Instead of treating user-defined functions as “black boxes”, we propose to analyze those functions to turn them into “gray boxes ” that expose opportunities to optimize data shuffling. We identify useful functional properties for userdefined functions, and propose SUDO, an optimization framework that reasons about data-partition properties, functional properties, and data shuffling. We have assessed this optimization opportunity on over 10, 000 dataparallel programs used in <b>production</b> <b>SCOPE</b> clusters, and designed a framework that is incorporated it into the production system. Experiments with real SCOPE programs on real production data have shown that this optimization can save up to 47 % in terms of disk and network I/O for shuffling, and up to 48 % in terms of cross-pod network traffic. ...|$|E

30|$|Based on a {{case study}} of Pfizer’s <b>production</b> <b>scope</b> {{evolution}} in China from 1993 to 2002, we propose that MNCs usually have to face dual pressures of keeping integration among global businesses on the one hand, and remaining responsive to local market conditions on the other. When there is large discrepancy between the two, due to the bounded rationality of the decision-makers, the development paths of the subsidiaries are likely to exhibit recursive pattern, instead of the sequential mode as suggested in the extant literature. On the other hand, we argue that companies can make strategic choices to facilitate the development of their overseas subsidiaries. By the adjustment of the strategic parameters pertaining to the content and processes of their development paths, companies can accumulate knowledge about the local market and strike a balance between the dual pressures they have to face. The implication of our study for the indigenous Chinese companies in their international expansion is that when facing unfamiliar business environment in overseas market, paying attention to the idiosyncratic local market condition and keeping strategic flexibility are pivotal to their success.|$|E

Because farmers using organic farming practices were the major users of some (not all) of the biological approaches, we ended up comparing organic and conventional farms. Experiments with treatments of biological versus conventional inputs (e. g. chemical fertilizers) within a given experiment were the other source of relevant data for comparative performance.

This study (1) identifies similarities and key differences between GHG accounting and life-cycle assessment (LCA), (2) compares them {{on a consistent basis}} through a case study on a waste management business unit. First, GHG accounting is performed. According to the GHG Protocol, annual emissions are categorized into three scopes: direct GHG emissions (scope 1), indirect emissions related to electricity, heat and steam <b>production</b> (<b>scope</b> 2) and other indirect emis-sions (scope 3). The LCA is then structured into a comparable framework: each LCA process is disaggregated into these three scopes, the annual operating activities are assessed, and the environmental impacts are determined using the IMPACT 2002 + method. By comparing these two approaches it is concluded that both LCA and GHG accounting provide similar climate change impact results as the same major GHG contributors are determined for scope 1 emissions. The emissions from scope 2 appear negligible whereas emissions from scope 3 cannot be neglected since they contribute to around 10 % of the climate change impact of the waste management business unit. This statement is strengthened by the fact that scope 3 generates 75 % of the resource use damage and 30 % of the ecosystem quality damage categories. The study also shows that LCA can help in setting up the framework for a annual GHG accounting by determining the major climate change contributors...|$|E

40|$|Importance {{of project}} Several months 2 ̆ 7 curing time {{is needed to}} give cheddar cheese the {{desirable}} flavor demanded by the market. The exact length of time required for curing depends upon the flavor intensity desired, but the curing process is always costly and time-consuming. The practice of making cheddar cheese from pasteurized milk is now common throughout the industry. Many progressive cheese factories are pasteurizing their milk and enjoying the consequent benefits from a higher quality product. Although pasteurization has eliminated many of the quality problems in cheesemaking, it has resulted in even slower curing cheese. Much of the cheese research now being carried on is concerned with finding means to shorten the normal curing period without adversely affecting {{the quality of the}} product would be invaluable to the cheddar cheese industry. DK cheese starter The curing of cheddar cheese is made possible by the symbiotic growth of microorganisms in the cheese curd, the action of enzymes present in the milk, and the enzymes in rennet which are added to the milk. Many workers (2) (33) (39) have expressed the thought that the rate of ripening of cheese may be influenced by specific microorganisms. Dahlberg and Kosikowsky (14) have isolated a particular strain of Streptococcus faecalis which, when used in cheese starter, is reported to hasten the development of good cheddar flavor in cheese that naturally tends to cure rather than slowly. DK cheese starter is a culture of this reputedly successful strain of S. faecalis. Purpose of investigation Dahlberg and Kosikowsky (14) reported that fine highly flavored cheddar cheese was produced, and that a two-month reduction in curing time was obtained when DK cheese starter was combined with commercial lactic acid starter in cheese making. Vanderbeek (50) experimented with cheese starter containing a strain of S. faecalis {{which may or may not}} have been the same strain employed in DK starter. He found that S. faecalis starter did not reduce the normal curing period, and that a bitter flavor developed in all the cheese in which S. faecalis has been used. The purpose of this investigation is to use DK cheese starter in combination with commercial lactic acid starter to make cheddar cheese. The ultimate object of this work is to gather evidence for the cheese industry showing the advantages or disadvantages of the use of DK cheese starter in quality cheddar cheese <b>production.</b> <b>Scope</b> of problem DK cheese starter was used to make cheddar cheese in the exact manner prescribed by its advocates. Control cheese was made with commercial cheese starter and used as a basis for comparison. Any pronounced differences in the manufacture of the cheese as a result of the starter were recorded.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{nature of}} firms' product or market expansion is original from {{the extension of}} their core competencies and resources, which create the synergies of a firm's capability development and business scope expansion. Thus in a firm's scope expansion process, technology plays an important role. As a result, when considering a firm's technology trajectory or operating business scopes, we should retrace to firms' initial technology and resource endowments in order to describe their technological capabilities development and business configuration comprehensively. This study illustrates the proposed hypotheses through 192 Taiwanese high-tech firms between 1998 and 2008. I propose that technological capabilities and business scopes fundamentally interplay in the determination of technological capabilities development which moderates by internal and external conditions, and identifies the interconnect effects on technological trajectory. A firm's technological capability development is influenced by its initial technology endowments in the beginning, then because by external environmental contexts - environmental munificence, environmental dynamics, industry attractiveness and industry competitiveness and internal complementary assets, this firm will therefore diversify their business scopes into different products or markets in different areas. However, firm in different business scopes will therefore further different new technological capabilities by their diversification, which in turn will affect the old technology, resulting in synergies or new technology capabilities. Therefore, I interpret the evolution of firms' technological capability development and business scopes as a coherence phenomenon and thus explain the feedback loop form of technology trajectory. The findings show there is a coherence effect between firms' technological capabilities and their business activities. A firm's technology endowments extend not only their own technological capabilities but also its business scopes simultaneously and so as business scopes do. The evidences also indicate that internal specialized complementary assets have positive moderating effects {{on the relationship of}} technological capabilities and business scopes. And the external context, environment munificence and industry attractiveness also have positive moderating effects on technological capabilities development. But the industry competition has a negative moderating effect on the relationship of technological capabilities and business scopes. 產品或市場的擴張其背後的本質乃是源自於企業內部的核心能力與資源的延伸、擴張，進而創造出能耐發展與經營範疇擴充的綜效。而在這樣的擴張過程中，技術的發展扮演重要的角色。因此，當我們在討論技術發展的軌跡或企業的經營範疇時，應回歸到最原始企業所擁有的技術本質，探討技術發展所帶動的企業資源佈局策略。 本研究藉由探討 1998 年至 2008 年的 129 家台灣高科技廠商的技術能耐與組織範疇，以及其所投入之非技術類資源的比重和所面臨的外在環境因素，來探討技術能耐的演進過程。藉此解釋技術資源與組織佈局決策的互動關係，了解技術能耐發展過程中的組織因素之影響。企業技術能耐的發展在一開始會受到企業本身所擁有的技術資源影響，發展出一個核心技術，繼而，又因受到外在環境因素－環境豐厚性、環境動態性、產業吸引力與產業競爭性的影響，以及企業內部互補性資產的調節，企業會因此進行產品或市場多角化等不同的事業範疇的選擇。然而，企業在透過在不同事業範疇的經營環境下，又會因此發展出新的技術能耐，該項新的技術能耐又進而影響企業舊有的技術資源，因而產生綜效或新的技術能耐。故本研究將企業技術資源與資源佈局策略的演進過程，解釋為一種協同凝聚的現象，進而解釋技術軌跡演進過程。 透過實證結果顯示，企業的技術能耐與其經營範疇存在著相互影響的協同凝聚現象。技術能耐除了會影響自身的延續發展外，也會影響企業經營範疇的決策，反之組織範疇亦同。此外，技術能耐透過組織內部的互補性資產之調節效果，對組織範疇決策產生顯著的影響；而組織範疇則透過環境豐厚性與產業吸引力對技術能耐發展有正向調節效果，而產業競爭性則有負向的調節影響效果。CONTENT ABSTRACT	ii CHAPTER 1 : INTRODUCTION	 1 CHAPTER 2 : THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT	 7 Chapter 2 - 1 : Evolutionary and Coherence Perspective	 11 Chapter 2 - 2 : Response to Internal Complementary Capabilities	 15 Chapter 2 - 3 : Response to External Environment Context	 19 CHAPTER 3 : METHODOLOGY	 23 Chapter 3 - 1 : Research design overview	 23 Chapter 3 - 2 : Data and Sample	 24 3. 2. 1 Data	 24 3. 2. 2 Data source	 25 CHAPTER 4 : STUDY ONE: IDENTIFYING THE COHERENCE EFFECTS BETWEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABITIES AND FIRM SCOPES	 27 Chapter 4 - 1 : Descriptive Statistics	 27 4. 1. 1 <b>Production</b> <b>Scope</b>	 27 4. 1. 2 Technological base	 29 4. 1. 3 The interconnection between technology base and business base	 31 Chapter 4 - 2 : Results	 33 CHAPTER 5 : STUDY TWO: ANALYZING THE MODERATING ROLES	 35 Chapter 5 - 1 : Measurements	 35 5. 1. 1 Technological Capabilities	 35 5. 1. 2 Business scopes	 35 5. 1. 3 Internal complementary capabilities	 36 5. 1. 4 External environmental context	 38 5. 1. 5 Control variables	 39 Chapter 5 - 2 Analytical Models	 39 Chapter 5 - 3 : Results	 40 5. 3. 1 Descriptive statistics and normality assumption	 40 5. 3. 2 The moderating role of internal complementary capabilities	 42 5. 3. 3 The moderating role of external environmental contexts	 45 CHAPTER 6 : DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS	 48 Chapter 6 - 1 : Discussion	 48 Chapter 6 - 2 : Conclusions	 50 Chapter 6 - 3 : Implications for Future Research	 51 REFERENCES	 53 FIGURE CONTENT FIGURE 1 : The Research Framework	 22 FIGURE 2 : Research Design Overview	 23 TABLE CONTENT TABLE 1 : Number of Firm Activities in a given year	 28 TABLE 2 : Entry into (and Exit from) New Business Activities, 1998 - 2008 	 28 TABLE 3 : Number of Firm Technologies in a given year	 30 TABLE 4 : Entry into (and exit from) new technological, 1998 - 2008 	 30 TABLE 5 : Descriptive Statistics for Interconnectedness Measures in 1998 and 2008 	 33 TABLE 6 : Descriptive Statistics for Coherence Measures in 1998 and 2008 	 34 TABLE 7 : Correlation Matrix and Descriptive Statistics	 41 TABLE 8 : Internal Complementary Assets Affect Business Scope	 42 TABLE 9 : External Environment Contexts Affect Technology Base	 4...|$|E

The presence of plant roots, organic matter and associated biological activity may {{play a significant role in}} the degradation or stabilisation of contaminants, and the presence of the plant cover may also contribute to the stabilisation of the site and increase its amenity value...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to assess}} the {{life-cycle}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of cassava ethanol production system focusing on utilization of biomass and biogas as energy sources in the steam <b>production</b> process. <b>Scope</b> of life cycle assessment is “cradle to gate” and the functional unit {{of this study is}} 1 liter of anhydrous ethanol produced. The use of biogas from wastewater treatment system for steam production greatly affects the GHG reduction. The GHG emissions of bioethanol plant that uses biogas from wastewater for steam production is 0. 548 kg-CO 2 -eq/L-ethanol, while the bioethanol plant without biogas utilization is 1. 031 kg-CO 2 -eq/L-ethanol. From the result, the utilization of biogas in steam production insignificantly reduce the GHG emission, if primary fuel in steam production is biomass. In contrast, using biomass such as wood chip and rice husk substitutes for fossil fuel as primary fuel in steam production greatly affects to GHG emission reduction (approximately 96 % reduction compared to literature) ...|$|R
