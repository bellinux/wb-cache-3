5|$|Croup can {{be caused}} by a number of viruses {{including}} parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as blood tests, X-rays, and cultures—are usually not needed.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{experiences}} {{at least one}} minor earthquake per day on average, and the Zagros region is particularly prone to seismic activity. During the last 100years, Iran has been hit by more than 130events stronger than magnitude5, with damaging earthquakes near Qeshm recorded in 1360, 1703, 1884, 1897, 1902, and 1905. The majority of Iranian quakes occur in the upper crust, close to the surface, {{which means that they}} are <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> destructive.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} control measures for invasive Caprellamutica populations as of 2012. It {{has been suggested}} that the seasonal population fluctuations may be taken advantage of. Eradication efforts done during the winter months when C.mutica populations are dormant and at their lowest numbers, are <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> effective in preventing their recovery during the summer months. Because of the great difficulty in detecting and removing them, however, control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than the eradication of established C. mutica.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E

5|$|The {{human use}} of fungi for food {{preparation}} or preservation and other purposes is extensive {{and has a}} long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering drugs. More recently, methods {{have been developed for}} genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> efficient than production by the original source organisms.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} quickly {{showed signs}} of organization {{with the development of}} banding features around its blossoming convection. Due to a favorable upper level environment, forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a 70mph (110km/h) tropical storm after making landfall on Haiti and eastern Cuba. Upper-level outflow remained well-defined, though convection waned near the center early on August 22. The depression appeared to continue organizing, with a well-defined cloud band to its north and east. However, strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly increased over the system, and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on August 22, south of the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The system retained a well-defined cloud pattern with a vigorous mid-level circulation, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center indicated regeneration could have occurred at any time. The wave axis moved over the Dominican Republic early on August 23, and became disorganized over the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola. There existed the potential for redevelopment as it moved into a <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> favorable area, though the National Hurricane Center ceased monitoring the system on August 25 when redevelopment appeared unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade (less the 4th Light Horse Regiment and two squadrons or five {{troops of}} 12th Light Horse Regiment) arrived at Beisan at 13:45 on 24 September. Here they {{received}} Order No. 31 from the Australian Mounted Division to attack Samakh. After leaving Beisan for Jisr el Mejamie, at 16:35 {{they received a}} message dropped from an aircraft, which reported that Samakh was defended by 50 rifles and machine guns. They arrived at Jisr el Mejamie at 21:00 and made contact with the regiment of the 4th Cavalry Division, holding the bridge. A further order to capture Samakh was received at 22:10, which included the additional objective of reconnoitring towards Tiberias, where they were {{to cooperate with the}} 3rd Light Horse Brigade in capturing the town. The orders gave the brigade commander, Brigadier General William Grant, the choice of attacking immediately, or waiting for the 4th Light Horse Regiment and the squadrons of the 12th Light Horse Regiment. He decided not to delay attacking the apparently weak rearguard, as he expected to be reinforced by the 15th Light Horse Regiment, 5th Light Horse Brigade, on the way to Samakh. If Grant had waited for reinforcements, the attack would have been during in daylight, {{in full view of the}} defenders in the railway station building, which may have resulted in at least as many casualties, and perhaps many more, during a <b>potentially</b> <b>more</b> protracted fight.|$|E
