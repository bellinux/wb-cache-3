50|$|A geared head {{drill press}} is {{a drill press}} in which power {{transmission}} from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head. No friction elements (e.g., belts) of any kind are used, which assures a <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements. Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.|$|E

Rubber mallets are also used for forcing tight-fitting parts together, for shifting plasterboard into place, in upholstery work, {{and a variety of other}} general purposes. It is a tool of preference for wood workers using chisels with plastic, metal, or wooden handles, as they give a softened strike with a <b>positive</b> <b>drive.</b> It is the most commonly used mallet.|$|E
50|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their road {{loss to the}} Ravens, the Raiders went home for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Atlanta Falcons. In the first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Falcons QB Matt Ryan {{completed}} a 37-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins, while RB Jerious Norwood got a 12-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Raiders' struggles continued as Ryan hooked up with Jenkins again on a 27-yard TD pass, while kicker Jason Elam nailed a 48-yard field goal. From then on out, Atlanta would prevent Oakland from getting any kind of <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> going and the Raiders fell to 2-6 with the shutout loss.|$|E

However, a <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> through the field yielded a second-place finish. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Beltoise again qualified 11th but retired after two laps, with an engine problem. At Belgium, he qualified seventh and finished fifth. At Monaco, Beltoise, who had qualified 11th and led the first practice times at one point, was in collision with Denny Hulme's McLaren on the first lap when the New Zealander got off-line and in attempting to rejoin, triggered a multiple accident. For this race, a second P201 chassis had been produced with outboard front disc brakes rather than inboard but was not used.|$|E
50|$|At {{the top of}} the Riley {{line for}} April 1959 was the new Riley 4/Sixty-Eight saloon. Again, it was merely a badge-engineered version of other BMC models. The {{steering}} was perhaps the worst feature of the car, being Austin-derived cam and peg rather than the rack and pinion of the One-Point-Five. Overall, it could not provide the sharp and <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> associated with previous Rileys, being based on the humble Austin Cambridge and Morris Oxford. Sharing many features with the similarly upmarket MG Magnette Mark III and Wolseley 15/60, it was the most luxurious of the versions, which were all comfortable and spacious, and (nominally) styled by Farina. The car was refreshed, along with its siblings, in 1961 and rebadged the 4/Seventy-Two.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{biodiversity}} of aboveground organisms {{have been widely}} investigated {{in a range of}} ecosystems, yet whether similar responses are also seen in belowground microbial communities, such as ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, are little understood. We investigated, in vitro, the effects of a gradient of 1 – 8 species of EM fungi interacting with substratum carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio on biomass production and CO 2 efflux. The model experimental systems enabled us to recover and measure biomass of individuals within communities and calculate net selection and complementarity effects. Both biomass and CO 2 efflux increased with species richness particularly under high N concentrations. Moreover, net biodiversity effects were largely <b>positive,</b> <b>driven</b> by both selection and complementarity effects. Our results reveal, in pure culture, the implications of EM species richness on community productivity and C cycling, particularly under high N conditions, and constitute the basis for future experiments under natural conditions...|$|R

At present, {{its most important}} activity {{is the development of}} the educational program, focused on schools on the island of Mallorca, university interns and families with children.Students of all ages have the opportunity to come and commence their knowledge of art through specialized visits. During the school year 2013/14 there were 3549 school visitors, while this year 2014/2015 we received 4470 students. The challenge, from the beginning, has been to provide different views on how to foment a first contact with art and encourage the curiosity of the youngest, in a playful yet didactic way. Educational visits to the Sa Bassa Blanca Museum are developed under the title [...] "Discovering the history of art and its hidden secrets." [...] This activity takes place in the different exhibition halls and endeavors to open a window on art in the hope that this first experience becomes a <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> for future interactions with art.Based on the historical context and the importance of symbolism in the exhibitions, this visit aims to transmit values of respect and admiration for the artistic legacy. It is intended that students learn to enjoy art, its mechanisms (approaching artistic techniques) and their different languages, as well as understand the notion of timelessness in human expression through art and history.|$|E
5000|$|In {{fact from}} 1904 Kraepelin changed the section heading to [...] "The born criminal", moving it from under [...] "Congenital feeble-mindedness" [...] {{to a new}} chapter on [...] "Psychopathic personalities". They were treated under a theory of degeneration. Four types were distinguished: born criminals (inborn delinquents), {{pathological}} liars, querulous persons, and Triebmenschen (persons driven by a basic compulsion, including vagabonds, spendthrifts, and dipsomaniacs). The concept of [...] "psychopathic inferiorities" [...] had been recently popularised in Germany by Julius Ludwig August Koch, who proposed congenital and acquired types. Kraepelin had no evidence or explanation suggesting a congenital cause, and his assumption therefore {{appears to have been}} simple [...] "biologism". Others, such as Gustav Aschaffenburg, argued for a varying combination of causes. Kraepelin's assumption of a moral defect rather than a <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> towards crime has also been questioned, as it implies that the moral sense is somehow inborn and unvarying, yet it was known to vary by time and place, and Kraepelin never considered that the moral sense might just be different. Kurt Schneider criticized Kraepelin's nosology for appearing to be a list of behaviors that he considered undesirable, rather than medical conditions, though Schneider's alternative version has also been criticised on the same basis. Nevertheless, many essentials of these diagnostic systems were introduced into the diagnostic systems, and remarkable similarities remain in the DSM-IV and ICD-10. The issues would today mainly be considered under the category of personality disorders, or in terms of Kraepelin's focus on psychopathy.|$|E

30|$|Vermes {{and colleagues}} studied {{regulatory}} mechanisms of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal system in critically ill patients and found elevated plasma levels of cortisol and ACTH in septic and trauma patients [20]. Whereas plasma concentrations of cortisol remained elevated for 8 days, plasma ACTH decreased between days 3 to 5. Plasma levels of endothelin- 1 and atrial natriuretic hormone were significantly elevated {{during the entire}} observation period. Accordingly, the authors speculated that the high endothelin- 1 level may exert a <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> on the adrenocortical level, whereas elevated high ANH level may inhibit the HPA axis during critical illness. Thus, critically ill patients can develop metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism, and hypokalemia.|$|E

40|$|Cough and the {{accompanying}} sensation known as the urge-to-cough are complex neurobiological phenomena dependent on sensory and motor neural processing at many levels of the neuraxis. In addition to the excitatory neural circuits that provide the <b>positive</b> <b>drive</b> for inducing cough and the urge-to-cough, recent studies have highlighted the existence of likely inhibitory central neural processes that can be engaged to suppress cough sensorimotor processing.

30|$|Self-determination theory It {{is assumed}} that {{learning}} takes place when positive emotions are involved.

40|$|Columnar cell apical {{membranes}} (CCAM) {{in series}} with goblet cell apical membranes (GCAM) form an electroosmotic barrier separating the midgut lumen from epithelial cell cytoplasm. A unique K+ ATPase in GCAM generates three gradients across this barrier. A greater than 180 mV electrical gradient (lumen <b>positive)</b> <b>drives</b> amino acid uptake through voltage-dependent K+ symports. A greater than 1000 -fold [H+] gradient (lumen alkaline) and a greater than 10 -fold [K+] gradient (lumen concentrated) are adaptations to the high tannin and high K+ content, respectively, in dietary plant material. Agents which act on the apical membrane and disrupt the PD, H+, or K+ gradients are potential insecticides. Insect sensory epithelia and mammalian stria vascularis maintain similar PD and K+ gradients but would not be exposed to ingested anti-apical membrane insecticides. Following the demonstration by Sacchi et al. that Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin (Bt) induces specifically a K+ conductance increase in CCAM vesicles, {{we find that the}} K+ channel blocking agent, Ba 2 +, completely reverses Bt inhibition of the K+-carried short circuit current in the isolated midgut of Manduca sexta. Progress in characterizing the apical membrane includes finding that fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine binds specifically to certain GCAM polypeptides and that CCAM vesicles can be mass produced by Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + precipitation from Manduca sexta midgut...|$|R
