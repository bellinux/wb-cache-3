5|$|CSG International {{originally}} sold {{two versions}} of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments. During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems. It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills</b> online.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{tension between the}} goal of {{increased}} cost recovery enshrined in the Water Services Act on the one hand, and the constitutional rights introduced in 1996 and the policy of free basic water introduced in 2001 on the other hand. There {{have been a number}} of controversies on policies in the sectors, including about private sector participation, which was introduced in the mid-1990s, the practice of cutting off water or installing flow restrictors for those who do not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills,</b> and the installation of pre-paid meters.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} also {{attracted}} some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, {{claim that the}} series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects in order to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills,</b> such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.|$|E
25|$|The billing cycle for unmetered {{customers}} is annual {{and most}} users, including many with water meters, {{are so far}} billed a flat rate only. Bills for metered customers whose meters are being read are sent out on a quarterly basis. The level of cost recovery is low. According to GWI's Turnaround Plan, the utility's average billing efficiency in the 2003-2006 period was only 68%, meaning that 32% of its customers did not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills.</b> In 2006 GWI collected revenues of only G$ 1.2billion, while {{operation and maintenance costs}} stood at G$ 3.5billion, including more than 60% paid for electricity, mainly for pumping. The difference was partly made up by a government subsidy of G$ 1.4billion, and partly resulted in unpaid bills to GWI's suppliers and deferred maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Approximately 60-70% {{of bills}} were paid in {{cash at bank}} branches.

During an open day for the new childcare centre, Toadie falls from an out-of-control bouncy castle and is left paralysed. Sonya struggles as Toadie refuses to accept how serious his injury is. She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her to pass out. After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home.

She and Toadie begin attending counselling.|$|E
500|$|Despite its spread, {{the early}} years of The Israelite were a {{financial}} struggle. [...] Most subscribers did not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills,</b> the Panic of 1857 adversely affected it, and the paper lost half its subscribers in the South during the Civil War.

2500|$|Interest charges {{vary widely}} from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are [...] "teaser" [...] rates {{in effect for}} initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can {{be as high as}} 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the {{interest}} or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak usury laws. The teaser rate no longer applies if the customer does not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills</b> on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2009 the {{security}} situation in Yemen began to deteriorate, resulting in heavy fighting {{in different parts of}} the country and a change of government in 2011. The fighting has forced many people to flee their homes, such as tens of thousands of people who fled from Abyan to Lahej and who received emergency drinking water supplies from the international community. Urban water supply throughout the country was affected by the interruption of power supply, lack of diesel fuel, insufficient backup generators, and a decline in revenues due to reluctance of consumers to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills.</b> In January 2012 the Minister of Water, Abdulsalam Razaz, said that the Ministry was owed over YR 33 billion (USD 153 million) [...] "by government bodies and people of power” and warned that it was [...] "on the verge of bankruptcy".

2500|$|In May 2009, Dodd was {{the author}} and lead sponsor of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009, which {{was signed into law}} by President Barack Obama on May 22, 2009. The law {{requires}} card companies give cardholders 45 days notice of any interest rate increases, prevents card companies from retroactively increasing interest rates on the existing balance of a cardholder in good standing for reasons unrelated to the cardholder's behavior with that card, and prohibits card companies from arbitrarily changing the terms of their contract with a cardholder, banning the so-called practice of [...] "any-time, any-reason repricing." [...] Also included in the bill were provisions requiring companies to give cardholders time to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills</b> by requiring card companies to mail billing statements 25 calendar days before the due date and individuals under the age of 21 to either show income or have a co-signer in order to obtain a credit card. In a conference call with reporters after the bill was signed, Dodd stated his intention to continue work on capping credit card interest rates at thirty percent and to establish limits on fees that merchants pay when a customer uses a credit card for a purchase.|$|E
2500|$|In {{each year}} since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, {{interest}} payments and other income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, for example {{by more than}} $150 billion in 2004. As the [...] "baby boomers" [...] {{move out of the}} work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills.</b> The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total [...] "Social Security" [...] expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars, which was 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit). All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue. As the trust funds are exhausted either benefits will have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, upward redistribution of income is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.|$|E
