5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced <b>plasma</b> <b>density</b> and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E

2500|$|Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} {{is often}} {{divided into four}} regions. The innermost region co-located with Saturn's planetary rings, inside approximately 3Rs, has a strictly dipolar magnetic field. It is largely devoid of plasma, which is absorbed by ring particles, although the radiation belts of Saturn are located in this innermost region just {{inside and outside the}} rings. The second region between 3 and 6Rs contains the cold plasma torus and is called the inner magnetosphere. It contains the densest plasma in the saturnian system. The plasma in the torus originates from the inner icy moons and particularly from Enceladus. The magnetic field in this region is also mostly dipolar. [...] The third region lies between 6 and 12–14Rs and is called the dynamic and extended plasma sheet. The magnetic field in this region is stretched and non-dipolar, whereas the plasma is confined to a thin equatorial plasma sheet. The fourth outermost region is located beyond 15Rs at high latitudes and continues up to magnetopause boundary. It is characterized by a low <b>plasma</b> <b>density</b> and a variable, non-dipolar magnetic field strongly influenced by the Solar wind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Spatially and {{temporally}} resolved {{measurements of}} runaway electrons {{have been performed}} in the TEXTOR tokamak. The main diagnostic for the investigations is a newly developed runaway probe which is mounted at a reciprocating mechanism. In addition, the runaway electrons are studied in the plasma by synchrotron emission. The scanning probes consists of fluorescing crystals covered by a graphite housing and is located at different radial positions. In this study, two generations of the probes are presented, a simple one for proving the principle and a more advanced one which allows the measurement of the energy distribution of the runaways. A strong decay of the runaway electrons at the plasma edge was observed. Runaway electrons have been measured at different <b>plasma</b> <b>densities</b> by synchrotron radiation and the probe. The reduction {{of the number of}} runaways have been measured with increasing <b>plasma</b> <b>densities</b> during low <b>density</b> <b>plasma</b> discharges by both diagnostics.
