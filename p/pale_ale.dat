5|$|Worthington's eldest son, {{also named}} William (1764–1825), assumed {{control of the}} company {{following}} his father's death. On the death of Worthington in 1825 he was succeeded by his son, also named William (1799–1871). A combination of factors conspired to make the Baltic trade infeasible; the Napoleonic Wars disrupted trade in the region and the Russian government increased import tariffs in 1822. Combined with a decrease on malt duty in 1823, this led to an oversupply of beer in Burton. As a result, the brewers instead looked towards the expatriate community in India as an increasingly important export market. Worthington produced their own India <b>Pale</b> <b>Ale</b> from 1829 onwards.|$|E

5|$|The {{railway network}} joined Burton in August 1839, {{which made it}} much more {{economical}} to distribute beer throughout the country. In 1842 William Worthington entered into partnership with Thomas Robinson, and the business traded as Worthington & Robinson. By 1861 Worthington employed 191 men and boys. Worthington dissolved the Robinson partnership in 1864, in order for his sons to acquire the business. The company became known as Worthington and Company, the co-partners being: William (1799-1871), {{with two of his}} sons, William Henry (1826-1894) and Calvert (1830-1871), who were joined two years later by his youngest son, Albert Octavius (1844-1918). After the introduction of agencies in British conurbations from the mid-1860s, the company began to rapidly expand. In 1866 the Prince of Wales awarded the company the Royal Warrant. Worthington pioneered brewing science from 1866 by employing a chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, who led the world in separation and cultivation of pure yeast strains. From 1872 the Worthington brewery was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company had previously resisted employing a laboratory, for fear that the public would perceive the scientific apparatus as a means of doctoring the beer. In order to differentiate themselves from other brewers, Worthington labelled their beers with alphabetical letters: their Burton Ales were called G, F and D, their light dinner ale was labelled M. Worthington E was an India <b>Pale</b> <b>Ale,</b> a competitor to Bass <b>Pale</b> <b>Ale.</b> By 1880, Worthington's IPA was challenging Bass's sales in the home market.|$|E
5|$|Kent is {{the centre}} of hop-growing in England, being centred on nearby Canterbury and Faversham has been the home of several breweries. The Shepherd Neame Brewery was officially founded in 1698, though brewing {{activities}} in Faversham pre-date this. The brewery {{claims to be the}} oldest in Britain and continues to be family-owned. The Rigden brewery was founded in the early 18th century by Edward Rigden. It subsequently merged with the Canterbury-based George Beer in 1922 to become George Beer & Rigden before being purchased by the Maidstone based Fremlin's. Whitbread bought out Fremlin's in 1967, and closed the Faversham brewery in 1990. The site is now a Tesco superstore. Shepherd Neame remains a significant regional brewer despite a decline in consumption of traditional bitter beer, producing around 230,000 barrels a year. It now also makes India <b>Pale</b> <b>Ale</b> under licence. Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Neame, recipient of the Victoria Cross, was born in Faversham and a memorial to him was placed in the town centre in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The company {{merged with}} Newcastle Breweries in 1960, forming Scottish & Newcastle, {{a group with}} market value of £50 million. William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the {{chairman}} and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the free trade, and promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan's Export {{became one of the}} three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle Brown Ale and Younger's Tartan Special. Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the highest gravity beer on general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India <b>Pale</b> <b>Ale</b> or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.|$|E

5|$|William McEwan {{opened the}} Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the {{outskirts}} of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by his mother and his uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan's India <b>Pale</b> <b>Ale,</b> the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.|$|E
