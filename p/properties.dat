5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with <b>properties</b> in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic <b>properties,</b> and can be classified according to which set of <b>properties</b> is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic <b>properties,</b> are classified as metalloids.|$|E

The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 <b>properties</b> in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the Turkish government, leaving only 580 of the 1,328 <b>properties</b> owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.).

40|$|Article {{is devoted}} to {{theoretical}} analysis of nature and mechanism of intellectual <b>property</b> insurance. Types of intellectual <b>property</b> relations {{and its role in}} public reproduction are investigated. Peculiarities of intellectual <b>property</b> relations are considered. Classification of intellectual <b>property</b> objects depending on their most essential features is analyzed. Different approaches to classification of intellectual <b>property</b> subjects are considered. Nature and preconditions of origin of intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are investigated. Goals and functions of intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are specified. Risks that related to disposal and commercialisation of intellectual <b>property</b> and connected with peculiarities of intellectual <b>property</b> objects and growing rate of intellectual <b>property</b> rights infringements are analyzed. Three groups of risks concerning disposal and commercialization of intellectual <b>property</b> objects are singled out: risks related to loss or abridgement of intellectual <b>property</b> rights; risks related to possible losses, contingencies and half-received profits connected with commercialization of intellectual <b>property</b> objects; risks of professional responsibility of participants of intellectual <b>property</b> market. On the basis of analysis of hands-on experience four types of intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are investigated: insurance of intellectual <b>property</b> rights; liability insurance of the intellectual <b>property</b> subjects; professional liability insurance of participants of intellectual <b>property</b> market; liability insurance of the contractors concerning intellectual <b>property</b> disposal.

5|$|There {{are several}} other {{different}} types of historic preservation associated with the <b>properties</b> of the National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of {{different types of}} <b>properties.</b> Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation <b>properties,</b> cemeteries, and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, <b>properties</b> associated with significant persons, <b>properties</b> achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural <b>properties,</b> and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|There are {{specific}} instances where <b>properties</b> {{usually do not}} merit listing in the National Register. As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, <b>properties</b> owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative <b>properties,</b> and <b>properties</b> that have achieved significance during {{the last fifty years}} are not qualified for listing on the Register. There are, however, exceptions to all the preceding; mitigating circumstances allow <b>properties</b> classified in one of those groups to be included.|$|E

50|$|Personal <b>property</b> is {{generally}} considered <b>property</b> that is movable, as opposed to real <b>property</b> or real estate.

50|$|Intangible <b>property,</b> {{also known}} as incorporeal <b>property,</b> {{describes}} something which a person or corporation can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/intellectual <b>property.</b> It generally refers to statutory creations such as copyright, trademarks, or patents. It excludes tangible <b>property</b> like real <b>property</b> (land, buildings, and fixtures) and personal <b>property</b> (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.). In some jurisdictions intangible <b>property</b> {{are referred to as}} choses in action. Intangible <b>property</b> is used in distinction to tangible <b>property.</b> It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible <b>property</b> (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible <b>property</b> (which is the source from which legal intangible <b>property</b> is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred). Competitive intangible <b>property</b> disobeys the intellectual <b>property</b> test of voluntary extinguishment and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual <b>property</b> (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.|$|R

Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the performance of commercial <b>property</b> in China over 1998 - 2007 for both direct and indirect <b>property.</b> Risk-adjusted performance analysis is used to assess the added value of China commercial <b>property</b> in a pan-Asia portfolio, with the portfolio diversification benefits of China commercial <b>property</b> also assessed. Sub-period analyses are also used to assess the dynamics of China commercial <b>property.</b> Findings - This paper finds that China commercial <b>property</b> has shown significantly enhanced performance and diversification benefits in recent years. In a pan-Asia <b>property</b> fund context, there are clear diversification benefits provided by China commercial <b>property,</b> with these benefits also being evident in the other Asian <b>property</b> markets. The findings highlight the benefits of a pan-Asia <b>property</b> investment strategy by international <b>property</b> investors, as well as the key benefits and added-value of including China commercial <b>property</b> in this pan-Asia <b>property</b> investment strategy. Originality/value - Previous empirical research into the China commercial <b>property</b> markets has been very limited. This paper rigorously assesses the role of China commercial <b>property</b> in a pan-Asia <b>property</b> portfolio context. Given the increasing interest by the leading international <b>property</b> investors regarding investing in China commercial <b>property,</b> this research enables more informed and practical investment decision-making regarding the role of both direct and indirect China commercial <b>property</b> as part of a pan-Asia institutional <b>property</b> investment strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
