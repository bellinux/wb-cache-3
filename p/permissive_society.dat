25|$|A heavy smoker all {{his adult}} life, Corbett {{had his first}} heart attack in September 1979. According to his daughter, he smoked sixty {{cigarettes}} a day until the heart attack, after which he cut down to twenty. He appeared in pantomime at the Churchill Theatre, Bromley, within two days of leaving hospital. He was then badly hurt in a car accident. He appeared shortly afterwards in the BBC detective series Shoestring, his facial injuries obvious. Other work included a Thames Television/ITV comedy series Grundy and the film Silver Dream Racer with David Essex, both in 1980. In Grundy, Corbett played an old man discovering the <b>permissive</b> <b>society</b> {{after a lifetime of}} clean living. The series was a flop and was soon cancelled.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{successful}} {{opening of the}} CRB in 1923, public discussion of contraception became more commonplace, and the term [...] "birth control" [...] became firmly established in the nation's vernacular. Of the hundreds of references to birth control in magazines and newspapers of the 1920s, more than two-thirds were favorable. The availability of contraception signaled {{the end of the}} stricter morality of the Victorian era, and ushered in the emergence of a more sexually <b>permissive</b> <b>society.</b> Other factors that contributed to the new sexual norms included increased mobility brought by the automobile, anonymous urban lifestyles, and post-war euphoria. Sociologists who surveyed women in Muncie, Indiana in 1925 found that all the upper class women approved of birth control, and more than 80 percent of the working class women approved.Lynd cited by Engelman, p. 143. The birth rate in America declined 20 percent between 1920 and 1930, primarily due to increased use of birth control.|$|E
5000|$|The way {{in which}} prostitutes {{advertise}} their presence varies widely. Some remain in apartments which have hints or clues outside such as posters with [...] "model" [...] written on them to lure potential customers inside. Others advertise by putting numbers or location in phoneboxes or in online or newspaper ads. In more sexually <b>permissive</b> <b>societies,</b> prostitutes can advertise in public view, such as through display windows. In sexually restrictive societies it may occur through word-of-mouth and other means.|$|R
5000|$|The sexual {{revolution}} {{can be seen}} as an outgrowth of a process. Though its roots may be traced back as far as the Enlightenment (Rousseau, Marquis de Sade) and the Victorian era (Algernon Charles Swinburne's scandalous Poems and Ballads of 1866), it was a development in the modern world which saw the significant loss of power by the values of a morality rooted in the Christian tradition and the rise of <b>permissive</b> <b>societies,</b> of attitudes that were accepting of greater sexual freedom and experimentation that spread {{all over the world and}} were captured in the concept of [...] "free love". Modern medicine may also have played a role, penicillin was able to largely eradicate syphilis and this brought greater freedom.|$|R

In Australia suppressors are tightly restricted in all States while in New Zealand they are {{available to the public}} without regulatory control. The results of NSW Government commissioned research list {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} de-criminalising what is undeniably a contentious product. The report lists the benefits; including hearing-loss prevention and reduced noise pollution. The disadvantages of suppressor use include the potential for criminal misuse and the public perception of criminality associated with the product. The 2011 report concluded no obvious correlation between suppressors and criminal activity in other <b>permissive</b> <b>societies</b> however there appears to be little change in Australia since the report was tabled in Parliament. While it is not the intention of the authors to advocate for change in either country the stark contrast in regulatory control given the similarity of cultures and provenance is noteworthy...|$|R
500|$|The first noted {{prosecution}} {{under the}} Obscene Publications Act was of Penguin Books in R v Penguin Books Ltd. [...] for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover. The book, which contained {{the use of}} the words [...] "fuck" [...] and [...] "cunt" [...] multiple times, along with sexual scenes, was banned completely in England and Wales until the conclusion of the trial; by the mid-1980s, it was on the school syllabus. Penguin Books relied on Section 4's [...] "public good" [...] defence, with academics and literary critics such as E. M. Forster and Helen Gardner testifying at the trial that the book was one of literary merit. The trial at the Old Bailey eventually ended with a not guilty verdict, allowing the book to be openly published and sold in England and Wales {{for the first time since}} it was published in 1928. This trial and its verdict is seen as heralding [...] "a new wave of sexual 'morality' for which the 1960s is now famous". Graham Lord wrote that the case [...] "was the first trumpet call of the <b>permissive</b> <b>society,</b> the moment many believe that British morality, manners and family life began seriously to deteriorate".|$|E

2500|$|Peggy Moffitt modeled {{the suit}} for Gernreich. She {{said it was}} a logical {{evolution}} of Gernreich's avant-garde ideas in swimwear design as much as a scandalous symbol of the <b>permissive</b> <b>society.</b> In the 1960s, the monokini led the way into the sexual revolution by emphasizing a woman's personal freedom of dress, even when her attire was provocative and exposed more skin than had been the norm during the more conservative 1950s. Like all swimsuits, the monokini bottom portion of the swimsuit can vary in cut. Some have g-string style backs, while others provide full coverage of the rear. The bottom of the monokini may be high cut, reaching to the waist, with high cut legs, or may be a much lower cut, exposing the belly button. The modern monokini, which is less racy than Gernreich's original design, takes its design from the bikini, and is also described as [...] "more of a cut-out one-piece swimsuit," [...] with designers using fabric, mesh, chain, or other materials to link the top and bottom sections together, though the appearance may not be functional, but rather only aesthetic. In recent years, the term has come into use for topless bathing by women: where the bikini has two parts, the monokini is the lower part. Where monokinis are in use, the word bikini may jokingly refer to a two-piece outfit consisting of a monokini and a sun hat. The original monokini is still sold by Victoria's Secret as a half-kini.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>permissive</b> <b>society</b> is {{a society}} in which social norms become {{increasingly}} liberal, especially with regard to sexual freedom. This usually accompanies a change in what is considered deviant.

2500|$|Many {{cultures}} {{define the}} transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, menarche (the first menstrual {{period of a}} female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. In the United States specifically, adolescents {{are said to have}} [...] "raging hormones" [...] that drive their sexual desires. These sexual desires are then dramatized regarding teen sex and seen as [...] "a site of danger and risk; that such danger and risk is a source of profound worry among adults". There is little to no normalization regarding teenagers having sex in the U.S., which causes conflict in how adolescents are taught about sex education. There is a constant debate about whether abstinence-only sex education or comprehensive sex education should be taught in schools and this stems back {{to whether or not the}} country it is being taught in is permissive or restrictive. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In <b>permissive</b> <b>societies,</b> overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is—in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth face much discrimination through bullying from those unlike them and may find telling others that they are gay to be a traumatic experience. The range of sexual attitudes that a culture embraces could thus be seen to affect the beliefs, lifestyles, and societal perceptions of its adolescents.|$|R
50|$|In early 1883 Forster {{realized}} that many boys in Melbourne {{had nothing to}} occupy their evenings and were falling into bad habits. In February 1883 he invited three boys off the streets {{to come to his}} own home in Canterbury Road, Toorak, Melbourne, to meet his sons. The evening was a success, other boys were invited, and soon a society was organized which met at St John's Sunday-school. In 1885 this room was no longer available and the classes were temporarily suspended, but classes were started in other suburbs and an amalgamation was made with a boys' society conducted by William Groom at North Fitzroy. Forster then gathered the newsboys of the city together in a room in Little Collins Street, and started the Herald Boys' Try Excelsior Class, afterwards known as the City Newsboys' <b>Society.</b> <b>Permissive</b> occupancy of a piece of land in Bowen St. was granted and the Gordon Institute for Boys was built and the Newsboys' Society was transferred to it.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} lipophobia and representations and experiences of obesity in Catalonia (Spain) from two points of view: that of the physicians and other health professionals who diagnose and treat obesity as an ill ness, and that of their patients, especially those between adolescence and early adulthood. The qualitative data demonstrate that the increasing social rejection of fat people can be traced not only to moralizing discourses on “excessive” food consumption or the commodification of slenderness and health, {{but also to the}} recent definition of obesity as a disease. The medicalization of fatness, far from helping to destigmatize obesity, is becoming a way of resignifying it in moral terms. While doctors’ and patients’ pers pectives diverge in some ways, they converge in others. In this text, I focus on the points of convergence arguing that biomedical understandings of obesity and overweight are characterized by a profound ambivalence. Young patients are regarded both as innocent victims of a <b>permissive</b> consumer <b>society,</b> and guilty of not following doctors’ orders. Although the family is held accountable for overweight or obesity in children, as young people become more independent, guilt is individualized and environmental causes are limited to inappropriate diet and insufficient exercise. Most narratives of young people with weight problems reflect similar ideas about the causes and the responsibility for obesity. Their acceptance of the basic premise that deviating from weight standards and rules for healthy eating are voluntary actions leads them to lose faith in themselves. The stigmatization of obesity thus becomes a vicious circle: the obese acceptance—even consider normal—the incriminations leveled at them, and blame themse lves for their situation and their inability to pre vent it. </p...|$|R
