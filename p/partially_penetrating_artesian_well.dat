40|$|The <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> tasked for {{abandonment}} {{was located}} on the LOX side (northwest area) of the launch complex. The exact date of well installation is unknown. The well {{was no longer in}} use {{at the time of the}} abandonment request, but was previously utilized under St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) consumptive use permit (No. 50054) for the Floridian Aquifer. The exact construction details of the LOX <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> were also unknown; however, a similar-type <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> was previously {{located on the}} LH 2 side of the site, which was abandoned in 2012. Based on discussions with the NASA RPM and review of the LH 2 <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> abandonment completion report, the LH 2 <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> was reported to be an 8 -inch diameter, 330 -foot deep well. The NASA RPM communicated that the LOX <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> was likely to be an 8 -inch diameter, 380 -foot deep well. This information was used for scoping, and was subsequently confirmed to be substantially accurate. No additional information could be found for the LOX <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> using the NASA Remediation Information System (RIS) ...|$|R

25|$|In {{downtown}} Olympia, {{efforts to}} preserve the use of artesian water at the one remaining public well has been the mission of H2Olympia: <b>Artesian</b> <b>Well</b> Advocates. In 2011, the city of Olympia committed $50,000 towards improvements of an <b>artesian</b> <b>well,</b> located {{in a parking lot}} that was recently purchased by the city. Renovations at the <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles. In Spring of 2012, sea-themed mosaic artwork created by community members was also installed {{at the site of the}} well.|$|R
2500|$|Olympia was {{historically}} {{dependent on}} artesian waters. Early settlers in Swantown and Tumwater used artesian springs for their main water supply. The artesian spring at Fourth Avenue and Main Street (now called Capitol Way) {{was the main}} community well where settlers gathered to socialize. The <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> at <b>Artesian</b> Commons park, a former parking lot, is active. Another still flows {{at the corner of}} Olympia Avenue and Washington Street. A [...] was constructed around another spring in the Bigelow Neighborhood. The northeast end of Capitol Lake was the location of an <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> until {{the construction of a new}} park that included changes to the shoreline. McAllister Springs, the main water source for Olympia, is fed by <b>artesian</b> <b>wells,</b> and the former Olympia Brewery is supplied by 26 <b>artesian</b> <b>wells.</b>|$|R

5000|$|From {{construction}} until 1971, {{the water}} tower operated as a private water company piping <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> water to commercial and residential customers in the immediate vicinity. The tower is built over the opening of an <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> and the water well and pumps are located under the tower itself. Another building was on the property which housed fluoridation and filtering equipment when the water company was in business piping <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> water directly to customers. <b>Artesian</b> <b>well</b> water is rich in minerals, better tasting than other natural untreated waters and its health benefits are incalculable. In 1971 {{the owner of the}} water company and tower was [...] "The Estate of J.F. Hendricks" [...] (several beneficiaries under his will including surviving relatives). They were forced by the City of Tampa in 1971 to cease water piping operations so that the City's water utility company could maintain a monopoly over the business of piping water to citizens.|$|R

5000|$|The city {{decided in}} 1882 {{to build an}} {{artesian}} ditch to control the [...] "Frog Pond" [...] effects; the plan was later upgraded and developed into an <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> in 1884 to combat the heavy rains and keep the basements from flooding. The <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> was designed by the city engineers to prevent flooding and develop a water system. However, during the digging of the well, the water stream that was found underground was too powerful to be contained. The water came blasting out with violent force and had the entire Main Street submerged in up to four feet of water. The engineers realized the previous flaws of the <b>artesian</b> <b>well</b> plan and soon added a gate valve to the well to control the flow of water, giving Aberdeen its first working water supply.|$|R
