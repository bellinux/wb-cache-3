40|$|A major {{safety concern}} with pidan (<b>preserved</b> <b>eggs)</b> {{has been the}} usage of lead (II) oxide (PbO) during its processing. This paper {{develops}} a rapid and nondestructive method for discrimination of lead (Pb) in <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> with different processing methods by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics. Ten batches of 331 unleaded eggs and six batches of 147 eggs processed with usage of PbO were collected and analyzed by NIR spectroscopy. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis {{was used as a}} reference method for Pb identification. The Pb contents of leaded eggs ranged from 1. 2 to 12. 8 [*]ppm. Linear partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and nonlinear least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) were used to classify samples based on NIR spectra. Different preprocessing methods were studied to improve the classification performance. With second-order derivative spectra, PLSDA and LS-SVM obtained accurate and reliable classification of leaded and unleaded <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs.</b> The sensitivity and specificity of PLSDA were 0. 975 and 1. 000, respectively. Because the strictest safety standard of Pb content in traditional pidan is 2 [*]ppm, the proposed method shows the feasibility for rapid and nondestructive discrimination of Pb in Chinese <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs...</b>|$|R

50|$|The soup is made {{of ground}} mixture of garlic, shallot, keluak, ginger, candlenut, turmeric, red chili and salt sauteed with oil until it gets aromatic. The sauteed mixture is then poured into boiled beef stock with diced beef. Lemongrass, galangal, bay leaves, kaffir lime leaves and sugar are then added as seasonings. The special dark or black color of rawon comes from the keluak as the main spice. The soup is usually garnished with green onion and fried shallot, and served with rice, hence the name rawon rice or Nasi Rawon in Indonesian language, {{together}} with baby bean sprouts, salted <b>preserved</b> <b>egg,</b> shrimp crackers and sambal chili sauce on the side.|$|E

40|$|Preserved {{eggs are}} a special Asian food. Traditionally, the gelling of {{preserved}} eggs is tested intuitively by feeling the slight vibrations that {{occur when the}} <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> is tapped with a finger. However, the effects of extended tapping and individual subjectivity lead to inaccurate results. This study thus attempts to devise a scientific method for inspecting the gelling of preserved eggs. Regression analysis of the peaks of the time response starting at 50 ms following the trigger yielded an exponential tendency line that indicates the decay rate of vibration theory. Distinct vibration analysis revealed that a decay below 80 represents complete gelling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis reveals an area under curve of 0. 963, a cut-off point at 0. 000 (x axis) and 0. 882 (y axis), and a decay rate of 84. 7995. The accuracy was 96. 7 %.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the chemical and structural changes in preserved white egg during pickled by vacuum technology. In order to evaluate the changes of <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> white during its salted period, sulfhydryl group, disulfide bond contents, and surface hydrophobicity were measured. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism analysis were performed by considering changes of the secondary structural elements, the protein components of egg white was also studied in more detail by electrophoresis. Results showed that the sulfhydryl group and surface hydrophobicity were increased with increasing salting time, whereas a decrease in the disulfide bond contents was observed. Regarding the secondary structure analysis, a decrease in a-helices and b-turns were accompanied by increases in b-sheets and random coils, which indicating a decrease in non-random structure while ever increasing of unordered structure. Electrophoresis shows no significant differences in protein patterns among fresh egg white and samples salting for up to 4 days. Disappearance of most protein was at the 5 th day. Single band of ovalbumin can be readily observed from the 6 th day to the ripening period finished.

40|$|Egg is a {{food that}} has been loved from ancient times by people all around the world. It {{has been called a}} present from god because its rounded shape was {{believed}} to refer to the earth. We found the oldest and most perfectly <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> fossil at Chunmachong (天馬) in Kyungju (慶州). We believe that it was used during the period of the Three States or the unified Silla (新羅), and, accordingly, it was a noble food {{that has been}} found at the king’s grave of the age. Egg, which is called egg of chicken in Korean, was written as egg of chicken (鷄卵), son of chicken (鷄子), bird’s egg of chicken (鷄蛋), and round thing of chicken (鷄丸) in the Korean alphabet and Chinese characters. The ancient countries had the following myths about eggs In myths about offspring by egg, they were born as heaven’s will to make them god. There were 19 proverbs: ‘Hitting a rock with an egg’, ‘It’s like the yellow part of an egg ’ and ‘Even an egg stops when it rolls’, etc. According to a theory of divination based on topography, people use eggs when they find a good place. There are 10 proverbs (四字 成語) : Dongjiipran (冬至立卵), Nanyeoseoktu (卵與石投) etc. Studies for analysis of egg recipes found in the old literature (cooking, agriculture and fishing, and medical books) in the Chosun Dynasty recorded 36 times where cuisine with egg was mentioned as the main ingredient, 154 times as a sub-ingredient, 79 times as a garnish, and 20 times etc. As a garnish, they were ‘finely sliced’, ‘thin rectangular and the rhombus form’, and ‘rounded shape’; after grilling they were divided into yello...|$|E
