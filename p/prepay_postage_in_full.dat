5000|$|The Postage Act {{was passed}} on 17 August 1839 {{in which the}} Penny Postage system was passed. It gave the Treasury until October 1840 to {{introduce}} the system. Public reaction to the interim rate of 4d was unfavourable and they felt cheated that the agreed reduction to the uniform rate of 1d had not taken place. This resulted in {{the abolition of the}} Fourpenny Post and the debut of the Uniform Penny Post on 10 January 1840 when 1d was charged for pre-paid one ounce letters. This was followed by the issuance of [...] labels to <b>prepay</b> <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> May 1840: the Penny Black and Two Penny Blue stamps.|$|R
25|$|Worldwide, {{the most}} common method of <b>prepaying</b> <b>postage</b> is by buying an {{adhesive}} postage stamp {{to be applied to}} the envelope before mailing; a much less common method is to use a postage-prepaid envelope. Franking is a method of creating postage-prepaid envelopes under licence using a special machine. They are used by companies with large mail programs, such as banks and direct mail companies.|$|R
50|$|The first postal {{stationery}} item issued {{by a government}} {{is thought to be}} the AQ lettersheet issued in 1608 and showing the coat of arms of Venice. In 1790 Luxembourg produced a 25-centime lettersheet. British newspaper publishers printed colourful stamps on paper supplied by the government between 1712 - 1870 and Australia produced lettersheets two years before the Mulready lettersheets were issued in 1840. During this period envelopes were rarely used. New South Wales issued prepaid lettersheets in 1838 with uninked embossed stamps (making them difficult to see) to <b>prepay</b> <b>postage</b> within the town of Sydney.|$|R
2500|$|A 2017 {{study in}} Electoral Studies found that Swiss cantons that reduced {{the costs of}} postal voting for voters by <b>prepaying</b> the <b>postage</b> on return {{envelopes}} (which otherwise cost 85 Swiss Franc cents) were [...] "associated with a statistically significant 1.8 percentage point increase in voter turnout".|$|R

[...] "And I'll <b>prepay</b> the <b>postage,</b> too. Now, be a good boy, Son, and run along, and maybe some time papa will buy you a lemon stick," [...] and at this remark {{there was a general}} laugh, in the midst of which Dan Soppinger threw up his hands, turned and left the room.|$|R
5000|$|In 1885 Congress {{enacted the}} use of “a special stamp of the face {{valuation}} of ten cents ... that when attached to a letter, {{in addition to the}} lawful postage thereon ... shall be regarded as entitling such letter to immediate delivery.” The first Special delivery stamp was printed by the American Bank Note Company and issued on October 1, 1885. It could not be used to <b>prepay</b> <b>postage</b> or any other service. The stamp bears the words [...] "Secures immediate delivery at a special delivery office,". In 1886 the Special Delivery service was expanded to all post offices and a new stamp was designed. The revised stamp was identical to the first issue of 1885 but instead bore the statement [...] "Secures immediate delivery at any post office." [...] The release of the revised stamp was delayed by the Post Office until 1888, however, allowing supplies of the first issue to be sold beforehand. But the usage of such stamps had their drawbacks. Special Delivery only served communities whose population was over 4,000 people and could not guarantee delivery by a specific time. To be valid the Special Delivery stamp had to be affixed to the envelope along with all other postage and could not be used to prepay regular and airmail postage.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the postal reply coupon was to allow someone in one country {{to send it to}} a {{correspondent}} in another country, who could use it to pay the postage of a reply. IRCs were priced at the cost of <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> the country of purchase, but could be exchanged for stamps {{to cover the cost of}} <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> the country where redeemed; if these values were different, there was a potential profit. Inflation after World War I had greatly decreased the cost of <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> Italy expressed in U.S. dollars, so that an IRC could be bought cheaply in Italy and exchanged for U.S. stamps of higher value, which could then be sold. Ponzi claimed that the net profit on these transactions, after expenses and exchange rates, was in excess of 400%. This was a form of arbitrage, or profiting by buying an asset at a lower price in one market and immediately selling it in a market where the price is higher, which is completely legal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{issue was}} {{declared}} invalid for <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> May 1861, as the Confederate States had supplies of them. Therefore, stamps used after that date usually have the marking [...] "OLD STAMPS/NOT RECOGNIZED" [...] on the cover.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a five-step procedure for meta-analysis. Especially {{important was the}} contacting of authors of prior papers.

Application of the five-step procedure to the issue of return <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> mail surveys yielded significantly more papers and produced more definitive conclusions than those derived from traditional reviews. This meta-analysis indicated that business reply postage is seldom cost effective because first class postage yields an additional 9 % return. Business reply rates were lower than for other first class <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> each of the 20 comparisons...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{the costs and}} benefits of using first-class postage compared to non-profit, pre-canceled <b>postage</b> <b>in</b> inducing response to a self-administered mail questionnaire. An experiment was conducted with the outgoing postage for the 1998 Nebraska Rural Poll. Twenty-five percent of the outgoing questionnaires were mailed with first-class postage, with the remaining seventy-five percent having non-profit, pre-canceled postage affixed. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in response rates between the two groups, there were no differences in demographic characteristics between the two postage groups, and the use of non-profit, pre-canceled <b>postage</b> resulted <b>in</b> substantial cost savings...|$|R
