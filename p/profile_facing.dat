5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in <b>profile</b> <b>facing</b> to the left. The figure is standing with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E
5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in <b>profile,</b> <b>facing</b> left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

Two sets of images are acquired: the frontal images and the slight angle <b>profile</b> <b>face</b> images.

In the second step, we propose a method for face recognition based on fuzzy clustering and parallel neural networks. In particular, the face pattern is divided into several small-scale parallel neural networks based on fuzzy clustering. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Face</b> <b>profile</b> is an {{important}} aspect of face recognition and it provides a complementary structure of the face that is seen in the non-frontal view. In the past, several methods have been proposed to recognize <b>face</b> <b>profiles</b> in still images. However, <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images that are captured at a distance by surveillance cameras usually are video sequences that have a low resolution. It is difficult to extract accurate <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> directly from a low-resolution video frame, which does not have many pixels on the <b>face</b> <b>profile.</b> The emphasis {{of this paper is to}} introduce a practical approach for human recognition by using high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images constructed from the low-resolution videos. We use both the spatial and temporal information present in a number of adjacent low-resolution frames of a video sequence to construct high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images. As the quality of high-resolution images relies on the correctness of image alignment between consecutive frames, an elastic registration algorithm is used for <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> image alignment. A match statistic is designed to detect and discard poorly aligned images which may degrade the quality of the high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> image. After obtaining high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images, we use a dynamic time warping method for <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> recognition. A number of dynamic video sequences are tested to demonstrate the applicability and reliability of our method. ...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{sandwich}} {{panels are}} commonly made of flat or lightly <b>profiled</b> steel <b>faces</b> and expanded polystyrene foam cores, and are increasingly used as roof and wall claddings in industrial and commercial buildings.

The use of lightly <b>profiled</b> <b>faces</b> is expected to increase the flexural wrinkling stress considerably whereas the presence of joints between the polystyrene foam slabs in the transverse direction introduces a reduction to the flexural wrinkling stress. Therefore a series of full scale experiments and finite element analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of lightly <b>profiled</b> <b>faces</b> and transverse joints on the flexural wrinkling stress of panels subjected to a lateral pressure loading. The results showed that properly designed lightly profiled panels provided considerable improvement to flexural wrinkling strength over flat panels whereas the presence of transverse joints caused a significant reduction to wrinkling strength.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} real time system for person detection, {{recognition}} and tracking using frontal and <b>profile</b> <b>faces.</b> The system integrates face detection, face recognition and tracking techniques.

The pose is determined from the face detection algorithm which uses a combination of <b>profile</b> and frontal <b>face</b> cascades and, depending on the pose, the face is compared with {{a particular set of}} faces having the same range for classification. The detected faces are recognized by projecting them onto the Eigenspace obtained from the training phase using modular weighted PCA and then, are tracked using the Kalman filter multiple face tracker. In this proposed system, the pose range is divided into three bins onto which the faces are sorted and each bin is trained separately to have its own Eigenspace. This system has the advantage of recognizing and tracking an individual with minimum false positives due to pose variations...|$|R

This paper presents a <b>profile</b> <b>face</b> detection algorithm based on curvelet features, as curvelet transform offers good directional representation and can capture edge information in human face from different angles. First, a simple skin color segmentation {{scheme based on}} HSV (Hue - Saturation - Value) and YCgCr (luminance - green chrominance - red chrominance) color models is used to extract skin blocks. The segmentation scheme utilizes only the S and CgCr components, and is therefore luminance independent.

In the performance test, {{the results showed that}} the proposed algorithm can detect <b>profile</b> <b>faces</b> in color images with good detection rate and low misdetection rate...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a method for identification of <b>profile</b> <b>faces</b> using frontal faces as references. It {{is based on a}} KCCA and consists of learning the transformation between frontal and <b>profile</b> <b>faces.</b> Since most of the existing databases of faces contain only frontal faces, and {{it is often difficult to}} have simultaneously the frontal and the <b>profile</b> <b>face</b> of any individual, this transformation may have a central role in practice. In fact, if a face is detected in a scene, it will be represented in the frontal space, thanks to the transformation learned by CCA, and then, compared to the frontal faces. Due to the nonlinearity of the transformation between the frontal and the profile pose, we were constrained to not represent the global face but to restrict to its main components (eyes, nose, mouth, chin) and to use kernel functions. The validation of our method has been achieved according to a leave one out-like protocol (LOOLP), based on a gallery of 600 individuals. This way of validation guaranties a more accurate estimate of the generalization error of the approach. For the transformation between 0 ° and 90 °, a score of 100 % on a 200 -face gallery that overpasses those published in the literature, is obtained. This score decreases to 76.5 % for a gallery of 600 faces. In a future work, we will generalize the method to other orientations (other than 90 °) in order to get a totally pose-invariant face identification system.|$|R
