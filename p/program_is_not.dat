25|$|If a spyware <b>program</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> blocked {{and manages}} to get itself installed, it may resist {{attempts}} to terminate or uninstall it. Some programs work in pairs: when an anti-spyware scanner (or the user) terminates one running process, {{the other one}} respawns the killed program. Likewise, some spyware will detect attempts to remove registry keys and immediately add them again. Usually, booting the infected computer in safe mode allows an anti-spyware program {{a better chance of}} removing persistent spyware. Killing the process tree may also work.|$|E

500|$|Jennings Bryant {{conducted}} a two-year {{longitudinal study of}} the effects of Blue's Clues at the University of Alabama in 2001 to ascertain whether or not the show's curriculum goals were achieved. He compared regular viewers and non-viewers and found that the show's episode repetition strategy improved children's comprehension while holding their attention and increasing their participation, which suggested that watching Blue's Clues increased children's learning and social interactions. At the end of the study, regular viewers outperformed the non-viewers, solving problems more successfully and systematically.
