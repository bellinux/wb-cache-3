40|$|Risk to astronauts due to {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{is a primary}} concern for missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and will drive mission architecture requirements, mission timelines, and operational practices. For short missions, radiation risk {{is dominated by the}} possibility of a large Solar Particle Event (SPE). Longer duration missions have both SPE and Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) risks. SPE exposure can contribute significantly toward cancer induction in combination with GCR. As mission duration increases, mitigation strategies must address the combined risks from SPE and GCR exposure. In this paper, full mission exposure assessments were performed for the proposed long duration lunar surface mission scenarios. In order to accomplish these assessments, previously developed radiation shielding models for a proposed lunar habitat and rover were utilized. End-to-End mission exposure assessments were performed by first calculating exposure rates for locations in the habitat, rover, and during Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVA).

40|$|Risk to astronauts due to {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{is a primary}} concern for missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and will drive mission architecture requirements, mission timelines, and operational practices. Both galactic cosmic ray (GCR) and solar particle event (SPE) environments pose a risk to astronauts for missions beyond LEO. The GCR environment, which {{is made up of}} protons and heavier ions covering a broad energy spectrum, is ever present but varies in intensity with the solar cycle, while SPEs are sporadic events, consisting primarily of protons moving outward through the solar system from the sun. The GCR environment is more penetrating and is more difficult to shield than SPE environments, but lacks the intensity to induce acute effects. Large SPEs are rare, but they could result in a lethal dose, if adequate shielding is not provided. For short missions, radiation risk is dominated by the possibility of a large SPE. Longer missions also require planning for large SPEs; adequate shielding must be provided and operational constraints must allow astronauts to move quickly to shielded locations. The dominant risk for longer missions, however, is GCR exposure, which accumulates over time and can lead to late effects such as cancer. SPE exposure, even low level SPE exposure received in heavily shielded locations, will increase this risk. In addition to GCR and SPE environments, the lunar neutron albedo resulting mainly from the interaction of GCRs with regolith will also contribute to astronaut risk. Full mission exposure assessments were performed for proposed long duration lunar surface mission scenarios. In order to accomplish these assessments, radiation shielding models were developed for a proposed lunar habitat and rover. End-to-End mission exposure assessments were performed by first calculating exposure rates for locations in the habitat, rover, and during extra-vehicular activities (EVA). Subsequently, total mission exposures were evaluated for <b>proposed</b> <b>timelines.</b> A number of computational tools and mathematical models, which have been incorporated into NASA's On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation In Space (OLTARIS), were used for this study.

Through {{multiple}} editions, spin offs and numerous film adaptions, {{it remains a}} much loved, much read novel which {{is seen as a}} timeless classic. Pride and Prejudice may also be considered timeless, because it is without a time. Even Mr Darcy “cannot fix the hour” (Austen 2003, 359;ch. 18). Jane Austen did not tell her readers in what year she set her most popular story, yet she plots the passing of time in Pride and Prejudice very carefully and theorists have argued Austen used specific almanacs to do this. In the novel, she repeatedly refers to hours, days, weeks, months and parts of the date, but at no point does Jane Austen tell readers the actual year in which Pride and Prejudice is set. To fill this perceived gap, renowned Austen scholar, R. W. Chapman, proposed Austen places Pride and Prejudice in two specific years and provided a detailed timeline to support his theory. This raises the question of why Austen didn’t just tell readers herself. Does the actual year of the novel matter? Or does Austen create her own time?
