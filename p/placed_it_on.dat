The state legislature <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the state highway system in 1933 {{as an extension}} of the existing Nevada City-Downieville Route 25. In the 1964 renumbering, the highway received a signed designation, State Route 174.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S. Patton, who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should {{be turned over to the}} government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, £1 {{million of}} damage was caused {{to the pier}} by {{drifting}} equipment during engineering work in Sand Bay, {{to the north of}} the pier. The damage was quickly repaired, despite fears that Birnbeck might become like nearby Clevedon Pier, which at the time was severed by a collapsed span. The pier was again badly damaged by storms in 1990 and was closed for safety reasons in 1994. Daily trips during the summer months to and from Cardiff, Clevedon, and Penarth were suspended indefinitely. Due to the decline, English Heritage has <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the Heritage at Risk register. In 1999, the lifeboat station installed a walkway across the pier to allow them safe access to the island, at a cost of £20,000.|$|E

In 2017, NPR ranked Amor Prohibido at number 19 on their list of the 150 greatest albums made by women.|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting and <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated {{in the form of}} a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's {{coronation}} {{took place}} on 2 December 1804. Two separate crowns were brought for the ceremony: a golden laurel wreath recalling the Roman Empire and a replica of Charlemagne's crown. Napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings. For the official coronation, he raised the Charlemagne crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture, but never <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> top because he was already wearing the golden wreath. Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head, the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David. Napoleon was also crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805. He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from amongst his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello and <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, {{which led to a}} fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
