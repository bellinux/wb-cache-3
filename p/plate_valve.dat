40|$|In {{order to}} expand the {{operational}} capabilities of hydraulically actuated systems {{the development of new}} valves to allow of enhanced flow rates and bandwidth performance is required. Previously, the technical challenge in developing such valves was the need for large spool strokes to achieve the desired flow rates. However, this would then hinder the dynamic response of the valve. To increase flow without reducing dynamic performance it is proposed that the use of multiple metering edges is appropriate. This is achievable using the Horbiger <b>plate</b> <b>valve</b> principle and direct connection to a piezoelectric actuator. This paper examines the design criteria associated with such a valve. Simulations undertaken as part of its construction and design show that improved flow rates can be achieved. Results from these simulations are then included in orifice equations to further predict flow as a function of plate separation. Finally a simulation was undertaken to determine the total forces acting on the valve, and the forces on the piezoactuator were found to be compressive under normal conditions, which should lead to predictable and stable operation...|$|E

METHODS The port was developed based on knowledge obtained from long-term experience with implantable hearing devices, which are firmly anchored to the bone behind the ear. This concept of bone anchoring was adapted to the requirements for a vascular access during hemodialysis. The investigational device is comprised of a base plate that is firmly fixed with bone screws to the bone behind the ear (temporal bone). A catheter leads from the base <b>plate</b> <b>valve</b> block through the internal jugular vein and into the right atrium. The valves are opened using a special disposable adapter, without any need to puncture the blood vessels. Between hemodialysis sessions the port is protected with a disposable cover.

This study measured the effectiveness of basic shop cleaning. Initially, three items representing parts of an oxygen system were contaminated: a metal <b>plate,</b> <b>valve</b> body, and metal oxygen bottle. The contaminants chosen were those most likely to be introduced to the system during normal use: oil, lubricant, metal shavings/powder, sand, fingerprints, tape, lip balm, and hand lotion.

Test subjects were classified into three groups: technical professionals having an appreciation for oxygen hazards; professional precision cleaners; and a group with no previous professional knowledge of oxygen or precision cleaning. Three test subjects were in each group, and each was provided with standard cleaning equipment, a cleaning procedure, and one of each of the three test items to clean. The results indicated that the achievable cleanliness level was independent of the technical knowledge or proficiency of the personnel cleaning the items.

40|$|The U. S. {{natural gas}} {{pipeline}} industry {{is facing the}} twin challenges of increased flexibility and capacity expansion. To meet these challenges, the industry requires improved choices in gas compression to address new construction and enhancement of the currently installed infrastructure. The current fleet of installed reciprocating compression is primarily slow-speed integral machines. Most new reciprocating compression is and will be large, high-speed separable units. The major challenges with the fleet of slow-speed integral machines are: limited flexibility and a large range in performance. In an attempt to increase flexibility, many operators are choosing to single-act cylinders, which are causing reduced reliability and integrity. While the best performing units in the fleet exhibit thermal efficiencies between 90 % and 92 %, the low performers are running down to 50 % with the mean at about 80 %. The major cause for this large disparity is due to installation losses in the pulsation control system. In the better performers, the losses are about evenly split between installation losses and valve losses. The major challenges for high-speed machines are: cylinder nozzle pulsations, mechanical vibrations due to cylinder stretch, short valve life, and low thermal performance. To shift nozzle pulsation to higher orders, nozzles are shortened, and to dampen the amplitudes, orifices are added. The shortened nozzles result in mechanical coupling with the cylinder, thereby, causing increased vibration due to the cylinder stretch mode. Valve life is even shorter than for slow speeds and {{can be on the}} order of a few months. The thermal efficiency is 10 % to 15 % lower than slow-speed equipment with the best performance in the 75 % to 80 % range. The goal of this advanced reciprocating compression program is to develop the technology for both high speed and low speed compression that will expand unit flexibility, increase thermal efficiency, and increase reliability and integrity. Retrofit technologies that address the challenges of slow-speed integral compression are: (1) optimum turndown using a combination of speed and clearance with single-acting operation as a last resort; (2) if single-acting is required, implement infinite length nozzles to address nozzle pulsation and tunable side branch absorbers for 1 x lateral pulsations; and (3) advanced valves, either the semi-active <b>plate</b> <b>valve</b> or the passive rotary valve, to extend valve life to three years with half the pressure drop. This next generation of slow-speed compression should attain 95 % efficiency, a three-year valve life, and expanded turndown. New equipment technologies that address the challenges of large-horsepower, high-speed compression are: (1) optimum turndown with unit speed; (2) tapered nozzles to effectively reduce nozzle pulsation with half the pressure drop and minimization of mechanical cylinder stretch induced vibrations; (3) tunable side branch absorber or higher-order filter bottle to address lateral piping pulsations over the entire extended speed range with minimal pressure drop; and (4) semi-active plate valves or passive rotary valves to extend valve life with half the pressure drop. This next generation of large-horsepower, high-speed compression should attain 90 % efficiency, a two-year valve life, 50 % turndown, and less than 0. 75 IPS vibration. This program has generated proof-of-concept technologies with the potential to meet these ambitious goals. Full development of these identified technologies is underway.

The <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing damping holes show excellent performance in avoiding air-release and cavitation. This study aims to reduce the noise emitted from an axial piston pump using a novel <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing damping holes. A dynamic pump model is developed, in which the fluid properties are carefully modeled to capture the phenomena of air release and cavitation. The causes of different noise sources are investigated using the model. A comprehensive parametric analysis is conducted to enhance {{the understanding of the}} effects of the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> parameters on the noise sources. A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization method is proposed to optimize the parameters of <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> The amplitudes of the swash plate moment and flow rates in the inlet and outlet ports are defined as the objective functions. The pressure overshoot and undershoot in the piston chamber are limited by properly constraining the highest and lowest pressure values. A comparison of the various noise sources between the original and optimized designs over a wide range of pressure levels shows that the noise sources are reduced at high pressures. The results of the sound pressure level measurements show that the optimized <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> reduces the noise level by 1.6  dB(A) at the rated working condition.
