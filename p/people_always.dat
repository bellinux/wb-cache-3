5|$|The Judge {{was always}} {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, with his sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and <b>people</b> <b>always</b> crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E

25|$|<b>People</b> <b>always</b> {{search for}} some escape from illness {{and it has}} been found that art {{is one of the more}} common methods. Art and the {{creative}} process can aid many illnesses (cancer, heart disease, influenza, etc.). People can escape the emotional effects of illness through art making and many creative methods.|$|E

25|$|Authors like Fernando García de Cortázar, The <b>people</b> <b>always</b> demand those guilty, and Franco and his accomplices focused all {{of their}} evils and misfortunes in a specific, visible, shootable enemy: the mason, the red, the liberal politician, the communist... who had bloodstained the fields of the Peninsula and pillaged the {{treasure}} of Spain and had taken refuge from their crimes abroad.|$|E
25|$|Many {{researchers}} use self-report {{measures of}} felt emotion as a manipulation check. This raises {{an interesting question}} and a possible methodological weakness: are <b>people</b> <b>always</b> accurate when they recall how they felt in the past? Several findings suggest {{this is not the}} case. For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot, supporters were asked to describe their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November.|$|E
25|$|The {{new record}} is coming along great! The new jams are high energy, and are gonna be a blast to play live. We're working on really using all three vocals, which {{we used to}} do a bit more in the early days and works great, and <b>people</b> <b>always</b> seem to want more of, so that will be fun. But mostly I expect a great Dillinger Four record: fun, fast-paced, great change-ups and a couple songs on this one where it's a bit {{different}} than stuff we've done before.|$|E

25|$|The Times {{was founded}} by {{publisher}} John Walter on 1 January 1785 as The Daily Universal Register, with Walter {{in the role of}} editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt because of the complaints of a Jamaican hurricane. Being unemployed, Walter decided to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later, it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because <b>people</b> <b>always</b> omitted the word Universal, Ellias changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to The Times. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name. Walter Sr had spent sixteen months in Newgate Prison for libel printed in The Times, but his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy makers and financiers.|$|E

Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match. Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: [...] "I would, but... I know where that hand's been." [...] The following night on Raw, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: [...] "...in the end, <b>people</b> <b>always</b> get what they deserve." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014 Smith {{offered her}} {{opinion on the}} sexualization of women in music. [...] "Pop music has always been about the {{mainstream}} and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge."

500|$|Midway through Stevens' first season, {{with the}} Bulldogs at 12–1, The New York Times wrote [...] "so far, Stevens {{has made the}} {{transition}} [...] look easy." [...] The Times went on to state that Stevens had the calm and composure of a seasoned veteran. [...] "You’ve {{got a lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>always</b> looking for the next step. And that’s not what I was doing. I was just trying {{to figure out a way}} to win the next game and think like a head coach." [...] Stevens said.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written under [...] "extreme pressure" [...] during the show's brief Christmas hiatus. Many critics have noted {{similarities}} between [...] "Monday" [...] and the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day. Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, {{the writers of}} the episode, however, credit an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled [...] "Shadow Play" [...] (1961). Gilligan later noted: [...] "The funny thing about 'Monday' is people seemed to really like it a lot, but <b>people</b> <b>always</b> sorta [...] smiled and said you're sort of ripping off Groundhog Day aren't you? [...] And I'd say, we're not ripping off Groundhog Day, we're ripping off The Twilight Zone." ...|$|E
500|$|A main {{theme of}} the episode is Kate's {{inability}} to commit to other <b>people,</b> <b>always</b> running from difficult emotional situations, and having barriers {{between her and her}} interests – physical, as in Sawyer's cage or Jack's aquarium, or metaphorical, as in her inability to settle down as Kevin's wife. Kate's marriage, which was first alluded in the season one episode [...] "Outlaws", is meant to be a contrast with her relationship with Sawyer in the realtime events – Kate and Kevin is a heartfelt and passionate relationship where Kate tries to get involved but her lifestyle ends up on making the marriage fail, whereas with Sawyer both are afraid of intimacy and connection yet still end up together.|$|E

500|$|An on- and {{off-road}} {{version of}} the Super Cub, what today would be classed as a dual-sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time, the CA100T Trail 50, came out in 1961. Jack McCormack, the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company, said the Trail 50, {{and even more so}} the later Honda CB77, was the result of Honda's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand. [...] "When you talk about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace. <b>People</b> <b>always</b> suggest that it was about Japanese management, but, to be frank, I was never impressed with Japanese management. They did what no other motorcycle make did—they listened." ...|$|E
500|$|Baird and Jackie {{were taken}} {{to live with the}} Birches and their son at The Dairy Cottage, which was owned by Mimi's husband, George Smith. At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself, where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House, {{although}} Baird and her friends called it [...] "frothy coffee". At 16, Baird started to hitch-hike to London, although her aunt never knew, as she would never have allowed it. Baird talked about the trips to London, and how relatively safe they were: [...] "Hitching was easy then. It was a way of life. Everything was becoming more free. We'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties. <b>People</b> <b>always</b> gave us a place to stay – we were never harmed." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinter quoted Father John Metcalf {{speaking}} to Raymond Seitz, then Minister at the US Embassy in London, [...] "My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a cultural centre. We {{have lived in}} peace. A few months ago a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." [...] Seitz responded, [...] "Let me tell you something. In war, innocent <b>people</b> <b>always</b> suffer." [...] Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq [...] "an arbitrary military action inspired {{by a series of}} lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.|$|E
