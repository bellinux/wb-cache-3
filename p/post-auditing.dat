40|$|Environmental impact {{assessment}} (EIA) is a procedure for predicting {{environmental impacts of}} projects prior to their development, while <b>post-auditing</b> seeks to assess the accuracy of such predictions. A literature review examines the need for <b>post-auditing,</b> highlighting several benefits to EIA performance that could arise if the results were effectively used. This reveals that, in practice, <b>post-auditing</b> activities are not widespread, and suggests reasons why this is so. An overview of post-audit findings from a survey of published studies is then presented, and it is concluded {{that there is much}} scope for raising the profile of <b>post-auditing</b> in EIA world-wide. Preliminary results from a recent UK <b>post-auditing</b> study based on eight projects are described. Information on impact predictions was gathered and compared with actual impacts. A total of 366 impact predictions were made of which 78 % were qualitative in nature; 57 % of the predictions were auditable and of these nearly three-quarters were accurate. Reasons for inauditability were ascertained including, for all cases, a lack of data or unsuitable information. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTACT Environmental impact {{assessment}} (EIA) {{is an integral}} part of the protection of the environment. Although it is a tool which considers the impact on many different elements of the environment, the process also has many deficiencies. Because of its limitations, an audit has been forming since the beginning of EIA. An EIA audit evaluates the performance of an EIA by comparing actual impacts detected after the realization of the project to those that were predicted, those that were listed in the environmental impact statement. This paper will offer an insight into the EIA and the <b>post-auditing</b> process and contains three basic parts of these areas. The first part explores the EIA, its historical evolution and application in the Czech Republic. The second part will discuss the post-audit itself. In this part, the different <b>post-auditing</b> processes, which were carried out in different parts of the world, were chosen. Within the selected <b>post-auditing,</b> the predicted data from the environmental impact statements are statistically compared with resultant data from reality. It is therefore necessary to analyze the percentage given for how many predictions were wrong in a positive way, accurate or wrong in negative way. From different results of <b>post-auditing,</b> we can tell that only a small percentage of the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the relationships among}} audit fees and discretionary accruals for non-profit public housing authorities (PHAs).

We find results consistent with prior literature indicating there is economic bonding between auditor and client; auditors constrain the magnitude of discretionary accruals less when they are paid more. We also find results consistent with prior literature indicating auditors provide more services and/or higher quality services with larger magnitude discretionary accruals and higher income-increasing discretionary accruals. These results are true whether you use <b>post-audit</b> or pre-audit data. However, we find in some instances, specifically when testing economic bonding with income-increasing and income-decreasing accruals separately, that the use of <b>post-audit</b> discretionary accruals as the dependent variable (used in prior literature) provides different results than when the more appropriate change in discretionary accruals from pre- to <b>post-audit</b> is used...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a <b>post-auditing</b> study-a comparison of the predictions of environmental impacts of projects made in environmental statements prior to developmentwith those that actually occurred upon or after development. The purpose of <b>post-auditing</b> is to provide an analysis of prediction performance in environmental impact assessment and thus to improve future practice by learning from experience. By means {{of a combination of}} site visits, interviews and document scrutiny, 865 predictions from 28 UK projects granted planning permission were examined. Of these, 488 (56 %) were auditable, of which 383 (79 %) were deemed 'accurate' or 'nearly accurate' and 105 (21 %) 'inaccurate'. The remaining 377 (44 %) predictions were not auditable, the main reasons being lack of data, vague or ambiguous predictions and time dependency. There were only six unpredicted impacts. The study reveals some encouraging findings, but also a number of discouraging ones, which indicate the need to increase both enthusiasm for, and implementationof, <b>post-auditing</b> activities. Several suggestions are made to help achieve these objectives. ...|$|E

40|$|Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is {{a formal}} process, which {{provides}} valuable {{information concerning the}} potentia 1 environmental consequences or impacts of proposed development plans and actions. ErA, therefore. {{plays an important role}} in aiding the decision-making process and has been adopted worldwide as a predictive evaluation tool. Once the ElA has been conducted and the possible environmental impacts established, thorough recommendations for mitigation are usually made. However, there is often no ElA follow-up (monitoring, <b>post-auditing,</b> evaluation and communication) to ensure that the mitigation measures or the recommendations revealed by the ErA are put into practice. EIA follow-up is a vital procedure, which if effectively conducted, ensures that negative environmental impacts are kept to a minimum and facilitates sustainable development.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a <b>post-auditing</b> study which compares the actual and predicted socio-economic impacts (including traffic) of a major power station construction project in the UK. An attempt is made to determine the accuracy of the predictions presented at the public inquiry into the development, drawing on the results of a developer-funded monitoring exercise undertaken {{for the duration of the}} eight-year construction programme. The study found that a very high proportion of testable predictions prepared prior to the inquiry could be audited; of these, 60 % were either within predicted ranges or accurate to within 20 % of predicted values. However, one in seven predictions had errors of more than 50 %. The study revealed no consistent bias towards either under- or over-estimation of impacts. The paper explores the reasons for the predictive errors identified in the study; these include a range of project-specific and more generic factors, several of which are likely to be applicable to other large-scale construction projects. The study is particularly useful in the field of EIA because it relates to several weak areas in current practice: the assessment of socio-economic impacts, construction effects, and monitoring and auditing. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} analyse the {{determinants}} of tax evasion, the existing literature on individual tax compliance typically takes a prior-to-audit point of view. This paper focuses on a <b>post-audit,</b> post-detection -so far unexplored- framework, by investigating what happens after tax evasion has been discovered and noncompliant taxpayers are asked to pay their debts. We fi rst develop a two-period dynamic model of individual choice, considering an individual that has been already audited and detected as tax evader, who knows that Tax Authorities are looking for her to cash the due amount. We derive the optimal decision of running away {{in order to avoid}} paying the bill, and show that the experience of a prior tax notice reduces the probability to behave as a scofflaw. We then exploit information on <b>post-audit,</b> post-detection tax compliance provided by an Italian collection agency for the period 2004 - 2007 to empirically test the effectiveness of the prior notice against scofflaws.

40|$|Purpose Making {{rational}} and undistorted corporate investment decisions {{is critically important}} to organizations. ‘Scientific’ investment appraisal can play a central role, particularly setting the hurdle rate. Empirical research reveals that actual rates generally exceed organizations’ cost of capital − the so-called Hurdle Rate Premium Puzzle. Allowing for bounded rationality of corporate decision-makers, this paper mobilizes the retrievability cognitive bias as one explanation of this paradox. Design/methodology/approach A systematic structuring and investigation of the legacy of eight scenarios, representing ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ decisions on 'good' and 'bad' proposals, is used to explain the inconsistency between normative capital investment theory and actual practice. Findings Decision makers' cognitive processes based on informal perceptions, strengthened by the scope of formal <b>post-audit</b> routines, provide a plausible explanation why investment decision makers tend to systematically set hurdle rates too high. Research limitations The findings {{have yet to be}} explored in more depth by fieldwork and experimental research. Practical implications The policy implications of this study are that corporate success could be enhanced by making executives aware of the hurdle rate premium phenomenon and of its behavioural causes; also by including significant rejected investment proposals in the <b>post-audit</b> programme and communicating the opportunity cost of ‘false negative’ decisions on proposals not adopted.
