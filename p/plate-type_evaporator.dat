40|$|A <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporator,</b> {{working with}} natural {{refrigerant}} circulation, {{has been investigated}} both experimentally and theoretically. Motivated by the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, HCFC 22 was compared to HFC 134 a and two zeotropic refrigerant mixtures. The effect of different separator liquid levels, i. e. refrigerant flows, and its influence on heat transfer was also studied. The investigated <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporator</b> consists of thirteen vertical flow channels and its size is 3. 0 m x 0. 5 m. The heat source for the evaporator is a falling water film {{on the outside of}} the plate. Experimental studies have been carried out using a test facility that enabled detailed measurements of heat transfer and pressure drop. Experiments were compared to results from a calculation method that simultaneously calculates heat transfer and pressure drop in a variable number of steps along the evaporator. The calculation method is based on a pressure drop correlation proposed by the VDI-Warmeatlas and a heat transfer correlation for vertical tubes proposed by Steiner and Taborek. For different evaporator duties, heat transfer was over predicted by 12 % for pure fluids by 15 % for mixtures. Calculated pressure drops were well within +/- 5 % of the measured values. Changes in heat transfer due to different flows were closely predicted by the proposed calculation method...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} ice formation and the possible occurrence of hysteresis phenomenon in a <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporator,</b> used in for example district heating heat pumps. Detailed heat transfer and pressure drop measurements are carried out for both pure fluids and zeotropic mixtures. Experimental results, together with some simulation results, are used to discuss the ice formation phenomenon. One result is that the refrigerant temperature at start of ice formation differs between refrigerants, especially between pure fluids and mixtures. The evaporator duty is observed to depend on start-up conditions. An explanation based on a boiling hysteresis phenomenon is suggested...|$|E
50|$|Limited product versatility:-Another major {{limitation}} of rising film evaporators is {{the requirement for}} the products to be of low viscosity and have minimal fouling tendencies. Competitive process designs like <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporators</b> can handle liquids that are more viscous with higher fouling tendencies because the inner parts are more easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the rising film evaporator is the low residence time of the liquid feed in the evaporator compared to other <b>evaporator</b> designs like <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporators.</b> This is crucial because it allows the usage of the evaporator in higher operating temperatures and gives assurance of high product quality despite the product being heat sensitive. Additional advantage is {{the availability of the}} option to operate the evaporator as a continuous process which is overall more energy and time efficient than a batch process operation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCompact {{evaporator}} like plate {{heat exchangers}} can {{play a significant role}} in reducing the investment cost of low cooling power sorption systems. However, when water is used as refrigerant, the working pressure is very low and vaporization phenomena are really different than vaporization phenomena occurring at higher pressures. Few studies focus on this subject and there is a lack of knowledge about vaporization (boiling or evaporation) phenomena occurring in compact evaporators at low pressure. The design of such evaporators remain manly empirical. There is thus a need of better characterization of the influence of the driving parameters in order to optimize the evaporator design. The objective of this article is thus to go further in the understanding of phenomena occurring in compact <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporators.</b> In that goal, an experimental campaign was conducted to study continuously the performance of a smooth plate type evaporator as a function of the filling levels. The influence of the saturation pressure and the secondary fluid temperature on an overall heat transfer coefficient is studied. It is show that there is a dependence of the maximal overall heat transfer coefficient to these parameters. It is also shown that there seems to be a strong dependence between phenomena observed and phenomena that happens before. Thus, dynamic and inertia effects must be taken into account and model developed in absorption configuration cannot be applied for this study...|$|R

Loop heat pipes with high reliability {{have been used as}} cooling devices in the space and deep sea as they work on the principle of capillary pumping without any mechanical driving parts. In this study in order to improve the heat transport performance of a loop heat pipe, the nonwoven fabric wick was developed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{implementation}} of {{compact heat exchanger}} in sorption systems is a key factor to allow {{the development of these}} systems. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a statistical model with a design of experiment (DOE) methodology and use dimensionless number to evaluate and understand the influence of the height of refrigerant liquid and secondary fluid inlet temperature on cooling capacity of a compact pate-type evaporator for sorption systems working near vacuum pressure. For this purpose, an experimental campaign was conducted on a small adsorption test bench using 13 X/water as working couple. Cooling capacities from 640 to 2000  W were measured. The DOE is a Doelhert type with two parameters: the inlet secondary fluid temperature (from 10 to 21 °C) and the filing level of refrigerant in the evaporator (from 6 to 24  cm). Thanks to the exploitation of the mathematical model obtained, optimal points under different constraints were found. A maximum cooling capacity of 2021 +/− 75  W in the entire experimental field was predicted for a secondary fluid inlet temperature of 25 °C and a height of liquid level of 19. 2  cm. Bond number and modified Jacob number per the ratio Psat/Ptriple were analyzed. The dimensionless numbers are correlated to the cooling capacity as a first step for designing compact <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporator</b> for adsorption systems using water as refrigerant...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperimental setup {{working as}} a pump-assisted {{closed-loop}} thermosyphon was built. Water vaporization inside a channel of a plate-type heat exchanger at subatmospheric pressure was observed. Three main flow regimes were identified. Influence of these regimes on heat transfer were discussed. Overall heat transfer coefficients were estimated. a b s t r a c t In {{order to be able}} to design properly low-pressure evaporators for sorption chillers, expertise on vaporiza-tion of the refrigerant under conditions that might occur in these evaporators is fundamental. However, few studies focus on this subject and there is a lack of knowledge about vaporization (boiling or evaporation) phenomena occurring in compact evaporators at low pressure. The objective of this article is thus to go further in the understanding of phenomena occurring in compact <b>plate-type</b> <b>evaporators.</b> In that goal, an experimental test setup was designed and built. It allows the observation of the water vaporization in a channel mimicking that of a plate heat exchanger of standard dimension (0. 2 m width 0. 5 m height) under various operating conditions (working pressure ranging from 0. 85 kPa to 16 kPa, secondary fluid temperature ranging from 10. 9 °C to 23. 1 °C, filling ratio ranging from 1 / 2 to 1 / 10 of the whole channel height). During these experiments, three main flow regimes were observed and three different working areas were identified: a pool boiling area, a vapor area, and a film evaporation area. In the latter, the creation of a liquid film due to the splashing of droplets is observed. These droplets result from the break-up of the membrane of a previously formed large bubble. The bubble formed is of several centimeters in diameter and appears in the pool boiling area, few centimeters below the free surface. It was shown that the major part of the cooling capacity is achieved in the film evaporation area. As a matter of fact, it is possible to predict the overall cooling capacity obtained experimentally with a maximum relative difference of 30 % directly from the evaluation of the overall heat transfer coefficients in that area...|$|R
40|$|In arid {{regions of}} the United States potable water is a {{valuable}} resource and is sometimes produced using energy intensive processes by removing salts from brackish water. Task 4 provides a solar option for producing potable water from brackish water; in competing in Task 4, H 2 OGS has developed a simple, cost effective solar desalination process to provide these regions with necessary, potable water. H 2 OGSâ€™ design takes into account WERC requirements, including cost, energy usage, worker safety, and easily obtained materials. U. S. government regulatory requirements are also taken into account as the proposed location for this process is Alamogordo, New Mexico. H 2 OGSâ€™ design consists of a thin <b>plate-type</b> solar <b>evaporator</b> and also a thin plate-type condenser. Black-painted corrugated galvanized steel panels were used to construct the evaporator and condenser. The black-painted evaporator panels are protected from atmospheric convection by a six mil polyethylene film, commonly used for greenhouses. Radiant energy from the sun passes through the polyethylene film and is absorbed by the black-painted panel. Brine is sprayed onto {{the back side of}} the panel via a nozzle located at the top of the unit. As the brine runs down the evaporating face, it is evaporated. The warmed, evaporated brine gravity drains to an insulated holding tank from which it moves to the next evaporating stage to be further concentrated. The evaporated water is condensed on additional corrugated steel plates located opposite the evaporating face. Because this plate is shielded from direct sunlight, the evaporated water is condensed by convection to the atmosphere and drained into a holding trough at the bottom of the unit where it is pumped to a potable water storage tank. The brine effluent that remains after leaving the final still unit is transported to a solar pond where salts crystalize and are removed by manual raking from the evaporation basin. This basin is designed to be 3 â€™ deep by 45 â€™ wide by 180 â€™ long and will evaporate the remaining 20 % of the bring effluent and allow for crystallization and recovery of the salts.

40|$|An ORC can {{be split}} into two levels. The first level {{contains}} the cycle parameters (temperatures and pressures) and the second level contains the components (heat exchangers, turbine, etc.). Often, both levels are optimized seperately and the interconnection between these two levels is chosen, based on experience. Pinch point temperature differences, pressure drops, etc. are assumed. This design process will in general not lead to the optimum system configuration. In a system optimization, the two levels of the ORC are optimized together and no assumptions {{have to be made}} about the interconnecting parameters. In this presentation, a simple version of a system optimization is explained. For a given heating and cooling source and for a fixed pump and turbine efficiency, the configuration of the heat exchangers is optimized together with the cycle parameters. Plate heat exchangers with chevron-type corrugations and shell-and-tube heat exchangers are modeled and can be used in the cycle. Single- and double-pressure cycles are investigated and both cycles can be a standard or a recuperated one. The developed model is based on a previous developed code and this code is extended with heat exchanger models which are taken from the literature. The Bell-Delaware model is used for the shell-and-tube heat exchangers. For single-phase plate heat exchanger the method of Martin is used while the models of Han, Lee and Kim are used for <b>plate-type</b> condensers and <b>evaporators.</b> The results show that plate-type heat exchangers are, as expected, more efficient than shell-and-tube heat exchangers. It is also shown that adding a second pressure level is useful, but the effect is less than in the case with ideal components. This is because adding an extra pressure level improves the fit between the heat source cooling curve and the working fluid heating curve, but this will also increase the heat transfer surface. So, the pinch point temperature difference has to increase to keep the heat transfer surface constant. A similar effect is seen in the recuperator. The average temperature difference in the desuperheater is often relatively high, so replacing it partly with a recuperator, in which the average temperature difference is mostly lower, will also increase the heat transfer surface. This model will be further extended with a turbine model, a model for air cooled condensers and a model for mechanical draft water cooling towers. Economics will also be taken into account. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOcean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is {{a process}} able to produce base {{electricity}} through the temperature differences existing between warm seawater at the surface and cold depth seawater. Up to now, very few experiments have been conducted and oil prices fluctuations have often prevented results exploitation. Recently, two factors have re-launched researches: a need {{for the production of}} a renewable energy ensuring the stability of the electric grid and the increase in oil prices. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the sustainability of an offshore 10 MW power plant. Some issues first need to be examined: heat exchanges, control strategies, cycle risks, working fluids, and thermodynamic cycles. This paper presents an experimental prototype as a first steppingstone of an “Eliminating Risks Program” and as a preliminary installation to the setting up of the first full scale OTEC power plant. The prototype is a reproduction on a reduced scale of a demonstration plant producing an electric power of 10 MW. To reduce costs and hazards of offshore installations (waves, cyclones, maintenance, etc.), decision has been made to build anonshore plant (settled on the Réunion island), creating artificial heat sources with a heat pump. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the principle of OTEC will be explained. Then, the prototype detailed: cycle, main components (the electricity production is directly related to the quality of the heat exchanges, so some different heat exchanger technologies are developed), working fluids, heat sources, and control strategies. Finally, results of an experimental parametric analysis will be presented, highlighting the major importance of heat exchanges, within the evaporator.

40|$|Computational and {{experimental}} investigations of fluid flow and heat transfer aspects of loop heat pipes (LHPs) {{are presented in}} this thesis. The overall goal is to formulate and develop cost-effective mathematical models and numerical solution methods for computer simulations of LHPs. This work has five distinct parts. First, a basic network thermofluid model of conventional LHPs operating under steady-state conditions is proposed, implemented, tested, and applied. It illustrates the main steps {{in the formulation of}} such models. The capabilities of this basic model are assessed by applying it to an LHP for which experimental results are available in the literature. The results show that this model is capable of at least qualitatively accurate predictions and could serve as a tool in preliminary designs of LHPs. Second, experimental apparatus and procedures are designed and implemented for measurements of the following properties of sintered powder-metal porous plates that are used as wicks in LHPs: Porosity; maximum effective pore size; effective permeability; and effective thermal conductivity when saturated with a liquid (distilled water in this work). The aforementioned experimental apparatus and procedures are applied to two sintered powder-metal porous plates, one made of nickel 200 and the other of stainless steel 316, and the results are presented and discussed. Third, an LHP with a flat (<b>plate-type)</b> <b>evaporator</b> and a fixed active mass of the working fluid (distilled water) is designed and constructed, and an experimental investigation of its steady-state operation is conducted. Full details of this LHP and the experimental setup and procedures are presented. The experimental results augment the available repertoire of experimental data on LHPs. They are used to test the predictions of the proposed network thermofluid model. Fourth, an enhanced version of the aforementioned basic network thermofluid model is proposed and adapted for computer simulations of the above-mentioned LHP operating under steady-state conditions. Fifth, results of experimental and computational investigations of the abovementioned LHP, operating with a stainless steel 316 wick and distilled water as the working fluid, are presented, compared, and discussed. The proposed network thermofluid model provides predictions that are within +/- 10 % of the experimental results...|$|E

The individuals involved in construction will be trained on the proper safety precautions before construction begins. Warning labels concerning the temperature of the unit will be printed on the solar brine concentrator. Regular and preventative maintenance will be performed by a trained individual(s) to keep the unit running safely and efficiently. 	The public involvement plan is crucial to the success of the solar brine concentrator in Alamogordo, New Mexico; this technology would be competing with the cityâ€™s current technology. Meetings will be held to inform the community of the benefits and disadvantages of both technologies. These meetings will help educate the community and address any community concerns. A training session will be held concerning operation, maintenance, and safety precautions of the facility. 	The H 2 OGS full scale unit will produce 25 L/day/person (1 / 2 of the UN minimum per day) for a community of 500 people or 12, 500 L/day (3, 300 gpd, 1. 2 million gpy). The installed cost of the unit is $ 100, 000. With capital cost amortized over 10 years the yearly capital charge is $ 10, 000. With community volunteer labor the operating costs are $ 10, 000 /yr. With 15, 600 L/day of brine feed the produced salts will be 198 lb/day (66, 000 lb/yr). At a salt netback price of $ 0. 33 /lb, the benefits of salt sales are $ 21, 780 /yr. The salt sales will thus cover both capital charges and operating costs, assuming volunteer labor. This optimistic scenario will produce water at zero cost to the community. The current Alamogordo water cost for large volume users is $ 7. 91 /k gal 23. With operating labor included at $ 50, 000 /yr the cost of water will increase to $ 40. 01 /k gal. 	The following report provides a detailed proposal of the solar brine concentrator, including design concepts, experimental results, health safety and environmental concerns, and a public involvement plan. While the design is recommended for Alamogordo, NM, H 2 OGS has designed the unit to be implemented anywhere there is a real need for potable water near a usable brine source...|$|R
