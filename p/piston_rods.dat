25|$|The tandem {{compound}} {{first appeared on}} the Erie Railroad in 1867. Like the Vauclain compound, a {{tandem compound}} has each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders driving a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank; but unlike the Vauclain compound, the cylinders are mounted fore and aft of each other. The rear wall of the forward cylinder is usually the forward wall of the rear cylinder. The piston rod of the rear cylinder {{is connected to the}} crosshead in the usual way, but the forward cylinder may have its piston rod, or rods, in either of two forms: either the piston rod of the rear cylinder is extended forwards to also carry the forward piston; or if the forward cylinder be the low-pressure cylinder (and thus larger in diameter than the high-pressure cylinder behind), it may have two long <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> which pass above and below, or to either side, of the high-pressure cylinder in order to reach the common crosshead.|$|E
30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> causes {{the front end of}} the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b> Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R

25|$|An {{oscillating}} {{engine was}} {{a type of}} direct-acting engine {{that was designed to}} achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term oscillating. Steam was supplied and exhausted through the trunnions. The oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in the trunnions to direct the steam feed and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the timing to be varied to enable expansive working. (As, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen.) This compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|E

500|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|E

2500|$|The Siamese engine, also {{referred}} to as the [...] "double cylinder" [...] or [...] "twin cylinder" [...] engine, was another early alternative to the beam or side-lever engine. This type of engine had two identical, vertical engine cylinders arranged side-by-side, whose <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> were attached to a common, T-shaped crosshead. The vertical arm of the crosshead extended down between the two cylinders and was attached at the bottom to both the crankshaft connecting rod and to a guide block that slid between the vertical sides of the cylinders, enabling the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved.|$|E
2500|$|The back-acting engine, {{also known}} as the return {{connecting}} rod engine, was another engine designed to have a very low profile. The back-acting engine was in effect a modified steeple engine, laid horizontally across the keel of a ship rather than standing vertically above it. Instead of the triangular crosshead assembly found in a typical steeple engine however, the back-acting engine generally utilized a set of two or more elongated, parallel <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> terminating in a crosshead to perform the same function. The term [...] "back-acting" [...] or [...] "return connecting rod" [...] derives {{from the fact that the}} connecting rod [...] "returns" [...] or comes back from the side of the engine opposite the engine cylinder to rotate a centrally located crankshaft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crosshead}} engine {{is described as}} having a vertical cylinder above the crankshaft, with the piston rod secured to a horizontal crosshead, from each end of which, {{on opposite sides of}} the cylinder, extended a connecting rod which rotated its own separate crankshaft. The crosshead operated within vertical guides that enabled the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved. The engine's alternative name [...] "A-frame" [...] presumably derived from the shape of the frames supporting these guides. Some {{crosshead engine}}s had more than one cylinder, in which case the <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> were usually all connected to the same crosshead. An unusual feature of early examples of this type of engine was the installation of flywheelsgeared to the crankshaftswhich were thought necessary to ensure smooth operation.

2500|$|The mill {{was built}} in 1786 by Matthew Boulton, {{with the backing of}} City financiers and Joah Bates, an organ player and {{composer}} who [...] "embarked all his own money and 10,000/ belonging to his wife" [...] to build it. It was the first steam-powered commercial flour mill in the United Kingdom. James Watt, an associate of Boulton, was personally hired to build a steam engine for the mill to grind corn. Watt's engine was tested before numerous spectators, including Sir Joseph Banks, but encountered problems with the sun and planet gear, and the <b>piston</b> <b>rods.</b> Repairs were completed in April 1786. The cost of erecting the mill proved to be considerably in excess of the original estimate, and Watt soon feared that it {{would turn out to be}} a losing concern. He had no doubt that the engines or the machinery would be able to do all that had been promised; but he feared that the absence of business capacity on the part of the managers would be fatal to the mill's commercial success. In September 1786, the Duke of Milan visited the mills.|$|E
2500|$|Water (feedwater) must be {{delivered}} to the boiler to replace that which is exhausted as steam after delivering a working stroke to the pistons. As the boiler is under pressure during operation, feedwater must be forced into the boiler at a pressure that {{is greater than the}} steam pressure, necessitating the use of some sort of pump. Early engines used pumps driven by the motion of the pistons (axle pumps), which were simple to operate and reliable, but only operated when the locomotive was moving, and could overload the valve gear and <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> at high speeds. Steam injectors later replaced the pump, while some engines transitioned to turbopumps. Standard practice evolved to use two independent systems for feeding water to the boiler; either two steam injectors or, on more conservative designs, axle pumps when running at service speed and a steam injector for filling the boiler when stationary or at low speeds. By the 20th century virtually all new-built locomotives used only steam injectors – often one injector was supplied with [...] "live" [...] steam straight from the boiler itself and the other used exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders, which was more efficient (since it made use of otherwise wasted steam) but could only be used when the locomotive was in motion and the regulator was open.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the side}} rods (UK: {{coupling}} rods) of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, <b>piston</b> <b>rods,</b> main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both cylinders are at top or bottom dead center simultaneously. A four-cylinder locomotive can be completely balanced in the longitudinal and vertical axes, although there are some rocking and twisting motions which can be dealt with in the locomotive's suspension and centering; a three-cylinder locomotive can also be better balanced, but a two-cylinder locomotive only balanced for rotation will surge fore and aft. Additional balance weight — [...] "overbalance" [...] — can be added to damp this, but at the cost of adding vertical forces, which are known technically as [...] "dynamic augment" [...] and colloquially as [...] "hammer blow". This can be extremely damaging to the track, and in extreme cases can actually cause the driving wheels to leave the track entirely. The heavier the reciprocating machinery, the greater these forces are, and the greater a problem this becomes.|$|E
