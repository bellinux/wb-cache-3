5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} of the song during the 2006 Confessions Tour was controversial. She was raised from the floor hanging on a mirrored cross wearing a red blouse and velvet <b>pants,</b> <b>with</b> a crown of thorns on her head. During the performance, the number 12million flashed above her on the stage's backdrop screens, along with images of African children. This was intended to detail the estimated {{number of children who}} have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed and {{directed}} by Howard Greenhalgh on 10 November 1997 in a studio located in London. The video features each Spice Girl in their own individual scene, inspired by their own movie fantasies. Melanie Brown is shown singing {{on top of a}} tank strapped with ammunition in an industrial post-apocalyptic war scene in a segment based on the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Emma Bunton is shown in a bedroom dressed in white pyjamas while objects float around her on their own; her scene is based on Poltergeist. Melanie Chisholm is shown in a Chinatown, dressed in a red cheongsam and black <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> her hair in a long ponytail with red streaks; her scene is based upon Year of the Dragon. Geri Halliwell is featured in a black-and-white scene based on Rita Hayworth's performance in Gilda. She is shown performing on a smoky stage in a long, white sequined gown with a group of sailors dancing around her.

25|$|In 2003, the Rams wore blue <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> {{their white}} jerseys {{for a pair}} of early-season games, but after losses to the New York Giants and Seattle Seahawks, the Rams reverted to gold <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> their white jerseys. In 2005, the Rams wore the blue pants again at home against Arizona and on the road against Dallas. In 2007, the Rams wore all {{possible}} combinations of their uniforms. They wore the Blue Tops and Gold Pants at home against Carolina, San Francisco, Cleveland, Seattle, and on the road against Dallas. They wore the blue tops and blue pants at home against Arizona, Atlanta, and Pittsburgh on Marshall Faulk night. They wore the blue tops and white pants on the road in Tampa Bay and at home against Green Bay. They wore white tops and gold pants at New Orleans and San Francisco. They wore white tops and white pants at Seattle and Arizona. And they wore white tops and blue pants at Baltimore and Cincinnati. In 2008, the Rams went away with the gold pants. The gold pants were used for only one regular season game at Seattle. The blue jerseys with white pants and white jerseys with blue pants combination were used most of the time. For the 2009 season, the Rams elected to wear the white <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> both jerseys {{for the majority of the}} time except the games against the Vikings and Texans (see below) where they wore the throwback jerseys from the 1999 season, week 2 in Washington when they wore gold <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> the blue jersey, and week 12 against Seattle when they wore blue <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> the blue jersey.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, the Buccaneers {{introduced}} orange {{pants to}} be worn with the white jerseys. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the Lions, lame-duck coach Sam Wyche suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> their orange jerseys. The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker Hardy Nickerson.|$|E

25|$|The team {{traditionally}} wears white pants at {{home and}} red on the road, {{although there have been}} exceptions. Nebraska donned red <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> red jerseys {{for the first time in}} school history for its 1986 contest against Oklahoma. Nebraska led this game for 58½ minutes before losing a 20–17 heart-breaker due to some late OU heroics, and the combination was deemed to be unlucky.|$|E
25|$|The team's helmet is purple with a Viking horn logo on each side. Each horn is {{outlined}} in gold. The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> their white jerseys (The Vikings, {{with their new}} uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been {{minor changes to the}} uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the facemask from gray to white (1980), and then to purple (1985); and adding the Norseman logo to the sleeves (1996). The Vikings continued to wear black shoes until Les Steckel became head coach in 1984. In 2006, the team returned to black shoes for first time since the 1983 season.|$|E

25|$|Front line {{officers}} wear dark {{navy blue}} shirts, cargo <b>pants</b> (<b>with</b> red stripe) and boots. Winter jackets are either dark navy blue jacket design–Eisenhower style, single breasted front closing, two patch type breast pockets, shoulder straps, gold buttons—or yellow windbreaker style {{with the word}} POLICE in reflective silver and black at the back (generally worn by the bicycle and traffic services units). All ranks shall wear dark navy blue clip on ties when wearing long-sleeve uniforms.|$|E
25|$|The Texans' helmet is {{dark blue}} with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was {{initially}} white {{when the team}} name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> its blue jerseys and blue <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wore all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007, the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look. (This uniform combination was not well-received and has since been retired). In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys. In 2016, the Texans unveiled a new uniform combo against the Jacksonville Jaguars, pairing the red jersey with blue pants and red socks. In 2017, the Texans wear the color rush uniform with all-navy blue.|$|E
25|$|To prevent some {{of these}} adverse {{physiological}} effects, the ISS is equipped with two treadmills (including the COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enable various weight-lifting exercises which add muscle but do nothing for bone density, and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends {{at least two hours}} per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> elastic bands attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce osteopenia.|$|E

25|$|Their {{style of}} dress {{reflected}} their Swabian German roots and traditions and was adapted to their life in America. Although the Harmonites typically wore plain clothing, made {{with their own}} materials by their own tailors, they would wear their fine garments on Sundays and on other special occasions. At Economy, on special occasions and Sundays, women wore silk dresses using fabric of their own manufacture. Clothing varied in color, but often carried the same design. On a typical day, women wore ankle-length dresses, while men wore <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> vests or coats and a hat.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 the Toros began a long {{association}} with the Houston Astros. Following {{the lead of the}} parent club (which was widely criticized for its 1980s uniforms), the Toros introduced what some consider the ugliest uniform in the history of organized baseball: orange <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> yellow and red stripes, and a jersey with a turquoise back, yellow raglan sleeves, and a front resplendent in yellow, avocado, red, orange, and lime green stripes of various widths. The look in 1981, an all-orange uniform with red and yellow trim, was similarly ill-received.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins, after {{wearing white}} almost {{exclusively}} in the 1980s and 1990s, occasionally reverted from 2002–2009 to using their burgundy jerseys for home games during the latter weeks of the season, but would still wear white against the Dallas Cowboys. At the 2010 season and home opener on September 12, the team debuted a never-before-seen look, pairing the standard modern burgundy jerseys with the throwback style of gold pants that are reminiscent of the era of George Allen, the late father of then GM Bruce Allen, which had last {{been seen in the}} game vs. the Giants in 2007. In 2010, the team wore burgundy jerseys for all regular season home games, including six total sporting the aforementioned new look. For two home games, vs Green Bay and Tampa Bay, the team wore the standard white pants. In Philadelphia on October 3, with the Eagles wearing white at home, the team also wore white <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> their burgundy jerseys—and did the same when visiting Dallas in December. Away against Tennessee on November 21, they debuted another new look, matching the gold <b>pants</b> <b>with</b> the standard modern white jerseys for the first time ever; the same combination would be worn at the Giants two weeks later. In the other four away games, the team wore the white jerseys over the burgundy pants.|$|E
