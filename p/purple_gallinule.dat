5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E

50|$|A five-year bird {{census of}} the park was {{completed}} in July, 2006. Nearly four dozen additional bird species {{were added to the}} park's checklist. The newly revised SLSP bird checklist features 249 bird species. Each spring over 200 bird species are possible. Texas' largest inland waterbird colony can be found on 29+ spoil islands. The nonstop sight and sounds of this colony is best viewed from along the west levee. This colony is growing and now hosts over 2,200 heron, egret, roseate spoonbill, anhinga, Neotropic cormorant and ibis nests each year. <b>Purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> and least bittern also breed on the lake. Also in spring, over 22 Neotropic migrant species are reported.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of long-time isolation from other wetlands {{is suggested by}} a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia. Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluriforms and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser jacana and the <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> are common on the lake despite being rare {{in other parts of}} Africa and Madagascar squacco heron, black heron, African darter and African skimmers are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and crocodiles are plentiful.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{medium-sized}} rail, measuring 26 - 37 cm in length, spanning 50 - 61 cm across {{the wings and}} weighing 141 - 305 g. Males, averaging 257 g in mass, are slightly larger than females, at 215 g on average. The adult <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> has big yellow feet, purple-blue plumage with a green back, and red and yellow bill. It has a pale blue forehead shield and white undertail. Darkness or low light can dim the bright purple-blue plumage of the adult {{to make them look}} dusky or brownish, although the forehead shield color differentiates them from similar species such as common gallinules.|$|E

50|$|Behind {{the beach}} {{is an area of}} wetland called the Salgados Lagoon which is fed by the waters of the river. It is a shallow salt marsh which {{in recent years has been}} {{restored}} and is now an important wildlife habitat for the area. The east banks of the lagoon have been transformed into a golf course. Whilst the west bank behind the sand bar has been conserved as a large wetland which has become an excellent habitat for a large variety of water fowl and has become an important stopping point for thousands of migrating birds. The lagoon has been classified as an IBA (Important Bird Area). It has been estimated that Salgados has upwards of 5,000 water fowl of 60 different species. These species include <b>Purple</b> <b>gallinule,</b> Purple heron and is a nesting site for the Ferruginous duck.|$|E
50|$|The {{flood plain}} marshes are rich with avifauna. Around 75 migrant species {{winter in the}} marshes. Usual {{migrants}} include garganey Anas querquedula, marsh sandpiper Tringa stagnatilis, wood sandpiper T. glareola, pintail snipe Gallinago stenura, whiskered tern Chlidonias hybridus, and black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa. Resident birds are painted stork Ibis leucocephala, openbill stork Anastomus oscitans, little egret Egretta garzetta, cattle egret Bubulens ibis, pond heron Ardeola grayii, pheasant-tailed jacana Hydrophasianus chirurgus, <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> Porphyrio porphyrio, white ibis Threskiornis melanocephalus, and black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus.

40|$|Lead {{exposure}} in waterfowl was studied using noninvasive fecal sampling in the Guadalquivir Marshes in Spain, an area {{affected by the}} 1998 Aznalcóllar mine disaster. Feces of greylag geese (Anser anser, n = 191) and <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrio porphyrio, n = 91) were collected from three different impacted sites (Entremuros, Caracoles and Cerro de los Ánsares) during the winters of 2004 to 2008. Lead and aluminium (an indicator of sediment ingestion) and Pb isotope signatures (to discriminate between sources of Pb exposure) were analyzed in freeze-dried, acid digested samples. The concentrations of fecal porphyrins and biliverdin were determined as noninvasive biomarkers to study Pb exposure effects. Results showed a decrease in Pb exposure over time in wintering greylag geese. In contrast, for <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> resident in the Entremuros a clear trend was not evident. For both species, sediment ingestion {{appeared to be the}} main source of exposure to Pb. In the Entremuros, some samples from <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> were detected with higher Pb levels than expected for simple soil ingestion, and these had Pb isotopic profiles compatible with mining sludge or Pb shot. Whilst fecal Pb isotopic profiles were effective in differentiating between samples from sites with different levels and sources of pollution, the combined use of element ratios (such as Pb/Al) and other non-traditional stable isotope signatures may also prove worthwhile. Overall, the fecal Pb levels detected were below those described in feces for waterfowl from other uncontaminated areas(, 10 mg/g d. w.). Despite this, for both species fecal Pb levels were positively correlated with porphyrin excretion, and for purpl...|$|E
40|$|The diverse {{breeding}} bird fauna of Israel comprises elements from various zoogeographical regions. This is predominantly {{attributed to the}} zoogeo-graphic position of Israel and its high habitat diversity. In this article I provide information on six bird species new to breeding in Israel since 1995 : green-backed heron (Butorides striatus), <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrio porphyrio), painted snipe (Rostratula benghalensis), thick-billed lark (Rhamphocoris clotbey), wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria), and common mynah (Acrido-theres tristis). The data provided here on the breeding habits of each species vary in extent. A recently fledged wallcreeper comprises the only indication of the species ’ breeding in the country, or near its borders. In the cases of the <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> and the painted snipe, adults were found rearing their young, while the green-backed heron and, especially, the thick-billed lark were studied throughout their entire breeding period. The common mynah is a recently introduced species whose local breeding features {{have not yet been}} thoroughly studied. The wallcreeper has a Central Palearctic distribution, while the remaining species or subspecies have a desert distribution within the Palearctic or a Paleotropic distribution. It is striking that most of the local breeding events of these species are closely connected to human-induced habitat modifications. With the addition of these six new breeding species, the total number of bird species found to breed in Israel is now 210, although some of these species no longer do so...|$|E
