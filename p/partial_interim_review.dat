40|$|One {{innovation}} {{submitted for}} {{the review of}} the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) has been to extend the <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> to the appeal procedure before the Appellate Body. The proposal seeks to enhance Members control over the outcome of the dispute settlement proceeding. In contrast, numerous commentators have argued for the elimination of the <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> from the DSU by questioning its utility and giving preference to time savings for the proceedings. The merits of both proposals, elimination or extension, should be evaluated {{on the basis of the}} <b>interim</b> <b>review's</b> contribution to the effective resolution of disputes between parties. Based on past experience, this article evaluates the <b>interim</b> <b>review's</b> role to reach a mutually agreed solution (MAS) and to provide parties the opportunity to introduce new evidence, raise new legal arguments or request clarifications and corrections. To that effect, it examines the scope of the <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> as interpreted by the adjudicative bodies of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and identifies the limitations on the scope of Member's control during the <b>interim</b> <b>review.</b> The article concludes that an extension to the appeal stage would be of limited utility and potentially even incompatible with essential prerequisites of a legalistic procedure. As regards the panel stage, parties' rights would not be prejudiced by the removal of the <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> from the proceedings.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the benefits and}} {{costs associated with the}} performance of a timely (concurrent) review of quarterly financial statements by the firm’s auditor. Using a sample of 1, 690 companies in Canada, a country where <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> are not mandatory, and controlling for variables associated with annual audit fees and the decision to purchase <b>interim</b> <b>reviews,</b> we find that for the years 2004 and 2005 the audit fees are 15 percent higher for companies with timely reviews. We also examine the cost structure of a review and find that contrary to prior beliefs, the costs are proportionately lower for smaller companies. On the benefits side, we find that the absolute unexpected accruals are on average significantly lower for firms with a timely <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> by their auditor and that the association of timely reviews with the level of unexpected accruals is significantly positive for the interim quarters (Q 1 -Q 3) but significantly negative for the fourth quarter. The results suggest that the presence of the timely review reduces the fourth-quarter abnormal accruals documented in previous studies...|$|R

50|$|The next day, Saturday 6 October 2001, {{the board}} of Railtrack met to discuss what the {{government}} intended to do. In the early evening, they called Winsor and asked whether he {{would be prepared to}} carry out an <b>interim</b> <b>review.</b> Despite the threatened legislation to stop him, Winsor replied that he would be prepared to help. Although he explained to Railtrack that he could not complete an <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> over a single weekend, he said he would be prepared to make a public statement that he had started the process, and suggested to Railtrack that if they were to show that to the administration judge the next day, the administration order would probably not be made. But Railtrack rejected Winsor's willingness to intervene, and the company went into administration - unopposed - the next day, Sunday 7 October 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} realised that ending Railtrack's administration {{required the}} High Court {{to be satisfied}} {{that the company was}} solvent. Darling needed Winsor to announce his willingness to carry out an <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> of the company's financial position, with the probability that he would allocate substantially greater sums to the company for the operation, maintenance and renewal of the network. To enable Winsor to make that decision, Darling knew that he needed to make a formal statement to Parliament to the effect that the government had reviewed the economic regulatory regime for the railways and was satisfied with it, and in particular that its independence was an essential cornerstone of the regime and of continuing private investor confidence in the railways. Darling made that statement on 12 June 2002, and Winsor announced his intention to carry out the <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> on 22 September 2002.|$|R

40|$|An <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> of {{management}} performance at ICARDA was {{requested by the}} CGIAR following its discussion of the Second External Management Review (EMR) of ICARDA at International Centers Week, October-November 1988. The 1988 EMR had been strongly critical {{of a number of}} facets of ICARDA's management and administration, and this <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> was intended to monitor ICARDA's progress in implementing the EMR recommendations. The document contains a transmittal by the CGIAR Executive Secretary and draft comments from the ICARDA Board. The principal document is a letter from John Dillon, who had chaired the 1988 EMR, and Pammi Sachdeva of the CGIAR Secretariat, containing the results of their review. The two reviewers reported substantial progress in implementation of the EMR recommendations, and sufficient improvement in management to warrant postponing further external monitoring until the next regular external review. Topics addressed included staffing of top management, organizational culture, legal status in Syria, Lebanon and Iran, research management, operations management, financial management, human resources, administration and information. An earlier recommendation for employment of an internationally recruited human resources professional to head the personnel unit was reiterated.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{the advent}} of {{applying}} Agile [1] practices on DoD projects, specifi-cally Scrum [2] practices, the burning question asked by many has been, “How does Agile integrate with Waterfall [3] milestones?” Agile development is by definition incremental, meaning major functionality is com-pleted and demonstrated to the customer, users, and other stakeholders at specified releases and {{through a series of}} short, scheduled iterations (or sprints). Waterfall projects rely on completing all requirements by the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) milestone, completing all design by the Critical Design Review (CDR) milestone, and completing product development by the Test Readiness Review (TRR) milestone. Some success has been made to abate this issue by breaking the typical waterfall-based milestone <b>reviews</b> into multiple <b>interim</b> <b>reviews</b> enabled by the flex-ibility in the DoD 5000 acquisition regulation requirements. <b>Interim</b> <b>reviews</b> reflect the iterative nature of Agile as they can be held more frequently and with tighter focus than the traditional days-long milestone reviews. This article presents an approach that uses surveillance points throughout the proj-ect lifecycle as the basis for technical interchange meetings (TIMS) each of which includes a demonstration and review of completed functionality that can be deployed as an operational component of the final product. When deployed into the targeted domain, users are encouraged to provide reflections of product usage in the form of feedback to the project team in real time...|$|R
