50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} is {{a variant of}} the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam {{into and out of the}} cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the <b>pivot</b> <b>mounting</b> (trunnion). These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.|$|E
50|$|Based on a Krupp 1888-1890 design, Skoda {{developed}} a new heavy mortar on a middle <b>pivot</b> <b>mounting</b> for testing in 1896. However, the authorities realised that advancing technology required a newer design using a barrel in a cradle mounted on a hydraulic recoil system. While introduced in November 1900, it wasn't quite ready and went {{through a number of}} minor improvements. One major problem was weak recoil springs that would allow the barrel to slip out of its cradle while elevated. Leather and horsehair stoppers could be wedged in the cradle as a short-term fix. But the permanent fix had to wait until the M 98/7 version that extended the jacket surrounding the barrel to the muzzle and redesigned the cradle was produced after 1907.|$|E
