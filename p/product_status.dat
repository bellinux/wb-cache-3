40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>status,</b> <b>product</b> symbolism, product involvement, and reference group influence is reviewed to conceptually define the <b>Product</b> Symbolic <b>Status</b> construct. The research {{consisted of two}} studies (N = 524) that examined 17 different product types to develop and validate the <b>Product</b> Symbolic <b>Status</b> (PSS) scale. The PSS scale is comprised of four facets: self-concept, impression management, lifestyle, and social visibility. The PSS scale consists of nine items which produced an average reliability of ???? =. 90 and showed evidence of convergent and discriminant validity in MTMM analyses with the constructs of product value-expressiveness, product involvement, and product exclusivity/luxury. The PSS scale {{can also be used}} for brand symbolic status research. The marketing and advertising research implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|How could {{a product}} or service is {{reasonably}} evaluated by anyone in the shortest time? A million dollar question but it is having a simple answer: Sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is consumers review on products and services which helps both the producers and consumers (stakeholders) to take effective and efficient decision within a shortest period of time. Producers can have better knowledge of their products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their <b>products</b> <b>status</b> (ex. <b>product</b> limitations or market status). Consumers can have better knowledge of their interested products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their deserving <b>products</b> <b>status</b> (ex. <b>product</b> limitations or market status). For more specification of the sentiment values, fuzzy logic could be introduced. Therefore, sentiment analysis {{with the help of}} fuzzy logic (deals with reasoning and gives closer views to the exact sentiment values) will help the producers or consumers or any interested person for taking the effective decision according to their product or service interest.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examine how}} power affects consumers' spending propensities. By integrating literatures suggesting that (a) powerlessness is aversive, (b) status is one basis of power, and (c) <b>products</b> can signal <b>status,</b> {{the authors argue that}} low power fosters {{a desire to}} acquire <b>products</b> associated with <b>status</b> to compensate for lacking power. Supporting this compensatory hypothesis, results show that low power increased consumers' willingness to pay for auction items and consumers' reservation prices in negotiations but only when <b>products</b> were <b>status</b> related. The link between powerlessness and compensatory consumption has broad implications both for consumers' health and well-being and for understanding the psychological state of power.

50|$|Behavioural {{segmentation}} is {{the division}} of the market based on how individuals react or respond to a product. Behavioural segmentation relates to a consumer's brand loyalty, usage rate and usage situation, to name a few. Consumer's purchase products primarily for their value or benefits and this is the basic element of this segmentation. Many marketers believe the best starting point for constructing market segmentation is behavioural segmentation. This is understandable as this segment deals an individual's reaction to the product exclusively. Businesses can use an individual's reaction to price drops, technology changes and <b>product</b> <b>status</b> to determine how to market their product or service effectively.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} cater to the taste bud of the younger generation, the recipe for the modern omegi tteok now uses glutinous rice powder mixed with mugwort and sugar. The rice powder makes the tteok more chewy while the {{addition}} of mugwort helps to simulate the green color of the original omegi tteok. The sugar makes it sweeter, promoting the omegi tteok into the marketable dessert <b>product</b> <b>status.</b> The modern mix of ingredients also {{makes it easier to}} store and preserve the omegi tteok, {{so that it can be}} sold and shipped all over the country. Several vendors are even experimenting with different gomul such as nuts, in place of the ground red bean, or adding foreign flavors like banana into the dough.|$|E
50|$|Medisafe's fine lumen cleaner {{was awarded}} for the Millennium Product. Millennium Products {{set out to}} find {{examples}} of the best in British design, creativity and innovation. To attain the Millennium <b>Product</b> <b>Status,</b> products and services had to open up new opportunities, be environmentally responsible, demonstrate the application of new technology and solve a key problem. The Sonic Irrigator was the first instrument reprocessing system to address the increasing challenges of complex, critical instrument cleaning/decontamination.The company manufactures in an Amtac ISO 9001, ISO 13485 quality environments to UL, CSA, CE requirements, complying with ISO 15883 - HTM2030 standards, guidelines for washer disinfectors and IEC 60601-1 Electrical safety standards. The technology of Medisafe’s dual performance Niagara W/D, with both Sonic Irrigation and conventional washing/disinfection is a successful contribution in advanced surgical instrument reprocessing.|$|E

40|$|In {{a number}} of {{purchasing}} situations, consumers are likely to base their value judgment {{on a combination of}} the <b>product</b> brand <b>status</b> and the store status. Hence, for owners of the product brand and the store it is important to isolate the <b>status</b> object (<b>product</b> or store) that primarily drives value. In a 2 x 2 factorial experiment we test this question, and find that consumer willingness to pay is influenced by <b>product</b> and store <b>status,</b> and that these interact in the explanation of value (when measured in terms of willingness to pay). </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the closed loop product design {{methodology}} and framework are presented, {{followed by a}} case study, which uses a refrigerator reciprocating compressor to illustrate the green concept generating from EoL information to design greener product. This methodology captures the information at end-of-life (EoL) and feeding back to design phase in making a greener product. With complete understanding of EoL <b>product</b> <b>status,</b> it enables original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to develop technology diversely {{and at the same}} time rapidly incorporating environmental concept in part of the product chain. The EoL <b>product</b> <b>status</b> is quantified and used as the reference for upcoming design concept. Thereby, a greater reliable product could be achieved by utilizing appropriate material or design in particular product. This resulted in improved product design as an inherent loop in product life cycle. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the rearranged polypropionate ester siserrone A (8), isolated from Siphonaria serrata, was investigated by standard spectroscopic methods and the relative stereochemistry determined by ROESY spectroscopy and chemical degradation studies. Base-catalysed rearrangement of denticulatin A (13) yields the polypropionate ester (16) while careful work-up of S. baconi yields the siphonarins, but not the baconipyrones, as earlier reported.

40|$|After an {{object-oriented}} {{framework for}} micro-processor based {{fire alarm systems}} had been implemented and the first instantiated system had reached <b>product</b> <b>status</b> an effort was undertaken to clearly document the architecture embedded in the framework. The result of this effort was a small pattern language which is presented in this paper. Important patterns in this language are the Point pattern, which covers the abstraction of sensors and actuators, and the Deviation pattern which deals with alarms, faults and other abnormal conditions. The described framework is intended to cover a spectrum of fire alarm systems ranging from small office systems to large complex systems intended for industrial multi-building plants...|$|E
