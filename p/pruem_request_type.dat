For this reason, HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616) added the new status codes 303 and 307 to disambiguate between the two behaviours, with 303 mandating the change of <b>request</b> <b>type</b> to GET, and 307 preserving the <b>request</b> <b>type</b> as originally sent. Despite the greater clarity provided by this disambiguation, the 302 code is still employed in web frameworks to preserve compatibility with browsers that do not implement the HTTP/1.1 specification.|$|R

30|$|This {{second result}} of Figures  5 and 6 {{can be seen}} by {{comparing}} the ratio of ingoing and outgoing data for each <b>request</b> <b>type.</b> Here we see the asymmetric algorithm reduces the overall amount of data going from the cloud to the premise (red part of the chart). This can be a major factor when charges associated with data going from the cloud to the premise are more expensive than charges for data going from the premise to the cloud. On average over the <b>request</b> <b>types,</b> asymmetric partitioning reduces the overall amount of data going from the cloud to the premise by a factor of 52 %. As we see in the next experiment, this can play a role in decreasing the total cost of deployment.|$|R

The current study examines differences between teachers' and mothers' request styles to determine if children are exposed to different request styles in each respective environment. Forty naturalistic lessons and free-play sessions of teachers and mothers conversing with children were coded for requests along several dimensions, including <b>request</b> <b>type.</b> Analysis revealed contrasting teacher and mother request styles. Results suggest that requests occur frequently in teachers' and mothers' speech, with teachers using slightly more total requests. Further analysis reveals that teachers and mothers differ slightly in their <b>request</b> <b>type</b> frequency distributions, with teachers using more need/want statements and hints. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for children's transition to school, Theory of Mind and request comprehension...|$|R

However, the degree to which people are sensitive to expected information value is unknown. This study examined a binary sorting task where sparsity differed across conditions. In contrast to previous work using hypotheses representable as visual areas, the stimuli in this study defined hypotheses in an abstract similarity space over geometric shapes. Participants could request labels for either category members or non-members. While both <b>request</b> <b>types</b> were used in all conditions, most often evenly, the proportion of participants showing a preference for one <b>type</b> of <b>request</b> was strongly impacted by the information value of that <b>request</b> <b>type.</b> A small tendency to prefer requests from the designated target category was also observed.

Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm satisfies the service request, achieves higher success ratio and gains higher revenue/cost ratio for substrate network comparing with the existing algorithms...|$|R
