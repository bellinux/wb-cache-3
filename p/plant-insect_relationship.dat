40|$|International audienceBreeding to {{increase}} crop resistance {{is a common}} strategy to decrease damage caused by insect pests, especially in the current context where insecticides are becoming {{at the same time}} less accepted by society and less efficient because of widespread pest resistance. The main bottleneck of this strategy is phenotyping. Although simple, high-throughput methods have been proposed which could be highly useful, they may raise conceptual issues. Using field and laboratory experiments on oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and the pollen beetle (Brassicogethes aeneus syn. Meligethes aeneus), we illustrated possible difficulties with this approach: (i) field screenings might not represent the real attractiveness of the tested genotypes; (ii) plant phenology or spatial organization of the genotypes might bias field screening results; (iii) experiments based on detached plant parts (here, single flower buds or anthers) might not allow to infer the <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationship</b> of the whole plant. We propose ways to better take these risks into account...|$|E
40|$|Sugary {{secretions}} {{are present}} in many plants and frequently they are linked with reproductive processes. Most of the gymnosperms, both extant and extinct, possess a pollination drop, a diluted sugary secretion protruding from the micropyle, which serves for pollen capture, hydration, and transport in the ovule. It is most probable that this secretion attracted insects giving origin to a <b>plant–insect</b> <b>relationship</b> for pollination based on a sugary solution well before the raise of angiosperm. Floral nectar, {{a new type of}} sugary exudate produced by a specific secreting tissue (the nectary), evolved rapidly when the transition from naked ovule to closed carpel was completed and the pollination drops were no longer available as a food resource for insects. Floral nectar is widely distributed and very diverse in the extant angiosperms where it represents the more common reward for a large variety of pollinators. In this chapter, we highlight the evolutionary relationship between nectar and pollination drops in terms of morphology, physiology, ecology, and biochemistry...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} pest of maize (Zea mays L) in North America and Europe is the European com borer (Os¬trinia nubilalis Hbn). However, in southern Europe another com borer species, the pink stem borer (Sesamia nonagri¬oides Lef.), also causes significant damage to maize. The dam¬age {{caused by the}} pink stem borer in the northwest of Spain was not important a few years ago, but today this damage has increased considerably. Few studies about this pest have been made thus far. The first objective of this work was to study the population quantity and seasonal appearance of Sesamia non¬agrioides in this area. Two trials were carried out in two years under natural field conditions with different sowing dates, thus covering the damage at different stages where the <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationship</b> could change. The {{results showed that the}} attacks varied in intensity depending on the year and sowing date. Early sowing could be a good method for cultural control of Sesamia nonagrioides because the material is too mature and escaped borer attack. Although cultural control could be effec¬tive in preventing or reducing the damage, genetic resistance is another alternative that could be used alone or joined with other control components for integrated pest management. The first step in this insect-resistance breeding program is to identify sources of resistance. Consequently, the second objec¬tive was to study the resistance/tolerance of twenty maize in¬bred lines under artificial infestation conditions with Sesamia nonagrioides. The inbred lines were evaluated for resistance and other agronomic traits. Significant differences were found for all traits. The inbred lines were divided according to matur¬ity groups: early and late. Early maturing inbreds had the greatest damage. The early inbreds EP 37, W 153 R and CMI 05 and the late inbreds Va 26 and w 64 A showed the best resis¬tance to the pest. Thus, they could be promising sources of re¬sistance or tolerance to pink stem borer. These lines may be suitable for use directly in the formation of resistant hybrids and new resistant inbred lines. Further, they and others could be used for the development of resistant synthetics, which could become the base material to obtain resistant varieties to Sesamia nonagrioides. This work was supported by the Committee for Science and Technology of Spain (project AGR 89 - 0537) and the Autonomous Government of Galicia (project XUGA 40301 A 90). Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|A highly {{variable}} invasive shrub, Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae), has been notoriously {{difficult to control}} thus far despite a well established biological control programme in South Africa. A promising leaf-feeding biological control agent, Falconia intermedia (Distant) (Hemiptera: Miridae), released to control this invasive plant eventually crashed at three out of five sites in the Eastern Cape Province. In the Mpumalanga Province, after initially colonising and building up high numbers on the L. camara stands the agent populations crashed. Several reasons for these population crashes have been suggested, but induced plant defences have not been investigated. Although plants {{face the challenge of}} herbivory by various organisms while remaining immobile, some plants may possess the ability to induce physical and/or chemical defensive responses following feeding and thus prevent further plant tissue damage and loss. Laboratory trials were conducted to determine the existence, nature and effect of physical and chemical feeding-induced responses of L. camara on the performance of the leaf-feeding biological control agent, F. intermedia. Lantana camara plants used in the study were obtained from five localities in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, while the insect culture was established from field populations. Plants from all varieties on which F. intermedia was released significantly increased the toughness of their leaves compared to control treatment plants. In addition, plants from three localities: Lyndhurst Farm, East London and Port Alfred, significantly increased trichome density after prolonged feeding by F. intermedia. On the three varieties showing increases in these two factors (i. e. leaf toughness and trichome density), oviposition, survival and feeding damage by the mirid agent was significantly lower on previously damaged plants. A significant negative correlation between trichome density and population numbers was found (R²= 0. 52, p < 0. 0003), suggesting that an increase in trichome density strongly contributes to a reduction in F. intermedia's growth. The growth and reproduction of the resistant plants was not significantly impacted by F. intermedia feeding. The defensive responses were found to be plant systemic and rapidly induced as they were elicited and expressed throughout the plant in both damaged and undamaged leaves within five weeks after insect release. Leaf toughness and trichome density were not significantly increased after feeding on plants from Whitney Farm and Heather Glen Farm. On the contrary, mirid individuals performed significantly better on plants from Whitney Farm and Heather Glen Farm than on plants of other varieties, indicating their susceptibility and suitability to the agent and the lack of induced resistance against the agent. Plants from all localities besides East London showed some level of tolerance and overcompensated for feeding damage by increasing plant growth and reproductive factors on plants fed upon. This was however only significant in two variables of the more susceptible localities, Whitney Farm and Heather Glen Farm. This increase in plant fitness did however indicate an induced defence response by these plants to feeding, a response designed to lessen the effects of agent feeding. Headspace volatile analysis was used to investigate any volatile chemical responses by L. camara due to F. intermedia feeding at two of the five localities chosen: East London and Whitney Farm. There {{was no significant difference in}} headspace volatiles emitted by leaves of plants from the East London insect infested and control treatment plants. On the Whitney Farm damaged plants however there was a 2. 5 fold increase in the emission intensity of one of the three main compounds, later identified as Beta-caryophyllene. Three major chemical constituents which were found to be common to leaf volatiles of the two varieties were identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) from the damaged and undamaged leaves of these two varieties. The methods used in collecting leaf volatiles were shown to be significant in the strength of chromatogram peaks. Using general authentication methods and purified standards, one of these was identified as the sesquiterpene, Beta-caryophyllene (C₁₅H₂₄). This compound is one of the major constituents found in isolations of L. camara varieties worldwide. This is the first such work done on a variety of L. camara in South Africa, and hopefully the beginning of more in-depth studies of the volatile organic chemicals from the numerous naturalised varieties of L. camara. It is suggested that the sum of these responses may play a role bigger than is currently understood in this <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationship.</b> It is also argued that feeding induced plant defences may play an important role in attempts to control alien plants using insect agents...|$|E
40|$|Plants mediate {{interactions}} between insects, including leaf- and root-feeders; yet {{the underlying mechanisms}} and connection with ecological theory remain unresolved. In this review, based on novel insights into long-distance (i. e., leaf-leaf, root-shoot) defence signalling, we explore the role of phytohormones in driving broad-scale patterns of aboveground-belowground interactions that can be extrapolated to general <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships.</b> We propose that the outcome of intra-feeding guild interactions is generally negative due to induction of similar phytohormonal pathways, whereas between-guild interactions are often positive due to negative signal crosstalk. However, not all outcomes {{could be explained by}} feeding guild; we argue that future studies should target ecologically representative plant-insect systems, distinguish subguilds, and include plant growth hormones to improve our understanding of plant-mediated interactions...|$|R

The observed interactions are skelitonizing, blotch and galls, ovipositions or coprolites, leaf mines and leaf chewing. These traces indicate that insects had associated the plants for various purposes, such as feeding, ovipositioning and sheltering for insect larvae etc. Further, these morphotraces tend to pin point some similarities of plant- insect interactions among extant plant species such as Piper betle and Musa sp. local plants of Sri Lanka.

40|$|Western {{flower thrips}} (Frankliniella occidentalis) {{has become a}} key insect pest of {{agricultural}} and horticultural crops worldwide. Little is known about host plant resistance to thrips. In this study, we investigated thrips resistance in chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora). We identified thrips-resistant chrysanthemums applying bioassays. Subsequently, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -based metabolomics was applied to compare the metabolome of thrips-resistant and -susceptible chrysanthemums. NMR facilitates wide-range coverage of the metabolome. We show that thrips-resistant and -susceptible chrysanthemums can be discriminated on basis of their metabolomic profiles. Thrips-resistant chrysanthemums contained higher amounts of the phenylpropanoids chlorogenic acid and feruloyl quinic acid. Both phenylpropanoids {{are known for their}} inhibitory effect on herbivores as well as pathogens. Thus, chlorogenic and feruloyl quinic acid are the compounds of choice to improve host plants resistance to thrips in ornamentals and crops. The effect of chlorogenic acid on thrips was further studied in bioassays with artificial diets. These experiments confirmed the negative effects on thrips. Our results prove NMR to be an important tool to identify different metabolites involved in herbivore resistance. It constitutes a significant advance in the study of <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships,</b> providing key information on the implementation of herbivore resistance breeding strategies in plants...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{chemical}} {{aspects of}} <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships</b> are largely studied, {{the effect of}} within-plant structure on insects is seldom investigated, especially in perennial crops. In fruit production, the manipulation of tree architecture is {{generally considered to be}} involved in pest development through considerations of "tree vigour" or branching density. However, both physiological and physical aspects of tree architecture (i. e., canopy height, width and shape, fruiting and vegetative shoot distribution, branching, connectivity, growth rhythmicity) affect the distribution and abundance of both phytophagous arthropods and natural enemies. Tree architecture can affect arthropod pest by modifying: (a) the attractiveness of the host-plant; (b) the within-plant life conditions including microclimate, availability and accessibility of resources and reproduction sites, and enemy-free spaces; (c) the efficiency of chemical or alternative pest control methods (including the use of pheromones). Despite seasonal effects and variability in species biology, modelling and experimental approaches have shown that a more complex architecture favours phytophagous insects and is detrimental to the foraging of most natural enemies. Orchards are permanent habitats, in which the manipulation of tree architecture is potentially a powerful tool for pest regulation, through the implementation of innovating training systems...|$|R
40|$|In nature, plants {{interact}} with many organisms {{and need to}} integrate their responses to these diverse community members. Knowledge on <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships</b> has accumulated rapidly during the last decades. Yet most studies on direct or indirect defences of plants against herbivory have treated herbivores as individual stressors. However, herbivores often consist of communities themselves, comprising organisms such as parasites and symbionts, which may have important effects on the herbivore phenotype, and consequently on interactions of the herbivore with its food plant. Here, we review how herbivore-associated organisms affect plant-herbivore interactions. Organisms associated with herbivores can directly affect how a plant interacts with their herbivorous hosts, by interfering with plant signal-transduction pathways, repressing the expression of plant defence-related genes, or altering plant secondary metabolism. In addition, herbivore-associated organisms can also affect plant responses indirectly by their effect on the behaviour and physiology of their herbivore host. The changes in plant phenotype that arise from herbivore-associated organisms may subsequently affect interactions with other community members, thereby impacting community dynamics. Furthermore, herbivore-associated organisms may act as a hidden driving force of plant-herbivore coevolution. Therefore, to understand plant-herbivore interactions {{it is important to}} realize that every single herbivorous insect constitutes a community in itself...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGlobal {{change is}} {{resetting}} the spatial and ecological equilibrium of complex co-evolutionary relationships between plants and their insect herbivores. We review the mechanisms {{at play in}} the responses of planteinsect interactions to global changes, including increased temperature and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, modification of land use and pollution. We distinguish between the direct effects of global changes on each partner from the indirect impacts on insects via the responses of plants. The indirect effects include {{a change in the}} nutritional quality of the plant tissues for herbivore insects, as well as a change in the microclimatic conditions at the leaf surface. Pollinators are involved in a close symbiotic relationship with their favourite plants, and any depression caused by climate stress can lead to pollination deficit. Pollinators are, indeed, quite sensitive to global changes. Furthermore, although species are connected by trophic links, all species respond differently to global changes. We highlight that {{more research is needed to}} elucidate the plant-mediated indirect effects of climate change on insects. Then, other human activities, such as land transformations and release of pollutants, are likely to modulate these links between climate and <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships.</b> We argue that predicting the net effect of global change on planteinsect relationships requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that modulate the interaction strength between the plants and the insects, rather than on focusing on each partner individually...|$|R
40|$|Plants produce {{semio-chemicals}} {{that directly}} influence insect attraction and/or repulsion. Generally, this attraction is {{closely associated with}} herbivory and has been studied mainly under atmospheric conditions. On the other hand, the relationship between aquatic plants and insects has been little studied. To determine whether the roots of aquatic macrophytes release attractive chemical mixtures into the water, we studied the behaviour of mosquito larvae using olfactory experiments with root exudates. After testing the attraction on Culex and Aedes mosquito larvae, we chose to work with Coquillettidia species, which have a complex behaviour in nature {{and need to be}} attached to plant roots in order to obtain oxygen. This relationship is non-destructive and can be described as commensal behaviour. Commonly found compounds seemed to be involved in insect attraction since root exudates from different plants were all attractive. Moreover, chemical analysis allowed us to identify a certain number of commonly found, highly water-soluble, low-molecular-weight compounds, several of which (glycerol, uracil, thymine, uridine, thymidine) were able to induce attraction when tested individually but at concentrations substantially higher than those found in nature. However, our principal findings demonstrated that these compounds appeared to act synergistically, since a mixture of these five compounds attracted larvae at natural concentrations (0. 7 nM glycerol, < 0. 5 nM uracil, 0. 6 nM thymine, 2. 8 nM uridine, 86 nM thymidine), much lower than those found for each compound tested individually. These results provide strong evidence that a mixture of polyols (glycerol), pyrimidines (uracil, thymine), and nucleosides (uridine, thymidine) functions as an efficient attractive signal in nature for Coquillettidia larvae. We therefore show for the first time, that such commonly found compounds may {{play an important role in}} <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships</b> in aquatic eco-systems...|$|R
40|$|The ecophysiological {{importance}} of phototoxins (PTs), {{a group of}} plant light-activated secondary compounds toxic {{to a wide range}} of organisms, was investigated in the context of <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships.</b> The efficiency of PTs in protecting plants against herbivores was investigated in the field by measuring the herbivory damage on a series of ten plant species having different levels of phototoxic activity. Regression analyses performed between the herbivory level and the phototoxic activity of plants indicated a lower number of herbivore attacks per leaf and a higher leaf area removed per attack on the most phototoxic plants. There was, however, no effect of the phototoxic activity of plant tissues on the total area per leaf removed by herbivores or the percent of leaf area consumed. Field observations also revealed that specialist insects typically occurred on highly phototoxic plants whereas generalist insects were predominantly restricted to the least phototoxic plants. Thus PTs do not reduce the total herbivory pressure experienced by plants, although they restrict the range of herbivores attacking plants to specialist herbivores, that is those that are likely to have evolved some adaptation. The purported adaptations of insects to PTs present in their host plants were investigated in a group of specialist and generalist herbivorous insects feeding on the phototoxic foliage of either Hypericum perforatum (Guttiferae) or Viguiera annua (Asteraceae). This comparative approach identified distinct behavioral and biochemical adaptations that are used by generalist and specialist phytophagous insects to circumvent phototoxicity. Generalist insects, three long-horned grasshoppers collected on H. perforatum in the southwest of France, were observed to selectively feed between the glands located on leaves of Hypericum perforatum that contain the PT hypericin. On the other hand, specialist insects, three leaf beetles and one noctuid, all relied on light-avoidance behavioral strategies to prevent photosensitization. Glands containing the PT hypericin were indeed acting as a feeding stimulant to larvae of Cloantha perspicillaris, a specialist noctuid on St John's-wort. Some differences between specialist and generalist insects were also observed in the activities of antioxidant enzymes which are a major biochemical adaptation for insects to tolerate the oxidative stress induced by PTs. Generalist insects relied on high constitutive activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) whereas insects specialized on phototoxic plants had lower, but PT-inducible activities of antioxidant enzymes. Some important ecophysiological constraints for plants relying on phototoxic defenses were also identified. It was furthermore confirmed that these environmentally-mediated variations in the production of defensive traits in plants affected the performance of herbivorous insects under both laboratory and field conditions. Inconsistencies between the results that were obtained in the present study and predictions based on the classical theory of coevolutionary interactions between host plants and their associated herbivorous insects, led me to propose a modified evolutionary scheme referred to as plant integrated chemical defenses (PICDs). It is suggested that PICDs may have evolved in phototoxic plants to specifically counter the ecophysiological drawbacks associated with phototoxic chemical defenses.

40|$|This {{short term}} {{research}} {{was concerned with}} an Agromyzid parasite –Phytomyza ilicis, Curt, which attacks young unthickened leaves of Jlex aquifolium, causing the formation of brown yellow blotches or mines on the leaf surface. Few papers related to P. ilicis have been published, and no recorded work has been given for the North East area of England, {{despite the fact that}} the holly leaf miner /holly tree association provides a useful system for the study of <b>plant-insect</b> <b>relationships.</b> Aims of the investigation were to determine whether differences in levels of infestation existed between trees of varying age and sex within the same area. Variation in infestation with height and aspect was investigated, together with egg mortality, later mortality factors by bird-attack and different species of parasites was also examined. The life-cycle of P. ilicis and its parasites was recorded from the mature larval - adult stages. Adult Sphegigaster flavicornis were recorded from suction-traps only. The study was carried out within Hollingside Wood, Durham city G. R. NZ. 276 405. Sixteen holly bushes were examined on the basis of their isolation or proximaty to other holly bushes, position with respect to other vegetation, height and diameter, degree of healthiness based on the number of leaves per twig, sex and position with respect to gradient within the main wood. Six suction-traps were set up within a group of three adjacent trees at varying height Intervals within the University field-station. The size of bushes examined varied between 1. 7 - 9. 6 metres. Problems with sampling are discussed, and it was decided to sample between 325 - 4300 leaves depending on the size of, the tree, The ideal sample size was 800 - 1000 leases, leaves v/ere examined for the presence of eggs, the number of eggs per leaf, the position along the midrib, the number of mines per leaf and their position on the leaf. Each mine was examined for bird attack, and for the presence of both larval and pupal parasites. Leaf-sections were obtained from each tree for leaves of the 1977 season, to determine whether cuticle thickness, influenced the level of infestation between trees. Cuticle thickness was found to be unimportant in determining whether a leaf was mined or not, however cuticle thickness ultimately is important since adult P. ilicis can only attack young leaves where the cuticle is undeveloped. A variation in the time of emergence for adult P. ilicis was observed when compared with accounts given by Miall and Taylor (1907), Downes (1931), although the general pattern of the life-cycle was similar. No significant difference in the level of infestation was observed between trees, although total mine and egg number varied significantly. Spatial distribution did not appear to influence the density of mines, and no significant difference in population density with regard to position within Hollingside Wood was found. Aspect and height influenced both total mine and egg number. Egg mortality was observed to vary between trees but differences were not significant. Egg density was observed to influence the viability of eggs within the leaf, but; the relationship was density-independent by the larval parasite, C. gemma, and by an undetermined mortality factor influencing survival in the early stages of development.

40|$|Insect parasitoids {{can play}} ecologically {{important}} roles in virtually all terrestrial plant-insect herbivore interactions, yet whether parasitoids alter the defensive traits that underlie interactions between plants and their herbivores remains a largely unexplored question. Here, we examined the reciprocal trophic interactions among populations of the wild cabbage Brassica oleracea that vary greatly in their production of defensive secondary compounds - glucosinolates (GSs), a generalist herbivore, Trichoplusia ni, and its polyembryonic parasitoid Copidosoma floridanum. In a greenhouse environment, plants were exposed to either healthy (unparasitized), parasitized, or no herbivores. Feeding damage by herbivores induced higher levels of the indole GSs, glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin, but not {{any of the other}} measured GSs. Herbivores parasitized by C. floridanum induced cabbage plants to produce 1. 5 times more indole GSs than levels induced by healthy T. ni and five times more than uninduced plants. As a gregarious endoparasitoid, C. floridanum causes its host T. ni to feed more than unparasitized herbivores resulting in increased induction of indole GSs. In turn, herbivore fitness parameters (including differential effects on male and female contributions to lifetime fecundity in the herbivore) were negatively correlated with the aliphatic GSs, sinigrin and gluconapin, whereas parasitoid fitness parameters were negatively correlated with the indole GSs, glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin. That herbivores and their parasitoids appear to be affected by different sets of GSs was unexpected given the intimate developmental associations between host and parasitoid. This study is the first to demonstrate that parasitoids, through increasing feeding by their herbivorous hosts, can induce higher levels of non-volatile plant chemical defenses. While parasitoids are widely recognized to be ubiquitous in most terrestrial insect herbivore communities, their role in influencing <b>plant-insect</b> herbivore <b>relationships</b> is still vastly underappreciated. </p...|$|R
