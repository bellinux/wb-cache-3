50|$|Educologists {{argue that}} the concept of educology implies the {{inclusion}} of the entire fund of recorded propositional knowledge about the entire process, from nascence to senescence. It is not limited only to knowledge about the education of children (pedagogy) or to that of male adults (andragogy). It is not recorded knowledge about processes other than education, such as knowledge about character development (ethology) or a combination of psychological knowledge and knowledge about the practice of teaching (<b>psychopedagogy).</b> The name educology eliminates the ambiguity which is created by naming the process of guided study with the term education and naming the fund of recorded propositional knowledge about that process with the same term education.|$|E

In research conducted metaphors in the four categories of Leavy, McSorley and Boté (2007) : transmissive/ behavioral, cognitive/constructivist, situated and self-referential. The results indicate that most of the prospective teachers were able to conceptualize their roles in the form of metaphors. The greatest number of metaphors expressed by the prospective primary and childhood teacher, belonged to the behaviourist/transmissive category, followed by the cognitivist/constructivist, self-referential, and situative categories. However the <b>psychopedagogy</b> group, expressed the same number of metaphors in the categories behaviourist/transmissive and cognitivist/constructivist, followed by the situative and self-referential categories. In emotional metaphors the result is very different: The greatest number of emotional metaphors expressed by the three groups belonged to the cognitivist/constructivist category, especially in prospective primary and childhood teacher, followed by the self-referential category, with fewer in the behaviourist/transmissive and situative categories. For preservice teachers, reflecting on their own metaphors, both cognitive and emotional ones, can be a powerful tool to conceptualize their ideas, attitudes, emotions and teaching roles and to initiate changes in them. </p...|$|E

In continuity with studies of human sciences that address the relation with knowledge of the subjects, and following Charlot’s (2008)  theoretical contributions, this study aimed to analyze the secondary processes of establishing the relation of students with knowledge, focusing on students who culminate the primary education and start secondary level in public schools in Rio Negro Province. Identifying and problematizing specifically the meanings these students give to school knowledge, and more generally, to school and their past and future trajectories in it. The research methodology was qualitative, hermeneutical and interpretative. We implemented a psycho-pedagogical accompanying workshop; it consisted in various meetings carried out during school hours, each one organized around a particular problem and linked to a production activity- sought, to recover the students’ discourse. On the basis of written, oral, graphic and dramatic productions, we researched the objects of knowledge, the activities the students mastered, and the relational forms acquired. As a result, we found that students reported different figures of learning (Charlot, 2008),giving special relevance to the ways of relating. In turn, from school, the apprehension of knowledge is emphasized but as knowledge-relational object. Regarding the know-writing, writing follows different rules to those proposed at school that we might call standard. Finally, when you refer to the places where they learn, even though they mention different spaces to school and family, these two spaces continue to be privileged sites and institutions for learning...|$|E

The main objective will be to find out if learned helplessness in school environments and education is actively researched and to ascertain the state-of-the-art of this research. We will provide a simple general diagnostic tool for teachers to detect signs of learned helplessness on their students. We will also provide simple treatment strategies to try to alleviate or minimize the effects of learned helplessness on students. These strategies do not treat mental disorders and, because of this, they can be used by any education professional: teachers and <b>Psychopedagogy</b> professionals.

40|$|Abstract Background Burnout {{syndrome}} (BS) {{is a set}} {{of psychological}} symptoms resulting from the interaction between chronic occupational stress and individual factors. These symptoms include emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and decreased professional satisfaction. BS is manifested in a variety of professions and is prevalent in contexts in which health professionals are required to interact directly with the public. Objective To determine the prevalence of BS among medical students at a university in Ceará State, Brazil. Methods Of the 517 students enrolled in their first to eighth semester in 2013, 376 (72. 7 %) were contacted. A socio-economic evaluation questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory – Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) were administered. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 20. 0. Two groups – burnout/risk and non-burnout – were compared using the chi-square and likelihood ratio tests with a significance level of 5 %. Variables with p < 0. 20 were included in a multivariate analysis logistical regression model. Results Burnout was detected in 14. 9 % of the students, and 57. 7 % showed a risk of developing the syndrome.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the use of cognitive maps from interviews as analytical procedures of a secondary preservice science teacher’s conceptions {{of the nature of}} science. The philosophy of science has for many years been absent both from science curricula and from science teacher education (Mellado, 1998 b). One of the causes of the failure of many science teaching courses and programs lies in the ambiguity of their philosophical standpoints, which generally leads to implicit assumption of immature and uncontrolled conceptions about the nature of science. From a constructivist perspective (Hewson & Hewson, 1989), the study of science teachers ' conceptions thus gains a particular importance as a first step to generating more suitable conceptions and practices in the teachers themselves. Lederman and O'Malley (1990) argue for qualitative research methods and consider that questionnaires give oversimplified results which do not correspond to the richer orientations manifest in interviews. We used cognitive maps in an investigation of a secondary preservice science teachers {{at the end of their}} education at the University of Extremadura (Spain) during the 1992 - 93 academic year (Mellado, 1996, 1997, 1998).

Analisamos aqui as respostas de estudantes dos cursos de Psicopedagogia de instituições particulares do {{interior}} do estado de São Paulo e Minas Gerais. Foram selecionados aleatoriamente estudantes que estavam no início, no meio e no final do curso de especialização, totalizando 52 sujeitos participantes da pesquisa. Todos os sujeitos responderam a um questionário contendo nove questões discursivas. Apresentaremos aqui os dados referentes a três delas: 1) O que é dificuldade de aprendizagem; 2) Em que momento você julga necessário encaminhar um aluno para atendimento especializado? 3) Você já encontrou em sua prática alunos com dificuldades de aprendizagem? Se sim, emita um parecer sobre uma criança, seu aluno, que apresentou dificuldade. Se não, explique hipoteticamente. Os dados obtidos a partir das respostas foram categorizados segundo a análise de conteúdo e análise estatística simples. Os principais resultados indicam que 56 % dos futuros psicopedagogos acreditam que a dificuldade de aprendizagem refere-se sempre e somente a uma incapacidade do sujeito que não aprende; 46 % sentem-se incapazes diante do quadro de um aluno que não aprende e não sabem intervir, necessitando recorrer a atendimentos especializados e 33 % descrevem alunos com dificuldades de aprendizagem como aqueles que possuem problemas relacionados aos conteúdos abordados em sala de aula, principalmente matemática e leitura e escrita. Estes dados iniciais apresentam as idéias e concepções que futuros profissionais têm e chamam a atenção para a importância da discussão destes temas nos cursos de formação de psicopedagogos.
