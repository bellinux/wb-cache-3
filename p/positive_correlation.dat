5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that self-oriented and {{socially}} prescribed perfectionism show differential relationships with intrinsic–extrinsic motivation and test anxiety, but the findings are ambiguous. Moreover, they ignored that test anxiety is multidimensional. Consequently, the present study re-investigated the relationships in 104 university students examining how the two forms of perfectionism are related to intrinsic–extrinsic motivation and multidimensional test anxiety (worry, emotionality, interference, lack of confidence, and total anxiety). Regarding motivation, self-oriented perfectionism showed <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> with intrinsic reasons for studying, and socially prescribed perfectionism <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> with extrinsic reasons. Regarding test anxiety, only socially prescribed perfectionism showed <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> with total anxiety. Moreover, socially prescribed perfectionism showed <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> with interference and lack of confidence, whereas self-oriented perfectionism showed <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> with worry, but negative correlations with interference and lack of confidence. The findings confirm that socially prescribed perfectionism is a maladaptive form of perfectionism associated with extrinsic motivation for studying and higher anxiety in exams. Self-oriented perfectionism, however, is an ambivalent form associated with intrinsic motivation for studying and with both higher and lower anxiety (higher worry, lower interference, lower lack of confidence) in exams...|$|R

Three {{hundred and sixty}} fish specimens belonging to three species of fish were examined parasitological for external and internal metazoan parasites. The seasonal prevalence of the detected parasites was differing from season to another. The highest rate occurred in summer and spring while, the lowest rate was in autumn and winter, respectively.

25|$|One {{study found}} that introverts have more blood flow in the frontal lobes of their brain and the {{anterior}} or frontal thalamus, which are areas dealing with internal processing, such as planning and problem solving. Extraverts have more blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus, temporal lobes, and posterior thalamus, which are involved in sensory and emotional experience. This study and other research indicates that introversion-extraversion is related to individual differences in brain function.

30|$|When we {{analysed}} {{the relationships}} between SWBQb and PWBS factors to assess the convergent validity of the SWBQb, we found 20 <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> out of 24 relationships that were tested, although they were weak (<[*]. 40). Previous international studies have reported <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> between spiritual well-being and psychological well-being among English samples (Fisher, 2011; Rowold, 2011). A validation study of SWBQp, conducted in Portugal (Mangia, 2015) using the same instruments as in this study found evidence for the convergent validity of the SWBQp and also obtained a very similar number of <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> (19 correlations). The correlations reported by Mangia (2015) were similar in magnitude to those we observed, although slightly higher. The pattern of correlations was very similar in the two studies: <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> between the SWBQ personal factor and all PWBS factors. Both studies also found <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> between SWBQ-communal and PWBS-environmental mastery, PWBS-personal development, PWBS-positive relationships, PWBS-purpose in life and PWBS-self-acceptance. SWBQ-transcendental was not correlated with PWBS-personal development in either study. We found no correlation between SWBQb-transcendental and PWBS-autonomy, but Mangia (2015) did find a very weak correlation between these two factors in the Portuguese versions of the instruments. Finally, SWBQb-environment {{was positively correlated with}} all the PWBS factors except positive relationships. These results provide evidence of the convergent validity of the SWBQb and corroborate studies that have observed correlations between spiritual well-being and psychological well-being in other countries (Fisher, 2011; Mangia, 2015; Rowold, 2011).|$|R
