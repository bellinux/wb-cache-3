5000|$|The {{creation}} of sparks from metals {{is based on}} the pyrophoricity of small metal particles, and <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>alloys</b> are made for this purpose. [...] This has certain uses: the sparking mechanisms in lighters and various toys, using ferrocerium; starting fires without matches, using a firesteel; the flintlock mechanism in firearms; and spark-testing ferrous metals.|$|E
50|$|In 1903 Auer von Welsbach won another {{patent for}} a fire striker ("flint") {{composition}} named ferrocerium. Welsbach's flints consisted of <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>alloys,</b> 70% cerium and 30% iron, which when scratched or struck would give off sparks. This system remains in wide use in cigarette lighters today. In 1907 he formed Treibacher Chemische Werke GesmbH {{to build and}} market the devices. In 1920 he received the Siemens-Ring as his name had become a synonym for the rise of artificial lightning.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{findings}} of the study, bilateral trade agreement is able to expand the export of the Philippines with its trade partner, Japan. Based on the export data of Philippine export to Japan, there are certain commodities that were initially decreasing prior to the agreement that significantly increased, 7 Â years since the implementation of the agreement such as: meat and edible meat offal (15, 3312.2 %), umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops and parts thereof (1878.1 %), explosives; pyrotechnic products, matches, <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>alloys,</b> certain combustible preparations (1091.7 %). It is therefore recommended {{to increase the number of}} bilateral trade agreement of the Philippines with other countries in order to boost export. It is further recommended to pursue assessment of other trade agreements undertaken by the Philippines to support this conclusion.|$|E

5000|$|Ferrocerium is a {{synthetic}} <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>alloy</b> that produces hot sparks that can reach temperatures of 3000 C when rapidly oxidized {{by the process}} of striking. This property allows it to have many commercial applications, such as the ignition source for lighters (where it is often known by the misleading name [...] "flint"), strikers for gas welding and cutting torches, deoxidization in metallurgy, and ferrocerium rods (also called ferro rods, flint-and-steel, and flint-spark-lighters). Due to ferrocerium's ability to ignite in adverse conditions, rods of ferrocerium are commonly used as an emergency combustion device in survival kits.|$|R
500|$|The {{first use}} of cerium was in gas mantles, invented by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. In 1885, he had {{previously}} experimented with mixtures of magnesium, lanthanum, and yttrium oxides, but these gave green-tinted light and were unsuccessful. Six years later, he discovered that pure thorium oxide produced a much better, though blue, light, and that mixing it with cerium dioxide resulted in a bright white light. Additionally, cerium dioxide also acts {{as a catalyst for}} the combustion of thorium oxide. This resulted in great commercial success for von Welsbach and his invention, and created great demand for thorium; its production resulted in a large amount of lanthanides being simultaneously extracted as by-products. Applications were soon found for them, especially in the <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>alloy</b> known as [...] "mischmetall" [...] composed of 50% cerium, 25% lanthanum, and the remainder being the other lanthanides, that is used widely for lighter flints. Usually, iron is also added to form an alloy known as ferrocerium, also invented by von Welsbach. Due to the chemical similarities of the lanthanides, chemical separation is not usually required for their applications, such as the mixing of mischmetall into steel to improve its strength and workability, or as catalysts for the cracking of petroleum. This property of cerium saved the life of writer Primo Levi at the Auschwitz concentration camp, when he found a supply of ferrocerium alloy and bartered it for food.|$|R
