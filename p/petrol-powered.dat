25|$|The Hobart Metropolitan Tramways {{reached a}} peak in {{popularity}} in the 1930s and 40s, but by 1960 increased pressure from private car ownership and <b>petrol-powered</b> buses led to economic trouble for both passenger rail and the Hobart Tramways.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 the Board {{purchased}} {{its first}} bus and commenced a feeder service {{from the end}} of the Sockburn tram route to Templeton. The bus was a battery-powered vehicle with solid rubber tyres but proved to be so unreliable that it was rebuilt and converted to use a petrol engine. It was later joined by another <b>petrol-powered</b> bus.|$|E
25|$|After {{successfully}} introducing diesel {{buses to}} its {{operation in the}} mid-1930s, the Board had hoped to phase out its older <b>petrol-powered</b> vehicles and focus on diesels, both for new routes and as required to replace trams. With the onset of World War 2, the supply of diesel-powered vehicles dried up and the only option for augmenting the fleet was the Fords, which eventually numbered 41 in service to the Board.|$|E
25|$|Incident Response Vehicles (IRV) or 'Pandas' are {{generally}} used when a '999' call has been received regarding an ongoing incident or emergency. Usually an IRV would {{be assigned to}} the call, as their continual patrol of an area reduces their deployment time. Response vehicles tend {{to be capable of}} the safe use of speed, common types include, Ford Focus or Vauxhall Astra. These are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 1.8 litres. Although <b>petrol-powered</b> engines once dominated, diesel engines are now becoming more common due to their superior fuel economy and therefore lower operating costs.|$|E
25|$|They were {{initially}} based at Ain-el-Gazala, {{just west of}} Tobruk. Stahlschmidt sank two small ships. In one attack on a 200-ton sailing ship his cannon fire struck the Galley, hitting the <b>petrol-powered</b> cooker, causing a large fire. Eight English and six Greek sailors abandoned the ship before it sank. Another was sunk leading to the capture of 32 men. Stahlschmidt achieved his first victory during the Siege of Tobruk on 15 June 1941. The British Eighth Army began Operation Battleaxe that morning and 2./JG27 was engaged in operations throughout the day. Stahlschmidt claimed a Hawker Hurricane, probably of No. 73 Squadron RAF. Stahlschmidt did not file another claim until 20 November 1941. The British Army initiated Operation Crusader to relieve Tobruk. Stahlschmidt claimed a trio of South African Air Force (SAAF) Martin Maryland bombers, west of Tobruk. The 21 Squadron SAAF reported the loss of four from a formation of nine and claimed one Bf 109 shot down in exchange during a mission to bomb positions at Al Edem. A week later, on 27 November, he claimed another Hurricane south of El Adem for his fifth victory which qualified him as a flying ace.|$|E

500|$|A study {{published}} in the UK in April 2013 assessed the carbon footprint of plug-in electric vehicles in 20 countries. As a baseline the analysis established that manufacturing emissions account for 70 g CO2/km for an electric car and 40 g CO2/km for a petrol car. The study found that in countries with coal-intensive generation, PEVs are no different from conventional <b>petrol-powered</b> vehicles. Among these countries are China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and India. A pure electric car in India generates emissions comparable to a [...] petrol car.|$|E
500|$|For the 2008 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, Holden {{announced}} the MY09.5 upgrade involving the standardisation of the [...] "premium" [...] Alloytec V6 across the Commodore range from 1 November 2008, whereas previously {{it had been}} reserved for the SV6 and Calais. Omega and Berlina variants acquired variable valve timing, like the High Output engine, but not the [...] "premium" [...] dual exhaust system and the five-speed automatic transmission. These changes result in the base petrol V6 producing [...] less power and [...] less torque than the engine it replaces. However, Omega and Berlina sedans benefit from a twopercent fuel efficiency improvement, or fourpercent for wagons. Additionally, emissions have also been reduced allowing <b>petrol-powered</b> variants to achieve Euro VI certification, a pending emission standard for European introduction in 2014. These changes extend further than the petrol engine as bi-fuel LPG variants benefit from an eightpercent improvement in fuel economy when run on LPG. This reduced fuel consumption does however, come at a cost—LPG-equipped models are rated at , [...] less than before.|$|E

2500|$|Emission {{standards}} for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are summarised {{in the following}} tables. Since the Euro 2 stage, EU regulations introduce different emission limits for diesel and petrol vehicles. Diesels have more stringent CO standards but are allowed higher [...] emissions. <b>Petrol-powered</b> vehicles are exempted from particulate matter (PM) standards through to the Euro 4 stage, but vehicles with direct injection engines are subject to a limit of 0.005g/km for Euro 5 and Euro 6. A particulate number standard (P) or (PN) has been introduced in 2011 with Euro 5b for diesel engines and in 2014 with Euro 6 for petrol engines.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 2003, the Fabia VRS, {{while not}} the first diesel hot hatch, was the first {{exclusively}} diesel hot hatch, having no petrol equivalent.

2500|$|In 1925, {{concerned}} that Martinborough {{may not receive}} what it was due in terms of transport links, the town’s administration prevailed upon the Railways Department for improved services. [...] One of the principal concerns was, given that the town was not to receive a direct rail connection as originally envisaged, that merchants and passengers in the town should not be disadvantaged by having to pay the higher rates of private transport operators compared with the cheaper railway rates {{they would have been}} able to pay had the railway come to Martinborough. [...] As an alternative to the abandoned idea of a railway line, they suggested that the Department should provide services using an electric tram, trolley bus, or light rail system. [...] The Department never seriously considered these proposals when, after examining the relevant information, it concluded that the revenue to be derived from such a service would not come close to covering the capital and operational costs involved, and that the only viable option was to use <b>petrol-powered</b> lorries and buses.|$|E

Each car had a capacity of 46 passengers and could travel at speeds of up to 18 mph. New tracks had to be re-laid for the petrol driven trams. The trams now ran on inverted U-shaped grooved-bridge rail with a four-foot gauge. The first two petrol-engined tramcars were designed by John Abbott and his son John Dixon Abbott, incorporating the Dixon-Abbott patent gearbox. They were built in England. By 1914, there were 37 <b>petrol-powered</b> tramcars running. 1945 saw {{the introduction of the}} first diesel-powered trams. Until 1955 there were still 64 <b>petrol-powered</b> trams in Karachi numbered from 94 to 157. These were single deck 4-wheeled cars with back-to-back cross benches.
