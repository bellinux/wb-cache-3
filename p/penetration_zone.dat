It was established that total zooplankton in the reservoir is being represented with 18 species belonging to Cladocera and Copepoda. Number {{of the species}} belonging to cladocer and copepod are 14 and 4, respectively. Contrary {{to the number of}} species, abundance was found to be in favor of copepods (65. 99 % of total zooplankton). Re-maining one third of total zooplankton (34. 01 %) was cladocerans. The most abundant species were determined as Bosmina longirostris among cladocerans and Thermocyclops vermifer per-sicus (Lindberg, 1936) among copepods. Monthly depth of light <b>penetration</b> <b>zone</b> (photic zone) was calculated using Secchi disk readings. It was observed that the copepods were more abundant than the cladocerans in the light <b>penetration</b> <b>zone</b> (photic zone). Beyond the light pe-netration zone the situation was reversed and the cladocerans were found to be more abundant than the copepods. Chlorophyll-a level was also examined in the lake.

It is not always possible to take into account the influence of these factors on penetration front forming within the existing models. The aim of the work was to research the penetration area forming in gas-arc welding. The research of the penetration area forming in gas-arc welding of CrNi austenitic steels was made. The parameters of the regime as well as the kind of the gaseous medium influence on the formation of the <b>penetration</b> <b>zone</b> were studied. The article shows a linear proportional relationship between the electrode feed rate and the size of the base metal plate. The penetration area formation mode for welding in argon and carbon dioxide have been worked out. Diameter, feed rate and the speed of the electrode movement have been chosen as the main input parameters. Multiple regression analysis method was used to make up the modes. The relations of the third order that make it possible to take into account the electrode metal transfer and thermal properties change of the materials to be welded were used. These relationships show quite good agreement with the experimental measurements in the calculation of the fusion zone shape with consumable electrode in argon and carbon dioxide. It was determined that the shape of the melting front curve can be shown as a generalized function in which the front motion parameters depend on feed rate and the diameter of the electrode. <b>Penetration</b> <b>zone</b> growth time is determined by the welding speed and is calculated as a discrete function of the distance from the electrode with the spacing along the movement coordinate. The influence of the mode parameters on the formation of the fusion zone has been investigated and the ways to manage and stabilize the weld pool formation have been identified. The modes can be used to develop effective ways to manage and control the welding process. Making up of the control systems as well as surfacing control involve the selection of the parameters that directly influence the formation of the melting zone as well as the use of these parameters as control signals in real time regime. The influence of the mode parameters on the formation of the fusion zone has been investigated and the ways to manage and stabilize the weld pool formation have been identified.

UUVs can be easily deployed {{in an area of}} interest such as offshore fleet operating regions and littoral <b>penetration</b> <b>zones</b> to collect critical data. In many military scenarios, collected sensor data have to be transmitted to a host station which could be a land base station, a host surface ship, a communication relay aircraft or a satellite. Since these types of missions require considerable on-station time, {{it is very important to}} perform them in an energy-optimal manner. This paper proposes a novel approach that minimizes energy consumption in collecting and communicating sensor data using a group of UUVs. Specifically, our approach determines the optimal mix of communication and vehicle repositioning for a given spatial configuration of UUVs and the location of the base station they must relay their information to. Our goal is to minimize total energy consumption which includes energies spent in underwater communications among the UUVs, the propulsions of the UUVs required to achieve communications and the RF communications conducted by surfacing UUVs to send the sensor data. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used to formulate the problem and solve it optimally under performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is very effective in reducing energy consumption required for communication activities and the solution times experienced are not excessive...|$|R

Recently emerged seminal roots were inoculated {{with a range}} of H. avenae larval densities, then transferred a hydroponic system to remove the effect of later nematode penetration on root development. Intolerance to H. avenae was assessed in terms of impairment of seminal root extension resulting in fewer primary lateral roots emerging from the seminal root below the zone of juvenile penetration. Tolerant plants infested with H. avenae had longer lateral root systems than infested intolerant plants. The decline in lateral root growth below the <b>penetration</b> <b>zone</b> was partly offset by increased growth above. This did not contribute to tolerance, however, as there were no differences between cultivars for this feature. Nematodes induced earlier nodal root emergence in all cultivars.

To improve knowledge of the metal penetration mechanism a series of test castings was performed at ITT Flygt’s foundry where the influence of chemical composition was studied. The chemical composition of the melt was changed in the ladle before pouring. The result showed that the carbon and phosphorus content had an influence on metal penetration. The metal penetration tendency decreased when decreasing the carbon content as well as when increasing the phosphorus content. The penetration areas were analysed in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Analysis (EDS). The analysis showed that the average chemical composition in the <b>penetration</b> <b>zones</b> {{was close to the}} initial composition of the alloy. Consequently, no significant macro segregation of carbon or phosphorous could be observed. The whole casting process was simulated with the software MAGMAsoftTM, in order to investigate the solidification characteristics as well as the porosity formation in the casting studied. For this, a special module for cast iron was used, MAGMAironTM, where nucleation and growth of all relevant phases are considered. During simulation it is possible to detect the areas where porosities are likely to be formed. The results show that expansion penetration generally occurs in the same areas depending on the mode of solidification. The inoculation and solidification behaviour will result in excess or deficiency of the metal at the end of solidification, which will lead to either metal penetration or formation of porosities...|$|R

The observations using light and electron microscopy revealed that the peroxisomes were predominantly spherical in shape and showed catalase activity.

Host resistance was examined at nematode attraction to and penetration of roots and nematode motility, maturation, and reproduction within roots. There {{was no significant difference}} in the rate at which P. thornei was attracted toward or penetrated resistant or susceptible roots. However, suppression of migration, juvenile maturation, and reproduction in and near resistant roots was evident, suggesting that resistance acts post penetration. No preferential root <b>penetration</b> <b>zone</b> was observed in contrast to other studies. The inhibitory compounds from resistant wheat plants appeared to be constitutively expressed and water soluble because nematode migration was suppressed in roots and root exudates of unchallenged seedlings. The effects of these compounds were reversible and affected P. thornei but not P. neglectus. Apart from migration, nematode multiplication was greatly inhibited by resistance because only a few juveniles (10 %) developed past stage three in roots of resistant compared with susceptible plants. Earlier in the life cycle, egg deposition and hatch of P. thornei were also significantly reduced in resistant roots and root exudates, suggesting the presence of hatching inhibitors.

40|$|To study {{diffusion}} and binding of polymers into surface-attached networks containing reactive groups, surface-attached polymer networks {{bound to}} oxidized silicon surfaces are generated, which contain succinimide ester groups. The surface-attached polymer layers are brought {{into contact with}} poly(ethylene glycol) s (PEG), which carry terminal amine end groups and which have systematically varied molecular weights. The coupling reaction between the active ester groups in the polymer networks and the amine groups in the incoming chains are studied by ellipsometry, surface plasmon spectroscopy, AFM, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The degree of functionalization of the reactive layers by the PEG-NH 2 depends strongly on the cross-link density of the network, the active ester content, and the molecular weight of the amine-terminated polymer.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a series of high-resolution, {{three-dimensional}} numerical experiments that investi-gate the nature of turbulent compressible convective motions extending from a convection zone into a stable layer below. In such convection, converging flows in the near-surface cellular convecting network create strong downflowing plumes that can traverse the multiple scale heights of the convection zone. Such struc-tures can continue their downward motions beyond the convecting region, piercing the stable layer, where they are decelerated by buoyancy braking. If these motions mix entropy to an adiabatic state below the con-vection zone, the process is known as penetration; otherwise it is termed overshooting. We find that in three-dimensional turbulent compressible convection at the parameters studied, motions generally overshoot a sig-nificant fraction of the local pressure scale height but do not establish an adiabatic penetrative region, even at the highest Péclet numbers considered. This is mainly due to the low filling factor of the turbulent plumes. The scaling of the overshooting depth with the relative stability S of the two layers is affected by this lack of true penetration. Only an S 1 dependence is exhibited, reflecting the existence of a thermal adjustment region without a nearly adiabatic <b>penetration</b> <b>zone.</b> Rotation about a vertical axis decreases the depth of overshoot-ing, owing to horizontal mixing induced by the rotation.

In this study, we present strong evidence that the dissolution rate {{is affected by the}} equilibrium-swelling ratio in β-lactoglobulin (βLg) gels.

This has been observed in free-swelling βLg gels using gravimetrical analysis and in the uniaxial swelling of WPC gel deposits using fluid dynamic gauging. At high dissolution pH (> 13. 3), the high Na+ concentration reduces swelling in spite of the high surface charge of the protein.

40|$|Abstract—The {{introduction}} of confocal {{laser scanning microscopy}} (CLSM) has provided a valuable new technique for the visualization of bonding structures such as a hybrid layer in dentin (Watson, 1989, 1. 991). In the case of seven commercially-available dentin bonding systems, it could be demonstrated that the CLSM renders considerably more detailed information than the SEM because of its non-destructive nature {{and because of the}} possibility of a distinction between components of bonding agents, With most of the bonding systems, measurements of the thickness of the hybrid layer could be carried out when the primer component was labeled with rhodamine B. It was found that this thickness is significantly increased by increases in etching time and only slightly decreased by increases in the drying time of the dentin and of the primer. When rhodamine B was used for dye penetration tests on four different dentin bonding systems, a leakage within the demineralized zone in the dentin was found in each of the specimens. This structure appears similar to that which Sano et al. (1995) called **nano leakage". The amount of nanoleakage could not be measured by this method. In the case of enamel or ceramic bonding, a <b>penetration</b> <b>zone</b> was found which corresponded to the etching patterns found in enamel and ceramics, respectively.

The innermost dentin caries has been reversibly attacked because the collagen matrix is not severely damaged, giving it potential for repair. The outer more superficial zone is highly infected with proteolytic degradation of the collagen matrix {{and as a result}} the dentin is irreversibly demineralised.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work CO 2 {{continuous}} laser welding process was successfully applied and optimized for joining a dissimilar AISI 316 stainless steel and AISI 1009 {{low carbon steel}} plates. Laser power, welding speed, and defocusing distance combinations were carefully selected {{with the objective of}} producing welded joint with complete <b>penetration,</b> minimum fusion <b>zone</b> size and acceptable welding profile. Fusion zone area and shape of dissimilar austenitic stainless steel with ferritic low carbon steel were evaluated {{as a function of the}} selected laser welding parameters. Taguchi approach was used as statistical design of experiment (DOE) technique for optimizing the selected welding parameters in terms of minimizing the fusion zone. Mathematical models were developed to describe the influence of the selected parameters on the fusion zone area and shape, to predict its value within the limits of the variables being studied. The result indicates that the developed models can predict the responses satisfactorily...|$|R
