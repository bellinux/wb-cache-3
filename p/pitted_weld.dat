40|$|Abstract: Several {{measurement}} modalities {{have been}} developed over the years for various nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) applications, such as ultrasonic, magnetic flux leakage, and eddy current testing, {{all of which have}} been used extensively in pipeline defect identification. While it is generally believed that different testing modalities provide complementary information, only a single testing modality is typically used for a given application. This is in part due to lack of effective, computationally feasible data fusion algorithms that are applicable to NDT&E signals. Such an algorithm capable of data fusion can combine information from two or more different sources of data, giving more insight and confidence to the data analysis than a decision that would otherwise be based on either of the sources alone. Learn++, previously introduced as an incremental learning algorithm, was applied to a NDT&E data fusion application. Specifically, we generated two ensembles of classifiers, one trained on ultrasonic signals, and the other on corresponding magnetic flux leakage signals obtained from stainless steal samples that contained five classes of discontinuities: crack, <b>pitting,</b> <b>weld,</b> mechanical damage, and no discontinuity. We have observed that the prediction ability of the automated classification system, as measured by the accuracy and reliability of the classification performance on validation data, was significantly improved when the two data sources were combined using Learn++...|$|R

The risk of these scenarios occurring can be assessed using good quality data, good quality corrosion and pitting models and structural reliability assessment. Recently, improved models for the prediction of longer term corrosion and <b>pitting</b> of <b>welds</b> have been developed and these are reviewed herein. An example illustrates the application of reliability analysis to a pipeline subject to localized corrosion. The reliability assessment includes parameters related to corrosion, pipeline dimensions and liquid flow, all treated as random variables.

40|$|Irradiated {{nuclear fuel}} has been stored and {{reprocessed}} at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory since 1953 using facilities {{located at the}} Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). This reprocessing produced radioactive liquid waste which was stored in the Tank Farm. The INTEC Tank Farm consists of eleven vaulted 300, 000 -gallon underground tanks including Tank WM- 182. Tank WM- 182 was put into service in 1955, has been filled four times, and has contained aluminum and zirconium fuel reprocessing wastes as well as sodium bearing waste. A program to monitor corrosion in the waste tanks was initiated in 1953 when {{the first of the}} eleven Tank Farm tanks was placed in service. Austenitic stainless steel coupons representative of the materials of construction of the tanks are used to monitor internal tank corrosion. This report documents the final inspection of the WM- 182 corrosion coupons. Physical examination of the welded corrosion test coupons exposed to the tank bottom conditions of Tank WM- 182 revealed very light uniform corrosion. Examination of the external surfaces of the extruded pipe samples showed very light uniform corrosion with slight indications of preferential attack parallel to extrusion marks and start of end grain attack of the cut edges. These indications were only evident when examined under stereo microscope at magnifications of 20 X and above. There were no definite indications of localized corrosion, such as cracking, <b>pitting,</b> preferential <b>weld</b> attack, or weld heat affected zone attack on either the welded or extruded coupons. Visual examination of the coupon support cables, where they were not encased in plastic, failed to reveal any indication of liquid-liquid interface attack of any crevice corrosion. Based on the WM- 182 coupon evaluations, which have occurred throughout the life of the tank, the metal loss from the tank wall due to uniform corrosion is not expected to exceed 5. 5 x 10 - 1 mil (0. 00 055 inch). For purposes of waste storage, this is a negligible amount of metal loss. Localized corrosion such as cracking, <b>pitting,</b> preferential <b>weld</b> attack, or weld heat affected zone attack is not expected to be a materials problem in the tank...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPitting {{corrosion}} {{and stress}} corrosion cracking around heat affected zone of 25 Cr 2 Ni 2 MoV rotor steel welded joint in chloridized high temperature water were studied by using U-bend specimen exposure test and electrochemical test. Different corrosion potentials were detected in various zones of welded joint with the order: heat affected zone > base metal > weld metal. By contrast, a reversed order was observed for <b>pit</b> density in <b>welded</b> joint which was partly ascribed to the galvanic effect of different zones. Stress corrosion cracks initiated from pits preferentially at the fusion line was observed because of its most complicated microstructure and highest hardness. A finite element analysis was carried out to evaluate the plastic strain distribution on the U-bend specimen.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new solid-state joining process which is energy efficient, environment friendly, and versatile 1. However, studies on galvanic corrosion of copper alloys joined by FSW are scarcely reported. In the present study, the corrosion behavior of friction welded copper plates is investigated. Identical samples were extracted from base and weld regions. Several DC and AC electrochemical measurements including OCP, potentiodynamic polarization, ZRA and EIS were carried out in conjunction with microstructural examinations. Severe plastic deformation and forging in weld region results in formation of stir bands 1. Small round pits, dissolved inclusions (mainly Cu 2 O), with less than 500 nm in size, are accumulated in stir band area. During FSW, the number of oxide inclusions is increased particularly in stir bands, shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1. SEM image of an individual stir band and <b>pits</b> in <b>weld</b> zone. Potentiodynamic polarization in 3. 5 % NaCl shows that the corrosion potential (Ecorr) difference between base and weld just after immersion is less than 10 mV where the weld owes higher potential. Near Ecorr, both anodic and cathodic activities for base sample are noticeably higher than the weld. After 4330 minutes, the Ecorr difference increases to 100 mV where the base reaches to a higher potential. This indicates that galvanic corrosion driving force raised up within the exposure time. While icorr remains almost constant in pweld, it appreciably decreases in base sample. These facts {{can be attributed to the}} formation of additional CuCl on the base surface 2...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the high}} power density and local {{temperature}} increase on nanoscopic asperities of solid metal contacts, traditional MEMS contact switches suffer from contact <b>welding,</b> <b>pitting,</b> electromigration and oxidation. Particularly, when MEMS switches are used to handle high power, solid metal contacts pose serious limitation on the contact reliability. A self-healing RF MEMS switch, which utilizes liquid gallium Contacts {{to take the place}} of the traditional solid metal-to-metal contacts, is proposed in this paper. Electrostatic actuation is Used to drive a silicon nitride bridge with upper electrodes. When the bridge is pulled down, liquid gallium droplets work as an interface between the upper and lower contact electrodes. The loss of the gallium droplets can be avoided due to the Unwettability of the material surrounding the contact electrodes. The switch is fabricated using a surface tnicromachining process. A coupled-field finite element pnalysis (FEA) is used to model the electric current, heating and thermal conduction of the contacts. The model includes deformable gallium droplets with 4 urn base diameter. The two sides of the droplets are connected to the upper and lower solid metal contact electrodes, respectively. By using the FEA models, the electric and thermal characteristics of the gallium droplets featuring a variety of geometric parameters have been studied. 1 A current handling capability of the liquid gallium pontact is verified by the FEA models.

The corrosion behavior of weldements showed a general decrease in corrosion rates in salty solutions with increasing of exposure time. The same thing happened to the weldement specimen which was exposed to the acidic solution containing (0. 5) wt%H 2 SO 4, while the corrosion rate of the weldements which exposed to the acidic solution containing (1 and 2) wt%H 2 SO 4 was dropped during the first (288 hr) of exposure then a relative increase was observed by increasing the exposure time.

40|$|The {{fatigue failure}} {{mechanisms}} of pre-corroded, laser beam welded Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy in different temper conditions (T 3,T 8) have been investigated. Aging influences the corrosion behavior of laser welds. In the T 3 temper, corrosion attack {{is in the}} form of <b>pitting</b> in the <b>weld</b> area, while in the T 8 temper corrosion {{is in the form}} of intergranular corrosion in the base metal. In the latter case corrosion is attributed to the presence of grain boundary precipitates in the base metal. Corrosion degrades the fatigue behaviour of 2139 welds. The degradation is equal for both the T 3 and T 8 tempers and for the corrosion exposure selected in this study corresponds to a 52 % reduction in fatigue limit. In both cases fatigue crack initiation is associated with corrosion pits. In the T 3 temper, the fatigue crack initiation site is at the weld metal/HAZ interface, while for the T 8 temper the initiation site is at the base metal. Fatigue crack initiation in uncorroded 2139 welds occurs at the weld toe at the root side, the weld reinforcement playing a principal role as stress concentration site. The fatigue crack propagates through the PMZ and the weld metal in all cases. Fatigue crack initiation in the corroded 2139 welds occurs exclusively at corrosion pits which act as stress raisers...|$|R

A deformed streamline structure or twin crystal in the ferrite phase can be seen near the surface or sub-surface of the perforated corrosion puncture edge.

The SEM results show that the puncture appears to have been a mode of quasi-cleavage fractures with secondary cracks along the direction of the crystal grain; thus, the failure has the features of mechanical and chemical corrosion. The corroded surface contains high amounts of O, C, and N, as well as S, Cl, Si, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ti, etc., all of which are corrosion products caused by sea water. The penetrating puncture hole at the turn of the tee pipe is likely the result of cavitation erosion accompanied by chemical/electrochemical corrosion, and the corrosion on the seam connecting the tee pipe and flange is likely the result of electrochemical corrosion...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that pitting corrosion occurs in stainless steel under the specific conditions which a corrosion factor superimposes. In cold and snowy area, welded structures on the outdoors are exposed to combinational environment of the salt damage and the freezing damage, in which the corrosive solution containing Cl- chlorine ions from the sea breeze and snow melting agents undergo freezing-thawing cycles during the winter. The cause of pitting corrosion phenomenon which occurs in the welded stainless steel under such a combinational environment has not yet been clarified. In the previous report, accelerated pitting corrosion is confirmed to have occurred as a result of concentration cell corrosion due to a local concentration of Cl- chlorine ion around a weld bead during freezing and thawing of the solution. In the present study, it is investigated that the effect of corrosive factors on the progression of <b>pitting</b> corrosion in <b>welded</b> austenitic stainless steel under freezing and thawing corrosive environment.

In addition, a section harvested from an actual furniture rack that was immersed for 14 years was analyzed for <b>pitting</b> in the <b>weld</b> and heat-affected-zone (HAZ) regions. The L Basin operations maintained very good water quality over the entire immersion period for these samples. These results for FY 2009 and FY 2011 coupons showed that the average pit depths for the 6061 and 6063 base metal are 1 and 2 mils, respectively, while those for the weld and HAZ are 3 and 4 mils, respectively. The results for the weld and HAZ regions are similar to coupons removed {{during the period of}} FY 2003 to FY 2007. These similarities indicate that the pit development occurred quickly followed by slow kinetics of increase in pit depth. For the actual furniture rack sample average pits of 5 and 2 mils were measured for the HAZ and weld, respectively. These results demonstrate that pitting corrosion of the aluminum furniture racks used to support the spent fuel occurs in waters of good quality.

40|$|Selective {{corrosion}} of type 316 L {{austenitic stainless}} steel welds during the production of organic acids resulted in losses in production due to unscheduled downtimes to perform repairs. Estimated corrosion rates of type 316 L filler material welds were {{an order of magnitude}} higher than that of the base material. Alternative higher alloyed commercial filler materials were evaluated under actual production conditions. The evaluated filler materials were types 316 L, 317 L, 309 L, 309 MoL, 2205, 2507, 625, 825 and 904 L. The effect of nitrogen on the corrosion properties of type 309 L filler material was evaluated by manipulating the nitrogen concentration of the shielding gas during MIG welding. These changes in nitrogen concentration did not influence the corrosion resistance of the type 309 L filler material. No correlation could be established between the corrosion rates, analysed chemical composition of the product and operating temperature during production. In almost all the cases where the chemical composition of the filler material was comparable with that of the base material the corrosion rates of the filler materials were higher than that base material. It might be expected that the ferrite phase with higher molybdenum and chromium should be more corrosion resistant while the austenite should be less resistant. This was, however, not the case with the corrosion of type 309 L filler material. It would thus appear that in this case nickel enrichment of the austenite phase had a larger influence on the corrosion resistance of the austenite phase than the chromium and molybdenum had on the corrosion resistance of the ferrite phase. It appears that nickel and molybdenum had the largest contribution to the corrosion resistance of stainless steels welds under these operating conditions. It is, however, believed that a certain minimum concentration of chromium is also required to provide corrosion resistance to these alloys in hot organic acid environments. In contrast with the fact that a substantial alloying content is required to improve corrosion resistance of the filler material, the small difference in composition between ferrite and austenite phases, due to micro segregation, appeared to affect the corrosion resistance on micro scale. This is illustrated by the micrographs, which show corrosion to etch out the dendrite structure. Since the morphology of the austenite and ferrite phases is so similar, it could not always be conclusively established which one of the two phases corroded selectively. Analyses performed on the austenite and ferrite phases did not indicate a concentration difference within the phases itself. However, there were significant differences in the concentration of elements between the phases, with the austenite stabilising elements reporting to the austenite phase and the ferrite stabilizing elements reporting to the ferrite phase, in line with thermodynamic predictions. In the case of the filler materials following the austenite mode of solidification, no significant concentration differences were detected within the matrix. Although all highly alloyed high nickel alloyed filler materials (types 904 L, 825 and 625) corroded at a lower rate than the type 316 L base material, type 625 filler material was the filler material of choice {{due to the lack of}} any <b>pitting</b> of the <b>weld.</b> <b>Pitting</b> was detected in both the 825 and 904 L filler materials. Galvanic corrosion was not noted at any of the weld/HAZ interfaces and in no case did the type 316 L parent metal adjacent to the weld corrode preferentially to the material further away from the weld.

Inclusions with increased content of carbon adhere on the surface and presumably have a hydrocarbon nature. Deviation from a smooth surface profile characterizes the second type of defects (holes, bumps, and pits). Some holes and bumps were found directly in the welding seam. The hot spots in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the equator welds have been partially associated with pits too.

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{site for}} the initiation of pitting on austenitic stainless steel {{has been shown to}} be sulfide inclusions and notably the manganese types of sulfides. Dissolution of inclusions has been observed and suggested to be the initial step for pit initiation, though several explanations for the mechanisms causing initiation has been proposed. Regarding welded stainless steels, several microstructural changes have been described and suggested to contribute to the decreased corrosion resistance in the weld zone. An area which has not been investigated much is the contribution of inclusions, in particular MnS inclusions, to the reduced corrosion resistance and the initiation of <b>pitting</b> in the <b>weld</b> zone. In the present work a literature review of the investigations focusing on the initiation of pitting by sulfide inclusions in austenitic stainless steels has been provided. A literature review of investigations focusing on the effects of welding on the microstructure, inclusions and the corrosion properties in the weld zone of austenitic stainless steels has also been provided. Experimental work was performed to obtain results which could be compared to or verify findings and suggestions from the reviewed literature regarding the initiation of pitting by inclusions. Observations of MnS inclusions as the preferential site for pit initiation in austenitic stainless steel was tried recreated. The hypothesis saying that dissolution of MnS inclusions occur prior to the initiation of pitting was also tried verified. It was also performed experiments to obtain results which could give knowledge about the effects of MnS inclusions on the corrosion properties and the initiation of <b>pitting</b> in the <b>weld</b> zone of an austenitic stainless steel. Along with this, the corrosion behaviour and microstructural changes in the weld zone in general and compared with the base metal were studied. A part of the work was also to study the effect of a lacking inert shielding gas during welding. Samples of a 316 L stainless steel were first examined in SEM to study the microstructure and to identify inclusions. Then, some samples were welded, followed by SEM examination. Then all samples were polarized electrochemically in synthetic seawater with the purpose of initiating pitting. After the polarization, all samples were examined in SEM again to correlate pitting attack to inclusions and to compare microstructural changes and the corrosion behaviour in the base metal and the weld zone. It was verified that the main initiation site for pitting in the base metal was MnS inclusions. It was indicated that dissolution of the MnS inclusions started the pit initiation process, with the contribution of released compounds from the inclusions. An average percent of inclusions showing an inactive behavior regarding the initiation of pitting was 38 %, verifying similar observations reported in earlier investigations. A nitric acid treatment to remove MnS inclusions improved the pitting resistance significantly. The welding caused the initiation of corrosion at lower potentials when performing electrochemical polarization in synthetic seawater. The corrosion mechanism was probably grain boundary corrosion caused by precipitation of chromium carbides in the grain boundaries. A lacking inert shielding gas during welding did not have any effect on the potential for the initiation of corrosion when comparing two samples welded with and without shielding gas. It was indicated that compositional changes had occurred for MnS inclusions in a certain distance from the fusion line. These changes may have caused the inclusions to be more prone to initiate pitting. Further investigation should be performed to clarify the behaviour of such inclusions, and their susceptibility towards the initiation of corrosion. Grain boundary corrosion in various grades had occurred in the HAZ in certain distances from the fusion line. In a further distance from the fusion line pitting-like corrosion in clusters, possibly induced by chromium depletion after forming chromium oxides combined with a thin oxide film, had occurred. The grain boundary corrosion and the pitting cluster attack are from the experimental results believed to be more important for the failure of the welded stainless steel investigated in this work, than pitting initiated at MnS inclusions changed by the welding process. </p...|$|R
40|$|Biofouling of {{surfaces}} causes numerous {{problems in}} a wide range of industries such as shipping, health care, oil and gas production and food production. Of specific interest to the current work is the accelerated corrosion of metals that can arise as a consequence of bacterial biofilm formation, which is commonly known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). The initial attachment of bacteria to a surface is one of the first steps in the process of biofouling. The attachment is dependent upon a large number of factors, which are broadly related to the properties of the bacteria, substrate/surface and environment. Changes in these properties can not only influence the initial attachment step, but also the interrelated production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by the bacteria and the subsequent corrosion. A large amount of the work performed to date on bacterial attachment in relation to MIC has focused on stainless steels, possibly due to reports of rapid failures of these materials such as through thickness <b>pitting</b> of piping <b>welds.</b> These studies have highlighted how a range of material properties (e. g. chemical composition, surface roughness, grain size and boundaries) can influence attachment and biofilm formation on steel surfaces. This range of influences means that a high level of care must be taken when designing and carrying out bacterial attachment tests in order to avoid the situation where a number of material variables affect the outcome of a single test. For example one of the criticisms of some of the previous work in this area is the lack of control of surface roughness of the substrates used in the studies. In this work we will report results of studies of the initial attachment and EPS production of E. coli bacteria on highly polished carbon steel samples, with a number of different microstructures, for a number of different test media. We have found that the microstructure and test medium can have a significant effect on the rate of bacterial attachment, the distribution of attached bacteria, the onset of EPS production and the corrosion of samples immersed in E. coli inoculated test media...|$|R
