However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. α-Fe 2 O 3 <b>polyhedrons</b> {{have been}} {{successfully}} synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal process. The average diameter of the synthesized α-Fe 2 O 3 <b>polyhedrons</b> is about 0. 8 µm. The structure and morphology of α-Fe 2 O 3 <b>polyhedrons</b> were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. And the possible formation mechanism is proposed that the α-Fe 2 O 3 <b>polyhedrons</b> are grown epitaxially from the FeOOH precursors by topotactic transformation. The experimental parameters {{play a crucial role}} in the growth of the α-Fe 2 O 3 <b>polyhedrons.</b> The results indicate that the phase and morphology of the products are greatly affected by the concentrations of disodium ethyleediamine tetracetate and NaOH in the starting solution. The magnetic properties of α-Fe 2 O 3 <b>polyhedrons</b> show weak ferromagnetic behavior with the saturation magnetization of 0. 498 emu/g, remanent magnetization of 0. 051 emu/g and coercivity of 372. 81 Oe...|$|R

5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a <b>polyhedron,</b> {{such as a}} cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a <b>polyhedron</b> with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA octahedron made from a long single strand designed to fold into the correct conformation, and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in one step, pictured {{at the top of}} this article.|$|E

Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic <b>polyhedron</b> to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any <b>polyhedron</b> that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E

In order to linearize the {{dynamics}} of the CoM, we exploit the notion of stability <b>polyhedrons</b> associated to given contact stances, inside which the existence of contact forces is guaranteed. To compute stability <b>polyhedrons,</b> we have first to specify a convex polytope inside which the center of mass's acceleration lies.

5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex <b>polyhedron,</b> the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed <b>polyhedron</b> of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E

5|$|Only the {{two largest}} regular moons have been imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular <b>polyhedron,</b> with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250km in diameter. At about 400km in diameter, it {{is larger than the}} Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus.

5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided <b>polyhedron,</b> which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E
