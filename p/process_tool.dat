40|$|The {{construction}} sector is continuously {{trying to develop}} and streamline the workflow. This is done {{to a large extent}} by digitizing and industrializing. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze how the digitizing, through an implementation of a <b>process</b> <b>tool</b> into the area of project management can improve the design work by better understanding the dependent relationships in the workflow. This study is done in cooperation with Sh Bygg in Uppsala and is based on interviews and surveys with persons involved in a project with Sh Bygg. The Focus of the study is to analyze how the technique of the <b>process</b> <b>tool</b> can be used in an early stage of a partnering project and in particularly the design work. The result is that the technique can simplify the design work and improved the understanding of how the processes are dependent of each other. The visualization of the process structure worked well and especially for the project manager, but for some persons in the project it was to general. The technique of the <b>process</b> <b>tool</b> works for intended the purpose yet {{to be able to use}} it to the full potential, the structure needs to be optimized. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} organizational collaboration report increased goal {{achievement in}} the case of collaboration but identify that developing effective collaborations is challenging. An increasing number of researchers and practitioners are applying emerging research tools such as social network analysis to study collaborations and many of those who have applied social network analysis suggest, anecdotally, that it is a useful <b>process</b> <b>tool</b> aimed at increasing understanding of collaboration and informed decision-making among collaborative members. Aims: The main objectives are to: (1) Empirically study networking and collaboration among environmental organizations in Waterloo Region; (2) Contribute to theory and practice development by examining definitions, values, and practices of organizational collaborations by local practitioners; and (3) Investigate the usefulness of social network analysis as a <b>process</b> <b>tool</b> to improve collaboration. Method: I used a sequential methods design with two phases. In Phase 1 I obtained and analyzed statistical data representing the level of networking and collaboration among local organizations. Using social network analysis, I produced sociograms (i. e., graphs) and statistical measures of the level of networking and collaboration in the Waterloo Region in 2011. In Phase 2, I conducted three open-ended semi-structured focus groups and seven interviews to discuss collaboration practice {{and the use of the}} social network analysis as a <b>process</b> <b>tool.</b> Using a systematic qualitative data analysis approach similar to grounded theory, I analyzed the different aspects related to collaboration practices and the use of social network analysis as a <b>process</b> <b>tool</b> to inform collaboration. Results: Study findings demonstrate that: (A) the majority of environmental organizations in Waterloo Region are well networked, collaborate broadly, and show a high level of cohesion; (B) environmental organizations in Waterloo Region share similar definitions of collaboration, and tend to apply many of the tasks and steps identified in the literature as good/emerging practice; and (C) social network analysis as a <b>process</b> <b>tool</b> is perceived as useful when assessing and developing organizational collaboration. Conclusion: The findings reveal that the environmental organizations in Waterloo Region have exemplary collaborative capacity through their networking and cohesion from which other geographic locations could learn. The findings also reveal that collaboration practice, to some degree, differs from theories of good/emerging collaborative practice, potentially due to the fact that theory may be too idealistic while practice may be too realistic, suggesting a need for organizations to move beyond the immediate needs (realities) toward more idealistic practice to increase their collaborative successes and for scholars to potentially adjust their theories to become more realistic and thus increase uptake. Finally, the findings suggest that network analysis has the potential to produce valuable outcomes as a <b>process</b> <b>tool.</b> These findings will be of particular interest for those studying organizational collaboration and the practitioners trying to improve effectiveness of organizational collaboration not just in the environmental field...|$|E

The third stage is an IT based intranet, which purpose is to motivate the employees to execute their activities. Through experience from our earlier paper, theory and empirical knowledge we analyse this tool to find out when digital and analogue elements respectively are beneficial to use.
