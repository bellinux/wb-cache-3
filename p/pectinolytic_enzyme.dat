These enzymes have a vast number of industrial applications in food (e.g., juice clarification, refinement of vegetables fibers, extraction of vegetables oil, curing of coffee and cocoa beans) (Silva et al. 2002; Gummadi and Panda 2003; Demir et al. 2012; Quattara et al. 2008; Pedrolli et al. 2009). biopulping of papers (Sittidilokratna et al. 2007) and textiles (Basu et al. 2009).

40|$|Abstract Background Leaf-cutting (attine) ants {{use their}} own fecal {{material}} to manure fungus gardens, which consist of leaf material overgrown by hyphal threads of the basidiomycete fungus Leucocoprinus gongylophorus that lives in symbiosis with the ants. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} the fecal droplets contain proteins that are produced by the fungal symbiont to pass unharmed through the digestive system of the ants, so they can enhance new fungus garden growth. Results We tested this hypothesis by using proteomics methods to determine the gene sequences of fecal proteins in Acromyrmex echinatior leaf-cutting ants. Seven (21 %) of the 33 identified proteins were <b>pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> that originated from the fungal symbiont and which were still active in the fecal droplets produced by the ants. We show that these enzymes are found in the fecal material only when the ants had access to fungus garden food, and we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis to show that the expression of six of these enzyme genes was substantially upregulated in the fungal gongylidia. These unique structures serve as food for the ants and are produced only by the evolutionarily advanced garden symbionts of higher attine ants, but not by the fungi reared by the basal lineages of this ant clade. Conclusions <b>Pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> produced in the gongylidia of the fungal symbiont are ingested but not digested by Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants so that they end up in the fecal fluid and become mixed with new garden substrate. Substantial quantities of <b>pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> are typically found in pathogenic fungi that attack live plant tissue, where they are known to breach the cell walls to allow the fungal mycelium access to the cell contents. As the leaf-cutting ant symbionts are derived from fungal clades that decompose dead plant material, our results suggest that their <b>pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> represent secondarily evolved adaptations that are convergent to those normally found in phytopathogens. </p...|$|R

Screening, isolation and identification of Aspergillus oryzae was done based on larger clearance zones in pectin- Congo red agar media and pectinase enzyme production was carried out inYEP media by submerged fermentation. Further production media was formulated using various fruit wastes (peels) in different compositions. Growth characteristics of the isolate and kinetics of the Exopectinase enzyme were optimized. Sapota peel in combination with groundnut oil cake (GOC) had been proved to be the best media for production of high potential Exopectinase. A oryzae has its highest enzyme activity at 500 C temperature at 4. 5 pH concentration level. It takes 60 mins of time duration to give best enzyme activity in 1. 5 % substrate concentration...|$|E
30|$|<b>Pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> {{are often}} {{utilized}} in varied industrial sectors; specifically alkaline pectinases have a prime {{role in the}} retting and degumming as they remove interlamellar pectin present between the fibers. In the present study, retting of kenaf and sunn hemp, and degumming of sunn hemp were studied by employing PGL produced by B. tequilensis SV 11 -UV 37. Although enzyme {{is a mixture of}} PGL and PG (about 18 : 1), here mentioned only PGL since PG yield is very less compared to PGL.|$|R
40|$|Theophylline pellets were {{coated with}} Eudragit® NE 30 D aqueous dispersions, {{containing}} various pectin HM/Eudragit® RL 30 D ionic complexes, using an Uni-Glatt fluidized-bed apparatus. Dissolution studies were then {{carried out on}} the coated pellets at pH 6. 0, in absence and in presence of commercial <b>pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> The theophylline release from the coated pellets, after an initial latency phase, occurred linearly {{as a function of}} time. The theophylline release rate was dependent on the pectin HM content of the complexes incorporated in the coatings. The lowest theophylline release from the coated pellets was obtained when the pectin HM content of the complexes was 20. 0 % w/w (related to Eudragit® RL), i. e. when the complexation between pectin HM and Eudragit® RL is optimal. The theophylline release from the coated pellets was slower in presence of the <b>pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> when the pectin content of complexes is higher than 20 % w/w. On the other hand, the effect of the enzymes induced an increase of the theophylline release when the pectin HM content of the coatings ranged between 10. 0 and 15. 0 % w/w (related to Eudragit® RL).

40|$|The {{interaction}} of temperature (4, 10, 18, and 30 °C), pH (6, 7, and 8), and NaCl (0, 2. 5, and 5 %) {{and their effects}} on specific growth rate, lag phase, and <b>pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> of Pseudomonas marginalis were evaluated. Response surface methodology was adapted to describe the response of growth parameters to environmental changes. To obtain good conditions of storage, the combined action of salt and temperature is necessary. At 4 °C with an NaCl concentration of 5 % and a pH of 7, the lag time was 8 days and no growth was observed at 4 °C with 5 % NaCl and a pH of 6. In the absence of salt, P. marginalis could grow regardless of temperature and pH. Pectate lyase and pectin lyase were produced by P. marginalis, while pectin methyl esterase activity was not observed in our culture conditions. The enzyme production depended on temperature, pH, and salt concentration {{but also on the}} age of the culture. <b>Pectinolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> were abundantly excreted during the stationary phase, and even at 4 °C, after 2 weeks of storage, enzyme activities in supernatant culture were sufficient to damage vegetables. Both bacterial growth and enzymatic production have {{to be taken into account}} in order to estimate correctly the shelf life of vegetables...|$|R
