50|$|Geriatric {{psychiatry}}, {{also known}} as geropsychiatry, <b>psychogeriatrics</b> or psychiatry of old age, is a subspecialty of psychiatry dealing with the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in humans with old age. After a 4-year residency in psychiatry, a psychiatrist can complete a one-year fellowship in geriatric psychiatry. As the population ages, particularly in developing countries, this field is becoming more needed. The diagnosis, treatment and management of dementia and depression are two areas of this field.|$|E
50|$|The geropsychiatric unit, {{the term}} for a hospital-based {{geriatric}} psychiatry program, was introduced in 1984 by Norman White MD, when he opened New England's first specialized program of this sort at a community hospital in Rochester, New Hampshire. White is a pioneer in geriatric psychiatry, being among the first psychiatrists nationally to achieve board certification in the field. The prefix psycho- had been proposed for the geriatric program, but White, knowing New Englanders' aversion to anything psycho- lobbied successfully for the name geropsychiatric rather than <b>psychogeriatrics.</b>|$|E

The tasks that Miller, Lipowski, and Lebowitz {{set out to}} {{accomplish}} in their jointly edited special issue of International <b>Psychogeriatrics</b> titled Delirium: Advances in Research and Clinical Practice, are threefold: to review the current major empirical findings {{in the field of}} delirium, to delineate major impediments to research productivity in this area, and to highlight those research questions that they deem worthy of immediate attention.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in individuals aged 65 years old and more {{in the general population}} has directed attention to geriatrics, a medical specialty concerned with the study, prevention and treatment of pathological conditions in the aged. Among these conditions, frequent psychiatric disturbances occur and therefore it is widely recognized the increasing role of <b>psychogeriatrics.</b> A comprehensive review of theoretical and methodological issues related with research in <b>psychogeriatrics</b> is presented. In a short introduction, {{the state of the art}} in some main areas is analyzed. It is pointed out that controversial and unsolved problems still influence the ongoing research in this field. The use of different theoretical models is discussed, taking into consideration their specific scope and drawbacks. Psychopathological phenomena in the elderly are under the influence of a variety of etiologic and pathogenic factors and the conclusion arises that an adequate conceptual framework can be provided by systemic and multifactorial models. However, in order to preserve their explicatory power, they require valid and reliable definitions of all variables involved [...] not only independent and dependent variables, but also mediating variables [...] as well as clear hypothesis on their relationships.

40|$|In {{learning}} {{to understand the}} particular problems of old age, in focusing our attention on losses and decompensation, we developed an approach which was concrete and situational rather than (life-long) developmental. In most cases, brief crisis-orientated interventions were sufficient to reduce symptomatology and restore the patient to a healthier level of functioning. Such interventions involved not only the psychogeriatric team but other health and social agencies as well. More so than in other fields of psychiatry, <b>psychogeriatrics</b> concerns itself with {{a wide spectrum of}} psychosocial factors; thus the integration of the psychogeriatric unit into the existing network of community services becomes an important concern. In February 1979, Ezrath Nashim Mental Health Center- the Institution in charge of the mental health of the population of North Jerusalem, about 100, 000 inhabitants- began a six month pilot project in <b>psychogeriatrics.</b> It has long been recognized that while psychiatric disturbances among the Jerusalem elderly were widespread, there was no specific psychiatric or geriatric agency in Jerusalem that addressed itself to this problem. Thus, a pilot program was initiated to assess the existing services in the community and to assess the need for a psychogeriatric service. Furthermore, the project intended to develop staff expertise an...|$|E

40|$|A {{healthy and}} active {{life is a}} key issue for elderly citizens, above all when {{psychological}} complications such as depression and anxiety disorders, late delusion or loneliness can be observed. Moreover, medical pathologies in elderly patients often have a multi-factorial etiology and many psychopathological dimensions and psychosocial risk factors are underestimated. From the perspective of clinical health psychology, <b>psychogeriatrics</b> could {{play an important role}} in promoting active ageing and a healthy lifestyle in elderly persons through tailored clinical approaches based on specific research and advanced professional training in this area. More research is needed in order to study which determinants affect the process of an active and functional ageing. Possible research ageing areas are: 1) evaluation of psychosocial risk-protective factors related to the individual's biography and personality. 2) Evaluation of enrichment programs and clinical protocols focused on the management of different topics such as health system areas, behavioral areas, social and physical environment areas, psychological factors and economic determinants. The goal of <b>Psychogeriatrics</b> endeavors to develop and evaluate interventions designed to stimulate improvement in friendship, self-esteem and subjective well-being, as well as to reduce loneliness among older citizens. 3) Evaluation of self-management programs in chronic disease conditions (such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking), that could enhance risk factors for health in elderly citizens. Typical key elements of self-management, such as decision making, problem solving, motivation, self-efficacy, resource utilization, and citizen's empowerment have to be studied...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine some aspects of the criterion-related {{validity}} of the Nursing-Care Dependency (NCD) scale. This 15 -item counting scale has recently been developed for assessing the care dependency of demented or mentally handicapped in-patients. Its criterion-related validity was investigated by studying the relationship between the Nursing-Care Dependency scale, the Rating Scale for Elderly Patients (RSEP), the Behavior Observation Scale for Intramural <b>Psychogeriatrics</b> (BOSIP) and the Scale for Social Functioning (SSF). Data were collected from 322 demented and 105 mentally handicapped patients using the mentioned instruments. High correlations were found between NCD and RSEP, and NCD and SSF. There was a low relationship between the NCD sumscore and BOSIP subscales-scores. The NCD was able to purposefully distinguish diagnostic groups of demented patients when an external criterion was used. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Based on an {{examination}} of the relevant literature, this article presents a survey of psychosocial models used in the psychogeriatric field. Models with a multidimensional approach to behavior problems in dementia and a focus on the individual were selected. The utility of these psychosocial models as a theoretical framework for emotion-oriented care for people with dementia, especially Alzheimer disease, is examined. In addition to describing the models, this article also reports on the target group for which these models were developed, {{the degree to which they}} have been operationalized for <b>psychogeriatrics,</b> and the degree to which they have been subjected to empirical testing. This study shows that all psychosocial models described may be called emotion-oriented, although they also contain, in varying degrees, elements from the consequences model. It was found that the models are used not only as a theoretical framework for research, but also in the provision of care. Despite the fact that most models have been used in the psychogeriatric field, therefore proving their practicability for psychogeriatric practice. only one of the models described has been tested empirically so far. The theoretical validity of the models in question is, therefore. not yet clear...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural disturbances, such as nocturnal restlessness and wandering, {{are seen}} in 90 % of {{patients}} with dementia {{at some point in}} their course. Non-pharmacologic interventions, such as high intensity lighting, can play an important role in managing these behavioural disturbances by impacting both the visual and the circadian system. In order to assess the behavioural and physiological effects of prolonged exposure to high intensity light on institutionalised older adults with dementia, ceiling-mounted luminaires emitting bluish (6, 500 K) and yellowish (2, 700 K) light (about 1, 800 lx horizontal on table level) were installed in an intervention group (n= 15) that was compared to a control group of traditional dim lighting equipment (n= 10). The study was performed from May to August 2006. Effects of lighting were assessed by the Dutch Behaviour Observation Scale for Intramural <b>Psychogeriatrics</b> (GIP), and tympanic temperature measurements. In the bluish light scenario, a significant improvement in restless behaviour was observed in the intervention group, as well as a significant increase in the range of tympanic temperature.

40|$|A {{committee}} of experts from the Italian Association of <b>Psychogeriatrics</b> compiled the following report, which was then approved by a Steering Committee (comprising 20 specialists in neurology, psychiatry or geriatrics) from the Association and by two Alzheimer associations representing patients and families: the Italian Association for Alzheimer's Disease and the Italian Federation for Alzheimer's Disease. The report {{is based on a}} comprehensive review of the scientific literature on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, discusses methodological aspects of dementia management, and details the limitations of current therapies. These guidelines are, in general, consistent with the principles of evidence-based medicine; however, for some controversial or poorly investigated issues, the guidelines integrate scientific evidence with experience and opinions from experts working in the clinical setting. In particular, the clinical experience of experts has been used to define recommendations for starting and interrupting pharmacotherapy, and to critically review evidence about the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions. The principal pharmacotherapeutic interventions covered in the guidelines are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine) and memantine. The main non-pharmacological interventions reviewed are memory training, reality orientation therapy, and combined non-pharmacological interventions. Other issues covered are opportunities for Alzheimer's disease prevention, various modalities of care, and the treatment of comorbidities...|$|E

40|$|In August 1984, an {{outbreak}} of Salmonella at Stanley Royd Psychiatric Hospital in Yorkshire led {{to the deaths of}} 19 elderly residents. It was an incident that attracted a good deal of comment in both the local and national press, and one that had enduring relevance for ideas about psychiatric care, food handling and catering provisions, hospital management and the official inspection of medical institutions. This article examines the impact that the 1984 outbreak had on official and popular perceptions of these issues. As well as bringing to public attention the fact that large numbers of vulnerable elderly patients were long-term residents in psychiatric hospitals, the Salmonella outbreak highlighted the inadequacies of Victorian hospital buildings in modern healthcare. Throughout the press reports and official investigations examined here, the provenance of Stanley Royd was repeatedly emphasised; its Victorian fabric persistently interfered with cleaning regimes, cold storage facilities and the conveyance of food to patients. Within institutions like Stanley Royd, ‘new’ and ‘old’ risks came together—the microscopic bacterium and the crumbling nineteenth-century building—to create a strong critique of existing psychiatric care. The episode also highlighted broader problems within the NHS, such as systems of management and the status of <b>psychogeriatrics</b> as a specialism...|$|E
