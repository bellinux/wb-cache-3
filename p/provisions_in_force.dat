Since the Slovenian tax legislation has no general provisions for such cases, the jurisprudence has decided to either apply the <b>provisions</b> that were <b>in</b> <b>force</b> at the date that tax obligation occurred or <b>provisions</b> that were <b>in</b> <b>force</b> during the tax period to which the tax liability relates. The author is a bit critical of that position because he finds it inadequate to some extent. Therefore he suggests an amended interpretation which takes into account provisions of the Slovenian constitution and practice of the Slovenian Constitutional Court. In conclusion, the author proposes an amendment of the Slovenian tax legislation with the enactment of a general provision that would resolve such legal situations. ...|$|R
