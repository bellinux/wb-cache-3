Simultaneous to substrate oxidation, they convert 2-oxglutarate, also known as alpha-ketoglutarate, into succinate and CO2. 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases bind substrates in a sequential, ordered manner. First, 2-oxoglutarate coordinates with an Fe(II) ion bound to a conserved 2-histidinyl-1-aspartyl/glutamyl triad of residues present in enzymatic center. Subsequently, the <b>primary</b> <b>substrate</b> enters the binding pocket and lastly dioxygen binds to the enzyme-substrate complex. Oxidative decarboxylation then generates a ferryl intermediate coordinated to succinate, which serves to oxidize the bound <b>primary</b> <b>substrate.</b> Succinate may interfere with the enzymatic process by attaching to the Fe(II) center first, prohibiting the binding of 2-oxoglutarate. Thus, via enzymatic inhibition, increased succinate load can lead to changes in transcription factor activity and genome-wide alterations in histone and DNA methylation.|$|E

50|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} and medial forebrain bundle {{has been}} the most-frequently-studied brain-stimulation reward site, particularly in studies {{of the effects of}} drugs on brain stimulation reward. The neurotransmitter system that has been most-clearly identified with the habit-forming actions of drugs-of-abuse is the mesolimbic dopamine system, with its efferent targets in the nucleus accumbens and its local GABAergic afferents. The reward-relevant actions of amphetamine and cocaine are in the dopaminergic synapses of the nucleus accumbens and perhaps the medial prefrontal cortex. Rats also learn to lever-press for cocaine injections into the medial prefrontal cortex, which works by increasing dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens. Nicotine infused directly into the nucleus accumbens also enhances local dopamine release, presumably by a presynaptic action on the dopaminergic terminals of this region. Nicotinic receptors localize to dopaminergic cell bodies and local nicotine injections increase dopaminergic cell firing that is critical for nicotinic reward. Some additional habit-forming drugs are also likely to decrease the output of medium spiny neurons as a consequence, despite activating dopaminergic projections. For opiates, the lowest-threshold site for reward effects involves actions on GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, a secondary site of opiate-rewarding actions on medium spiny output neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Thus GABAergic afferents to the mesolimbic dopamine neurons (<b>primary</b> <b>substrate</b> of opiate reward), the mesolimbic dopamine neurons themselves (<b>primary</b> <b>substrate</b> of psychomotor stimulant reward), and GABAergic efferents to the mesolimbic dopamine neurons (a secondary site of opiate reward) form the core of currently characterized drug-reward circuitry.|$|E

On mixed sediments live barna-cles share <b>primary</b> <b>substrates</b> (shells and gravel) with numerous empty barnacle tests, 7 % of which had drill holes of an unidentified origin.

The abundance of drilled empty tests in the field correlated with that of Boreotrophon. A year-long caging experiment clearly confirmed predation, showing the highest barnacle mortality and proportion of drilled tests in whelk enclosures, and the lowest — in predator exclosure treatments. Boreotrophon preferred the barnacles attached to conspecifics to those from <b>primary</b> <b>substrates.</b> Because of its scarcity Boreotrophon had a minor direct effect on bar-nacle abundance in the field. Yet, initially defaunated empty tests and live barnacles devel-oped markedly different macrobenthic assemblages, suggesting a strong indirect effect of the predation. Juvenile Boreotrophon were 5 - 6 times less abundant in open and partial cages than in exclosures and enclosures, which indicates that the recruitment and, conse-quently, the abundance of Boreotrophon and its predation on Balanus are top-down con-trolled by apex predators. In contrast, in tropical and temperate intertidal the predation on barnacles is stronger and primarily limited by environmental stress and prey availability...|$|R
50|$|Co-metabolism {{is defined}} as the {{simultaneous}} degradation of two compounds, in which the degradation of the second compound (the secondary substrate) depends on the presence of the first compound (the <b>primary</b> <b>substrate).</b> This is in contrast to simultaneous catabolism, where each substrate is catabolized.

They do this by producing methane monooxygenase, an enzyme which is known to oxidize numerous compounds, including pollutants such as chlorinated solvents, via co-metabolism.
