40|$|Based on the {{decoupled}} {{control method}} of levitation and thrust {{forces in a}} single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM), a compact combined-levitation-and-propulsion SLIM Maglev vehicle can be realized without any additional levitation magnet. When the vehicle runs, the levitation and <b>propulsion</b> <b>forces</b> varies depending on the phase of primary current because of the short primary end effect. Especially the fluctuation of the levitation force causes the vertical vibration of the vehicle. To realize a high performance levitation and propulsion control by only SLIM, these fluctuations must be restrained. In this paper, levitation and <b>propulsion</b> <b>forces</b> were analyzed by using space harmonic analysis method and combined-levitation-and-propulsion control taking the fluctuation of the levitation and <b>propulsion</b> <b>forces</b> into consideration was proposed.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Ljungström rig, besides the simplicity and safety, is in the engineer's knowledge of fluid dynamics. The mast is rotated so that the sail rests on the mast at lee. This is to minimize turbulent flow on the leeward side of the mast and the <b>propulsion</b> <b>force,</b> which is so important, becomes almost undisturbed. This was totally new for that time and made a boat with Ljungström rig point higher than its contemporary competitors. Today profiled masts addresses this problem, but hardly more efficiently. The real showpiece,however, is at full run where the two sails separate as butterfly wings, sheeted on each side, similar to a spinnaker, but with no extra booms or guys needed.|$|E
50|$|Ships {{and boats}} are usually steered with a rudder. Depending {{on the size}} of the vessel, rudders can be {{manually}} actuated, or operated using a servomechanism, or a trim tab/servo tab system. Boats using outboard motors steer by rotating the entire drive unit. Boats with inboard motors sometimes steer by rotating the propeller pod only (i.e. Volvo Penta IPS drive). Modern ships with diesel-electric drive use azimuth thrusters. Boats driven by oars (i.e. rowing boats, including gondolas) or paddles (i.e. canoes, kayaks, rafts) are steered by generating a higher <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> on the side of the boat opposite of the direction of turn. Jet skis are steered by weight-shift induced roll and water jet thrust vectoring. Water skis and surfboards are steered by weight-shift induced roll only.|$|E

An advantageous side effect is that the sails are kept in optimal angle towards the apparent wind and deliver optimal <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> by that. Even in sailboats running under engine, the self steering gear {{can be used to}} keep the boat heading into the wind to easily set or change sails (exception: sheet-to-tiller principle).As wind direction sensors are used a) a wind vane mounted on an axis being tilted more or less towards the horizon (wind vane self-steering)b) the pressure of the wind in the sail(s) and by that the force on the sheet (sheet to tiller self-steering).|$|E

50|$|Rowing is a cyclic (or intermittent) form of {{propulsion}} {{such that}} in the quasi-steady state {{the motion of the}} system (the system comprising the rower, the oars, and the boat), is repeated regularly. In order to maintain the steady-state propulsion of the system without either accelerating or decelerating the system, the sum of all the external forces on the system, averaged over the cycle, must be zero. Thus, the average drag (retarding) force on the system must equal the average <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> on the system. The drag forces consist of aerodynamic drag on the superstructure of the system (components of the boat situated above the waterline), as well as the hydrodynamic drag on the submerged portion of the system. The propulsion forces are the forward reaction of the water on the oars while in the water. Note also that the oar can be used to provide a drag force (a force acting against the forward motion) when the system is brought to rest.|$|E

Those aspects had also {{an important role in}} the agitated public debates in which Korn participated. Ahead of his time, following educationalist concepts that would be universally acknowledged in the 1950s, he remarked the need of make the student, as an active and creative subject, the center of the educationalist process. In La Reforma Universitaria (1919), he wrote:The Reform is a dynamic process, and its purpose is creating a new University spirit and giving the University back its lost prestige, being conscious of its mission and dignity. In order to attain so, the student’s participation in the University’s government is essential. They, and only they, represent the <b>propulsion</b> <b>force,</b> the efficient action, capable of moving inertia and avoid stagnation. Without them, nothing has been done, and nothing would have been done. The way in which they must intervene, that’s a secondary issue; the important thing is to make sure that they constitute such a power, that nothing will be done without it. We have announced the advent of an intense ethical and aesthetical culture, purely Argentine, noble because of its yearning of social justice; a culture meant to exceed, without harming Science, an intellectualist and utilitarianist age. It is pleasing to observe the youth looking for the light of new ideals through different paths. A free cathedra surrounded by free students, who own and are responsible for their acts, will contribute towards forging the national character in a better way than the wordy tutelage of those who never even had strength of character themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Rowing {{boats are}} {{designed}} for speed, not manoeuvrability, so steering requires effort. Coxswains may steer with either the tiller (a cable connected to the rudder), commands for increased [...] "pressure" [...] or strength from rowers {{on one side of}} the boat, or both, depending on what is necessary in the situation. In the most extreme cases, the coxswain may go [...] "full tiller", turning the rudder to its maximum angle, and may enlist the rowers to help the boat turn faster. This technique is usually reserved for only the sharpest turns, as the sharp angle of the rudder increases drag and upsets the balance of the boat. For more conventional turns, the coxswain may move the tiller slightly to one side or the other over the course of a few strokes. To minimize disturbance of the boat's stability, the motion of the tiller must be smooth and not sudden. The coxswain may also initiate the turn during the drive phase of the stroke, when the propulsive force of the oar blades in the water helps stabilize the boat. For very small steering adjustments, the coxswain may move the tiller very subtly during the recovery phase of a single stroke. This technique is most effective at higher speeds and on straight courses, and must be used discreetly since motion of the tiller during the recovery can easily disturb the boat's balance. Some coxswains advocate that the rudder should be applied only during the drive phase (and centered during the recovery phase), citing the fact that the boat is most stable when the oars are in the water and least stable when the oars are out of the water. The technique that often accompanies this view involves repeatedly moving the rudder back and forth over several strokes, making sure that the rudder is centered before every recovery. However, the rudder has much less steering power during the drive phase because of the very large forward <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> it must overcome. As a result, this technique often causes more boat drag due to longer rudder use, and the back-and-forth motion of the rudder tends to rock the boat.|$|E
40|$|Background: Efficiency in manual {{wheelchair}} propulsion is low, as is {{the fraction}} of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> that is attributed to the moment of propulsion of the wheelchair. In this study we tested the hypothesis that a tangential <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> direction leads {{to an increase in}} physiological cost, due to (1) the sub-optimal use of elbow flexors and extensors, and/or (2) the necessity of preventing of glenohumeral subluxation. Methods: Five able-bodied and 11 individuals with a spinal cord injury propelled a wheelchair while kinematics and kinetics were collected. The results were used to perform inverse dynamical simulations with input of (1) the experimentally obtained <b>propulsion</b> <b>force,</b> and (2) only the tangential component of that force. Findings: In the tangential force condition the physiological cost was over 30 % higher, while the tangential <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> was only 75 % of the total experimental force. According to model estimations, the tangential force condition led to more co-contraction around the elbow, and a higher power production around the shoulder joint. The tangential <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> led to a significant, but small 4 % increase in necessity for the model to compensate for glenohumeral subluxation, which indicates {{that this is not a}} likely cause of the decrease in efficiency. Interpretation: The present findings support the hypothesis that the observed force direction in wheelchair propulsion is a compromise between efficiency and the constraints imposed by the wheelchair-user system. This implies that training should not be aimed at optimization of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>force,</b> because this may be less efficient and more straining for the musculoskeletal system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In trajectory-based loads, the {{structural}} engineer treats each {{point on the}} trajectory as a load case. Distributed aero, inertial, and <b>propulsion</b> <b>forces</b> are developed for {{the structural}} model which are equivalent to the integrated values of the trajectory model. Free-body diagrams are then used to solve for the internal forces, or loads, that keep the applied aero, inertial, and <b>propulsion</b> <b>forces</b> in dynamic equilibrium. There are several advantages to using trajectory-based loads. First, consistency is maintained between the integrated equilibrium equations of the trajectory analysis and the distributed equilibrium equations of the structural analysis. Second, the structural loads equations {{are tied to the}} uncertainty model for the trajectory systems analysis model. Atmosphere, aero, propulsion, mass property, and controls uncertainty models all feed into the dispersions that are generated for the trajectory systems analysis model.

In the present study, non-contact supports are generated using {{the effect of the}} static pressure force produced by a squeezed air film. The linear slider is supported at just two of its ends. Applying a different excitation amplitude to the two transducers leads to a difference in the floating height {{at either end of the}} slider due to the different air-film thicknesses.

Our method uses both the static and radio frequency (RF) magnetic field inherently available in MRI to generate <b>propulsion</b> <b>force.</b> The <b>propulsion</b> <b>force</b> is produced by a swimming tail containing waving beam consisting of three coils in a row. Alternating current in the coils acting on the static magnetic field of the MRI will generate waving movement to produce a <b>propulsion</b> <b>force.</b> RF magnetic field will provide power to generate the alternating currents in the coils.
