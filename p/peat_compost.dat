40|$|Most gaseous {{emissions}} from {{waste water treatment}} plants, industrial operations, and solids handling facilities, consist of contaminant mixtures rather than pure chemicals. In the literature, several {{studies have been conducted}} on biological treatment of {{gaseous emissions}} using either naturally bioactive media (soil, <b>peat,</b> <b>compost,</b> etc.) in biofilters or synthetic support media in biotrickling filters. Generally, these studies have relied on single contaminants. However, previous studies, conducted by the author, on biodegradation of mixtures in liquid phase, has shown that biodegradation rates for mixtures are quite different than single contaminants, mainly due to either synergistic or antagonist relationships between the main bacterial species responsible for the degradation of the various compounds. In this paper, a systematic study was initiated to understand biodegradation of gaseous contaminant mixtures in biotrickling filters and develop theoretical models that would provide avenues for extending pure compound studies to compound mixtures. This understanding is very important since there are hundreds of gaseous contaminants which can constitute million sof gaseous contaminant mixtures, and it is impossible to experimentally determine the biotreatment kinetics of every possible mixture combination.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The paper {{focuses on}} the {{operation}} of a pilot plant with four biofilters operated in parallel for determining the suitability of coconut fiber, <b>peat,</b> <b>compost</b> from the digested sludge of a wastewater treatment plant and pine leaves as packing materials for biofiltration of toluene. Physical characteristics of packing materials such as specific surface area, density, pore size and elemental composition were determined for each packing material. Biological activity and packing capabilities related to toluene removal were determined during the startup and operation of the four biofilters under different conditions of nutrients, watering and inlet air relative humidity supply. Nutrient addition was key in improving removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) of biofilters. Feeding of medium with nutrients increased the RE and the EC {{by a factor of}} 2 to 4 than these found when supplying only tap water. Additionally, when extra nitrogen was supplied in the medium, RE and EC increased by a factor of 2. Nutrient addition also lead to a microbial population change from bacterial to fungal biofilters. It was denoted that watering control is necessary to improve fungal biofilters performance in terms of ensuring a proper washout of acidic by-products to avoid fungi inhibition and consequent lowered removal capacities. ...|$|E

Therefore, {{the effect of}} the duration of irrigation on the quality and yield of seed of two cultivars of dwarf green bean ('Larma' and 'Montano', Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was studied during fall and spring in Greece. Seeds were sown on 11 Sept. 2000 (fall crop) and 23 Feb. 2001 (spring crop) in <b>peat</b> <b>compost</b> and when the plants had two expanded leaves (11 and 20 days after sowing, respectively), they were transplanted to the soil of an unheated, plastic-covered greenhouse. The following irrigation treatments were applied: 1) irrigation for the entire duration (control), 2) irrigation until the first pods were dry, 3) irrigation until approximate to 50 % of the pods had filled, and 4) irrigation till flowering. Fall cultivation was not suitable for seed production due to low yield and reduced seed quality. By contrast, the spring crop had a higher yield, seed size and good germination. Stopping irrigation of the spring crop at the drying of the first pods achieved an approximate to 20 % saving in water without significantly affecting seed yield or quality. Earlier discontinuation of irrigation to achieve greater savings of water caused a reduction in yield, but did not affect seed quality...|$|E

In contrast, total N decreased with increasing proportions of wheat straw and rice hull composts with 100 % rice hull compost having a total N concentration close to 0 (Fig.  2 c). This indicated the higher N content of peat, on average, compared to wheat straw and rice hulls. Concentrations of P and K {{increased with}} increasing proportions of guar, jantar, and wheat straw composts, and, while 50 % guar, jantar, and wheat straw compost blends had statistically similar amounts of P, 100 % guar had the greatest concentration of P and K overall. Concentrations of P and K were not greatly affected by varying proportions of rice hull compost, and remained slightly lower than that of the 100 % peat control (Fig.  2 d, e). Concentrations of Fe and B remained similar to the 100 % peat control across all proportions of guar and jantar composts and decreased with increasing proportions of wheat straw and rice hull composts (Fig.  2 f, g). This indicated the relatively lower levels of Fe and B to be found in wheat straw and rice hulls as compared to peat. The pattern of Fe and B was similar for Zn, except Zn only decreased {{with the addition of}} wheat straw compost up to 50 %, but had a similar Zn concentration in 100 and 10 % wheat straw compost blends (Fig.  2 h).

30|$|Baker et al. (1998) {{surmised that}} the primary benefit of a {{treatment}} system including a P-retaining substrate {{is that it can}} achieve desired levels of P-attenuation regardless of site conditions. They also stressed that such a system can also accumulate P in a finite and accessible volume of filter media, thus making the material available for collection. This implies that the substrate is placed in the system {{in such a way that}} it would be easy to replace, when saturation is achieved. Baker et al. (1998) have suggested a number of placements of filter media in different kinds of on-site treatment systems. They suggested, for instance, a filter media be placed as a horizontal treatment layer within conventional septic system tile beds, incorporation of the filter media as a module after primary treatment or filter media installed as a treatment barrier. Another possibility is to use the substrate as bed media in a CW, which has been suggested by several researchers and also investigated by several scientists. Also, from another practical point of view, substrata-based systems are preferred to soil-based ones. Mann (1990) stressed that filter substrates are more advantageous to use due to their high hydraulic conductivity, e.g. they are less likely to clog or block than are systems based on soil containing high levels of clay or silt. This is of importance because hydraulic conductivity affects the P sorption. In percolating on-site system, the sorption media that have been studied include, but are not limited to, sawdust, <b>peat,</b> <b>compost,</b> zeolite, wheat straw, newspaper, sand, limestone, expanded clay, wood chips, wood fibers, mulch, glass, ash, pumice, bentonite, tire crumbs, expanded shale, oyster shells, and soy meal hulls (Hossain et al. 2010 a, b; Xuan et al. 2009). This approach was adjudged to have ‘‘green’’ implications because of the inclusion of recycled material as part of the material mixture, promoting treatment efficiency and cost effectiveness (Hossain et al. 2010 a).|$|E

End of nursery period, {{a sufficient number}} of 14 day old seedlings of each grafting method were transplanted in large pots filled with a mixture of <b>peat</b> <b>compost</b> and vermiculite (3 : 1). The plants were split in three equal groups and in the following 14 days each group was periodically irrigated with equal amounts of respectively tap water or saline water (50 mM NaCl and 100 mM NaCL). The relative growth rate (RGR) and its components; net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf area ratio (LAR), root relative growth rate (RRGR), stem elongation rate (SER) and leaf expansion relative rate (LER) were computed for each experimental plot. Additionally to that, equal weights of fresh roots from seedlings of both grafting methods were washed out carefully with tap water and immersed into equal quantities of methanol. Several diluted solutions (10 % vol/vol, 15 % vol/vol and 20 % vol/vol) were prepared from each root extracts, parallel with control solutions (0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 ppm) of artificial cytokinins, and used as rooting medium for 20 day old cuttings of tepary bean (Phaseoulus acutifolius). The average number of root nodes and lateral roots as well as the average length of lateral roots of tepary bean cuttings was used to indicate the difference between RPSG and SG seedlings regarding the nature and quantity of growth hormones extracted from the fresh rootstock roots. A significantly higher relative growth rate was found for root pruned splice grafted seedlings after transplanting, mostly due to higher net assimilation rate, as well as a higher root relative growth rate indicating a faster stand establishment rate for RPSG seedlings. Generally speaking, the relative growth rate of transplanted seedlings was drastically reduced due to the increase of nutrient solution salinity. However, significantly higher values were recorded for root pruned splice grafted seedlings compared to splice grafted ones. The same was true regarding root relative growth rate, stem elongation rate and leaf expansion rate. A higher concentration of cytokinins, was indicated by a higher rooting index of Phaseoulus acutifolius, from the extracts of RPSG seedlings and to that is attributed their significantly higher stand establishment rate...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Miniature rose (Rosa hybrida) {{are well}} {{known as one of}} the world’s most popular {{ornamental}} plants cultivated worldwide as potted and/or bed plants. Nowadays, more than 100 million pots of miniature roses are propagated by stem cutting in the commercial greenhouses of European countries such as Denmark and Germany. Some treatments such as application of plant growth regulators and suitable rooting medium could be required for accelerating root formation in rose cuttings. Using plant growth regulators like natural or synthetic auxin is a pre-requirement for the initiation of adventitious root in some stem cuttings and it has been reported that the division of the first initiator cells of root depends on internal or synthetic auxin. Methods of application of these chemicals and suitable concentration could be related to several factors, importantly the plant varieties, type of cuttings and the time of cutting preparation. Various kinds of media such as soil, peat moss, perlite and vermiculite are used as bed substrate according to required ratio. Rooting media must provide appropriate moisture and air ventilation for cuttings establishment, which highly affect the cuttings root formation. Appropriate procedure for using wastes materials as culture bed, especially those materials that produced locally, is main aim of some studies to find an alternative medium in ornamental pot plant production. In this regards, evaluation of agricultural wastes to be used to culture bed and introducing suitable materials could be considered. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of two types of plant growth regulators and bed combinations on rooting percentage of semi-hardwood cuttings in miniature rose. Materials and Methods: In order to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA) and naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA), and two media with different composition on root formation of miniature rose stem cutting, this research was carried out as a factorial on the basis of randomized complete design (RCD) with three replications. Plant growth regulators including IBA at concentrations of 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mgl- 1, concentrations of NAA at 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mgl- 1 were applied together with two types of rooting media. Media including mixing volume of perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2, and perlite, peat and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 were mixed and applied in this experiment. Using SAS software, data was analyzed based on a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis and tested by least significant difference (LSD) at (P-value< 0. 05). Results and Discussion: Results showed that the highest rooting percentage of cuttings was obtained with 2000 mgl- 1 of IBA, while no significant effect of NAA treatment and different rooting media on percentage of rooting was revealed. The two-fold and three-fold interaction of treatments on other measured traits such as primary and secondary root number and root diameter were significant. The two-fold interaction of NAA treatments and rooting media on the trait of primary root number were no significant. The highest root number and root diameter measured in medium containing perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 for cutting received combined plant growth regulators. Conclusions: Compost, the final product of organic residues degradation, improves soil physical characteristics such as soil aggregate formation and stability, water penetration, porosity, compressing resistance and nutrients availability. As well, it improves soil biological characteristics and in result, integration of compost with soil can increase growth, yield and quality of crop. There are also some evidences that in contrast of <b>peat,</b> <b>compost</b> contains plant growth regulators improved plant growth and development. Totally, considering our obtained results, in order to accelerate rooting formation in miniature rose cuttings, treatment of cuttings with synthetic plant growth regulators in medium containing perlite: tea wastes compost: sand (2 : 2 : 1) under alternate mist system is recommended. Organic materials activate root area as well as improving fertility of soil. They also play a role in supplying and releasing absorbable nutrients, root establishment, enhancing field capacity, reducing evaporation from soil surface and reducing expenses. Therefore, we emphasize on appropriate using of these components in order to obtain better productivity...|$|E

This study evaluated the performance of locally available bulking agents (i. e., NL sawdust and <b>peat)</b> during MSW <b>composting</b> in a bench-scale system. Physiochemical (temperature, oxygen uptake rate, pH, electrical conductivity, moisture and ash content, and C/N ratio) and biological (enzyme activities and germination index) parameters were monitored to evaluate compost maturity and stability.

In sawdust composting, higher temperature and oxygen uptake rate (OUR) were observed in the third week of composting, and higher enzyme activities in the second week. Sawdust composting generated a higher germination index, indicating higher maturity. Conclusions: Both sawdust and peat are effective bulking agents for the bench-scale composting.

Composted biowaste could provide such an alternative. An additional advantage of (partially) replacing <b>peat</b> by <b>compost</b> is the increased disease suppressiveness. In this study, nine commercial composted biowastes were tested for disease suppressiveness using the pathosystems Pythium ultimum-cucumber, Phytophthora cinnamomi-lupin and Rhizoctonia solani-carrot. Increased disease suppression was found in compost-amended potting mixes for all three pathosystems. The level of disease suppression ranged from slight stimulation of disease to strong suppression.

In this paper, solid-state 13 C NMR data pertaining {{to changes in the}} chemical composition of a diverse range of natural organic materials, including wood, <b>peat,</b> <b>composts,</b> forest litter layers, and organic materials in surface layers of mineral soils, were reviewed with the objective of deriving an index of the extent of decomposition of such organic materials based on changes in chemical composition. Chemical changes associated with the decomposition of wood varied considerably and were dependent on a strong interaction between the species of wood examined and the species composition of the microbial decomposer community, making the derivation of a single general index applicable to wood decomposition unlikely. For the remaining forms of natural organic residues, decomposition was almost always associated with an increased content of alkyl C and a decreased content of O-alkyl C. The concomitant increase and decrease in alkyl and O-alkyl C contents, respectively, suggested that the ratio of alkyl to O-alkyl carbon (A/O-A ratio) may provide a sensitive index of the extent of decomposition. Contrary to the traditional view that humic substances with an aromatic core accumulate as decomposition proceeds, changes in the aromatic region were variable and suggested a relationship with the activity of lignin-degrading fungi. The A/O-A ratio did appear to provide a sensitive index of extent of decomposition provided that its use was restricted to situations where the organic materials were derived from a common starting material. In addition, the potential for adsorption of highly decomposable materials on mineral soil surfaces and the impacts which such an adsorption may have on bioavailability required consideration when the A/O-A ratio was used to assess the extent of decomposition of organic materials found in mineral soils...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{document}} {{discussed a}} biofilter packing with complex filler, which was inoculated {{by a kind}} of toluene-degrading microorganism. The toluene-degrading microorganism(JBJ- 3), which was isolated from activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant of refinery, was classified as Pseudomonas sp. initially by physiological and biochemical tests. The removal efficiency of JBJ- 3 reached to 93. 73 % for 48 h. Complex filler consisted of wood chip, <b>peat</b> and <b>compost</b> etc. It has high amounts of organic matter, high specific surface area, good water holding capacity, good permeability, varied microbial system, and contains intrinsic nutrients. The complex filler could inoculate Pseudomonas sp. JBJ- 3 well. And under the different inlet concentrations of toluene, the overall removal efficiency had reached above 92 %. And the biofilter packing complex filler showed a good resistance to shock load...|$|R
