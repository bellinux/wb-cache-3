50|$|Cylinder walls {{can become}} very worn or damaged from use. If {{the engine is}} not {{equipped}} with replaceable sleeves {{there is a limit}} to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced. In such cases where the use of a sleeve or liner can restore proper clearances to an engine. Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable. A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop. The engine block is mounted on a <b>precision</b> <b>boring</b> machine where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference fit. The sleeves can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a shrink fit. This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily. When the engine block cools down it shrink fits around the sleeve holding it into place. Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine. When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system. Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and honed to match the piston. Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper ring seating at break in.|$|E

40|$|Traditional finishing, like grinding, {{particularly}} in the machining of hardened parts, requires the consumption of {{a significant amount of}} coolant. This is harmful for the environment. Besides this, more initiatives were taken in process planning to improve the process economy and flexibility. Reduction of machining cost and time {{is one of the most}} important factors in development of new technologies. In the 70 s, preliminary research studies were done to develop hard turning process as new technology which can fulfill the same requirements as grinding. With the development of advanced machine tools and PCBN cutting tools, in the 90 s the application of hard turning also became available for the industry. It has been already proved that hard turning is capable technology in cutting of hardened steels however, there are few results regarding to bore manufacturing. Therefore, the replace ability of hard turning against grinding must be defined in high <b>precision</b> <b>bores</b> when the workpiece has different geometry (bore diameter, length to diameter ratio, wall thickness ratio). Moreover, as tolerances given for a workpiece are getting stricter, the transition range between hard turning and grinding must be determined. In some cases, it can be also worthy to utilize the advantages of these two processes to create a powerful combined technology. Therefore, a set of rules was developed to assist the selection of proper process at process planning. The research work focussed on manufacturing of high <b>precision</b> <b>bores,</b> in the field of the automotive industry.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to design, optimise and deploy a practical multi-measurand sensor (MMS) for process monitoring of glass and carbon fibre preforms in an autoclave. The MMS design was based on the optical fibre-based extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometric (EFPI) strain sensor. The EFPI sensor consisted of a pair of cleaved optical fibres, with a defined gap that were housed in a <b>precision</b> <b>bore</b> capillary. Interferometric interrogation was used to measure the cavity length hence, permitting the strain to be determined. The basic EFPI sensor design was modified in the following manner to enable multi-measurand monitoring. Firstly, a fibre Bragg grating (FBG) was inscribed on one of the optical fibres that were destined to be housed in the capillary; the end-face of this cleaved optical fibre was sputter coated with Au/Pd to produce a reflective surface. This FBG is in a relatively strain-free condition and only responds to temperature. Secondly, a technique was developed to manufacture optical-quality end-faces of the capillary and this too was sputter coated with Au/Pd. Thirdly, secondary cleaved optical fibres were packed around the lead-in optical fibre of the EFPI sensor with a defined (secondary) cavity thus, permitting transmission/reflection FTNIR spectroscopy. Finally, cleaved secondary optical fibres were also secured to the lead-in fibre and these served as Fresnel reflection sensors. The interrogation of the MMS was carried out using a conventional fibre-coupled multi-channel FTNIR spectrometer.

By a greater appreciation of the basic chemistry of the paint system, improvements of the final commercial products cculd be possible. A simple paint system was designed which contained industrial pigment, poly(vinylacetate) polymer and soluble ccnstituents including sodium hexametaphosphate (dispersant), and sodium dodecylsulphate (emulsifier). A non ionic thickener, sodium hydroxyethylcellulose, and an ionic thickener, carboxymethyl cellulose was also included.

40|$|Profile {{waviness}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes for scrapped parts in <b>precision</b> <b>bore</b> grinding. Although efforts have been made to reduce its occurrence, the problem has not been eliminated completely. In production, the identification of a few scrapped parts in a lot of several thousands often requires expensive manual processes. Grinding machines used to produce these parts are usually equipped with measurement gage heads having tactile probes. Until now, these in-process gages have been used to measure only the average diameter of the part. This research focused on the use of these tactile probes to measure bore waviness in precision-ground parts. The first objective was to develop a post-process machine that performs automated measurement of the bore profile and is capable of detecting waviness. The machine was built using the same measurement system and the same roll-shoe centerless fixture as the grinding machines used for the production of the parts. The machine was designed and set up such that disturbances of the measurement are minimized. It was shown that the machine reaches accuracies close to those obtained by manually operated roundness machines. The cycle time is approximately 4 seconds per part compared to several minutes for manually operated roundness machines. As a second objective, the possibility of measuring waviness directly in the grinding machine was evaluated. Feasible design modifications to reduce the effect of disturbances are very limited in grinding machines, since interference with the grinding process must be avoided. Therefore, analytical methods were developed to reduce these effects and partly restore the original profile. The main disturbances that were addressed are errors due to irregular sampling of the profile, to the frequency response behavior of the gage heads, and to motion of the workpiece center relative to the gage heads. The post-process machine was used as a development and test platform for the analytical methods. To further verify these methods, tests were also conducted in an industrial grinding machine. Ph. D.
