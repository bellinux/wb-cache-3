5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, {{is for those}} who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid.

The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self. This is the <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's fifth round home tie against South Shields {{produced}} a straightforward 3–0 victory. The goals were scored by Joe Smith, Jack Smith and David Jack, the latter maintaining his record of scoring in every round. The quarter-final against Nottingham Forest required two replays {{to produce a}} winner. Following a 2–2 draw in Nottingham and a goalless game in Bolton, the Wanderers prevailed 1–0 in another close game held at Old Trafford. Bolton drew Swansea Town, the last remaining Second Division club, in the semi-final. This meant Bolton did not meet a single First Division club in their <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final. Three early goals gave Bolton a comfortable 3–0 win at White Hart Lane.|$|E

5|$|Chocobo Tales {{features}} {{a mix of}} three different types of gameplay; role-playing video game, exploration, and card battles. Players explore a 3D environment to find picture books. Upon finding them the player is transported into pop-up picture books to complete minigames and open the <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next part of the story. The picture books {{take the form of}} Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are not located within pop-up books, do not affect the game-world and are not required to progress in the game.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E

5|$|Following Dunmore's War, Richard Henderson, a {{prominent}} judge from North Carolina, hired Boone {{to travel to}} the Cherokee towns in present North Carolina and Tennessee and inform them of an upcoming meeting. In the 1775 treaty, Henderson purchased the Cherokee claim to Kentucky to establish a colony called Transylvania. Afterwards, Henderson hired Boone to blaze {{what became known as the}} Wilderness Road, which went through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Along with a party of about 30 workers, Boone marked a <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky River, where he founded Boonesborough. Other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone returned to the Clinch Valley and brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned the <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E

5|$|Realizing Calgary's <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup {{would go}} through Edmonton, coach Bob Johnson devised a seven-point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on {{limiting}} Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri's creativity, limiting access {{to the left side}} of the ice where the Oilers' top stars liked to skate, leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to frustrate the Oiler players. Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game that ended in a 4–4 tie. The Flames then defeated the Oilers 9–3 in their final regular season meeting, a game that ended with another brawl and accusations by both teams that the other was sending their goons out after talented players.|$|E
5|$|The 256,300 man strong U.S. First Army, {{commanded}} by General Courtney Hodges, {{was ordered to}} break through the Siegfried Line around the area of Aachen, in order to reach the Rur river. Although the First Army began to encircle the area around Aachen in early September, the Battle of Aachen did not end until 21 October. The city cost the Americans roughly 3,000 casualties, but had opened the <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rur (river) river. Despite the casualties taken the ground gained was comparatively worthless, and the fighting for Aachen had not necessarily brought German defeat any closer.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative Party had {{previously}} experienced serious division during the 1850s, when the Emperor's complete {{support for the}} Conciliation policy {{gave rise to the}} Progressives. The difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed Conciliation (led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí) perceived the Emperor as being indispensable to the functioning of the political system: an ultimate and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened. This new generation of ultraconservatives, unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of PedroII's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. Unbeknownst to Rio Branco and PedroII, both had prepared the <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Empire's later downfall.|$|E
