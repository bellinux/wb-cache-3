2500|$|Ship No.3: (c/n 3) The third {{aircraft}} was built with a triangular-section welded tubular steel tailboom, four-wheeled undercarriage, {{full set of}} instruments, but a completely open cockpit. Performance and handling of this aircraft {{were found to be}} much better than its predecessors but the open cockpit was viewed as a major handicap. Young described flying the aircraft as being [...] "like sitting in a chair and flying through space." [...] However, [...] Bell company officials who flew in it found the experience to be thoroughly frightening. The solution to the open cockpit was the <b>plexiglas</b> <b>bubble</b> that was to become iconic on Bell 47/H-13 production aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{monocoque}} tub, {{with the}} bulkhead at the back, a nose section at the front, and an access hatch system overhead, formed a passenger compartment for a driver and a passenger sitting in tandem. The base plate {{on which the}} hatch was hinged was riveted {{to the right side}} of the monocoque tub and the nose section. The hatch was made of a steel sheet base with a glass windshield, a <b>plexiglas</b> <b>bubble</b> canopy, and a framed set of sliding windows on either side of the canopy.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{shooting}} of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at approximately 12.30 pm, SS-100-X was driven to Parkland Memorial Hospital. The <b>Plexiglas</b> <b>bubble</b> top and cloth cover were then attached. Later that afternoon at 3.30 pm CST the limousine was taken to Love Field and boarded on a C-130 and flown to Andrews Air Force Base, Washington DC, landing at 8 pm EST. After arrival at Andrews AFB, the limo was delivered to the White House garage. The Secret Service and later the FBI took photos of the limo's interior and searched it for evidence before it was thoroughly cleaned and valeted.|$|E
5000|$|... "Que mon cœur lâche" [...] was sung {{in a rock}} version {{during the}} concerts at Bercy in 1996 and was thus {{included}} on the live album and VHS/DVD Live à Bercy. The song {{was accompanied by a}} sexy choreography in which Farmer is dancing around a vertical iron bar and was surrounded by muscular male dancers in <b>Plexiglas</b> <b>bubbles</b> who bared their buttocks. The song was also performed during the Mylenium Tour in 2000, but only in the shows in Russia.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNon-bearing {{materials}} {{currently used}} in building applications (walls or bulkheads) are generally formed by panels or blocks. Such materials require good thermal performances and minimal mechanical strength. Mineral foams are relevant solutions. We focus on calcium sulfate foams containing {{a large amount}} of air trapped in bubbles. The foam production starts with fluid suspension obtained by quick mixing of water, mineral binder and surfactants. Foaming is applied before the quick setting of the mineral matrix. To study the interaction between foaming and rheological properties evolution, we use a transparent fluid model (dispersion of carbopol 676 in water). The air bubbles stability in yield stress polymer gel is analyzed by picture processing. carbopol gel is placed in <b>plexiglas</b> container. <b>Bubbles</b> are inserted with a variable volume using a syringe for injection controlling gas pressure. We start with the study of single bubble in different carbopols gels to model the change effect of rheological properties (setting effect). Bubbles sizes and internal pressure evolve according to thermodynamical laws. The foam stability is mostly conditioned by coalescence phenomena. It consists on the two bubbles fusion in contact by the membrane destruction which separated them. Experiments reveal that a small amount of surfactants is compulsory to preserve foam structure. Coalescence phenomenon is studied on our model yield stress fluid following the meet condition of two injected bubbles. The type and the surfactants dosage generate a wide range of configuration. Results enable us to understand better the foams behavior at fresh state. It gives us tools to optimize the formulation regarding mechanical and thermal properties targets...|$|R
5000|$|Built in 1964, {{the vehicle}} was {{powered by a}} 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and was backed by a Powerglide {{automatic}} transmission. The body was hand-laid fiberglass, hiding Roth's extensive chrome work to the chassis. The cockpit, set at the extreme rear of the vehicle {{in the manner of}} a dragster, was lined with fake fur and featured an 11-inch General Electric [...] "1-Touch" [...] portable television inserted in the console. Topping the cockpit was a custom-made, hydraulically operated <b>Plexiglas</b> <b>bubble</b> top. [...] One of a series of ordinary doorbell push-button switches atop the hood activated the top from the outside.|$|E
