60|$|Rho. By that I {{should be}} a very covetous person; for I am ever <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> money, and putting it into my pocket again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said I, hurriedly, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> typewritten play. [...] "She's {{no doubt}} a charming girl. Now, here's that little curtain-raiser you promised to listen to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! Oh, dear! He's <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> {{drawing of}} Wilton Bridge. He'll eat it up. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Whatever shall I do?" ...|$|E
60|$|To relieve {{my friend}} from his embarrassment, I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch and urged {{that we should}} walk in the {{direction}} of the Admiralty, as the hour for my interview had nearly arrived.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello Haught," [...] was my greeting, as I {{dismounted}} and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch. [...] "I'm {{four hours}} and a quarter late. Sorry. I could have made it, but didn't {{want to leave the}} wagons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh dear me, Angelica, don't <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>MY</b> hair, it hurts! You might {{remove a}} great deal of YOUR OWN, as I perceive, without {{scissors}} or pulling at all. Oh, ho, ho! ha, ha, ha! ho he he!' ...|$|R

60|$|I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> field-glass and {{directed}} it {{at a little}} speck high above our heads. It was the basket floating high in the air. I gave the glass to my wife to look, {{but she did not}} want to use it.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch, which I had {{forgotten}} to wind; and found it run down. The hands stood at twenty minutes past four. Daylight, then, could not be far off. Eighteen hours--say twenty: and Byfield had guessed our rate at one time to be thirty miles an hour. Five hundred miles---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Travers. [...] "I {{had just}} then <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch. Of course it {{flew out of}} my hand but it hung by the chain. Somebody trampled on it. The hands are broken off short. It keeps on ticking but I can't tell the time. It's absurd. Most provoking." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{settled the}} question. [...] "You {{are a good}} and an honest girl," [...] I said, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse; [...] "and you came to this misfortune through trying--too eagerly--to help the young lady. A ten-pound note is not overmuch as {{compensation}} for your accident. Take it, and get well. I should be sorry to think you lost a good place through your anxiety to help us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And e'en wae worth ye, Jock, my man, I paid ye weel your hire; Why <b>pull</b> ye <b>out</b> <b>my</b> grund-wa'-stane, To me lets in the fire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We clattered by--I too {{taken by}} {{surprise}} to stop my cab until we were well past and round a corner. Then I had a queer moment, a double and divergent movement of my will: I tapped the little door in {{the roof of the}} cab, and brought my arm down to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch. 'Yes, sir!' said the cabman, smartly. 'Er--well--it's nothing,' I cried. 'My mistake! We haven't much time! Go on!' and he went on [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "A nose, my father;" [...] I replied, greatly softened, [...] "has been {{variously}} {{defined by}} about a thousand different authors." [...] [Here I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch.] [...] "It is now noon or thereabouts--we shall have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To commence then:--The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that protuberance--that bump--that excrescence--that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, observe, I hadn't {{given him}} my name {{at all and}} his {{question}} embarrassed me a bit. Somehow or other it didn't seem proper for me to fling his own name at him as it were. So I merely <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> new certificate from my pocket {{and put it into}} his hand unfolded, so that he could read Charles Powell written very plain on the parchment.|$|E
6000|$|... "'O'Day,' says I, 'of the Columbia Detective Agency. And now, sir, let me {{give you}} a piece of good advice. You go back and take your {{medicine}} like a man. Hand 'em back the boodle; and maybe they'll let you off light. Go back easy, and I'll put in a word for you. I'll give you five minutes to decide.' I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch and waited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{one of the}} monks, {{he could}} not justly say which, or wouldn't, and I, {{thinking}} the letter of more importance than my own neck, ask him quietly into my friend's house. There he <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> this and five silver pennies, and I shall have five more if I bring an answer back: but to none than Hereward must I give it. With that I calling my friend, who is an honest woman, and nigh as strong in the arms as I am, ask her to clap {{her back against the}} door, and <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> axe." ...|$|R
6000|$|Eliz. O master, master, You {{will not}} let the mob, when I lie dead, Make me a show--paw over all <b>my</b> limbs-- <b>Pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> hair--pluck off my finger-nails-- Wear scraps of me for charms and amulets, As if I were a mummy, or a drug? As they have done to others--I have seen it-- Nor set me up in ugly naked {{pictures}} In every church, that cold world-hardened wits May gossip o'er my secret tortures? Promise-- Swear to me! I demand it! ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{no sign of}} the boy. Every {{few minutes}} I would walk back to the boat and linger beside it till I could no longer stand the mute reproach of the baskets huddled in a little pile on the stones, poor, {{houseless}} immigrants that they were. And from time to time I made a touching spectacle of myself, by <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch and peering, by what feeble light I could find, anxiously at its face to make out the hour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{thank you}} so much!" [...] I cried, with heartfelt gratitude, leaning {{out of the window}} as the train was on the point of starting. I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse, and drew timidly forth a sovereign. [...] "I've only English money," [...] I said, hesitating, for I didn't know whether he'd be {{offended}} or not at the offer of a tip--he seemed such a perfect gentleman. [...] "But if that's any use to you--" ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> measure, and {{applying}} {{it to the}} prostrate carcass, found that the gorilla we had now shot was five feet eight inches in height, and proportionately large round the chest. It {{seemed to be a}} mass of sinews and hard muscles, and as I gazed at its massive limbs I could well imagine that it had strength sufficient to perform many, at least, if not all of the wonderful feats ascribed to it by the natives.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> pencil, tore a leaf from my note-book, and {{scribbled}} a hasty note to Hilda: [...] "The invalid is--whom do you think?--Sebastian! He is dangerously {{ill with}} some malignant fever. I am bringing him down into camp to nurse. Get everything ready for him." [...] Then I {{handed it over}} to a messenger, found for me by the retired gentleman, to carry to Hilda. My host himself I could not spare, as he was my only interpreter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shure, yer honor, I was kilt entirely, and <b>my</b> {{arms were}} <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of <b>my</b> sockets. Holy Mother, who'd have thought 'twould be so {{difficult}} to come down a rope! The sailors are great men, entirely." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I could by {{no means}} like her project; I though it looked too much like {{prompting}} him, which indeed he did not want, and I clearly saw that I should lose nothing by being backward to ask, so I took her up short. 'I can't image why he should say so to you,' said I, 'for I assure you he brought me all the money I sent him for, and here it is,' said I (<b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse with about twelve guineas in it); and added, 'I intend you shall have most of it by and by.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have a cigar," [...] said Holmes; [...] "and you had best take a <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> of <b>my</b> flask, for you {{are very}} wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to {{overpower}} Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?" ...|$|R
60|$|At first I saw nobody; but {{feeling a}} {{pressure}} against the door, I looked round it, and there, to my amazement, were Mr. Peggotty and Ham, ducking {{at me with}} their hats, and squeezing one another against the wall. I could not help laughing; but {{it was much more}} in the pleasure of seeing them, than at the appearance they made. We shook hands in a very cordial way; and I laughed and laughed, until I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, very well,' {{answered}} the seaman; 'exceedingly well--like a tight ship in a brisk gale. Let me recollect. I remember thanking Jack, very composedly, for the interesting and agreeable communication; I then <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> canvas pouch, with my hoard of moidores, and taking out two pieces, I bid Jack keep the rest till I came back, as I {{was for a}} cruise about Auld Reekie. The poor devil looked anxiously, but I shook him by the hand, and ran downstairs, in such confusion of mind, that notwithstanding what I had heard, I expected to meet Jess at every turning.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘My dear friend,’ said I, ‘for God’s sake do not embarrass me {{with more}} alms. I loved to receive them from that hand, {{so long as}} they were needed; but they are so no more, and {{whatever}} else I may lack—and I lack everything—it is not money.’ I <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> sheaf of notes and detached the top one: it was written for ten pounds, and signed by that very famous individual, Abraham Newlands. ‘Oblige me, as you would like me to oblige your brother if the parts were reversed, and take this note for the expenses. I shall need not only food, but clothes.’ ...|$|E
60|$|I fear {{it was not}} a very ardent flame, however, for Gus did {{not write}} every week, and I did not care a bit; nevertheless, I kept his picture and gave it a sentimental sigh when I {{happened}} to think of it, while he sent messages now and then, and devoted himself to his studies like an ambitious boy as he was. I hardly expected to see him again, but soon after the year was <b>out,</b> to <b>my</b> great surprise, he called. I was so fluttered by the appearance of his card that I rather lost my head, and did such a silly thing that it makes me laugh even now. He liked chestnut hair, and, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> combs, I rushed down, theatrically dishevelled, hoping to impress my lover with my ardour and my charms.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} then that I thought {{it time to}} put my pipe in my pocket, for, you see, I had been havin' a puff on the sly as we was bearin' down; an' I put up my fore-finger to shove the baccy down, when one o' them stingin' little things comes along, whips <b>my</b> best cutty <b>out</b> o' <b>my</b> mouth, an' carries the finger along with it. Of coorse I warn't goin' below for such a small matter, so I <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> hankerchief, an' says I to the little man that lost his hat, `Just take a round turn here, Jim,' says I, `an' I'll be ready for action again in two minutes.' Jim, he tied it up, but before he quite done it, the round shot was pitchin' into us like hail, cuttin' up the sails and riggin' most awful.|$|R
5000|$|Brian Michael Bendis, {{writer of}} Ultimate Spider-Man, {{revealed}} his intentions {{to have the}} Ultimate Marvel version of Firestar appear in the book {{in an interview on}} Comic Book Resources on July 20, 2007.
