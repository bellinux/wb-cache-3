50|$|Cross-band {{repeaters}} {{are sometimes}} {{a part of}} government trunked radio systems. If one community is on a trunked system and the neighboring community is on a conventional system, a <b>talk</b> <b>group</b> or agency-fleet-subfleet may be designated {{to communicate with the}} other community. In an example where the community is on 153.755 MHz, transmitting on the trunked system <b>talk</b> <b>group</b> would repeat on 153.755 MHz. Signals received by a base station on 153.755 MHz would go over the trunked system on an assigned <b>talk</b> <b>group.</b>|$|R

In <b>Talking</b> <b>Groups</b> {{all members of}} the group have the same rights, each member is responsible only for themselves (group members do not make decisions for other group members), each group is autonomous, everyone attends the group on account of their own problems, whatever is discussed in the group remains confidential, and participation is free of charge.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Talk</b> <b>Group,</b> or {{fleet of}} radios, has a [...] "Home Site". The <b>talk</b> <b>group</b> information, which {{consists}} of the <b>talk</b> <b>group</b> and radio IDs of a fleet are stored in this site. When a user turns a radio on, it attempts to register on the Home Site based on the frequencies programmed in the radio. If the radio sees a signal from the home site, and the signal is of usable strength, it registers on the home site. If the radio cannot see the signal from the home site, it starts trying other programmed frequencies of other PassPort sites in the network. When the radio finds a site that has sufficient signal strength, it attempts to register as a [...] "Roamer". The site that the radio is attempting to log on to queries the home site for permission to register the Roamer radio. If permission is granted, the radio is registered to the remote site. After that, any voice traffic from the <b>Talk</b> <b>Group</b> of the roamer is not only repeated at the Home Site, {{but also to the}} remote site which the radio is registered. When the Roamer roams to a different site, or back to its home site, the <b>Talk</b> <b>Group</b> voice traffic ceases to be repeated at the first site the roamer registered to. The radio monitors signal strength constantly and when the strength falls below a set threshold, the radio starts searching for a site with a stronger signal. If the radio finds a stronger signal, it attempts to register to that site.|$|R

40|$|By relying {{mainly on}} the {{accessibility}} approach to anaphora, this article intends to analyze the types, distributions and retrieval of anaphors in two forms of spoken discourse: casual and controlled talk. For the specific purposes of the study, twenty sophomore Iranian students were randomly selected to conduct the talks. The subjects {{were divided into two}} groups of casual and controlled talk. According to the settings and adopted topics, the overall casual <b>talk</b> <b>group</b> was further divided into two groups of dorm and academic talk. In the end, it was observed that as the talk situations vary, types, frequencies, distances, retrieval qualities and thematic structure (patterning) of anaphors undergo dramatic changes too. Further analyses of the obtained data show that the number of pronominal anaphors is by far more than NP anaphors in dorm casual talk whereas in academic casual talk the number of NP anaphors exceeds that of the former <b>talk</b> <b>groups.</b> However, the distribution of anaphors in the performance of controlled <b>talk</b> <b>groups</b> has shown to be more moderate with regard to the types of anaphors used in it. Overall, the distributional patterns of various anaphoric devices in different talk situations are considered to be a function of the speakers’ evaluation of the cognitive states of the listeners/addressees. Average distances and frequencies of the different types of zero, pronominal, and NP anaphors have also been shown to undergo dramatic changes as talk situations vary. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of the isolated vocal-facilitating techniques Chant Talk and Pitch Inflections on the phonation of healthy female speech-language pathology (SLP) students. Study design: A multigroup pretest-posttest design was used. Methods: A homogenous group of 40 healthy female SLP students with a mean age of 18. 7 years were randomly assigned into 3 groups: a Chant <b>Talk</b> <b>group</b> (practicing Chant <b>Talk</b> across 18 weeks), a Pitch Inflections group (practicing Pitch Inflections across 18 weeks), and a control group (practicing no facilitating techniques). To compare vocal measures before and after this time span, an identical objective voice assessment protocol (aerodynamic measurement, acoustic analysis, voice range profile, and Dysphonia Severity Index) was performed in the 3 groups. Results: Both Chant Talk and Pitch Inflections groups resulted in a significant decrease of the acoustic measure noise-to-harmonics ratio compared with the control <b>group.</b> The Chant <b>Talk</b> <b>group</b> resulted in a significant increase in the acoustic measure fundamental frequency compared with the control group. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that the facilitating techniques Chant Talk and Pitch Inflections may improve the objective measure of breathiness (noise-to-harmonics ratio) in healthy female SLP students...|$|R

50|$|GE Marc V used a {{two-tone}} sequence {{to identify}} a group: what modern systems call agency-fleet-subfleet or <b>talk</b> <b>groups.</b> Each radio {{had at least one}} tone pair, which identified the group of radios it could talk with. It was similar in format to two-tone sequential paging codes except that, in a GE Marc V system, the first tone was much longer than the second. This long first tone gave a bigger time window for all the scanning radios to find and decode a two-tone sequence. The first tone was lengthened for systems with more channels.|$|R
50|$|Trunked radio takes {{advantage}} of the probability that with any given number of user units, not everyone will need channel access at the same time, therefore fewer discrete radio channels are required. From another perspective, with a given number of radio channels, a much greater number of user groups can be accommodated. In the example of the police department, this additional capacity could then be used to assign individual <b>talk</b> <b>groups</b> to specialized investigative, traffic control, or special-events groups which might otherwise not have the benefit of individual private communications.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: {{studies in}} adults {{have shown that}} {{external}} focus of attention is better than internal focus in motor learning. So, {{the aim of this}} study is to evaluate the effects of focus of attention- self talk on balance of women with multiple sclerosis. Materials and Methods: In this semi- experimental study, statistical population included women with MS referred to MS Society of Arak. Whereas balance disorder in patients was diagnosed by neurologyist, they were invited to the study. Patients were accidentally divided into 3 groups each of 15 concluding control, self tak-external focus of attention and self talk- internal focus of attention groups and were evaluated by Berg balance scale. 42 samples completed executive steps of study. ANOVA and Tukey tests were used to compare balance score between groups with significant level of less than 0. 05. All patients practiced balance tasks for 9 days and then they were undergone post test. Results: Balance was improved in all groups. Although the external- self <b>talk</b> <b>group</b> was better than the two other groups, there was no significant difference between external and internal- self <b>talk</b> <b>groups.</b> Conclusion: The findings of this study showed the effect of practice on improvement of balance skill and superiority of the experimental groups in comparison with control group. Probably, focus of attention with self talk has effect on balance of women with MS. ...|$|R
