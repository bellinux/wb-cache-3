60|$|It was {{wonderful}} to hear how Mr. Blyth talked; how he alternately glorified the clown's wife for the <b>punctual</b> <b>performance</b> of her promise, and appealed triumphantly to the rector to say, whether he had not underrated rather than exaggerated little Mary's beauty. It was also wonderful to see Mrs. Peckover's blank look of astonishment when she found the rigid doctor of divinity, who would {{not so much as}} notice her curtsey, suddenly relax into blandly supplying her with everything she wanted to eat or drink. But a very much more remarkable study of human nature than either of these, was afforded by the grimly patronizing and profoundly puzzled aspect of Vance, as he waited, under protest, upon a woman from a traveling circus. It is something to see the Pope serving the Pilgrims their dinner, during the Holy Week at Rome. Even that astounding sight, however, fades into nothing, as compared with the sublimer spectacle of Mr. Vance waiting upon Mrs. Peckover.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we propose {{the use of the}} {{performance}} measure distribution rather than its punctual value to rank hedge funds. Generalized Sharpe Ratio and other similar measures that take into account the higher-order moments of portfolio return distributions are commonly used to evaluate hedge funds performance. The literature in this field has reported non-significant difference in ranking between performance measures that take, and those that do not take, into account higher moments of distribution. Our approach provides a much more powerful manner to differentiate between hedge funds performance. We use a non-semiparametric density based on Gram-Charlier expansions to forecast the conditional distribution of hedge fund returns and its corresponding performance measure distribution. Through a forecasting exercise we show the advantages of our technique in relation to using the more traditional <b>punctual</b> <b>performance</b> measures...|$|E
50|$|Little {{or nothing}} {{is known of}} the boyhood of Dinkar Rao, except that his {{education}} in his mother tongue was commenced about his fifth year {{under the supervision of}} his father. He was also instructed in Sanskrit and Persian. Particular attention appears to have been bestowed on his religious education. He grew up an orthodox Hindu, pious and <b>punctual</b> in the <b>performance</b> of his religious duties. He loved Hindu music, and acquired a fair knowledge of Hindu medicine.|$|R
40|$|A multi-mesh {{adaptive}} {{scheme for}} convection-diffusion-reaction problems is presented. The proposal {{is applied to}} air quality modeling, especifically to the simulation of a pollutant <b>punctual</b> emissions. The <b>performance</b> of the proposal is analyzed with different nonlinear reaction models, including the photochemical model CB 05 implmented within the Comunity Multiscale Air Quality model, which involves sixty-two species and very different characteristic reaction times. The problem is solved with splitting of transport and reaction processes. This allows to discretize the species in distinct computational meshes, adapted to {{the distribution of the}} error indicator of each case. A common reference mesh is used for all species and during all problem evolution. A remeshing technique based on imposing the volume of new elements is used to define and update the computational meshes. An error indicator well suited for problems involving large variation of the unknowns is used. A single-mesh strategy, with remeshing adapted to the most demanding specie in each part of the domain, is used for comparison. The results of the examples presented show that the accuracy of single and multi-mesh strategies are similar. Instead, computational cost of multi-mesh is lower than single-mesh in most cases. Reduction increases with the number of species and the number of plumes. An example of a punctual emissor in a three-dimensional domain, with realistic values of CB 05 components, is presented.
