25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. <b>Pyrantel</b> pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|In {{cats and}} dogs whose {{gastrointestinal}} tract is infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with <b>pyrantel</b> embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. Praziquantel is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis.|$|E
25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as {{mebendazole}} and albendazole are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These anthelminthics are administered {{in a single}} dose are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole can be given with a single dose twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a single dose. WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate is also equally effective on ascaris. However, {{it has been reported}} that albendazole, mebendazole, and <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate are not entirely effective against T. trichiura with single oral doses in population-based control.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} sanitation, {{which includes}} improving access to toilets and proper disposal of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas {{where more than}} 20% {{of the population is}} affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine. Treatments recommended by the World Health Organization are the medications albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, or <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide.|$|E
25|$|Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as {{albendazole}} and mebendazole) are {{the first}} line treatment of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin) are effective against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass deworming programmes. <b>Pyrantel</b> is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.|$|E

2500|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{is a growing}} concern for many horse owners. Resistance has been noted with ivermectin to ascarids, and with fenbendazole, oxibendazole, and <b>pyrantel</b> to small strongyles. [...] Development of new drugs takes many years, leading to the concern that worms could out-evolve the drugs currently available to treat them. As a result, most veterinarians now recommend deworming for small strongyles based on fecal egg counts to minimize the development of resistant parasite populations. Fecal egg count reduction tests can also be performed to identify which dewormers are effective on a particular farm.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pyrantel</b> pamoate {{acts as a}} depolarizing neuromuscular {{blocking}} agent, thereby causing sudden contraction, {{followed by}} paralysis, of the helminths. This has the result of causing the worm to [...] "lose its grip" [...] on the intestinal wall and be passed {{out of the system}} by natural process. Since <b>Pyrantel</b> is poorly absorbed by the host's intestine, the host is unaffected by the small dosage of medication used. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate, may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. This obstruction is usually {{in the form of a}} worm impaction and happens when a very small, but heavily parasitized animal is treated and tries to pass a large number of dislodged worms at once. Worms usually pass in normal stool or with diarrhea, straining, and occasional vomiting.|$|E
50|$|Drugs used in {{treatment}} of A. caninum infections of dogs include: dichlorvos, fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole, nitroscanate, piperazine, <b>pyrantel,</b> milbemycin, moxidectin, diethylcarbamazine, oxibendazole, and ivermectin.|$|E
50|$|Ancylostoma duodenale can {{be treated}} with albendazole, {{mebendazole}} and benzimidazoles. <b>Pyrantel</b> pamoate is an alternative. In severe cases of anemia, blood transfusion may be necessary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyrantel</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} a number of parasitic worm infections. This includes ascariasis, hookworm infections, enterobiasis (pinworm infection), trichostrongyliasis, and trichinellosis. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Ivermectin {{is highly}} {{effective}} {{even at the}} low dose of 100 μg per kg, and <b>pyrantel</b> is also effective at 25-50 mg per kg. Benzimidazoles such as mebendazole, parbendazole and thiabendazole are also highly effective.|$|E
50|$|Infection of this {{parasite}} can {{be treated}} in several ways. There is a single treatment with includes a combination of febantel, <b>pyrantel</b> and praziquantel. There is also a monthly treatment with the administration of combination drugs as well.|$|E
50|$|Trichostrongylus tenuis, {{also known}} as the {{strongyle}} worm, is a gut nematode found in the United Kingdom, sensitive to <b>Pyrantel</b> pamoate. Larvae have a short migration inside the mucosa of the intestine and return quickly to the digestive tract.|$|E
5000|$|Deworming {{can begin}} with foals at {{four to eight}} weeks of age and is {{repeated}} about every 60 days. Treatment is with anthelmintic medication, and rotating between different classes of anthelmintics is recommended. [...] Effective treatments include the macrocyclic lactones, notably ivermectin or moxidectin, which can kill the early larval stages before they migrate into the liver and lungs. Another class of effective medication are the benzimidazoles, such as fenbendazole. <b>Pyrantel</b> pamoate is also used, and a closely related variant, <b>pyrantel</b> tartrate, can be fed as a daily dose that is effective at killing larvae. Prior to development of these drugs, during the 1950s and 1960s, treatment with piperazine, dichlorvos and trichlorfon was used.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cats and}} dogs whose {{gastrointestinal}} tract is infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with <b>pyrantel</b> embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. Praziquantel is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the use of}} {{herbivore}} manure as fertilizer is {{a common}} practice preceding infection, thorough cleaning and cooking of vegetables is required for prevention of infection. Treatment with <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate is recommended. Alternative agents include mebendazole and albendazole. Successful treatment with ivermectin has also been reported.|$|E

Mebendazole and thiabendazole have also both been cited to work.|$|E
50|$|Another {{medication}} {{administered to}} kill worm infections has been <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate. For some parasitic diseases, {{there is no}} treatment and, {{in the case of}} serious symptoms, medication intended to kill the parasite is administered, whereas, in other cases, symptom relief options are used.

5000|$|The typical adult {{therapy for}} oesophagostomiasis {{is a single}} 400 mg dose of {{albendazole}} (200 mg for children) or <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate. [...] Albendazole works by binding to the free beta tubulin, which inhibits tubulin polymerization. This results in the inhibition of glucose uptake by the Oesophagostomum. Albendazole and <b>pyrantel</b> pamoate at these doses have cure rates of 85% and 59-82%, respectively. Excision of Oesophagostomum larvae from nodules {{has been shown to}} have a curative effect on the patient but is invasive and more resource intensive than chemotherapy. For oesophagostomiasis with complications, the type of treatment varies depending on the severity of the disease. Usually 200-400 mg of albendazole will be given immediately and continued for up to 5 days in conjunction with 250 mg dosages of amoxicillin.In the case of formation of abscesses or fistulae arising from Dapaong tumors, incision and drainage is performed, followed by a regimen of albendazole and antibiotic treatment.|$|E
