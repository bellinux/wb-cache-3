In the past, extinguishers were marked with colored geometric symbols, and some extinguishers still use both symbols.

2500|$|Only a {{small number}} of people were at the {{airstrip}} and saw the crash. [...] The airport groundsman and an airline staff member grabbed <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishers,</b> jumped into a car and raced across the airstrip. Others at the airstrip and nearby beaches ran towards the burning aircraft. [...] The aircraft's cabin door had been torn away by a tree stump and lay about [...] behind the aircraft but despite the open doorway no-one inside the passenger cabin attempted to escape. [...] Fuel floating {{on the surface of the}} water was burning fiercely, making it dangerous to approach the wreckage. One of the first witnesses to reach the scene believed he saw two people at the front of the passenger cabin who were alive but before he could get close enough to investigate he was driven back by flames.|$|E
2500|$|A {{fire engine}} from Coolangatta arrived {{within minutes of}} the crash. [...] The boggy swamp made it {{difficult}} to manoeuvre the vehicle close to the wreckage. [...] Firemen initially attacked the fire with <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishers</b> and then used the fire engine to pump water from the swamp onto the blazing wreckage. [...] Two firemen found a way around the burning fuel {{on the surface of the}} water and climbed onto the wing with their hose. The fire burned fiercely for 30 minutes but was not completely extinguished for another hour. Apart from the outer wings and the tail section, little of the aircraft was recognisable. [...] Both halves of the tailplane were visibly bent downwards. [...] The wreckage of the wings and engine mounts also showed they had suffered severe downward bending indicating the severity of the impact. The charred body of one of the pilots was half-way out a cockpit window, suggesting he survived the crash and attempted to escape from the wreckage.|$|E

40|$|Investigations of past fires {{suggest that}} {{building}} occupants {{faced with a}} fire have problems defining the severity of it, especially {{in the early stages}} of the fire. An experiment was therefore carried out to study people’s ability to estimate fire growth, and their perceived ability to extinguish a <b>fire</b> using a <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> A total of 535 persons, namely 304 men and 231 women, were asked to fill out a questionnaire that was divided into three parts. In the first part the test participants were asked to estimate the time between different stages of a fire. The second part involved estimations of the own ability to extinguish a <b>fire</b> with a <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> The third part involved general questions about age, gender and academic background. The results suggest that people in general are not very good at defining the severity of a fire when it is visually accessible. Estimations of the fire growth did not correspond very well to the actual fire growth, and a great proportion of the test participants believed that they had not been able to extinguish an extinguishable <b>fire</b> using a <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> It is therefore argued that the perceived risk not always conforms to the real risk in a fire situation where the fire is visually accessible. The results can be used to explain why building occupants not immediately initiate evacuation in a fire situation, even when the fire is visually accessible...|$|R

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is {{developing}} a Fine Water Mist (FWM) <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher</b> (PFE) for use on the International Space Station (ISS).

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} a Fine Water Mist <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher</b> for use on the International Space Station. The International Space Station presently uses {{two different types of}} fire extinguishers: a water foam extinguisher in the Russian Segment, and a carbon dioxide extinguisher in the US Segment and Columbus and Kibo pressurized elements. Changes in emergency breathing equipment make Fine Water Mist operationally preferable. Supplied oxygen breathing systems allow for safe discharge of a carbon dioxide <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher,</b> without concerns of the crew inhaling unsafe levels of carbon dioxide. But the Portable Breathing Apparatus offers no more than 15 minutes of capability, and continued use of hose based supplied oxygen systems increases the oxygen content in a fire situation. NASA has developed a filtering respirator cartridge for use in a fire environment. It is qualified to provide up to 90 minutes of capability, and because it is a filtering respirator it does not add oxygen to the environment. The fire response respirator cartridge does not filter carbon dioxide, so a crew member discharging a CO 2 <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher</b> while wearing this filtering respirator would be at risk of inhaling unsafe levels of CO 2. Fine Water Mist extinguishes a fire without creating a large volume of air with reduced oxygen and elevated CO 2. Compared to the carbon dioxide based <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher,</b> the flight qualification of Fine Water Mist systems requires special care. Qualification of the CO 2 based <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher</b> began with the assumption that any fire on ISS would be extinguished if the air in the fire environment reached a critical concentration of CO 2. Qualification of a CO 2 based system requires the developers to make assertions and assumptions about vehicle geometry and the ability of the extinguisher to deliver CO 2 in different geometric configurations, but the developers did not need to make assertions or assumptions {{about the size of the}} fire, the temperature, or the heat generation rate. Fine Water Mist systems extinguish a fire predominantly by removing heat [...] so qualification standards must evaluate geometry, but also temperature, heat transfer, and heat generation rate. This paper outlines and describes the methods used to develop standards used to qualify Fine Water Mist systems for a human spaceflight environment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{sources of}} fuel are present aboard current spacecraft, with one {{especially}} hazardous source of stored energy: lithium ion batteries. Lithium ion batteries {{are a very}} hazardous form of fuel due to their self-sustaining combustion once ignited, for example, by an external heat source.

50|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} is trapped by the foam {{stabilizer}} and creates a thick foam which will float on top of hydrocarbon fuels and seal off access to atmospheric oxygen, smothering the fire.

FWM extinguishes a fire without creating a large volume of air with reduced oxygen and elevated CO 2. The following paper will discuss the unique functional and performance requirements that have been levied on the FWM PFE. In addition, the NASA ISS specific fire standards will be described which were developed to establish acceptable extinguisher performance. The paper will also discuss the flight hardware design. The fin e water mist <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher</b> has two major elements: (1) the nozzle and crew interface, and (2) the tank. The nozzle and crew interface have been under development for several years. They have gone through several design iterations, and have been part of more than 400 fire challenge and spray characterizations. The crew and vehicle interface aspects of the design will use the heritage of the CO 2 based <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher,</b> to minimize the disruption to the crew and integration impacts to the ISS. The microgravity use environment of the system poses a set of unique design requirements specifically for the tank. The nozzle requirements drive a tank pressure that is 2 - 5 times higher than any commercially available water mist systems. Microgravity requires deliberate separation of gas and water, facilitated by a bladder, a diaphragm, a piston, or separate tanks. This paper will describe status of the project to date, the design details of the tank and the nozzle, and discuss the trade studies that informed the decisions to select the tank and nozzle configuration...|$|R
