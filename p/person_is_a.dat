5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board. They may, within two months from the date of the detention order, make written representations to the Minister. The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board. Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court. The burden of proving that a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E
5|$|The ballads are characterised {{by sexual}} {{encounters}} between everyday people and human(-like) beings {{referred to in}} at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man and the elf a woman, as also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but with a happy ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E

25|$|Israel's {{national}} air carrier, El Al, {{is widely regarded}} as the safest airline in the world, and no flight leaving Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport has ever been hijacked.

Other measures include reinforced cockpit doors and an air marshal on every flight.|$|E
25|$|Exocentric {{compounds}} occur {{more often}} in adjectives than nouns. A V-8 car is {{a car with a}} V-8 engine rather than a car that is a V-8, and a twenty-five-dollar car is a car with a worth of $25, not a car that is $25. The compounds shown here are bare, but more commonly, a suffixal morpheme is added, esp. -ed. Hence, a two-legged <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> person with two legs, and this is exocentric.|$|E

25|$|Having a {{last name}} of Levi or a related term does not {{necessarily}} mean a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Levite, and some Levites do not have such last names. Levitical status is passed down in families from parent to child, as part of a family's genealogical tradition. Tribal status of Levite is determined by patrilineal descent, so a child whose biological father is a Levite (in cases of adoption or artificial insemination, status is determined by the genetic father), is also considered a Levite. Jewish status is determined by matrilineal descent, thus conferring levitical status onto children requires both biological parents to be Israelites and the biological father to be a Levite.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} branch {{is headed by}} the governor who serves as both head of state and head of government. The lieutenant governor {{may or may not}} have executive authority depending on whether the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> member of the Governor's cabinet. Under the current Kentucky Constitution, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor only if the governor is incapacitated. (Before 1992 the lieutenant governor assumed power any time the governor was out of the state.) The governor and lieutenant governor usually run on a single ticket (also per a 1992 constitutional amendment), and are elected to four-year terms. The current governor is Republican Matt Bevin, and the lieutenant governor is Jenean Hampton.|$|E
25|$|A {{portion of}} the {{homeless}} population are generally in transit, {{but there is no}} generally accepted terminology to describe them; some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations, and thus the professional and vernacular lingo to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy. Much of the concern stems from the European situation, where homeless persons of Roma, Sinti and other ethnic descent have rejected the term gypsy, which they view as a racial slur. Other terms which some use regarding in-transit persons are: transient, vagabond, tramp or drifter. Occasionally, these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> traveler, e.g. hobo. The pejorative term bum is used for persons who are alleged to be lacking a work ethic. The term transient is frequently used in police reports, without any precise definitions across jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Following Diana's death, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund {{was granted}} {{intellectual}} property rights over her image. In 1998, the fund sued the Franklin Mint, accusing it of illegally selling Diana dolls, plates, and jewellery after having been refused a license to do so. In California, where the initial case was tried, a suit to preserve the right of publicity may be filed {{on behalf of a}} dead person, but only if that <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Californian. The Memorial Fund therefore filed the lawsuit on behalf of the estate and, upon losing the case, was required to pay the Franklin Mint's legal costs of £3million which, combined with other fees, caused the Memorial Fund to freeze its grants to charities. In 2003, the Franklin Mint counter-sued. In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Memorial Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million (US$21.5 million) to charitable causes on which both sides agreed. In addition to this, the Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to £4 million (US$6.5 million) in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.|$|E

500|$|Biko's {{given name}} [...] "Bantu" [...] means [...] "people"; Biko {{interpreted}} {{this in terms}} of the saying [...] "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" [...] ("a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> person by means of other people"). As a child he was nicknamed [...] "Goofy" [...] and [...] "Xwaku-Xwaku", the latter a reference to his unkempt appearance. He was raised in his family's Anglican Christian faith. In 1950, when Biko was four, his father fell ill, was hospitalised in St. Matthew's Hospital, Keiskammahoek, and died, making the family dependent on his mother's income.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the belief}} that baptism is a {{necessary}} part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. However members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. [...] One author describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, [...] "Faith is the reason why a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> child of God; baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God" [...] (italics are in the source). [...] Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a [...] "work" [...] that earns salvation.|$|E
500|$|According to Lodge, Mandela's {{political}} thought reflected tensions between {{his support for}} liberal democracy and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making. He was an admirer of British-style parliamentary democracy, stating that [...] "I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration." [...] In this he {{has been described as}} being committed to [...] "the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation", something which distinguishes him from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin. Mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as [...] "democracy in its purest form". He also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, Ubuntu, which was a Ngnuni term meaning [...] "A <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> person through other persons" [...] or [...] "I am because we are." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E
500|$|The Sac and Fox Nation governs itself {{under the}} {{authority}} of the Indian Self-Determination Act and has its own tax commission. [...] The tribe imposes a tax on earnings of any person working within tribal jurisdiction, regardless of whether that <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tribal member. [...] The tribe also provides for a motor vehicle tax and registration of any vehicle that are owned by a tribal member and garaged within tribal jurisdiction. [...] The State of Oklahoma, through the Oklahoma Tax Commission, also administers income and motor vehicle taxes. [...] The state considers that all income earned in the state is taxable, including on tribal land, and issues tax assessments against those who are delinquent. [...] Oklahoma contends that anyone within the state had to register their vehicles with the state, while the Sac and Fox Nation required tribal members residing in tribal jurisdiction to register the vehicle with the tribe. [...] The state viewed those members to be delinquent in their vehicle taxes, but made no effort to collect until the vehicle was sold to a new owner. [...] At that time, Oklahoma would require that the delinquent taxes and penalties be paid in order to register the vehicle.|$|E
