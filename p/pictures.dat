5|$|In mid-2012, {{legal issues}} arose when {{attempts}} were made to digitally re-release the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya <b>Pictures</b> had filed a lawsuit against Gemini Colour Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi <b>Pictures</b> for attempting to re-release the film without her production company's permission. The reason for the suit was that in December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi <b>Pictures</b> had transferred the entire rights of the film to Movie Film Circuit, which in turn had transferred them to Vijaya <b>Pictures</b> on 18 May 1976. Vijaya <b>Pictures</b> approached the Gemini Colour Laboratory to digitise the film for re-release, however Sri Vijayalakshmi <b>Pictures</b> asked laboratory officials not to release the film without their prior consent. Sri Vijayalakshmi <b>Pictures</b> also disputed Vijaya's claim by running an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper on 18 May 2012, stating that it was the owner of the film's rights and anybody who wished to exhibit it in digital format should only do so with their permission. R. Subbiah, the judge who presided over the case, ordered the status quo to be maintained by both parties.|$|E

5|$|Coppola {{originally}} intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to {{his commitment to the}} filming of Gardens of Stone (1987), engaged Arnold Schulman who scripted Capra's A Hole in the Head (1959). Schulman eventually collaborated with David Seidler on the Tucker project. Subsequently, Coppola rewrote the Schulman and Seidler scripts, but an attempt to get a co-writing credit on the film was overruled by the Writers Guild of America, as an arbitration committee determined Coppola did not contribute enough to the script to warrant an on-screen writing credit. The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but Universal <b>Pictures,</b> Walt Disney <b>Pictures,</b> TriStar <b>Pictures</b> and Paramount <b>Pictures</b> wanted Coppola and Lucas to lower it to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical failures of both Labyrinth and Howard the Duck. Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and pre-production proceeded.|$|E
