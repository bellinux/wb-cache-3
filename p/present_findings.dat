5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to <b>present</b> <b>findings</b> at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

These insects can inflict painful bites on humans as well. In the Ivory Coast, where Buruli ulcer is endemic, the water bugs are present in swamps and rivers, where human activities such as farming, fishing, and bathing take place. <b>Present</b> <b>findings</b> describing the experimental transmission of M. ulcerans from water bugs to mice are in good agreement {{with the possibility of}} this mode of transmission to humans by bites.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{news reports}} and related blogs {{indicate}} that HBOT {{is used for}} many cases of children with autism. HBOT can cost up to $150 per hour with individuals using anywhere from 40 to 120 hours {{as a part of}} their integrated treatment programs. In addition, purchasing (at $8,495–27,995) and renting ($1,395 per month) of the HBOT chambers is another option some families use. When considering the financial and time investments required in order to participate in this treatment and the inconsistency of the <b>present</b> <b>findings,</b> HBOT seems to be a riskier and thus, often less favorable alternative treatment for autism. Further studies are needed in order for practitioners and families to make more conclusive and valid decisions concerning HBOT treatments.|$|E
