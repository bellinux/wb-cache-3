50|$|The False <b>Underwing</b> <b>Moth</b> (Allotria elonympha) is {{a species}} of moth in the Erebidae family. The species is found in eastern North America.|$|R
5000|$|As the red <b>underwing</b> <b>moth</b> takes off, {{the sudden}} flash of colour may confuse the attacker, {{and when it}} lands and {{immediately}} closes its wings it may seem to disappear as the colour is [...] "switched off". It is also thought that the symmetrical patterned orange sections on the rear wings form the illusion of another smaller creature (butterfly), so the attacker will go for the colourful [...] "small illusive" [...] rear safe region on {{the main body of}} this red <b>underwing</b> <b>moth</b> species.|$|R
50|$|Various Allium {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of the leek moth and onion fly {{as well as some}} Lepidoptera {{including}} cabbage moth, common swift moth (recorded on garlic), garden dart <b>moth,</b> large yellow <b>underwing</b> <b>moth,</b> nutmeg moth, setaceous Hebrew character moth, turnip moth and Schinia rosea, a moth that feeds exclusively on Allium species.|$|R
50|$|The Catocalini are a {{tribe of}} moths in the Erebidae family. Adults of many {{species in the}} tribe are called <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> due to their vividly colored hindwings that are often covered by contrastingly dark, drab forewings.|$|R
50|$|Peridroma saucia, the <b>pearly</b> <b>underwing</b> or {{variegated}} cutworm, is {{a species}} of moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in southern and central Europe, but is also found further north because of its migratory nature. Elsewhere in the Palearctic ecozone it is found in North Africa, Asia Minor, Russia (including the Russian Far East and Siberia), China, Taiwan and Japan. In the Nearctic ecozone it {{is found in the}} U.S. and southern Canada and in the Neotropic ecozone in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the bright colors, arranged in usually roughly concentric markings, at a casual glance resemble {{the eyes of a}} predatory animal, such as a cat. An <b>underwing</b> <b>moth,</b> well camouflaged in its daytime resting spot on a tree trunk or branch, will suddenly flash open the hindwings when disturbed. A bird or other small predator that is not used to this display is likely to be frightened, allowing the moth to escape. However, unlike some other bright-colored moths which are bad-tasting or even poisonous to predators, <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> are well palatable at least to some birds (e.g. the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata). To assist in avoiding nocturnal predators such as bats, these moths also possess (like many of their relatives) fairly well-developed hearing organs.|$|R
5000|$|Catocala minuta, {{the little}} <b>underwing,</b> a <b>moth</b> species found the United States ...|$|R
50|$|The {{adults are}} {{predominantly}} nocturnal, flying from shortly after dusk {{right up to}} daybreak. They are generally most active about two hours after nightfall. However, several if not all species of <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> have a second activity period exactly around noon, during which they are also regularly found on the wing for about 1-2 hours each day.|$|R
50|$|Catocala is a {{generally}} Holarctic genus of moths in the Erebidae family. The moths are {{commonly known as}} <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> or simply underwings. These terms are sometimes used for a few related moths, but usually - especially when used in plural, not as part of a species name - they are used to refer to Catocala only.|$|R
5000|$|Noctua (Latin for [...] "little owl") is a genus of moths. They have dull, cryptic {{forewings}} {{and often}} very bright hindwings. These are {{hidden under the}} forewings when the moths rest, leading to their common name of yellow underwings. They are not particularly {{closely related to the}} [...] "true" [...] <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> (Catocala) though, apart from both being Noctuoidea (and in the traditional classification, Noctuidae). They are good fliers.|$|R
50|$|Fifehead Wood {{provides}} the light orange <b>underwing</b> <b>moth</b> (Archiearis notha) with its sole Dorset residence. The site {{also has a}} large variety of butterflies, such as the white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and the purple hairstreak (Neozephyrus quercus).Breeding populations of several different birds inhabit Fifehead Wood. Grey heron and great spotted woodpeckers may be spotted,and treecreepers can also be observed spiraling within the habitat, as they ascend tree trunks in a progression of small hops.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} cryptic species {{complexes}} in Catocala, e.g. the group around the Delilah underwing (C. delilah); {{these and other}} hitherto unknown species are still being discovered and described in some numbers. Thus, resolving the phylogeny and taxonomy of the <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> is an ongoing effort, which has made (as of 2011) little progress. In the scientific literature, smaller subdivisions into putatively related species are sometimes applied, {{but there is no}} consistent and widely accepted taxonomic treatment for the genus as a whole.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{of adults}} is 35-40 mm. They are generally easy to recognize by the cryptically patterned forewings, the yellow background {{color of their}} hindwings, and the black pattern on the latter. This consists of a black band along the outer edge, save for the hindmost part where a separate black dot is found. Forewing hue varies a lot, but similar sympatric species usually have an additional black band running across the central hindwings. Unlike in many (but not all) other <b>underwing</b> <b>moths,</b> their tibiae are all spineless.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{species of}} Catocala have medium to large adults, cryptically {{coloured}} {{except for the}} hindwings, which are marked with stripes in orange, red, white, or even blue. In some, the hindwings are mostly blackish. Unlike what the common name [...] "underwings" [...] seems to suggest, the colour is brightest on the upperside. However, the bright hindwings are not visible at rest, being hidden under the dull forewings - hence the name. Due to their diversity and variety of colors and patterns, <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> are popular with collectors of Lepidoptera.|$|R
50|$|The locust underwing (Euparthenos nubilis) is {{a species}} of moth in the Erebidae family and {{the only member of}} its genus Euparthenos. The adults {{resemble}} some of the <b>underwing</b> <b>moths</b> of genus Catocala, which are fairly close relatives, in color, pattern, and the habit of resting on tree trunks. But E. nubilis can usually be immediately recognized by the 4 concentric black bands per hindwing, as opposed to one or two (at most 3) in Catocala. Color morphs of E. nubilis with altered pattern are known, however, and these may be hard to recognize without detailed examination.|$|R

5000|$|The Erebinae are a {{subfamily}} of moths in the Erebidae family. Erebine moths {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, but reach their greatest {{diversity in the}} tropics. While {{the exact number of}} species belonging to the Erebinae is not known, the subfamily is estimated to include around 10,000 species. Some well-known Erebinae include <b>Underwing</b> <b>moths</b> (Catocala), and Witch moths (Thermesiini). Many of the species in the subfamily have medium to large wingspans (7 to 10 cm, 3 to 4 inches), up to nearly 30 cm in the White Witch moth (Thysania agrippina), which has the widest wingspan of all Lepidoptera. Erebine caterpillars feed on a broad range of plants; many species feed on grasses and legumes, and a few are pests of castor bean, sugarcane, rice, as well as pistachios [...] and blackberries.|$|R
50|$|Catocala benjamini, Benjamin's <b>underwing,</b> is a <b>moth</b> of the Erebidae family. It {{is found}} in Arizona, Nevada, {{southern}} California and southern Utah.|$|R

50|$|Catocala electa, {{the rosy}} <b>underwing,</b> is a <b>moth</b> {{of the family}} Erebidae. The species {{can be found in}} Europe and Asia (ranging to Korea).|$|R
50|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna of {{the reserve}} has been surveyed in detail in 2002 and 2012, and surveyors found a rich and diverse fauna {{with an abundance of}} ancient woodland associated species. A total of 650 species have been identified and the reserve is now known to be of SSSI quality for saproxylic invertebrates (dead wood specialists). Of special interest is the rare fungus weevil Pseudeuparius sepicola, a Red Data Book species. The nationally scarce wood-cricket Nemobius sylvestris is very common in Briddlesford Copse and a population of the ash-black slug (Limax cinereoniger) was also recently discovered at the reserve - the largest terrestrial slug in the world. The rides and railway cuttings also provide a valuable habitat for a variety of woodland butterflies including silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and the dark crimson <b>underwing</b> <b>moth</b> (Catocala sponsa).|$|R
50|$|Rheum {{species have}} been {{recorded}} as larval food plants for some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, buff ermine, cabbage <b>moth,</b> large yellow <b>underwing,</b> and nutmeg <b>moth.</b>|$|R
