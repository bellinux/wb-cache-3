50|$|Low-temperature {{synthesis}} of clay minerals (with kaolinite as an example) has several aspects. In {{the first place}} the silicic acid to be supplied to the growing crystal must be in a monomeric form, i.e., silica should be present in very dilute solution (Caillère et al., 1957; Caillère and Hénin, 1962; Wey and Siffert, 1962; Millot, 1970).

As styrene-crosslinkable VE resins bisphenol A (BA) and novolac types (N), whereas as polyisocyanate a polymeric methylene diphenyl isocyanate (PMDI) were used. The structure and selected properties of the hybrid resins were determined and compared to those of the neat VEs and <b>polysilicate</b> filled polyurea (denoted as 3 P resin). Using VE for resin hybridization, which worked as an additional emulsifier for the WG/PMDI/phosphate system, resulted in a fine particle dispersion of the <b>polysilicate.</b> It was found that the type of VE affected not only the dispersion of WG (and thus of the <b>polysilicate)</b> but also the network formation of the polyurea/VE hybrids and their properties. Information about the structure of the <b>polysilicate</b> filled hybrid resins was gained from dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), scanning electron and atomic force microscopic measurements.

Geopolymer can be synthesized by polycondensation reaction of geopolymeric precursor, and alkali <b>polysilicates.</b> Literature demonstrates that the exact geopolymerization mechanism is not well understood because the geopolymerization process involves a substantially fast chemical reaction.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is the sol-gel preparation of the crystalline or amorphous orthosilicates of some bivalent metals, namely, copper orthosilicate (Cu 2 SiO 4), {{which seems to be}} a quite efficient catalyst, although it has not been synthesized yet. The main obstacles that prevent the sol-gel synthesis of orthosilicates include high metal/silica molar ratios in precursor mixtures. They cause (i) formation of the crystalline of metal oxides at intermediate stages of synthesis and (ii) a substantial difference between intermediate and final anion structures because of the polycondensation of silicate anions at the stages of gelation and drying. This can result in a double-stage character of synthesis, involving formation of metal <b>polysilicates</b> and a metal oxide as intermediates. The synthesis pattern employed by the authors was based on a combination of "anti-polycondensation" actions that had three components involved: a) 3 -aminopropylsilanetriol, a water-soluble silica precursor that demonstrates low polymerizability and high stability in any ambience; b) triethanolamine, a high-boiling chemically active agent that prevents metal hydroxide precipitation and inhibits polycondensation at initial stages of heat treatment; c) methyl triethylammonium hydroxide, a strong component that inhibits polycondensation processes at the stage of the solution drying. Metal nitrates M(NO 3) 2 (M=Cu, Mg, Zn, Cd) were employed as metal oxide precursors, while water was the solvent. Coating solutions were applied to glass, silica glass or silicon substrates and heated to 300, 500, 700 and 900 °C. The resulting silicate fi lms were studied using UV-VIS spectroscopy, FTIR, XPS and XRD methods. Molecular mass distribution of silicate anions in the films was measured using the molybdate method.

40|$|A very {{important}} step in water and in wastewater treatment is the coagulationflocculation process, which is widely used, due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Regardless {{of the nature of}} the treated sample (e. g. various types of water or wastewater) and the overall applied treatment scheme, coagulation-flocculation is usually included, either as pre-, or as post-treatment step. The efficiency of coagulation-flocculation strongly affects the overall treatment performance; hence, the increase of the efficiency of coagulation stage seems to be a key factor for the improvement of the overall treatment efficiency. Several research efforts have been devoted to improve the efficiency of coagulation-flocculation process the last 3 decades. The result of these efforts was the development of a relatively new category of coagulation reagents, the Inorganic Polymeric Flocculants (IPF’s) or pre-polymerized inorganic coagulants. They are prepared through the partial polymerization of the conventional coagulants (such as AlCl 3) and their properties were intensively examined and have proved to be more efficient than the conventional simpler ones, leading to cost and operative more effective treatment. A representative example is polyaluminium chloride (PACl), which is widely used the last 20 years in water or wastewater treatment. However, in spite of their improved properties, the pre-polymerized coagulants performance still remains inferior, when compared to the performance of organic polyelectrolytes, used e. g. in water treatment. Considering the several drawbacks related with the use of organic polymers (e. g. residual toxicity, increased treatment cost) and the need for more effective treatment, the need for coagulation reagents with improved properties is obvious. In recent years, the relevant research in the coagulation-flocculation field has focused mainly in understanding the behaviour and aquatic chemistry of pre-polymerized coagulants, such as polyaluminium chloride, and to the further improvement of their properties. The main reason for the higher efficiency of organic polymers is their higher molecular weight, which implies better flocculation properties. Therefore, it was assumed that the increase of the size and molecular weight of IPFs components would probably improve further their coagulation properties. Two different approaches were studied, the increase of the most effective Al-species content (i. e. Al 13) and the introduction of other compounds (inorganic or organic) in the pre-polymerized coagulants in order to produce new, composite coagulation reagents. In the present work, the second approach was studied, i. e. the modification of the composition of a pre-polymerized coagulant (such as PACl) through the introduction of appropriate additives. It is supposed that the new, composite coagulation reagents prepared through the modification of PACl will be superior to PACl regarding water or wastewater treatment. The additives used for this purpose were the <b>polysilicates</b> in the case of inorganic compounds and 3 different polyelectrolytes in the case of organic additives, a non-ionic (Magnafloc LT- 20), a cationic (p-DADMAC) and an anionic (Magnafloc LT- 25) polyelectrolyte. Initially preliminary preparation experiments were conducted and the optimum preparation conditions for the composite coagulants and for all 4 cases of additives were determined. These conditions were applied for the production of several different composite coagulants for each case, with different combinations of the molar ratio [OH]/[Al] (polymerization degree or basicity) and additives content and with the application of 2 preparation procedures (i. e. co-polymerization or composite polymerization). The properties of the prepared reagents were intensively examined with the use of several characterization methods, such as the ferron technique and the nuclear magnetic resonance (27 Al-NMR) for the determination of Al species distribution and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) for the observation of possible alterations in the chemical bonds of the composite coagulants, due to the addition of the aforementioned compounds. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy was also applied (XRD) for the determination of Al 13 and other possible Al species or other new species, possibly formed due to the presence of the additives. Moreover, the configuration of the dry products derived after dehydration of the prepared reagents was observed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the usefulness of}} sodium carboxymethyl celluloses (CMC) in promoting self-degradation of 200 °C-heated sodium silicate-activated slag/Class C fly ash cementitious material after contact with water. CMC emitted two major volatile compounds, CO 2 and acetic acid, creating a porous structure in cement. CMC also reacted with NaOH from sodium silicate to form three water-insensitive solid reaction products, disodium glycolate salt, sodium glucosidic salt, and sodium bicarbonate. Other water-sensitive solid reaction products, such as sodium <b>polysilicate</b> and sodium carbonate, were derived from hydrolysates of sodium silicate. Dissolution of these products upon contact with water generated heat that promoted cement’s self-degradation. Thus, CMC of high molecular weight rendered two important features to the water-catalyzed self-degradation of heated cement: One was the high heat energy generated in exothermic reactions in cement; {{the other was the}} introduction of extensive porosity into cement...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} fields of activity in cement chemistry relates {{to the study of the}} factors that determine the strength development in the hardened cement paste. A combination of factors such as the chemical nature, surface forces, surface area, morphology, porosity and other characteristics may influence in a complex way the strength properties of the hardened paste. Recent work has shown that the hydrated silicate in hardened cements exists not only as ortho but also as di, teri and <b>polysilicate</b> chains. It appears therefore that the mechanical properties may also depend on the degree of condensation of the silicate structure. The authors have attempted to explain the variation in the mechanical property of cement hydrated under different conditions, by variations in the chemical nature, the morphology and the degree of condensation in the hydrated silicates.
