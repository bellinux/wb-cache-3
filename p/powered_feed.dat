50|$|Wood Waste RecyclingThe {{wood waste}} {{operation}} {{consists of an}} electric grinder and trommel screen, {{and a series of}} electrically <b>powered</b> <b>feed,</b> transfer, and stacking conveyors. The operation processes clean wood loads hauled by customers, which are separated from mixed debris by staff or removed from the demolition debris processing operation. The wood waste is ultimately ground and screened to create wood chips and wood fines. Wood waste is used as biomass to power cogeneration facilities or marketed as mulch or soil amendments.|$|E
50|$|In 1940 Ernest and Mildred Weise {{and their}} son Robert bought the mill, which they {{operated}} as the Weise Milling Company. With {{the construction of the}} Mansfield Dam in 1957, and the already declining water level of the Big Raccoon Creek, the Weises converted the mill to an electric <b>powered</b> <b>feed</b> grain operation. A glazed block office was added on east side of the mill. 1969 brought the end of daily operations at the mill though products were still produced and sold to tourists and by mail order year-round. In 1972 the Weises purchased some burr stones from an old mill in New Palestine and reinstalled them at the Bridgeton Mill. The mill was then bought by Mike and Karen Roe in 1995. Along with help, and reciepes, from the Weise family, the mill continues to operate for special events.|$|E

40|$|Issue: A {{key process}} in {{preparing}} recovered wood waste for commodity feedstock and specialty products {{is to remove}} contaminants and reduce its screening size. Each equipment type varies concerning the forms of wood waste it can effectively handle and its production quality. Best Practice: Hogging (Grinding) Equipment Types. Hogging equipment's horsepower, physical hog size, and the wood waste type it processes set the limits for its throughput capacity. Hammer Hog: A hammer hog operates by pulverizing wood with either swinging or fixed “hammers. ” It then forces material through heavy steel sizing grates. The size of the grate openings determines the resulting product size, available in interchangeable size ranges adjustable down to very small particles (fines). The fixed hammers achieve force at the cutting surface because they attach to the rotor mass. The swinging hammers, because {{of their ability to}} apply variable force, tend to have greater tolerance for large, hard contaminants. Thus, they require less maintenance, although hammers and grates require regular maintenance. Hammer hogs are available with vertical or horizontal in-feed configurations. The horizontal in-feed typically features a <b>powered</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism. Mass Rotor Hog: This machine is a newer variety of primary reduction hog. The mass rotor hog consists of a heavy shaft that has, mounted at an angle, thick solid steel plates that have replaceable wear bars. Th...|$|E

40|$|Data center power {{infrastructure}} incurs massive capital costs, {{which typically}} exceed energy costs {{over the life}} of the facility. To squeeze maximum value from the infrastructure, researchers have proposed over-subscribing power circuits, relying on the observation that peak loads are rare. To ensure availability, these proposals employ power capping, which throttles server performance during utilization spikes to enforce safe power budgets. However, because budgets must be enforced locally—at each power distribution unit (PDU) —local utilization spikes may force throttling even when power delivery capacity is available elsewhere. Moreover, the need to maintain reserve capacity for fault tolerance on power delivery paths magnifies the impact of utilization spikes. In this paper, we develop mechanisms to better utilize installed power infrastructure, reducing reserve capacity margins and avoiding performance throttling. Unlike conventional high-availability data centers, where collocated servers share identical primary and secondary <b>power</b> <b>feeds,</b> we reorganize <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> to create shuffled power distribution topologies. Shuffled topologies spread secondary <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> over numerous PDUs, reducing reserve capacity requirements to tolerate a single PDU failure. Second, we propose Power Routing, which schedules IT load dynamically across redundant <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> to: (1) shift slack to servers with growing power demands, and (2) balance power draw across AC phases to reduce heating and improve electrical stability. We describe efficient heuristics for scheduling servers to PDUs (an NP-complete problem). Using data collected from nearly 1000 servers in three production facilities, we demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce the required power infrastructure capacity relative to conventional high-availability data centers by 32 % without performance degradation...|$|R

Use of double symmetric <b>power</b> <b>feed</b> around {{the center of the}} plasma electrode greatly reduced the voltage non-uniformity, and the shielded cables made stable power transport.
