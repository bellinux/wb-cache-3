50|$|<b>Pentagestrone</b> (INN), {{also known}} as 17α-hydroxyprogesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group that was never marketed. An acetate ester, <b>pentagestrone</b> acetate (Gestovis, Gestovister), has been marketed for clinical use. <b>Pentagestrone</b> was described in the literature in 1960.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentagestrone</b> acetate (brand names Gestovis, Gestovister), {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxyprogesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group that was described in the literature in 1960 and introduced by Vister in Italy in 1961. It is the 3-cyclopentyl enol ether of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate. <b>Pentagestrone</b> acetate, along with quingestrone (the 3-cyclopentyl enol ether of progesterone), {{is said to have}} very similar properties to those of dydrogesterone, a pure progestogen and close analogue of progesterone.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{cannot be}} esterified, {{progesterone}} possesses a ketone {{group at the}} C3 position, and for this reason, {{it is possible to}} etherify it; that is, progesterone ethers are chemically possible. Quingestrone (Enol-Luteovis) is a progesterone ether (specifically, the 3-cyclopentyl ether of progesterone) that has been marketed in Italy as an oral contraceptive. Quingestrone is a variant of progesterone with improved pharmacokinetics, including higher potency, oral activity, greater lipophilicity, and a longer half-life. Two other progestogens, <b>pentagestrone</b> (never marketed) and <b>pentagestrone</b> acetate (Gestovis, Gestovister), are the 3-cyclopentyl enol ethers of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Quingestrone, {{also known}} as {{progesterone}} 3-cyclopentyl enol ether (PCPE) or as 3-cyclopentyloxypregna-3,5-dien-20-one, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically the C3 cyclopentyl enol ether of progesterone. Quingestrone {{is closely related to}} <b>pentagestrone</b> acetate (17α-acetoxyprogesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether).|$|E
