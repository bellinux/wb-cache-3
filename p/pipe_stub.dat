2500|$|On 3 December 2010, the ATSB {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} report which contained a key finding of a manufacturing flaw: An area of fatigue cracking was found within a <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> that feeds oil to the engine HP/IP bearing structure. Bearing lubricating oil leaked from the crack, causing the subsequent engine fire and failure of the IPT disc. The fatigue fracture {{was a result of}} the misalignment of the <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> during the counter-boring process. That inaccurate alignment resulted in one side of the same <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> becoming too thin to resist fatigue fracturing. This [...] "could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue crack initiation and growth, oil leakage and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire," [...] according to the agency.|$|R
2500|$|The {{findings}} {{were determined to}} be a [...] "critical safety issue," [...] and the ATSB recommended immediate inspections of in-service Trent 900 engines. [...] On 8 December the ATSB reported that 45 Trent 900 engines had been inspected, and 3 of these engines had failed inspection and {{had been removed from}} service. [...] On 18 May 2011, the ATSB released an interim factual report which states that 53 Trent 900 engines were removed from service— 11 due to out-of-tolerance oil-feed <b>stub</b> <b>pipes</b> and 42 due to lack of measurement records relating to the oil-feed <b>stub</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of 1952 the cars were {{substantially}} rebuilt, including better cooling - most notably a greatly enlarged radiator aperture in the nose, better ventilation, and repositioning of the exhaust <b>pipe</b> <b>stubs.</b> The car had been deliberately designed with a low seating position, but Fangio, asked what changes he would like on the car, replied that amongst other things he would like a little higher seat, as he liked to see where he was going. The car was modified to Fangio's request and he drove the car intermittently throughout 1953. He later {{said that it was}} the most formidable car he ever drove during his career. At this stage the engines were developing more than 500 hp, touching 600 hp, albeit with a very peaky power curve. This power curve had been forecast by Rolls-Royce who had recommended that inter-stage throttling of the supercharger be incorporated to provide a curve more suited to road use. Berthon considered the addition an unnecessary complication, and this, and the alternative variable-angle stators at the supercharger's inlet - both used initially on the two-stroke Crecy - which had been developed and tested by Rolls-Royce for the engine, were not proceeded with.|$|R
25|$|When first built, the car used a Napier Lion {{engine of}} around 500bhp. It was of {{conventional}} form with a front-mounted vertical radiator {{and the driver}} behind the engine. The three banks of the W-12 engine were hidden behind bulges in the narrow bonnet, with exhaust <b>stub</b> <b>pipes</b> protruding.|$|R
2500|$|The {{investigation}} by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) indicated that [...] "fatigue cracking" [...] in a <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> within the engine resulted in oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led {{to the release of}} the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. It also said the issue is specific to the Trent 900.|$|R
50|$|In the DSM process, {{cyclohexane}} was {{heated to}} about 155 °C (311 °F) before passing {{into a series}} of six reactors. The reactors were constructed from mild steel with a stainless steel lining; when operating they held in total about 145 tonnes of flammable liquid at a working pressure of 8.8 kg/cm2 gauge (0.86 MPa gauge; 125 psig). In each of the reactors, compressed air was passed through the cyclohexane, causing {{a small percentage of the}} cyclohexane to oxidise and produce cyclohexanone, some cyclohexanol also being produced. Each reactor was slightly (approximately 14 inches, 350 mm) lower than the previous one, so that the reaction mixture flowed from one to the next by gravity through nominal 28-inch bore (DN 700 mm) <b>stub</b> <b>pipes</b> with inset bellows. The inlet to each reactor was baffled so that liquid entered the reactors at a low level; the exiting liquid flowed over a weir whose crest was somewhat higher than the top of the outlet pipe. The mixture exiting reactor 6 was processed to remove reaction products, and the unreacted cyclohexane (only about 6% was reacted in each pass) then returned to the start of the reactor loop.|$|R
50|$|The types A, C, D and F {{were all}} side-valve engines, with valves {{operated}} by push rods running exposed and {{parallel to the}} cylinder axes, driven within the V from a central, gear-driven camshaft above the crankshaft. All camshafts were hollow for lubrication. The cylinder cooling jackets surrounded the cylinders, then turned inward with flattened faces for inlet and exhaust manifolds and push rods. The exhaust stubs were vertical, each bank of cylinders feeding its own horizontal <b>pipe.</b> The inlet <b>stubs</b> entered the cylinder head at right angles. The earliest type A engines {{had a pair of}} inlet tubes, one for each bank and fed from a carburettor at the front. Slightly later model As and types C and F placed the carburettor between the cylinder banks, halfway along the engine axis. Fuel and air was passed to a spherical copper mixing chamber above the carburettor, then via four radial copper tubes which finally branched into pairs the feed the inlet ports symmetrically. The smaller type D retained the end positioned carburettor. These engines all had cast iron cylinders. The types A and C were very similar in construction as well as capacity, but a major change in crankshaft design was introduced with the smaller type D and inherited by the F. The A and C types had a crankshaft supported by only three plain bearings and the width of the central one required a greater space between the second and third cylinder of each bank, visibly dividing each into blocks of two. The crankshafts of the D and F types had five ball race bearings, one between each cylinder and two end bearings; the output thrust bearing was a double race to allow for pusher or tractor configurations. The new bearing arrangement permitted an equal cylinder spacing. The type FA was a type F with an extended crankshaft, mounted in a very prominent, conical crankcase extension. The type T, discussed below, had a similar extension, which in that case at least allowed a larger diameter thrust bearing to be used.|$|R
