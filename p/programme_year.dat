40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{programme implementation}} and outcomes for the developmental phase (2009 - 2011) of the Parent Child Home Programme (PCHP) in three domains: the programme, the Home Visitors, {{and children and}} their parents. Background The PCHP home visiting programme aims to improve school readiness of children at risk of educational disadvantage. A trained Home Visitor calls to a parent and child twice a week over two years. Each week the Home Visitors interact with the children, using the books and toys provided, and model oral language, reading and play. Parents are encouraged to continue this practice between visits. The Dublin Docklands PCHP, operating in four Liffeyside parishes, commenced in autumn 2007, based on a model developed in the United States. Unlike the US PCHP, the Docklands programme is delivered by local women, all mothers, rather than professionals. This was important to programme success: if not accepted locally {{it would have had}} difficulty reaching its goals. Methodology We undertook a longitudinal study of the Dublin Docklands PCHP that examined programme implementation and outcomes during PCHP’s pilot phase (2009 - 2011). Programme implementation records for two cohorts of children were assessed against the PCHP programme replication standards. Twenty-five children (two cohorts, one in <b>programme</b> <b>year</b> 2 and another commencing year 1) were administered developmental assessments on four occasions (three for those in year 2) at programme commencement, during and at programme end. Seventeen parents were interviewed about their programme experiences. Eleven Home Visitors participated in semi-structured interviews on three occasions. These interviews explored their pathway into and through the home visiting programme, experience of programme delivery, understanding of their job and its impact on their personal and professional lives. Two focus groups were conducted {{at the end of each}} <b>programme</b> <b>year,</b> where Home Visitors were asked about the experience of implementing the programme. In the final focus groups the Home Visitors were asked for their perspectives on the key issues arising from the research...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{physical education}} knowledge according to gender, secondary school <b>programme,</b> <b>year</b> {{of study and}} type of knowledge. The results of {{multivariate analysis of variance}} show that the programme of study had the highest impact (20. 2 % of the variance) on both dependent variables (conceptual and specific knowledge), the impact of gender was about half as high (11. 7 % of the variance), whereas the impact of the year of study was much lower (3. 5 % of the variance). The students from grammar school programmes had more knowledge than students from the other two secondary school programmes. Males scored higher than females, especially on specific knowledge. In technical and vocational programmes, there is no impact of the year of study on the knowledge exhibited by female students. As a result, physical education teachers should have more knowledge and skills in order to educate students about health-related physical fitness. They will need to acquire special didactic competences, particularly when teaching girls in technical and vocational secondary schools.

40|$|The Cultural Capital of Europe project aims to {{highlight}} and promote culture {{of a specific}} region in Europe during a calendar year. Umeå was chosen to become the Capital of Culture in 2014 and highlight the northern corner of Europe. A new “Open source” approach with the objective to increase participation and co-creation of different actors in the cultural capital year was introduced. This study examines media descriptions of the Samis and alternative cultural groups’ participation in the Cultural Capital year.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether performance {{in any of}} the Health Professions Admissions Test (HPAT) sections, most specifically the interpersonal understanding section, correlates with self-reported empathy levels in medical students. Setting: The study was conducted in University College Cork, Ireland. Participants 290 students participated in the study. Matching HPAT scores were available for 263 students. All male and female undergraduate students were invited to participate. Postgraduate and international students were excluded. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary measures: HPAT-Ireland and Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE) scores were compared including subsection analysis. Secondary measures: comparisons were made between groups such as gender and year of programme. Results: A total of 290 students participated. Males scored significantly higher than females for total HPAT-Ireland (U= 7329, z=− 2. 04, p 0. 05). There was no effect of <b>programme</b> <b>year</b> on JSE scores (all p> 0. 05). Conclusion: The introduction of the HPAT-Ireland test was partly designed to identify students with strong interpersonal skills. A significant finding {{of this study is that}} JSE values did not correlate with HPAT-Ireland scores. This study suggests no clear link between scores on a selection test, the HPAT-Ireland, which is designed to assess several skill domains including interpersonal skills, and scores on a psychometric measure of empathy, at any point during medical education...|$|E
40|$|Various {{researches}} revealed language learners’ preferences {{on language}} learning strategies vary {{due to a}} few reasons. However, studies on how good language learners usually learn and practise the target language will provide new perspectives for the current trends and developments of language learning and teaching (Lightbown & Spada, 2006), especially among those majoring in English language. Thus, this small-scale study aims to investigate how the undergraduates majoring in English language and Linguistics at University of Malaya employ language learning strategies to enhance their English language efficiently. Quantitative and qualitative research designs were used to identify the learners’ preferences on types of strategies, frequency of usage and in what ways the preferred language learning strategies among the learners vary with their <b>programme</b> <b>year</b> of study. Using Oxford’s (1990) Strategy Inventory of Language Learning (SILL) Version 7, the quantitative data were analysed {{in the form of}} average scores and percentages. Categorization and thematic analysis were used to analyse the qualitative data retrieved from the interview. The findings revealed that majority of the learners prefer social and metacognitive strategies more than other types of language learning strategies. They were indeed frequent users of strategies and this finding also was reflected in their results of self-rating on proficiency level. The participants from each year of study were found to have similar patterns on the preferred types of strategies and how they go about learning the language. This research contributes perspectives about strategies in language learning and awareness about the effectiveness of using strategies that can be considered as pertinent to develop learners’ achievements in language learning as well as its implications toward the educators, syllabus designers and researchers...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{learning}} outcomes achieved by Foundation <b>programme</b> (<b>Year</b> 0) students preparing over one academic year to progress to a three year Bachelor’s degree in biological science, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences, medicine, pharmacy or physics. The thesis reports {{the development of}} a range of teaching activities focussing on students’ chemical language. Knowledge of chemical language is vital to developing student understanding but is an under-researched area. The teaching activities comprise a range of language focused strategies. A unique corpus of student work (Foundation Corpus or FOCUS) from Year 0 to PhD level is developed that is used in a range of corpus linguistics based teaching activities. Other activities include word games, mini-whiteboards, modelling and directed activities related to text. Quantitative data were collected from eighty six students over two years by {{the development of a}} unique chemical language diagnostic test (CLDT). The test assesses understanding of a range of chemical language: scientific affixes, fundamental words (such as atom or molecule), acid and bases, kinetic theory, non-technical words, symbolic language and technical words. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from six students over four years by semi-structured interviews. The data consists of explanations of chemical scenarios and is analysed for students’ usage of chemical language. Twenty students undertake an eye tracker task that provides quantitative data on students’ eye movements when reading text. Outcomes indicate strong correlations between initial CLDT score and chemistry examination score at the end of Year 0. This suggests that students scoring poorly on chemical language face more challenges to reach the required grade to pass Year 0 than those with better linguistic skills. Evidence is provided for the existence of “chemical interlanguage” and discusses linguistic demand in multiple dimensions. The study reinforces the need to engage positively with chemical language acquisition, offering strategies for developing this and methods for its assessment. ...|$|E
