6000|$|We {{had stopped}} before {{a case of}} miniatures. In the front row were two {{somewhat}} larger than the others, and Isobel's first serious attempts. Behind each was stuck a little <b>ivory</b> <b>board</b> bearing the magic word [...] "Sold." ...|$|R
50|$|On either 16 or 17 April Mozart paid a {{visit to}} the consistorial {{councillor}} Christian Gottfried Körner, a friend of Friedrich Schiller. Körner's sister-in-law Dora Stock was a talented artist and took the occasion to sketch a portrait of Mozart, shown here, in silverpoint on <b>ivory</b> <b>board.</b> This may have been the last portrait of the composer to be produced.|$|R
25|$|In April 1789, {{when she}} {{produced}} this portrait, Dora Stock {{was living in}} Dresden with Minna and Gottfried, still imagining herself to be engaged to the distant Huber. At this time, Mozart was passing through town and giving concerts, {{as part of the}} Berlin journey he made during Spring 1789. On either 16 or 17 April 1789, Mozart made a social visit to the Körner home. Stock took the occasion to sketch a portrait of Mozart in silverpoint on <b>ivory</b> <b>board,</b> shown here.|$|R
50|$|If the dusting is {{not enough}} the ivory can be cleaned {{with a mixture of}} water and mild soap (such as Ivory Snow or WA <b>Paste).</b> Never soak <b>ivory</b> as the water could cause the dirt to become more visible by {{embedding}} it into cracks or pores.|$|R
5000|$|Consequently, Standley and {{his shop}} had an {{enormous}} influence on {{what was perceived as}} [...] "authentic" [...] to these cultures. While he always accurately presented (for example) <b>ivory</b> cribbage <b>boards</b> as tourist goods, he was probably himself not aware {{of the extent to which}} ivory miniatures and carved tusks from Alaska or Athapaskan beadwork were also hybrid goods produced for the tourist trade that had begun with the gold rush. Similarly, his exhibits in his store and elsewhere did not distinguish between pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.|$|R
50|$|The Ivory Coast {{national}} rugby union team, nicknamed Les Éléphants, represents Côte d'Ivoire (also {{known as}} Ivory Coast) in rugby union. The team is recognised as Ivory Coast by the International Rugby <b>Board.</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast {{participate in the}} annual Africa Cup and are considered a third tier rugby team.|$|R
50|$|The State Government Museum {{is inside}} the fort. It was {{opened to the public}} in 1985. It {{consists}} of objects of art, archaeology, prehistory, weapons, sculptures, bronzes, wood carvings, handicrafts, numismatics, philately, botany, geology and zoology. Historical monuments of the erstwhile composite North Arcot District are contained in the gallery. Special exhibits include a bronze double sword from Vellore Taluk dating to 400 BC, stone sculptures from the late Pallava to Vijayanagar periods, <b>ivory</b> chess <b>boards</b> and coins used by the last Kandian King of Sri Lanka, Vikrama Raja Singha.

It is 4 feet 8 inches in height ...|$|R
25|$|BBS {{systems on}} other systems {{remained}} popular, especially home computers, largely because they catered {{to the audience}} of users running those machines. The ubiquitous Commodore 64 (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs were Blue <b>Board,</b> <b>Ivory</b> BBS, Color64 and CNet 64. In the early 1990s, {{a small number of}} BBSes were also running on the Commodore Amiga. Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, Amiexpress, C-Net, StormforceBBS, Infinity and Tempest. There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the Atari 800, then the 800XL, and eventually the 1040ST. The earlier machines generally lacked hard drive capabilities, which limited them primarily to messaging.|$|R
