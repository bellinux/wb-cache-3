40|$|The {{permanent}} magnet AC motor trapezoidal (BLDC motor) is not strictly DC motor, {{which uses a}} pulsed DC fed to the stator field windings to create a rotating magnetic field. Therefore, the motor needs an electronic commutation to provide the rotating field. A pair of switches must be turned on sequentially in the correct order to energize a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>windings.</b> If the incorrect order is applied, then the BLDC motor will not operate properly. This paper presents a smart guideline {{to ensure that the}} order to energize a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>windings</b> is correct. To ensure the guideline, FPGA based a simple commutation state machine scheme to control BLDC motor is presented. The experiment results have shown that the guideline is correct. The commutation scheme was successfully realized using Altera's APEX 20 KE FPGA to control BLDC motor in both of forward/reverse rotations or forward/reverse regenerative braking properly. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} simple {{analysis}} based on properties of the axial field generated by symmetrical multipoles to reveal all possible distributions <b>of</b> two coaxial <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> circular <b>windings,</b> which result in systems featuring zero octupole and 32 pole magnetic moments (six-order systems). Homogeneity of magnetic field of selected systems is analyzed. It {{has been found that}} one of the derived systems generates homogenous magnetic field whose volume is comparable to that yielded by the eight-order system. The influence of the current distribution and the windings placement on the field homogeneity is considered. The table, graphs and equations given in the paper facilitate the choice of the most appropriate design for a given problem. The systems presented may find applications in low field electron para-magnetic resonance imaging, some functional f-MRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging) and bioelectromagnetic experiments requiring the access to the working space from all directions. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for fault detection, faulted {{phase and}} winding {{identification of a}} three-winding power transformer based on the induced voltages in the electrical power system. The ratio of the induced voltages of the primary-secondary, primary-tertiary and secondary-tertiary windings {{is the same as}} the corresponding turns ratio during normal operating conditions, magnetic inrush, and over-excitation. It differs from the turns ratio during an internal fault. For a single phase and a three-phase power transformer with wye-connected windings, the induced voltages of each <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>windings</b> are estimated. For a three-phase power transformer with delta-connected windings, the induced voltage differences are estimated to use the line currents, because the delta winding currents are practically unavailable. Six detectors are suggested for fault detection. An additional three detectors and a rule for faulted phase and winding identification are presented as well. The proposed algorithm can not only detect an internal fault, but also identify the faulted phase and winding of a three-winding power transformer. The various test results with Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) -generated data show that the proposed algorithm successfully discriminates internal faults from normal operating conditions including magnetic inrush and over-excitation. This paper concludes by implementing the algorithm into a prototype relay based on a digital signal processor...|$|E
40|$|The term {{precision}} linear actuator, {{direct drive}} (PLADD) {{refers to a}} robust linear actuator designed {{to be capable of}} repeatedly performing, over a lifetime of the order of 5 to 10 years, positioning maneuvers that include, variously, submicron increments or slews of the order of a centimeter. The PLADD is capable of both long stroke (120 mm) and high resolution (repeatable increments of 20 nm). Unlike precise linear actuators of prior design, the PLADD contains no gears, levers, or hydraulic converters. The PLADD, now at the prototype stage of development, is intended for original use as a coarse-positioning actuator in a spaceborne interferometer. The PLADD could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which there are requirements for long stroke and high resolution: potential applications include medical imaging and fabrication of semiconductor devices. The PLADD (see figure) includes a commercially available ball-screw actuator driven directly by a commercially available three-phase brushless DC motor. The ball-screw actuator comprises a spring-preloaded ball nut on a ball screw that is restrained against rotation as described below. The motor is coupled directly (that is, without an intervening gear train) to a drive link that, in turn, is coupled to the ball nut. By eliminating the gear train, the direct-drive design eliminates the complexity, backlash, and potential for misalignment associated with a gear train. To prevent inadvertent movement, there is a brake that includes flexured levers compressed against the drive link by preload springs. This is a power-off brake: There are also piezoelectric stacks that can be activated to oppose the springs and push the levers away from the drive link. Hence, power must be applied to the piezoelectric stacks to release the drive link from braking. To help ensure long operational life, all of the mechanical drive components are immersed in an oil bath within hermetically sealed bellows. The outer end of the bellows holds the outer end of the ball screw, thereby preventing rotation of the ball screw. Positioning is controlled by an electronic control system that includes digital and analog subsystems that interact with the motor and brake and with two sensor/encoder units: a Hall-effect-sensor rotation encoder and a linear glass-scale encoder. This system implements a proportional + integral + derivative control algorithm that results in variation of voltage commands to each <b>of</b> the three <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>windings</b> <b>of</b> the brushless DC motor. In one of two alternative control modes, the voltages are applied to the windings in a trapezoidal commutation scheme on the basis of timing signals obtained from the Hall-effect sensors; this scheme yields relatively coarse positioning - 24 steps per motor revolution. The second control mode involves a sinusoidal commutation scheme in which the output of the linear glass-scale encoder is transposed to rotational increments to yield much finer position feedback - more than 400, 000 steps per revolution...|$|R

A full wave rectifier is connected to the gate windings and a resistor is connected across the rectifier to provide a DC voltage to cross it representative of the current flow through the control winding. A DC power supply is provided to supply power to the square wave voltage source. A diode is connected between each end of the primary winding of the transformer and one polarity of the DC power supply to commutate the reactive current resulting from the counter emf generated in the reactor back to the DC supply to eliminate potentially damaging reactive voltage spikes which would otherwise appear at the output of the square wave generator and conserve energy...|$|R
