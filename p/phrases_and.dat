We also analyze why <b>phrase</b> <b>and</b> proximity terms are far more effective for web retrieval than for ad-hoc retrieval. ...|$|R

5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial <b>phrases</b> <b>and</b> dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of <b>phrases</b> <b>and</b> sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|Most of Kartodikromo's fictional works {{took place}} in Bandung or Surabaya. He was an early Indonesian example of the social realist movement. Like most {{nationalist}} writers at the time, Kartodikromo preferred writing in Malay (the predecessor of modern Indonesian) rather than his native Javanese; however, he did write several pieces in Javanese. While the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise Malay, Kartodikromo experimented with the language, using words, <b>phrases,</b> <b>and</b> scenes which {{had never before been}} used.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules by}} which signs can be {{combined}} to form words and phrases are called syntax or grammar.

5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts, <b>phrases</b> <b>and</b> names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation. As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E

5|$|Lie and {{his family}} {{returned}} to Buitenzorg in 1866. At the time there were no schools offering a European-style education in the city, and thus {{he was sent to}} a Chinese-run school. For three years, in which the youth studied under three different headmasters, he was made to repeat traditional Hokkien <b>phrases</b> <b>and</b> copy Chinese characters without understanding them. Tio suggests that Lie obtained little knowledge at the school, and until his death Lie was unable to understand Chinese. During his time in Buitenzorg, he studied painting under Raden Saleh, a friend of his father's. Although he reportedly showed skill, he did not continue the hobby as his mother disapproved. He also showed a propensity for traditional literary forms such as pantun (a form of poetry) and was fond of creating his own.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or <b>phrases,</b> <b>and</b> involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

5|$|The album has a melodic form, and employs pentatonic {{scales for}} melodic development, a {{practice}} common in African and African-American folk music. Goin' Home is mostly tempoless, {{as most of}} the pieces are performed in a rubato-like free rhythm. Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts, particularly at the end of bars, <b>phrases,</b> <b>and</b> sections in a piece. Most of the spirituals have a thirty-two-bar form, with the eight-bar section comprising four two-bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{device of}} ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, <b>phrases</b> <b>and</b> sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to {{the point that they}} could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} official languages (German, French, and Italian) have terms, {{not used}} outside of Switzerland, known as Helvetisms. German Helvetisms are, roughly speaking, {{a large group}} of words typical of Swiss Standard German, which do not appear either in Standard German, nor in other German dialects. These include terms from Switzerland's surrounding language cultures (German Billett from French), from similar term in another language (Italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from German Aktion). The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms, which are equally known as Helvetisms. The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary, <b>phrases,</b> <b>and</b> pronunciation, but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise. Duden, one of the prescriptive sources for Standard German, is aware of about 3000 Helvetisms. Current French dictionaries, such as the Petit Larousse, include several hundred Helvetisms.|$|E
