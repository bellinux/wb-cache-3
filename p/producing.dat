5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (<b>producing</b> compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (<b>producing</b> 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (<b>producing</b> 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in <b>producing</b> air-borne sounds. Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse {{more in a}} dense environment (such as foliage), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations. The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for <b>producing</b> sound in insects.|$|E
