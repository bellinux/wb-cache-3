40|$|OBJECTIVES. <b>Period</b> <b>effects</b> of {{per capita}} {{consumption}} of alcohol and divorce rates are assessed for change in quantity and frequency among age/sex groups in multiple longitudinal studies. METHODS. Twenty-five studies of quantity and 29 studies of frequency are used. Studies are from 15 nations and cover periods of 1 to 21 years. Models predict the standardized mean difference for quantity and frequency based on <b>period</b> <b>effects</b> and group-level and methodological variables. RESULTS. When both the <b>period</b> <b>effects</b> of {{per capita consumption}} and the divorce rate are considered, the divorce rate significantly predicts change in quantity and frequency. An increase in the divorce rate {{is associated with a}} stronger decrease in frequency among younger people; men are more likely than women to decrease their frequency of drinking when divorce rates rise. CONCLUSIONS. Multiple societal-level factors should be considered critical in influencing the drinking patterns of groups. These results suggest that an increase in the divorce rate is associated with more "dry" social contexts, characterized possibly by drinking patterns of a more "volitive" nature (i. e., heavier quantity per occasion and less frequent drinking) ...|$|R

We used multi-year national cross-sectional surveys, the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions for 2001, 2004, and 2007, and estimated the <b>period</b> <b>effect</b> on the health of employed workers aged 18 – 65 years. The prevalence of ill-health indicators (poor self-rated health status, subjective symptoms, and the number of respondents receiving consultations from medical doctors and other health professionals) significantly increased during this period.

Furthermore, after adjusting for income level as an individual factor, deteriorating trends remained for the poor self-rated health status of male employees, subjective symptoms of female employees, and receiving medical consultations for both genders. The health status of employed workers in Japan deteriorated, especially from 2004 to 2007, regardless of age and cohort effects.

Background: The objective {{of this study was to}} examine long-term trends in rates of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality, a leading cause of mortality in Hungary. The study examined the effects of age, period, and cohort on IHD mortality rates and compared mortality rates between the capital (Budapest) and non-capital counties. Methods: Data on IHD deaths and population censuses were obtained from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. Age-period-cohort analysis utilized nine age-group classes for ages 40 to 84 years, eight time periods from 1970 to 2009, and 16 birth cohorts from 1886 to 1969. Results: Age-adjusted IHD mortality rates for men and for women generally increased from 1970 to 1993 and from 1980 to 1999, respectively, decreasing thereafter for both sexes. IHD mortality rates for men and for women from Budapest were lower from 1991 and from 1970, respectively, than corresponding rates in non-capital counties, with the difference increasing after 1999.

Using a large life-history data-set on the full career trajectories of German males from the birth cohorts 1929 - 31, 1939 — 41, and 1949 — 51 up to age at interview, together with several time-series indicating the development of the social and economic structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, the identification problem in models estimating cohort, life-course, and <b>period</b> <b>effects</b> {{is at the same time}} solved.
