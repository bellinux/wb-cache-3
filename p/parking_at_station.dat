50|$|The SmartRider is a {{smartcard}} {{incorporating a}} microchip and internal aerial, allowing the smartcard {{to communicate with}} processors located on Transperth buses and ferries and <b>at</b> railway <b>stations.</b> The microchip enables value to be loaded onto the card, as well as allowing the journey details to be recorded and the appropriate fare deducted from the stored value on the card. The card is {{able to pay for}} bus, ferry or train travel and can also be used at some Pay 'n' Display railway station car parks to pay for parking. Though {{it can be used to}} pay for <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> <b>stations,</b> <b>parking</b> payments expire <b>at</b> midnight on the day of payment and there is no way to pay for the following day's parking before returning to the station. Therefore, night shift workers are not able to <b>park</b> <b>at</b> <b>stations.</b> This serious oversight is yet to be addressed by Transperth.|$|R

50|$|This {{station was}} called Oakland West until 1982; {{it opened in}} September 1974 with the {{commencement}} of service through the Transbay Tube. Since early 2014, <b>parking</b> commuters <b>at</b> this <b>station</b> pay $6 per day on the weekdays. This was implemented to raise revenue, to bring <b>parking</b> costs <b>at</b> the <b>station</b> in line with <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> other local garages, {{and to ensure that}} <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> the <b>stations</b> was going to be used for BART patrons only, parking spaces would have had to be 'validated' inside the BART paid area.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the other}} major {{problems}} noted in the report was the availability of <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> <b>stations</b> along the line. One of the key features of the Greenwood Station was to be additional parking, which would remove any need to construct a multi-story <b>parking</b> facility <b>at</b> Whitfords and Warwick Stations. That was {{in addition to the}} construction of a further 240 car <b>parking</b> bays <b>at</b> Whitfords <b>Station,</b> costing $780,000 in 2000, on the southern side of the station. Construction of a multi-story <b>parking</b> structure <b>at</b> Warwick was not considered as an option due to a number of social and environmental concerns.|$|R

50|$|The {{line was}} {{designated}} by the Department for Transport as a community rail line in September 2006. This aims to increase revenue and reduce costs. Among possible options are increasing the car <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> <b>stations,</b> looking <b>at</b> ways to increase the train frequency, and assisting the Dartmoor Railway to operate a connecting service between Yeoford and Okehampton.|$|R

50|$|A new 1,424-space {{parking garage}} {{located on the}} station's east side opened on August 14, 2008. There are 3,617 <b>parking</b> spaces <b>at</b> the <b>station.</b> The former surface parking lot off North Kings Highway {{is the center of}} an ongoing {{residential}} and business redevelopment project. <b>Parking</b> <b>at</b> Huntington <b>Station</b> costs $4.85 all day on weekdays, but is free on weekends and federal holidays.|$|R

50|$|A new 85-bay car <b>park</b> <b>at</b> the <b>station</b> {{was opened}} in November 2013 - funded by South Yorkshire PTE, this cost Â£500,000 and is located behind the {{northbound}} platform.|$|R
