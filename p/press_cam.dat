50|$|Mounted on {{the frame}} under the right portion of the side cover housing is the mainspring, a heavy V-spring. Its greater arm (lower) engages a notch in the right fork of the hammer to drive it forward when {{released}} by the sear. Its lesser arm (upper) continuously <b>presses</b> a <b>cam</b> upward that engages a slot in the under surface of the breechblock slide when the action is closed.|$|R
25|$|A four-slide, {{also known}} as a multislide, multi-slide, or four-way, is a {{metalworking}} machine tool used in the high-volume manufacture of small stamped components from bar or wire stock. The press is most simply described as a horizontal stamping <b>press</b> that uses <b>cams</b> to control tools. The machine is used for progressive or transfer stamping operations.|$|R
50|$|This type of cam, in {{the form}} of a {{symmetric}} heart symbol, is used to return a shaft holding the cam to a set position by pressure from a roller. They were used for example on early models of Post Office Master clocks to synchronise the clock time with Greenwich Mean Time when the activating follower was <b>pressed</b> onto the <b>cam</b> automatically via a signal from an accurate time source.|$|R

This {{clock was}} made with a {{synchronising}} mechanism, consisting of a heart shaped cam returnable to its zero position by the operation of a roller bearing being <b>pressed</b> onto the <b>cam</b> by a solenoid, driven by an external signal relayed by land line from the GPO Chronopher [...] at St.Martin's le grand, which in turn, received it from the Greenwich Observatory.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{according}} to the requirements of some cam component in rotary press, cubic NURBS spline is used to generate the contour of cam after calculating every control point on the basis of movement requirement of driven part. And software ADAMS is used to verify the calculation result. Results show this method is an effective way for manufacturers of rotary <b>press</b> to generate <b>cam</b> contour, which can improve the performance of cam mechanism and save much time...|$|R
50|$|Connected to the {{midpoint}} of the rotating lever is a long metal arm. The motion of the lever causes this arm to be forced rearward, pushing the entire breech mechanism with it. The rear end of this mechanism <b>presses</b> on the <b>cam,</b> forcing the bolt upward and unlocking it. Continued motion slides the bolt rearward against the spring, while also operating the mechanism that feeds the ammunition belt and readies the next round. When it reaches the end of its motion the spring pushes everything forward again, carrying the new bullet with it and seating it in the barrel before locking again.|$|R
5000|$|There are two rare {{variants}} {{that use}} the roller cam principle. For locations where centre-pull is inappropriate, the side-pull [...] "toggle cam brake" [...] was developed. [...] Also a first-class cantilever, it uses a single-sided sliding cam (the toggle) against one arm that is attached by {{a link to the}} other arm. As the <b>cam</b> <b>presses</b> against the follower, the force is also transmitted to the other arm via the link. And specifically for suspension forks where the housing must terminate at the brake frame, the side-pull [...] "sabre cam brake" [...] was developed. In the sabre cam design, the cable end is fixed and the housing moves the single-sided cam.|$|R
5000|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided sliding cam. (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) Each arm has a cam follower. As the <b>cam</b> <b>presses</b> against the follower it forces the arms apart. As {{the top of each}} arm moves outward, the brake shoe below the pivot is forced inward against the rim.There is much in favor of the roller cam brake design. Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the causes}} of {{malnutrition}} among the rural inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa is the high cost of dietary fats that are necessary to maintain normal body functions. Though the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN recommends an annual intake of 9. 6 liters of dietary fats a year per person, some areas of Africa consume only about 1. 5 liters annually. Many members of these communities lack the resources to purchase imported edible oils; locally produced peanut oil would provide a cheaper alternative. In addition, peanut production is particularly beneficial to farmers, as peanut plants enrich the soil they grow in. Once they have a steady supply of peanuts, the problem facing farmers is the inability to efficiently extract the oil from the nuts. The current design for human-powered rapid extraction is the Bielenberg ram press, which uses a lever to generate the required pressure needed to extract the oil. However, this design is not optimal for two reasons: it requires significant upper body strength to operate, and also, incorrect operation of the lever leads to {{only a fraction of the}} peanuts' oil content being extracted. For these reasons, this thesis focuses on a design modification originally proposed by a team in D-Lab Spring 2006. (cont.) While the oil extracting mechanism was kept intact, the lever was replaced by a cam-and-follower system driven by treadles. By moving the driving motion from the upper body to the lower body of the user, the new design aims to address the ergonomics issue present in the Bielenberg ram <b>press.</b> The <b>cam</b> also allows optimization of the pressure profile for the peanuts. Research performed by Ravi Patel in 2007 has shown that a rapid buildup followed by a long period of followed by a gradual advancing of the piston will create the desired pressure characteristics to maximize output. An earlier attempt to convert the Bielenberg ram press into a treadle design yielded several insights into how the design could be improved. These insights have led to many design modifications, which are incorporated into the proposed redesign. This redesign is aimed at improving performance, reducing cost, and increasing the manufacturability of the press. by Daipan Lee. Thesis (S. B.)
