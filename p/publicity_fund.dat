5000|$|In May 2009, Linden Lab {{announced}} they were [...] "grandfathering" [...] OpenSpace sims (now rebranded as [...] "Homesteads"), after a protracted protest movement caused a major amount of negative <b>publicity</b> and <b>funded</b> potential litigation.|$|R
40|$|The {{mediation}} {{movement has}} been given <b>publicity,</b> <b>funds</b> of taxpayers, and support by propagating simplistic notions of the “adversary” system and of what lawyers do on a daily basis. Conversely, lawyers have often attempted to neutralise this rival profession by (as major doorkeepers to serious family disputes) wilful ignorance of their own behaviour, ignorant criticism of mediator behaviour, anecdotal warfare and attempts to co-opt mediation under their own monopolistic umbrella. This paper reflects upon the behaviour of both family lawyers and family mediators {{with the aim of}} assisting each group understand the other. Both groups have much to learn from studying the other. The legal profession has only begun to study itself - some of its members remain unduly fearful of demystification...|$|R
50|$|The {{first game}} {{developed}} under the Cryo Interactive moniker was the hit Dune, which granted {{the newly formed}} software company both <b>publicity</b> and <b>funding</b> for further games under Virgin until 1996, when Cryo started self-publishing inside the European market, and in North America through then partially owned Canadian publisher DreamCatcher Interactive.|$|R
25|$|Boll has {{received}} significant negative <b>publicity</b> regarding this <b>funding</b> method, {{attributed to a}} loophole in the German tax laws that was finally closed in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The PlayPump {{received}} heavy <b>publicity</b> and <b>funding</b> {{when first}} introduced, but {{has since been}} criticized for being too expensive, too complex to maintain or repair in low-resource settings, too reliant on child labor, and overall less effective than traditional handpumps. WaterAid, {{one of the biggest}} water charities in the world, opposes the PlayPump for these reasons.|$|R
40|$|The word internationalism {{originally}} {{referred to}} relationships between nations and states, but came quite early to mean relationships of solidarity {{between people and}} peoples across or despite national boundaries, inter-state conflicts and economic competition. Over the past few centuries {{it has been a}} constant feature of social movement practice, from the 1649 Leveller mutiny against joining Cromwell’s campaign in Ireland to the 1984 – 87 Dublin shopworkers’ strike against handling South African produce- or contemporary international solidarity with struggles in Mexico, Kobane or Ferguson. International solidarity has been hugely important in changing the terms of politics. External supporters often provide crucial sources of legitimacy, <b>publicity,</b> <b>funding</b> or knowledge – but they also tell local activists that they are not alone, that what they do resonates on a world stage and that official attempts to dismiss their issues do not convince everyone. Conversely, supporting struggles abroad can be a tool for educating movement participants, thinking outside the particular state’s political discourses and arrangements...|$|R

50|$|After {{the passage}} of the JOBS Act, Macias has been {{publishing}} a series of white papers that compile research and statistics from independent sources to evaluate the profitability of <b>publicity</b> for hedge <b>funds,</b> private equity, and other alternative investment vehicles. Although his firm offers the marketing services of both publicity and advertising, his firm's research points to the conclusion that publicity has a higher return on investment than advertising. Although financial <b>publicity</b> and <b>fund</b> marketing are not the primary focus of Macias PR, Macias' global agency owns and operates three subdivision domains that are dedicated to financial media strategy - MarketYourFund, HedgeFundPublicity, and HedgeFundPR. Their latest white paper uses a case study from an asset management client to evaluate the scope of a financial publicity campaign - this research is available to the public.|$|R
40|$|In 2004 an {{interdisciplinary}} <b>publicity</b> <b>funded</b> {{project on the}} effectiveness and durability of biocides in building coatings was started at the Fraunhofer-Institute for Building Physics in Holzkirchen, Germany. Material components, building coatings and biocide combinations were chosen and samples for outdoor weathering experiments were also designed, all in cooperation with partners from the industry. About 350 biocide-equipped samples together with control specimens without biocide were exposed to real climatic conditions at two locations in Germany. Emerging microbiological growth on the samples was assessed, according to a self-developed special scale. The periodic assessment tool place in monthly/two monthly (first location) and half-year cycles (second location), respectively. For different samples of the biological colonization could be detected. Whereas the conditions in Germany for growth on outdoor surfaces are best in the autumn, they stagnate or diminish in the dry seasons, winter and summer. All biocide equipped coatings showed, as expected, a retarded growth. However, some characteristic differences could be recognized which could be assigned to different features of the coatings and to different combinations of biocides...|$|R
2500|$|With Feldman as President, in 2002, AFT delegates {{approved}} a four-point plan: 1) building a [...] "culture of organizing" [...] throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) {{engaging in a}} series of <b>publicity,</b> legislative, <b>funding</b> and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work, and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad. Feldman moved quickly to ensure that the plan was implemented.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, he and {{his brother}} Aubrey formed the Drury Brothers Company, an {{advertising}} and public relations agency. That same year, the organizers of the Save-the-Redwoods League, many of whom knew Drury from the university, asked Drury Brothers to manage the League. Newton Drury became executive secretary in charge of <b>publicity</b> and <b>fund</b> raising, a position he held for twenty years. Drury and the league obtained a six-million dollar bond measure passed to buy California redwood groves.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of flagship species as a conservation tool is controversial, and amphibians {{are not usually}} regarded as meeting the strategic criteria that flagships demand. Capitalizing on the historical, cultural and economic importance of the Axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum at Lake Xochimilco, Mexico, a conservation programme for this species and its habitat was developed using the Axolotl as a flagship. The threats to the lake are complex and stem from the unsustainable use of its resources. The needs and livelihoods of local stakeholders must therefore {{be taken into account}} before attempting to address the threats. The programme therefore focused on developing nature tourism by training local boatmen (remeros) in environmental interpretation. Surveys showed that the boatmen increased their incomes and job satisfaction after training, and that the environmental interpretation programme improved relevant knowledge and awareness of visitors. Although ongoing threats mean that reintroduction of captive-bred Axolotls is not appropriate, zoos with captive populations of Axolotls supported the programme regionally and internationally by providing <b>publicity,</b> <b>funds,</b> staff expertise, training support and themed educational activities. By raising both funds and awareness for the wider conservation of Lake Xochimilco, the Axolotl is probably the first amphibian flagship to be launched successfully. ...|$|R
50|$|But the {{concession}} suffered from particularly poor <b>publicity,</b> with marketing <b>funds</b> used entirely for MFI's own advertising and {{the refusal of}} DSG to include the brand in their own Currys campaigns. Therefore Hygena at Currys relied almost entirely on word of mouth marketing.|$|R
2500|$|Much of the <b>publicity</b> and <b>funding</b> for the Pisgah Home {{movement}} {{came from}} Yoakum's {{work as a}} faith healer and an early Pentecostal evangelist, traveling to many locations in California, the Eastern United States and Europe. [...] His work as a healer received praise in many religious publications, and a secular writer noted {{that some of the}} lame and blind who came to Pisgah Home [...] "left wheel chairs, crutches, braces, and canes to be hung in impressive testimony along the walls." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} the club has fallen into disrepair, and in May 2007, Warren Smith, Chairman of LPC Living and HRH Duke of Gloucester, {{launched}} an appeal to raise £1 million to restore the building to its former glory. The club received <b>publicity</b> and <b>funds</b> after being featured in the Channel 4 series The Secret Millionaire in November 2007. Property developer Chek Whyte initially donated £15,000 towards repairs {{as part of the}} programme, then subsequently paid for roof repairs and has become involved with the club long-term.|$|R
50|$|The {{most recent}} form of Merely Players {{coalesced}} in 1984 when Morse mounted a nationwide tour of Canada to raise both <b>publicity</b> and <b>funds</b> for the Performing Arts Lodges of Canada (PAL); retirement centers for performers (actors, singers, dancers, and others) who {{are connected to}} the performing arts. Following the tour, he continued to perform the show throughout North America for the next two decades, between television and film projects, including {{on a number of occasions}} to raise both funds and awareness for Parkinson's disease treatment and research. Morse died in February 2008.|$|R
500|$|During the Great Depression, {{residents}} of the city contemplated abandoning the airport {{because of the cost}} of maintenance, but in 1935 Brothers Fred and Al Key, managers of the airport, thought of a way to keep the airport operating. From June 4 until July 1, 1935, the brothers flew over the city in their plane, the [...] "Ole Miss." [...] The record they established in their 27 days aloft, totaling 653 hours and 34 minutes, attracted enough <b>publicity</b> and <b>funds</b> to the city to keep the airport running. Key Field is therefore named after the brothers, whose flight endurance record remains unbroken in conventional flight.|$|R
50|$|The town {{previously}} had war memorials {{in the form}} of a memorial garden in the cemetery and the memorial hall on Tinker's Field. In October 2004 a new memorial was unveiled in the town, a simple pedestal topped by a bronze of hands holding up a globe. The opening was the culmination of a five-year <b>publicity</b> and <b>fund</b> raising campaign, initiated by local resident Jay Cunningham who felt that the garden and hall were not prominent enough. The design of the memorial was by Lance Corporal Alan Wilson of the Wootton Bassett army cadets, chosen by public vote, and then sculpted by local artist Vivian ap Rhys Price.|$|R

30|$|Cancer/Medical {{establishment}} {{is referred to}} the most powerful decision making group within the Government (NIH/NCI-FDA-CDC-DHHS), Big pharma, major organizations (AACR, ACS, ASCO, AMA), cancer research and treatment centers, major medical schools. Members of establishment (5 – 10 [*]×[*] 103) with carrier longevity of 35 – 65  years are decision makers in charge of research directions, <b>publicity</b> and <b>funding.</b> The temporary or permanent handlers of establishment (directors of institutes, divisions or departments, deputies and staff (30 – 100 [*]×[*] 103) and the world’s largest lobbying group (3 – 5 [*]×[*] 106) carry out the directions of members of establishment. War on cancer has been made as an imaginary problem that cannot be solved for over six decades [5, 7, 16].|$|R
50|$|His {{documentary}} Underneath the Arches broke tradition by enabling London’s {{homeless people}} {{to tell their}} own stories without any links from a programme presenter. Instead, he used short clips from catchy music hall songs to establish each location and, with careful editing, the interviewees related their own experiences and introduced each other. The <b>publicity</b> boosted <b>funds</b> for the Crisis at Christmas campaign and brought more volunteers to the charity which used a derelict church in Lambeth to house and feed homeless people during Christmas week {{each year in the}} 1970s. The unique presentation of the programme won the UNDA award from the International Catholic Association for Radio and Television for the best UK religious radio programme in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{her first}} involvements was <b>publicity</b> and <b>funding</b> work for the Swedish Permobil {{electric}} wheelchair designed by Per Uddén, who has credited her efforts in making it a field leader and [...] "creating liberty {{for hundreds of thousands}} of people with mobility problems all over the world". In the 1980s Bernadotte joined several professors in launching an academy to coordinate international dyslexia research and support young researchers. As of 2006 she has an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bologna's Institute of Psychology in recognition of her contributions to dyslexia research. She is also Honorary Chairman of The Swedish Dylexia Foundation and Swedish Dyslexia Association and Honorary President of The International Rodin Remediation Academy.|$|R
5000|$|Though he did {{not make}} a deal with the sharks, Furmansky felt that he got the [...] "best of both worlds" [...] from the <b>publicity</b> and {{resultant}} <b>funding</b> he received due to his appearance on the show. A month after his pitch was taped, a San Francisco venture capital firm invested in Budsies, and the weekend after his segment aired, traffic on the Budsies website jumped to 100,000 visitors.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} it became a {{registered}} charity in April 1993, NMPH needed new offices to provide a complete range of services for relatives, enabling the charity to both find and support. This expansion was greatly helped by founders of the Big Issue, who secured premises in Mortlake. Missing People is still based there today. ITN's Sir Trevor McDonald - later to become a Vice Patron, instigated invaluable <b>publicity.</b> Where <b>funding</b> allowed, new staff and volunteers joined and the information taken from each caller regarding a disappearance became more detailed and more accurate. A department offering Publicity was born. The success of the charity was cemented {{in its first year}} by an office visit from Diana, Princess of Wales in October.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{widespread}} skepticism, {{the trail}} was cleared {{and a total}} of $51,325 was raised. In 1973, Dick Wilmarth of Red Devil, Alaska, and his lead sled dog Hotfoot beat a pack of 34 mushers who competed in the race to Nome. Negative publicity caused by the death of several dogs during the race reduced the purse to only $31,000 in 1974, but the event still attracted a field of 44 mushers. In 1975, the race instituted stronger dog care requirements, and a corporate sponsor raised the purse back to $50,000. Despite more negative <b>publicity</b> and <b>funding</b> problems in 1976, the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race has since grown into the premiere sporting event in the state, and the largest dog sled race in the world.|$|R
50|$|Later on, between 1971 and 1973, Zumbado was a {{chief editor}} at the {{magazine}} Cuba, and at La hiena triste (The sad hyena), {{a publication of the}} UNEAC (Union of Artists and Writers of Cuba) (3). Then he worked for the Institute of the Domestic Demand as an exportable <b>funds</b> <b>publicity</b> and promotion adviser of the integral promotion group (EMPI), where he worked together with his wife, Mabel (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 236).|$|R
50|$|Oram {{began his}} journalism career in Texas. His first venture, a weekly paper called the Fort Worth Monitor, partnered him with Leopold Mamolen. When the {{newspaper}} failed, he left Texas {{and went to}} work for newspapers in Hartsdale and Brooklyn, New York while he attending law school. In 1936 Oram began working with the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, an activist group committed to the Loyalist side in Spain's Civil War. When that organization split, Oram joined the group's liberal faction that included Ralph Bates, Varian Fry, and Roger Baldwin and helped form the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign. As the Director of <b>Publicity</b> and <b>Fund</b> Raising for the organization, Oram was responsible for obtaining the funds to aid in relocating Spanish Loyalists who fled Spain following General Francisco Franco's victory.|$|R
5000|$|After Shanker died in February 1997, Feldman won {{election}} as the AFT's president in July 1998, becoming the union's first female president since 1930. Feldman re-emphasized the AFT's commitment to educational issues. She also renewed the union's focus on organizing: During her tenure, the AFT grew {{by more than}} 160,000 new members (about 17 percent).With Feldman as President, in 2002, AFT delegates approved a four-point plan: 1) building a [...] "culture of organizing" [...] throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) engaging {{in a series of}} <b>publicity,</b> legislative, <b>funding</b> and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work, and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad.

50|$|His {{career began}} in 1940 when Pulford, {{who was then}} doing {{freelance}} engineering illustration, began painting posters for Rank cinemas in the Leeds area. His work included Gaslight, The Bluebird, and Thief Of Baghdad. In 1943 he was asked by Rank {{to set up a}} design studio in London and Pulford <b>Publicity</b> was established, <b>funded</b> by Downton Advertising, a Fleet Street agency connected with Rank. One of the first employees was the lettering artist Tom Brownlow.|$|R
50|$|In 1914 the Higdons were {{dismissed}} but the pupils organised a strike. One of the pupils, Violet Potter, led the students out on strike. The vast majority {{agreed to be}} taught in temporary places. Initially they worked on the village green {{and then in a}} carpenter's shop. The situation attracted national <b>publicity</b> and crowd <b>funding</b> from supporters resulted in a new school building by 1917. Early visitors to the school were Sylvia Pankhurst and George Lansbury who opened the new building.|$|R
2500|$|Suddenly, {{during and}} after his 2008 market success, Forester, who runs his fund from Libertyville, became a celebrity. [...] He made his first {{television}} appearance in December and newspapers {{from as far away}} as Chile's El Mercurio have requested interviews with him. [...] In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Forester conceded that because his fund is smaller than many of his peers, he is able to get in and out of portfolio positions faster than others and that his returns would have been much lower if he had been managing a larger portfolio. [...] However, he said his success at beating the market was more attributable to his financial market assessments than his fund's size. [...] Because of the <b>publicity</b> his <b>fund</b> has been receiving in the down market its assets under management grew fivefold during 2008.|$|R
50|$|The UC3M {{uses the}} crowd funding system to finance its projects. The process usually {{involves}} four main steps: Firstly a scientist, student or an alumnus will develop {{an idea about}} research, innovation, and/or the diffusion of knowledge. Secondly they spread this idea via Gotero.org, which is a website where donors can search for and endorse projects listed on the webpage. Thirdly, an interested donor will begin financing a project. Finally, the project reaches sufficient levels of <b>funding,</b> <b>publicity</b> and related improvements to become reality.|$|R
