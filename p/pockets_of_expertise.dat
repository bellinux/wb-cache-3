40|$|Introduction Attempts to use CIT in {{education}} are now ubiquitous. There is hardly an institution without its <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise,</b> and hardly a national {{government that has}} not made pronouncements {{about the need for}} schools/colleges/universities to enter the 'information age'. The investment in particular institutions is sometimes substantial, but even so, this rarely amounts to more than 1 or 2 % of total expenditure, and is usually much less. The problem is that cash for development usually has to be found in addition to normal operating costs which are already on the margins of adequacy, while any benefits in terms of efficiency take years to work their way through. Unlike private industry, the public education sector cannot borrow or float a share 'rights issue' to raise the required investment. However, money is not the only problem, and possibly not even the central problem in embedding the use of technology - that is, in moving from <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> plus optimistic...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} that employees face in locating knowledge among distributed <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> {{can be particularly}} acute in large multinational organizations. This study focuses on people searching for knowledge by contacting other people. The fundamental research questions are: {{when faced with the}} need for knowledge, what are the knowledge searcher’s motivations and obstacles to contact one person, instead of another? And when does a person cross borders to look for knowledge, as opposed to source it locally? The developed theory, predicting the determinants of a knowledge searcher contacting a potential knowledge source, centers on four latent constructs: the contact’s knowledge value, the searcher’s expectation that the contact will share this knowledge, the searcher’s estimated cost to obtain this knowledge, and the contact’s accessibility to the searcher. A number of previously identified enablers and barriers to information sharing are then posited as antecedents of these four constructs. The theory was tested by a field study within 12 European subsidiaries of an American HQ based MNE in the software and IT services industry. The sample Data consisted of survey reports from 133 dyads, whose members included salespersons, technical, or industry consultant...|$|E

This is done by investigating the past, present and future of NLP of African languages, keeping especially the multidisciplinary nature of the field {{and the role of the}} linguist in mind. A Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) report of 1986, expressed concern about the backlog in South Africa regarding NLP, and called for dynamic action. As computational power increased and became less expensive, more interest began to be shown in NLP in South Africa. <b>Pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> that have developed at various institutions over the past 20 years are discussed and the importance of cooperation in the field, across disciplines, is illustrated in this paper. In order to facilitate coordinated action and prevent the duplication of language resources and the development of basic enabling technologies, the implementation of the concept of the Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK) is recommended, while a new project, which aims to create a platform for WordNet development for African languages, is cited as prime example of international collaboration.

40|$|Canada is in {{the process}} of {{developing}} a national scientific and technical information (STI) system. It is designed to ensure that scientists, researchers, engineers, industrialists and managers have ready access to any scientific or technical information or publication required in their day-to-day work. In 1970 impetus was given the program when the National Research Council (NRC) was assigned formal responsibility for planning and development, with the National Science Library (NSL) serving as the focal point or coordinating agency for local STI services. During the last two years, emphasis has been placed on the strengthening of two existing networks [...] -a network of 230 libraries linked to the NSL by the "Union List of Scientific Serials in Canadian Libraries" [...] -the CAN/SDI network, a national current awareness service at present using 12 data bases, and linked to the NSL by 350 Search Editors located in all parts of Canada. This service is being expanded to provide remote access to the CAN/SDI data bases by an interactive on-line system. In recent months, steps have been taken to establish regional referral centres and link into the system little used <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> subject <b>expertise</b> and specialized STI resources.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{communities}} of services have been studied in a certain numbers of proposals as virtual <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> similar <b>expertise.</b> The motivation is to provide these services with high chance of discovery through better visibility, and to enhance their capabilities {{when it comes to}} provide requested functionalities. There are some proposed mechanisms and models on aggregating web services and making them cooperate within their communities. However, forming optimal and stable communities as coalitions to maximize individual and group efficiency and income for all the involved parties has not been addressed yet. Moreover, in the proposed frameworks of these communities, a common assumption is that residing services, which are supposed to be autonomous and intelligent, are competing over received requests. However, those services can also exhibit cooperative behaviors, for instance in terms of substituting each other. When competitive and cooperative behaviors and strategies are combined, autonomous services are said to be "coopetitive". Deciding to compete or cooperate inside communities is a problem yet to be investigated. In this thesis, we first identify the problem of defining efficient algorithms for coalition formation mechanisms. We study the community formation problem in two different settings: 1) communities with centralized manager having complete information using cooperative game-theoretic techniques; and 2) communities with distributed decision making mechanisms having incomplete information using training methods. We propose mechanisms for community membership requests and selections of web services in the scenarios where there is interaction between one community and many web services and scenarios where web services can join multiple established communities. Then in order to address the coopetitive relation within communities of web services, we propose a decision making mechanism for our web services to efficiently choose competition or cooperation strategies to maximize their payoffs. We prove that the proposed decision mechanism is efficient and can be implemented in time linear in the length of the time period considered for the analysis and the number of services in the community. Moreover, we conduct extensive simulations, analyze various scenarios, and confirm the obtained theoretical results using parameters from a real web services dataset...|$|R

40|$|School drug {{education}} {{is seen by}} governments as an ideal prevention strategy because it offers the potential to stop use by the next generation. Australian schools expanded drug education substantially during the 1960 s in response to rising use by young people, and in 1970 the first national drug education programme was launched. In the mid- 1990 s the level and quality of drug education increased noticeably. Unfortunately, subsequent national initiatives have failed to capitalise on the gains made during this period. Some good quality, independent research, such as the Gatehouse Project and the School Health and Alcohol Harm Reduction Project (SHAHRP), has been conducted in Australia. However, national-level momentum is being lost, because there is little commitment {{to the development of}} evidence-based mass programmes. In this climate drug education has become vulnerable to short-term decision-making that emphasises palatable, policy-driven outcomes and focuses on strategies designed to bolster the legitimacy of these goals. So is Australia ‘fair dinkum’ about drug education in schools? There is a history of innovation, and past programmes have left behind <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise,</b> but the challenge is to invest continuously in methods with evidence of success, rather than settle for cyclical programmes driven by the political and moral palliatives of the day. To do less is to fail the young people of Australia. [Midford R. Is Australia ‘fair dinkum’ about drug education in schools? Drug Alcohol Rev 2007; 26 : 421 – 427...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> in offshore outsourcing projects. While the study <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> development and coordination {{has received more}} attention in recent years, much of this research has been on co-located teams. Furthermore, the study <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> development has often considered the development <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> separately from the coordination and integration <b>of</b> <b>expertise.</b> To address this gap, this paper discusses the notion <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> management, to conclude that it consists of three interconnected processes, namely: development, coordination and integration. The paper goes on to suggest that distributed teams may face a dilemma in terms <b>of</b> how <b>expertise</b> should be developed, i. e. in a joint or distributed manner. To illustrate the challenges involved in expertise management processes, an in-depth case study of an ABN AMRO – TCS outsourcing project is outlined in which onsite and offshore teams developed, coordinated and integrated expertise despite geographical distance, time-zone differences and different local contexts. Evidence from this case suggests that this outsourcing project jointly developed expertise while coordinating and integrating expertise in a distributed manner. Finally...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{the way in which}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> is {{understood}} and invoked has prevented progress in the debate as to whether moral philosophers can be said to be ‘moral experts’. We offer an account <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> that draws on the role of tacit knowledge in order to provide a basis upon which the debate can progress. Our analysis consists of three parts. In the first part we highlight two specific problems in the way that the concept <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> has been invoked in the moral expertise debate, namely the understanding <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> as an exclusive concept and the conflation <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> with the idea of ‘authority’. In the second part we suggest an alternative way of approaching the concept <b>of</b> <b>expertise.</b> This is based on Collins and Evans’ sociological theory <b>of</b> <b>expertises.</b> This theory provides a valuable analytical framework for thinking about claims to expertise and for drawing the kinds of distinctions which allow for different kinds <b>of</b> moral <b>expertises</b> and competencies. In the final part, we show how the application of this theory helps to avoid some of the problematic conclusions which theorists have arrived at to date and provides a common platform for debate. Ultimately, it permits the argument to be made that moral philosophers could be considered specialist members of an expert community of moral decision-makers...|$|R
40|$|Development of the eardrum {{retraction}} pocket, as pathologic finding, depends on Eustachian tube dysfunction, {{onset of the}} middle ear infection and site of development of retraction on the eardrum. The study is aimed at: 1. Determining the incidence <b>of</b> {{eardrum retraction}} <b>pocket</b> and cholesteatoma within it, {{as well as at the}} degree of eardrum retraction; 2. Determining of association between eardrum retraction <b>pocket</b> and changes <b>of</b> the eardrum mucosaand parstensa of the tympanic membrane; 3. Determining of onset and intensity of the bone destruction in eardrum retraction pocket; 4. Examining of Eustachian tube function based on time of mucocilliary transport according to the type of the eardrum retraction pocket. The study is based on the retrospective analysis of the results obtained from the patients treated at the Institute of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade for the diagnosis of the chronic suppurative otitis who underwent otosurgical procedures during the six-year period, from 1996 - 2001. In our series of 540 patients subjected to otosurgical treatment, the incidence <b>of</b> the retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum was 11. 23 %. Onset of more severe degree of eardrum retraction was most frequent in the attic. Cholesteatoma was detected in 82. 2 % of patients of the group with the attic-retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum, as well as in 25 % of patients of the group <b>of</b> tensa-sinus retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum. Atrophic changes of the tympanic membrane pars tensa were detected in almost all tensa-sinus retraction <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum. Approximately one half <b>of</b> the attic-retraction <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum were accompanied by eardrum atrophy. Bone destruction of the auditory ossicles was limited to the long process of incus and superior structures of stapes. Time of the mucocilliary transport was significantly longer (p< 0. 01) in attic-retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum than in tensa-sinus retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum, indicating significance of tube in development <b>of</b> attic-retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the tympanic membrane.

Two distinct paradigms were developed to test cognitive flexibility in non-routine environments along the continuum <b>of</b> <b>expertise,</b> from first year psychology undergraduates through to practicing psychologists. Experiment 1 tested immunity and susceptibility to the deleterious effects of anomalous information in clinical psychology diagnostic problems, using 276 participants in seven groups <b>of</b> graded <b>expertise.</b> Participants underwent diagnostic decision-making tasks and also rank-ordered stimulus information in terms of importance. In Experiment 2, 272 participants in six groups were tested for effects of disconfirmatory information presented dynamically. A &# 145;garden path&# 146; paradigm (Feltovich, Coulson & Spiro, 1984) was adapted, involving the initial presentation of ultimately misleading information.
