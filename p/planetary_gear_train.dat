40|$|In this paper, the {{methodology}} of establishing two-carrier <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> (PGT) equipped with a speed-changing system which contains breaks and clutches is considered. The reactive shaft is changed by means of breaks whereas the input and output shaft of the <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> are changed by clutches. Compound multi-speed <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> are obtained {{by a combination of}} two-carrier two-speed <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> controlled by only two breaks. The coding system of the two-speed <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains,</b> which defines the connection between shafts of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> sets and the shaft layout equipped with breaks, a driving and an operating machine is shown. It is established which variants of two-speed <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> are possible to combine by means of corresponding clutches in order to get two-variant or three-variant PGT. The methodology of choosing two-carrier PGT which are created by a combination of two or three two-speed variants within the frame of the same scheme is described as well as the example of finding an optimal three-speed PGT by means of the developed computer program 6 -brz is shown...|$|R

2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term annular gear is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains.

2500|$|The {{weapon is}} {{described}} as an [...] "air-cooled, electrically powered, rapid firing weapon." [...] All portions of the firing cycle are powered this way so the unit requires an external power source. Other important features are the reciprocating barrel and cam assembly that drive the other components of the system. All phases of the weapon cycle are positively controlled by the drum cam assembly in which a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> is enclosed, responsible for reducing the motor's high speed to the desired rate for the gun. The 5/8 horsepower 28 Volts DC motor is mounted on the turret bracket and drives the drum cam through a flexible shaft in order to isolate it from the weapon's recoil. The weapon accepts linked ammunition, which was fed from rotary drums {{in the case of}} the M5 and M28 systems, and from boxes {{in the case of the}} XM9 systems. [...] The M5 could also use a box magazine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. 3 K {{type and}} 2 K- 2 H type <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> can be {{designed}} to have high reduction ratios. Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K type <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> reducer only contain two ring gears and one carrier, hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H type <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> reducers. Also, in general, the gear reducers with high reduction ratio are compound gear system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose 2 K type <b>planetary</b> simple <b>gear</b> reducers with high reduction ratios. Based on the concept of train value equation, the kinematic design of 2 K type <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> with high reduction ratio are synthesized. Six 2 K type <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> reducers are designed to illustrate the kinematic design process. Three of the examples are 2 K type <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> reducers with simple planet gears. For the 2 K type <b>planetary</b> simple <b>gear</b> reducer, there is a problem that is the simple planet gear engages to two ring gears with different tooth number.

40|$|Based on the {{principle}} of double-half-revolution mechanism, this paper designed a new-style bionic walking mechanism by using two tandem <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains,</b> which is composed of one first swiveling arm, one second swiveling arm, two striding rods and mechanism bracket, etc. The first swiveling arm and second swiveling arm are the planet carriers (also as gearbox casings) of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> respectively. On the basis of analysis of interference and motion coupling relationship of joints, non-interference condition of the bionic walking mechanism was obtained.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for designing hybrid scooter transmissions with <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains.</b> The basic concept is to combine two <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> into a split-power system; so, by incorporating clutches and brakes when engaged, the system becomes a hybrid scooter transmission. The transmissions combine the power from two power sources, a gasoline engine and an electric motor. The systems use four different modes {{in order to}} maximize the performance and reduce emissions: electric-motor mode; engine-mode and engine/charging mode; power-mode; and regenerative-braking mode. Kinematic and power flow analyses are performed. According to the analysis results, formulae for the speed ratio of the transmission are derived and a procedure for identifying the arrangements with no internal recirculation of the split power system is developed. Sixteen possible configurations of hybrid scooter transmission satisfying the design requirements are presented. A design example is used to illustrate the design procedure and operation principle of the transmission. Hybrid scooter Transmission Split-power system Planetary gear-train...|$|R

40|$|A {{model system}} is {{described}} by parameters for shafts, <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> and nodes.

This brings about a new view on the concept of degrees of freedom. The close relationship between gear ratios and torque ratios yields identical functions for these ratios when applied to the input and output shafts of a system, The full use of this relationship requires strict conventions of signs and an extension of the interpretation of values. The introduction of a new concept, named responsivity, expresses the relationships between torques and between powers of arbitrary shafts. With suitable equations, it becomes possible to investigate torque and power distributions exhaustively.
