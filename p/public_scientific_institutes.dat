40|$|Can local {{industrial}} policies increase {{local firm}} competitiveness? Cluster-oriented policies targeted at selected industries have {{just such a}} goal and are very popular among politicians, despite the controversy surrounding these policies in academia. Thus, it would appear useful to discover if cluster-oriented policies are effective. This paper evaluates the cluster-oriented policy introduced in Bavaria, Germany, in 1999. The policy's goal was to foster innovation and regional competitiveness by stimulating cooperation. Using difference-in-difference-in-differences estimates, we find for different innovation measures that the cluster-oriented policy increased the likelihood of becoming an innovator in the target industries by 4. 6 to 5. 7 percentage points. At the same time, R&D expenditures decreased by 19. 4 % on average for firms in target industries, while access to external know-how, cooperation with <b>public</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>institutes,</b> {{and the availability of}} suitable R&D personnel increased.

40|$|The gas sensing {{performances}} of low cost commercial chemical sensors are {{compared to the}} ones of standardized chemical analysers. Real time measurements are performed {{on the field of}} three municipal solid waste plants (MSW). Long-term campaigns of several months have been organised during the period 2010 - 2015. The sensors and the reference analysers have worked simultaneously. The selected sensors are commercial metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors (MOx, Figaro). The sensors-array devices are developed at the ULg laboratory (SAM). Analysers are certified and operated by the official Wallonia <b>public</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>institute</b> (ISSeP). In addition to odour, other target compounds are considered: methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, but also NMHC as limonene, pinene and BTEX The laboratory has a long experience in using chemical sensors for odour in-field measurements, especially for landfills and composting plants. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the {{performances of}} chemo-resistors array for continuous monitoring of compounds typical of municipal wastes in comparison to reference analysers. It highlights weaknesses and strengths of the two kinds of devices. The obtained results are considered for odour event detection as well as for chemical compound quantification and are discussed to evaluate the efficiency of metal oxide sensors for a low cost gas emissions assessment.

40|$|Cemagref is a French <b>public</b> <b>scientific</b> {{research}} <b>institute</b> {{in agricultural}} and environmental engineering. Its {{scientific and technical}} community is multidisciplinary and consists of ten regional centers in France. Each center is equipped with an information service. Library professionals must offer Cemagref researchers homogeneous and efficient information services throughout the organisation. Tools offered by publishers for accessing scientific and technical information increase each year, and become more effective and more diversified. Resources are scattered. Researchers need to be directed to tools best adapted to their needs. Cemagref's library professionals concern is to identify tools, and to choose the most cost effective solution in collaboration with researchers. Working closely with researchers {{and having a good}} knowledge of their needs is a major advantage. This paper deals with the study methods and the results obtained in response to researchers information needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} a wealth of studies, reports and assessments being published in many EU member states, by national and international organisations and in the research community on economic, environmental and human health related aspects of unconventional {{oil and gas exploration}} and production. Many R&D initiatives are also under way. This report attempts to provide a survey of several of such studies and initiatives, with a focus on the years 2014, 2015 and early 2016. Principally, reports and studies from <b>public</b> bodies and <b>scientific</b> <b>institutes</b> were covered. Additionally, relevant papers published in peer-reviewed journals were included. A review {{of the quality of the}} studies covered, the accuracy of their claims and their possible limitations was not carried out. This report is therefore only meant to provide a compilation of their summaries, without any endorsement of the findings reported in any of the studies and assessments covered in the report. JRC.
