25|$|Maurice Wilks, Rover's chief {{designer}} {{came up with}} a plan {{to produce}} a light agricultural and utility vehicle, of a similar concept to the Willys Jeep used in the war, but with an emphasis on agricultural use. He was possibly inspired by the Standard Motor Company, who faced similar problems and were producing the highly successful Ferguson TE20 tractor in their shadow factory in Coventry. More likely, he used his own experience of using an army-surplus Jeep on his farm in Anglesey, North Wales. His design added a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (<b>PTO)</b> feature since there was a gap in the market between jeeps and tractors (which offered the feature but were less flexible as transport). The original Land Rover concept (a cross between a light truck and a tractor) is similar to the Unimog, which was developed in Germany during this period.|$|E

50|$|In farm equipment, a {{spinning}} output shaft {{on the rear}} of the vehicle is commonly referred to as the <b>Power</b> <b>Take-Off</b> or <b>PTO,</b> and the power-transfer shaft that is connected to it is commonly called a PTO shaft, but is also a jackshaft.|$|R
50|$|A power {{tower is}} a type of {{mechanical}} <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (or <b>pto)</b> which resides on an auxiliary transmission. It is mounted to the top of an auxiliary transmission (also known as a brownie or joey box) and its vertical housing has earned it the name power tower.

2500|$|A {{belt pulley}} was {{standard}} equipment on the WC, while a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (<b>PTO)</b> and a mechanical power lift for the cultivator were optional. In 1936 the PTO option's list price was USD $50, the power lift option's, $35.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Power</b> <b>take-off</b> (<b>PTO)</b> was {{integral}} to the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was [...] "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" [...] The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: [...] "the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an [...] belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing." [...] PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up {{to the demise of}} the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional hay {{making in}} the Boho was a {{communal}} endeavour. Neighbours of the farmer and his family would gather round to help [...] "win" [...] the hay before any sign of rain. This was a long and arduous job compared to the modern process. Local people might even {{take a day off}} their regular job for this sole purpose. The meadow was cut using a scythe (originally), and then in more modern times by tractor with a side-mounted mower blade. The grass swathes would be turned over by means of a hay rake and if the grass was dry enough it would be [...] with a pitchfork. The person that was tedding would lift as much as he/she could with a pitchfork and then shake it out vigorously over the ground. Once the grass was dry enough, the loose hay would be gathered into rows with hay rakes (this tedding might be repeated depending on how dry the grass was). The rows could also be made into small [...] "laps" [...] or [...] "lappins" [...] which are circularised stacks of dried grass. The invention of a hay-right or tedding machine connected to the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (<b>PTO)</b> of a tractor made tedding a lot less labour-intensive.|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{bore the}} CJ name, the Willys-Overland CJ-2 {{was not really}} {{available}} at retail. The CJ-2s, also known as [...] "AgriJeeps," [...] were the second generation prototype for the first production civilian Jeep, and were used solely for testing purposes. It was directly based on the military Willys MB, using the same Willys Go Devil engine, but stripped of all military features, particularly the blackout lighting. They had tailgates, <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> (<b>PTO's),</b> engine governors ($28.65), column-shift T90 manual transmissions, 5.38 gears, 2.43:1 low-range transfer cases, and driver's-side tool indentations. The earlier models had brass plaques on the hood and windshield that read [...] "JEEP". Later models were stamped [...] "JEEP" [...] a la the familiar [...] "WILLYS" [...] stamping that appeared on the CJ-2A and later models. Some CJ-2s had [...] "AgriJeep" [...] plaques affixed to the dash. The spare tire was mounted forward of the passenger-side rear wheel on the earlier models and aft of the rear wheel on later ones. It seems that CJ-2s were distributed to [...] "agricultural stations" [...] for evaluation purposes. Of the 45 CJ-2s built, serial numbers CJ2-06, CJ2-09, CJ2-11, CJ2-12, CJ2-14, CJ2-26, CJ2-32, CJ2-37 and CJ2-39 have survived. Only CJ2-09 has been restored.|$|R

This research focussed on {{the conversion of the}} WEC motions into usable electricity by the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system (<b>PTO).</b> Specifically, a hydraulic PTO system with an accumulator as energy buffer was studied. The power absorption was calculated, with implementation of several control strategies to maximize the output. Here, a distinction was made between fast strategies, which alter the control on a wave-by-wave basis, and slow strategies, which apply constant control over longer time windows. Additionally, the effect of the accumulator volume on the power conversion and the system pressure was studied. Results indicated that control strategies positively influence the PTO performance and that the accumulator volume is of major importance in hydraulic PTOs...|$|R

In this paper a velocity ratio has been used to study how the geometric parameters buoy draft and radius, assuming constant generator damping coefficient, affects the motion and the energy absorption of a WEC.

40|$|Ocean {{waves are}} irregular, {{nonlinear}} and directionally spread (short-crested). The irregularity of waves {{can be considered}} by superposing components at different frequencies. In many frequency-domain analyses, second-order contributions can be calculated {{to take account of}} the nonlinearity in wave-structure interactions. The directional spreading of the waves is usually described by introducing a directional spectrum. Several directional spectra have been suggested by researchers [1]. In short-crested waves, the wave energy propagates in different directions around principal wave directions, which will affect the performance of Wave Energy Converters (WEC). Especially, less energy may be harnessed for some directionally sensitive WEC. In present paper, we have examined the performance of an attenuator type WEC by calculating the relative rotations (pitch and yaw motions) between floating modules in uni-directional and multi-directional waves. The emphases have been put on operational sea states and only linear incoming waves have been considered. In the next section, the description of multi-directional waves in a numerical model will be introduced briefly.

40|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} floating wave energy converters (that includes the IPS buoy, the Wavebob and the PowerBuoy) comprehends devices {{in which the}} energy is converted from the relative (essentially heaving) motion between two bodies oscillating differently. The paper considers {{the case of the}} IPS buoy, consisting of a floater rigidly connected to a fully submerged vertical (acceleration) tube open at both ends. The tube contains a piston whose motion relative to the floater-tube system (motion originated by wave action on the floater and by the inertia of the water enclosed in the tube) drives a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> mechanism (<b>PTO)</b> (assumed to be a linear damper). To solve the problem of the end-stops, {{the central part of the}} tube, along which the piston slides, bells out at either end to limit the stroke of the piston. The use of a hydraulic turbine inside the tube is examined as an alternative to the piston. A frequency domain analysis of the device in regular waves is developed, combined with a one-dimensional unsteady flow model inside the tube (whose cross-section is in general nonuniform). Numerical results are presented for a cylindrical buoy in regular waves, including the optimization of the acceleration tube geometry and PTO damping coefficient for several wave periods...|$|R

Hydrodynamic characterisation software is avoided in favour of a simpler and more versatile design tool destined to a wider range of users.
