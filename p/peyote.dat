5|$|In autumn 1956 Cameron's first {{exhibition}} was held, at Walter Hopp's studio in Brentwood; several paintings were destroyed when the gallery caught fire. Around this time, Cameron {{was introduced to}} the actor Dean Stockwell at a public recital of her poetry; he then introduced her to his friend and fellow actor Dennis Hopper. She was also an associate of the artist Wallace Berman, who used a photograph of her {{on the front of the}} first volume of his art journal, Semina. The volume also included Cameron's drawing, <b>Peyote</b> Vision. This artwork was featured in Berman's 1957 exhibition at Los Angeles' Feris Gallery, which was raided and shut down by the police. Investigating officers claimed that <b>Peyote</b> Vision, which featured two copulating figures, was pornographic and indecent, thus legitimising their actions.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of cacti {{have been shown to}} contain psychoactive agents, {{chemical}} compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain. Two species {{have a long history of}} use by the indigenous peoples of the Americas: <b>peyote,</b> Lophophora williamsii, in North America, and the San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi, in South America. Both contain mescaline.|$|E
5|$|To {{make it up}} to Seth and Munchie, Homer {{creates a}} new type of juice with crops from their garden and {{distributes}} them to every store in town. However, the <b>Peyote</b> ingredient makes anyone who drinks the juice hallucinate. Chief Wiggum catches on and soon the police surround the farm. Homer defends Seth, Munchie and the hippie honor by reminding the police of the morals taught by the 1960s, planting a flower in each of the officer's guns. However, Wiggum discharges his, lodging its flower in Homer's forehead and leaving him hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|Psychopharmacologist Arthur Heffter {{isolated}} mescaline {{from the}} <b>peyote</b> cactus in 1897 and conducted experiments {{on its effects}} by comparing the effects of <b>peyote</b> and mescaline on himself.|$|E
25|$|But the {{difference}} between the other unemployment cases the Court had decided and this case was that Oregon's ban on <b>peyote</b> applied to everyone equallyin other words, it made no room for individualized consideration of the reasons a person might want to use <b>peyote.</b>|$|E
25|$|The use of entheogens for {{religious}} purposes resurfaced in the West during the counterculture {{movements of the}} 1960s and 70s. Under the leadership of Timothy Leary, new spiritual and intention-based movements began to use LSD and other hallucinogens as tools to access deeper inner exploration. In the United States, the use of <b>peyote</b> for ritual purposes is protected only {{for members of the}} Native American Church, which is allowed to cultivate and distribute <b>peyote.</b> However, the genuine religious use of <b>peyote,</b> regardless of one's personal ancestry, is protected in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Quanah Parker is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first important leaders of the Native American Church movement. Parker adopted the <b>peyote</b> religion after having been gored in southern Texas by a bull. Parker was visiting his uncle, John Parker, in Texas where he was attacked, giving him severe wounds. To fight an onset of blood burning fever, a Mexican curandera was summoned and she prepared a strong <b>peyote</b> tea from fresh <b>peyote</b> to heal him. Thereafter, Quanah Parker became involved with <b>peyote,</b> which contains hordenine, mescaline or phenylethylamine alkaloids, and tyramine which act as natural antibiotics when taken in a combined form. Clinical studies indicate that peyocactin, a water-soluble crystalline substance separated from an ethanol extract of the plant, proved an effective antibiotic against 18 strains of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, several other bacteria, and a fungus.|$|E
25|$|Jim Carroll {{described}} using <b>peyote</b> in The Basketball Diaries that {{a friend}} of his smuggled from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Disney {{animator}} Ward Kimball described {{participating in}} a study of mescaline and <b>peyote</b> conducted by UCLA in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, France, The Netherlands and Germany, {{mescaline}} in {{raw form}} and dried mescaline-containing cacti are considered an illegal drug. However, anyone may grow and use <b>peyote,</b> or Lophophora williamsii, {{as well as}} Echinopsis pachanoi and Echinopsis peruviana without restriction, as it is specifically exempt from legislation. In Canada, mescaline is classified as a schedule III drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, whereas <b>peyote</b> is exempt.|$|E
25|$|Mescaline is biosynthesized from {{tyrosine}} or a hydroxylated phenylalanine. In Lophophora williamsii (<b>Peyote),</b> dopamine converts into mescaline in a biosynthetic pathway involving m-O-methylation and aromatic hydroxylation.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{reservation}} era in Native American history {{began with}} {{the adoption of the}} Native American Church and Christianity by nearly every Native American tribe and culture within the United States and Canada as a result of Parker and Wilson's efforts. The <b>peyote</b> religion and the Native American Church were never the traditional religious practice of North American Indian cultures. This religion developed in the nineteenth century, inspired by events of the time being east and west of the Mississippi River, Parker's leadership, and influences from Native Americans of Mexico and other southern tribes. They had used <b>peyote</b> in spiritual practices since ancient times.|$|E
25|$|Smith and Black {{had argued}} that at the very least, the Court should only uphold Oregon's ban on <b>peyote</b> as applied to them if Oregon had a {{compelling}} interest in prohibiting their religious use of <b>peyote.</b> The Court had invalidated three other unemployment compensation restrictions under this standard. But those other restrictions themselves required consideration of individualized circumstances, such as when unemployment compensation was denied {{to a person who}} could not, for religious reasons, work on Saturdays. If a state has in place a system of individualized consideration, the constitution did not allow the state to refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without a compelling reason.|$|E
25|$|The <b>peyote</b> cacti {{and other}} mescaline-containing {{plants such as}} San Pedro are illegal in Western Australia, Queensland, and the Northern Territory, whilst in other states such as Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, they are legal for {{ornamental}} and gardening purposes.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} motifs {{are related to}} the three most {{important}} elements in Huichol religion, the deer, corn and <b>peyote.</b> The first two are important as primary sources of food, and the last is valued for its hallucinogenic properties which give shamans visions.|$|E
25|$|Many music genres span {{multiple}} tribes. Pan-tribalism is the syncretic {{adoption of}} traditions from foreign communities. Since {{the rise of}} the United States and Canada, Native Americans have forged a common identity, and invented pan-Indian music, most famously including powwows, <b>peyote</b> songs, and the Ghost Dance.|$|E
25|$|It occurs {{naturally}} in the <b>peyote</b> cactus (Lophophora williamsii), the San Pedro cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi), the Peruvian torch (Echinopsis peruviana), {{and in a}} number of other members of the Cactaceae plant family. It is also found in small amounts in certain members of the Fabaceae (bean) family, including Acacia berlandieri.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that links established by Teotihuacán were with local rulers of ceremonial centers, of the mentioned network, or through alliances with regional intermediaries, or by small Teotihuacán merchants groups, living in these centers, that ensured the various products flow, such as minerals, salt, shells, quills, obsidian, and <b>peyote,</b> among others.|$|E
25|$|The Red Dog Saloon was a bar {{and music}} venue located in the isolated, old-time mining town of Virginia City, Nevada. In April 1963, Chandler A. Laughlin III {{established}} a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately 50 people who attended a traditional, all-night <b>peyote</b> ceremony which combined a psychedelic experience with traditional Native American spiritual values.|$|E
25|$|William James {{was also}} {{interested}} in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with nitrous oxide and even <b>peyote.</b> He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others they are certainly ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.|$|E
25|$|The {{speculation}} that manna was an entheogen, also paralleled in Philip K. Dick's posthumously published The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, is supported {{in a wider}} cultural context {{when compared with the}} praise of soma in the Rigveda, Mexican praise of teonanácatl, the <b>peyote</b> sacrament of the Native American Church, and the holy ayahuasca used in the ritual of the União do Vegetal and Santo Daime churches.|$|E
25|$|Spybuck {{worked as}} a farmer, painter, and {{historical}} informant. He belonged to a large and influential family within the Absentee Shawnee Nation where he was {{an active member of}} the community and became a <b>Peyote</b> leader when the Native American Church was first adopted by Shawnee people. He died in 1949 at the age of 66 and was buried in a family plot near his home.|$|E
25|$|David Silverman sees {{value in}} the work even while {{considering}} it fictional. In Reading Castaneda he describes the apparent deception as a critique of anthropology field work in general – a field that relies heavily on personal experience, and necessarily views other cultures through a lens. According to Silverman, not only the descriptions of <b>peyote</b> trips but also the fictional {{nature of the work}} are meant to place doubt on other works of anthropology.|$|E
25|$|Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, , is a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} {{held that the}} state could deny {{unemployment}} benefits to a person fired for violating a state {{prohibition on the use}} of <b>peyote,</b> even though the use of the drug was part of a religious ritual. Although states have the power to accommodate otherwise illegal acts performed in pursuit of religious beliefs, they are not required to do so.|$|E
25|$|Castaneda {{makes the}} reader {{experience}} {{the pressure of}} mysterious winds and the shiver of leaves at twilight, the hunter's peculiar alertness to sound and smell, the rock-bottom scrubbiness of Indian life, the raw fragrance of tequila and the vile, fibrous taste of <b>peyote,</b> the dust in the car, and the loft of a crow's flight. It is a superbly concrete setting, dense with animistic meaning. This is just as well, {{in view of the}} utter weirdness of the events that happen in it.|$|E
25|$|The Ghost Dance spread {{throughout}} the Plains tribes in the 1890s and many songs are sung today. They are characterized by relaxed vocals and a narrow range. Apache-derived <b>peyote</b> songs, prayers in the Native American Church, use a descending melody and monophony. Rattles and water drums are used, in a swift tempo. The Sun Dance and Grass Dance of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with terraced descent and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.|$|E
25|$|Psychedelic {{substances}} {{which may}} have therapeutic uses include psilocybin (the main active compound found in magic mushrooms), LSD, and mescaline (the main active compound in the <b>peyote</b> cactus). Although the history behind these substances has hindered research into their potential medicinal value, scientists {{are now able to}} conduct studies and renew research that was halted 40 years ago. Some research has shown that these substances have helped people with such mental disorders as obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, depression, and cluster headaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{members of}} the Beat Generation used {{a number of different}} drugs, including alcohol, marijuana, benzedrine, morphine, and later psychedelic drugs such as <b>peyote,</b> Ayahuasca, and LSD. They often approached drugs experimentally, initially being unfamiliar with their effects; their drug use was broadly inspired by intellectual interest and many Beat writers felt their drug experiences enhanced creativity, insight or productivity. The use of drugs was a key influence on many of the social events of the time that were personal to the Beat generation.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the European {{settlers}} in Texas, the plant <b>peyote</b> (peyotl in Nahuatl) had become a popular hallucinogenic among tribes in the Rio Grande Valley as well as parts of West Texas and Chihuahua. Tribes in the area included the Carrizo Coahuiltecan and later the Lipan and Mescalero Apache, and even the Karankawa and the Caddo tribes. The plant came to be used for both recreational and ritual usage. Its hallucinogenic effects were regarded with suspicion among the Spaniards and the drug was never widely used outside the Native American communities.|$|E
25|$|He {{describes}} Southern Athabascan music, {{that of the}} Apache and Navajo, as {{the simplest}} next to the Great Basin style, featuring strophic form, tense vocals using pulsation and falsetto, tritonic and tetratonic scales in triad formation, simple rhythms and values of limited duration (usually only two per song), arc-type melodic contours, and large melodic intervals with a predominance of major and minor thirds and perfect fourths and fifths with octave leaps not rare. <b>Peyote</b> songs share characteristics of Apache music and Plains-Pueblo music having been promoted among the Plains by the Apache people.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{ingestion}} of psychoactives {{has been a}} central feature in the rituals of many religions, {{in order to produce}} altered states of consciousness. In several traditional shamanistic ceremonies, drugs are used as agents of ritual. In the Rastafari movement, cannabis is believed to be a gift from Jah and a sacred herb to be used regularly, while alcohol is considered to debase man. Native Americans use <b>peyote,</b> as part of religious ceremony, continuing today. In India, the soma drink {{has a long history of}} use alongside prayer and sacrifice, and is mentioned in the Vedas.|$|E
25|$|While {{this process}} occurred, three Asian styles may have {{influenced}} North American music across the Bering Strait, all featuring pulsating vocal technique and possibly evident in recent Paleo-Siberian tribes such as Chuckchee, Yukaghir, Koryak. Also, these {{may have influenced}} the Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Inuit-Northwest Coast areas. According to Nettl, the boundary between these southward and the above northward influences are the areas of greatest musical complexity: the Northwest Coast, Pueblo music, and Navajo music. Evidence of influences between the Northwest Coast and Mexico are indicated, for example, by bird-shaped whistles. The Plains-Pueblo area has influenced and continues to influence the surrounding cultures, with contemporary musicians of all tribes learning Plains-Pueblo-influenced pantribal genres such as <b>Peyote</b> songs.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Greenwich Village in New York City and Berkeley, California {{anchored}} the American folk music circuit. Berkeley's two coffee houses, the Cabale Creamery and the Jabberwock, sponsored performances by folk music artists in a beat setting. In April 1963, Chandler A. Laughlin III, {{co-founder of the}} Cabale Creamery, established a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately fifty people who attended a traditional, all-night Native American <b>peyote</b> ceremony in a rural setting. This ceremony combined a psychedelic experience with traditional Native American spiritual values; these people went on to sponsor a unique genre of musical expression and performance at the Red Dog Saloon in the isolated, old-time mining town of Virginia City, Nevada.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{the cases}} in which the Court had allowed a {{religious}} motivation to exempt a person from a neutral, generally applicable law involved the assertion of both the right of free exercise along with some other right. Thus, religious publishers are exempt from a law requiring them to obtain a license if that license may be denied to any publisher the government deems nonreligious. The government may not tax religious solicitors. The government may not require the Amish {{to send their children to}} school because their religion demands otherwise, and Amish parents, like all parents, have the right to direct the education of their children. Because Smith and Black were not asserting a hybrid right, they could not claim a religious exemption under the First Amendment from Oregon's ban on <b>peyote.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{commercialization of}} Huichol art began when a Franciscan priest {{by the name}} of Ernesto Loera Ochoa began a Huichol museum at the Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan just north of Guadalajara. One of the artists {{exhibited}} here was Ramón Medina Silver, whose work was exhibited and sold at the museum. Medina’s work {{came to the attention of}} American Peter Furst, who suggested that Ramón represent the traditions and beliefs of his people by pressing colored yarn into a wax and resin-covered baseboard. These yarn paintings first appeared in 1962 in Guadalajara and were derived from “nierikas” a small board or disc with a hole or mirror in the center. Nierikas were initially produced by shamans to represent visions they experienced while consuming <b>peyote,</b> then left as offerings to the gods in places such as caves, temples and streams.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, mind-altering {{substances}} {{were used in}} rituals by medicine men to achieve a higher state of consciousness or trance-like state. These substances were used for mental and spiritual health purposes. Flora such as <b>peyote,</b> the morning glory, certain mushrooms, tobacco, and plants used to make alcoholic substances, were commonly used. The smoking of tobacco mixed with other plants produced a trance-like state. Alcoholic substances were used at rituals and were extremely strong. Hallucinogens were used {{to communicate with the}} spirit world. A number of these substances were used not to cure sickness, but instead for pain relief. In addition, as depicted in Maya pottery and carvings, ritual enemas were used for a more rapid absorption and effect of the substance. In contrast to modern culture, these remedies were used to restore balance and harmony to the body.|$|E
