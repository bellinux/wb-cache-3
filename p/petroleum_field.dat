40|$|Well {{placement}} optimization is {{an important}} part of <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Field</b> Development. However, in order to improve the optimization procedures, it can be important to incorporate considerations like knowledge about the geology of the reservoir or about existing or planned well paths. This leads to additional constraints that have to be satisfied during the optimization. In this thesis we concentrate in particular on constraints on the well lengths and the distance between the wells. We suggest an alternating projections method to deal with both constraints at the same time, and develop an efficient numerical method for the solution. Although we cannot prove that the method is convergent, numerical results of our implementation indicate that the approach works as intended. An additional important contribution from this work is the implementation of a well index calculator. In reservoir simulation, the well index relates the flow rate and pressure of the wellbore to the pressure solution of the subsurface fluid flow system, and is therefore an essential part in computing resulting production volumes. We also implement an algorithm that, given a slanted well and the physical state of a reservoir, calculates the well indices for the well blocks that are intersected by the well. In particular the well index calculation for deviated wells is a nontrivial task that is important for well placement optimization research. This task is already handled by some industry reservoir simulators, but the implementation is hidden from the end-user. All of the implementations are meant to be an addition to FieldOpt, a <b>petroleum</b> <b>field</b> development optimization framework that is currently under development by the Petroleum Cybernetics Group at NTNU...|$|E
40|$|The {{petroleum}} {{that also}} means "rock-oil" could not exist {{under the ground}} without reservoir rock be its sandstone, limestone, shale or granite. Therefore, understanding the rock characteristics and its behaviour is primarily important before the designing phase of a <b>petroleum</b> <b>field.</b> Knowing {{that most of the}} petroleum fluid will situated in sandstone, the emphasation would focus on this type of rock. The basic properties such as porosity, permeability, density, compressive strength, tensile and shear strength are need to be defined and understood, and the relationship among them should be identified. In this research paper, all rock properties and behaviour has been highlighted and the relationship between them has been explained. The problem related to the rock, e. g. shale swelling, drilling, pipe stuck, wellbore stability and sand production problem also have been discussed. The wellbore stability then been focused and related experimental work results presented. The perforation parameter and wellbore geometry have been varied to see the effects of rock stress on the wellbore stability. The results show that the rocks mechanics aspect must be considered in the designing phase of a <b>petroleum</b> <b>field</b> to avoid excessive money spending to threat the petroleum wells and to optimized the production. Therefore, the rock properties and behaviour should be understood in details before the designing period. From experimental works, {{it was found that the}} perforation parameters habe a great influence on the wellbore stability and sand production due to the stress redistribution depending upon the rock properties and behavior. The higher is the shot density, the lower will be the wellbore stability and increased sand production problem. The spiral pattern gave the best stability followed by inplane and inline patterns...|$|E
