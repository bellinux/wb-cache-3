An additional levy upon annual property taxes, ranging from $ 20 to $ 240, was used as the price of these additional programs. Mail surveys were sent to three main stakeholder groups: informed stakeholders, who had attended the Red River Basin Commission water management conference; decision-makers, including county commissioners and mayors in basin constituencies; and random residents. An overall response rate of 34 % was achieved. One interesting result was the general homogeneity of opinions across stakeholder groups.

The results of this 4 -year effort illustrate the value of optimization modeling for providing integrated information needed to manage a complex multipurpose water system.

The limitations of such modeling also are discussed.

Significant improvements in performance appear possible through water transfers and exchanges, conjunctive use, and various operational changes to increase flexibility. These changes also greatly reduce costs to agricultural and urban users of accommodating environmental requirements.
