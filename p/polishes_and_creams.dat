40|$|International audienceFinishing {{operations}} in shoe manufacturing process comprises operations such as application of <b>polishing</b> wax, <b>polishing</b> <b>cream</b> <b>and</b> spray solvents, and brushing {{in order to}} achieve high gloss. These operations require skilled worker and are generally difficult to automate due to the complex motion trajectories. The paper describes a robotic cell for finishing {{operations in}} a custom shoe production plant. Such customization of shoe production should allow production of small batches of shoes of the same type. This requires automatic set up and adaptation of the production line. To meet these requirements, a CAD system for automatic generation, optimization and validation of motion trajectories was integrated into a robotic cell. In automatic trajectory generation some of the major problems are limitations posed by the robot joint limits, robot singularities and environment obstacles. These problems were solved using the kinematic redundancy of the robot manipulator...|$|R
