5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with an obstructive {{pulmonary}} disorder such as bronchitis {{may present}} with a decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio on <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> Unlike other common obstructive {{disorders such as}} asthma or emphysema, bronchitis rarely causes a high residual volume (the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation effort).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> (PFT) is a {{complete}} evaluation of the respiratory system including patient history, physical examinations, chest x-ray examinations, arterial blood gas analysis, and <b>tests</b> of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function.</b> The primary purpose of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> is to identify the severity of pulmonary impairment. [...] <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> has diagnostic and therapeutic roles and helps clinicians answer some general questions about patients with lung disease. PFTs are normally performed by a respiratory therapist.|$|R

25|$|There {{is no cure}} {{available}} for asbestosis. Oxygen therapy at home is often necessary to relieve the shortness of breath and correct underlying low blood oxygen levels. Supportive treatment of symptoms includes respiratory physiotherapy to remove secretions from the lungs by postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration. Nebulized medications may be prescribed in order to loosen secretions or treat underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Immunization against pneumococcal pneumonia and annual influenza vaccination is administered due to increased sensitivity to the diseases. Those with asbestosis {{are at increased risk}} for certain cancers. If the person smokes, quitting the habit reduces further damage. Periodic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests,</b> chest x-rays, and clinical evaluations, including cancer screening/evaluations, are given to detect additional hazards.|$|E
2500|$|Pectus excavatum {{requires}} no corrective procedures in mild cases. [...] Treatment of severe cases can involve either invasive or non-invasive techniques {{or a combination}} of both. Before an operation proceeds several tests are usually to be performed. These include, but are not limited to, a CT scan, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests,</b> and cardiology exams (such as auscultation and ECGs). [...] After a CT scan is taken, the Haller index is measured. The patient's Haller is calculated by obtaining the ratio of the transverse diameter (the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage) and the anteroposterior diameter (the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum). A Haller Index of greater than 3.25 is generally considered severe, while normal chest has an index of 2.5. The cardiopulmonary tests are used to determine the lung capacity and to check for heart murmurs.|$|E

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of COPD is established through spirometry although other <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> can be helpful. A chest x-ray is often ordered {{to look for}} hyperinflation and rule out other lung conditions but the lung damage of COPD is not always visible on a chest x-ray. Emphysema, for example can only be seen on CT scan.|$|E
50|$|A {{spirometer}} is {{the main}} piece of equipment used for basic <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Tests</b> (PFTs). Lung diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema can be ruled out from the tests.

50|$|Although some {{patients}} present with normal lung function, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> generally demonstrate fixed airway obstruction with a decreased FEV1 and reduced FEV1/FVC ratio without bronchodilator response. Air trapping is common {{and leads to}} increased residual volumes. As the disease progresses, a mixed pattern of obstruction and restriction may develop. In general the obstructive lung disease is slowly progressive with periods of stability.|$|E
50|$|If the {{echocardiogram}} {{is compatible}} with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, common causes of pulmonary hypertension (left heart disease and lung disease) are considered and further tests are performed accordingly. These tests generally include electrocardiography (ECG), <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> including lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and arterial blood gas measurements, X-rays of the chest and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning.|$|E
50|$|Causes include {{breathing}} in toxic fumes, respiratory infections, connective tissue disorder, or following {{a bone marrow}} or heart-lung transplant. Symptoms may not occur until two to eight weeks following toxic exposure or infection. The underlying mechanism involves inflammation that results in scar tissue formation.
