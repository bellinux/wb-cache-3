5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{consumers}} of alcohol per capita in the world, the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at all hours via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E

25|$|A 2004 MIT {{study and}} an earlier paper {{published}} by the Society of Automotive Engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress ‘knock’ such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO2 emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.|$|E

Nevertheless, beer and soju are the two most common alcoholic drinks in the country, with 94.9 percent of all alcohol consumed (in <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol)</b> being liquor and the remaining 5.1 percent beer.

2500|$|Extensive {{research}} of Western cultures has consistently shown increased survival associated with light to moderate alcohol consumption. A 23-year prospective study of 12,000 male British physicians aged 48–78, found that overall mortality {{was significantly lower}} in current drinkers compared to non-drinkers even after correction for ex-drinkers. [...] This benefit was strongest for ischemic heart disease, but was also noted for other vascular disease and respiratory disease. [...] Death rate amongst current drinkers was higher for 'alcohol augmentable' disease such as liver disease and oral cancers, [...] but these deaths were much less common than cardiovascular and respiratory deaths. The lowest mortality rate was found for consumption of 8 to 14 'units' per week. [...] In the UK a unit is defined as 10ml or 8g of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Higher consumption increased overall mortality rate, but not above that of non-drinkers. Other studies have found age-dependent mortality risks of low-to-moderate alcohol use: an increased risk for individuals aged 16–34 (due to increased risk of cancers, accidents, liver disease, and other factors), but a decreased risk for individuals ages 55+ (due to lower incidence of ischemic heart disease).|$|E

It means fuddled, a condition from which one recovers more readily, than from downright drunkenness, and of which the physical effects are not so injurious. I believe the consequences of even total inebriety from wine, are not as bad as those which follow inebriety from whiskey and rum. But your real amateur here is no more content with wine than he is with us; he drinks a white brandy that is pretty near the <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether whole cells or crude enzyme extracts are more effective for preparative-scale ketone reductions by dehydrogenases as well as learning which cofactor regeneration scheme is most effective. Based on results from three representative ketone substrates (an α-fluoro-β-keto ester, a bis-trifluoromethylated acetophenone, and a symmetrical β-diketone), our results demonstrate that several nicotinamide cofactor regeneration strategies can be applied to preparative-scale dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions successfully. Optically <b>pure</b> <b>alcohols</b> can be readily derivatized and further transformed, making them pivotal intermediates in asymmetric synthesis. 1 Historically, catalytic hydrogenation has proven exceptionally useful in chiral alcohol synthesis, 2, 3 althoug...|$|R
