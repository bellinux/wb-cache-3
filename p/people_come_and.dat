We have strict quarantine laws and it should be the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate. We should be very careful about where certain Muslims come from and what they believe. If you come here, you should behave yourself – it's as simple as that... If <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> live in any country and their way of life is so different they need their own special laws, then possibly they have to pick somewhere else to live. The idea of any Muslim being photographed for a passport or a licence with one of those shrouds on – sorry, it just can't happen.|$|E
2500|$|Even when pastoring {{his church}} in Dallas, Bosworth would hold {{meetings}} in other areas, and his ministry {{always had an}} element of praying for the sick and divine healing. [...] When his wife died in 1919, he arranged for someone to look after his children, then went started larger scale evangelistic meetings. [...] It appears the turning point for Bosworth's healing ministry were meetings in Lima, Ohio in August 1920. [...] The pastor there asked Bosworth to preach on Divine healing. [...] While Bosworth had previously believed in Divine Healing, and had prayed for the sick, he had not previously preached Divine Healing. [...] Bosworth writes {{that he went to}} the Lord and asked [...] "'suppose I preach on Healing and the <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> don't get healed?' [...] The Lord said 'If people didn't get saved, you wouldn't stop preaching the gospel.'" [...] Bosworth studied the question, prayed about it {{and saw that it was}} God's will to heal as well as save people. [...] In the Lima meetings Bosorth stepped out on the Word, preached Divine Healing, and stated that healing of the body was as much a part of the gospel as salvation of the soul. [...] He invited the sick to come and hear the word of healing for their bodies. [...] The people responded, they were healed, and it led to more who came for salvation.|$|E
