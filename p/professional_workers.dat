It {{was the first}} full-time congressional lobby for minority group civil rights. Throughout the organization's life, the Non-Partisan Council worked with the NAACP, National Urban League, The United Office and <b>Professional</b> <b>Workers</b> of America, The National Association of Graduate Nurses, the American Federation of Churches, the Colored Women's Club, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Auxiliary, and the New York Voter's League. The NPC was dissolved on July 15, 1948, by twelfth Supreme Basileus Edna Over Gray-Campbell. A year later, Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to apply for life membership in the NAACP.|$|E
5|$|These {{effects were}} not felt uniformly, however. For example, {{by the end}} of the Brezhnev era, blue-collar workers had higher wages than <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in the Soviet Union. For example, the wage of a {{secondary}} school teacher in the Soviet Union was only 150 rubles while a bus driver's wage was 230. As a whole, real wages increased from 96.5 rubles a month in 1965 to 190.1 rubles a month in 1985. A small minority benefited even more substantially. The state provided daily recreation and annual holidays for hard-working citizens. Soviet trade unions rewarded hard-working members and their families with beach vacations in Crimea and Georgia. Workers who fulfilled the monthly production quota set by the Soviet government were honored by placing their respective names on the factory's Roll of Honor. The state awarded badges for all manner of public services, and war veterans were allowed to go to the head of the shop queues. All members of the USSR Academy of Sciences were given a special badge and their own chauffeur-driven car. These awards, perks and privileges made it easier for some to find decent job placements, though they did not prevent the degeneration of Soviet society. Urbanization had led to unemployment in the Soviet agricultural sector, with most of the able workforce leaving villages for the local towns.|$|E

30|$|Indeed, being <b>professional</b> {{means that}} <b>workers</b> are {{expected}} to assume appropriate work identities prescribed by an organisation (Fournier 1999). Professionalism, Fournier argues, {{has turned into a}} disciplinary mechanism that shapes a <b>worker’s</b> conduct. The <b>professional</b> <b>worker</b> is autonomous, responsible and competent, and can be controlled from a distance through internalising these traits (Fournier 1999 : 284 – 290). In other words, professionalism has become a defining quality of an ideal worker.|$|R

25|$|Since real numbers can be {{represented}} as distances or intervals on a line, the slide rule was invented in the 1620s, shortly after Napier's work, to allow multiplication and division operations {{to be carried out}} significantly faster than was previously possible. Edmund Gunter built a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale at the University of Oxford. His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations, including multiplication and division. William Oughtred greatly improved this in 1630 with his circular slide rule. He followed this up with the modern slide rule in 1632, essentially a combination of two Gunter rules, held together with the hands. Slide rules were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved <b>professional</b> <b>workers,</b> until the invention of the pocket calculator.|$|E
25|$|A common unit of {{exposure}} of lung tissue to alpha emitters is the {{working level month}} (WLM), {{this is where the}} human lungs have been exposed for 170 hours (a typical month worth of work for a miner) to air which has 3.7 kBq of 222Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products). This is air which has the alpha dose rate of 1 working level (WL). It is estimated that the average person (general public) is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 rem), while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public). Lastly the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) consider that the exposure of the lungs to 1 Bq of 222Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products) for one year will cause a dose of 61 μSv.|$|E

McCarthy was especially critical of the film, calling it [...] "no clearer to a child than the Gorbachev-Reagan talks".
