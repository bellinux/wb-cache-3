30|$|The linear {{displacement}} of a horizontal pipeline should not exceed 40  % {{of the length}} of a sliding <b>pipe</b> <b>bracket.</b>|$|E
30|$|The <b>pipe</b> <b>bracket</b> of the {{buttress}} was 1.5  m and {{the maximum}} {{displacement of the}} horizontal pipeline was 12.8  mm, which was far smaller than 1500  ×  40  % =  600  mm. The maximum angular displacement of the pipeline was generated at Bend 1 (gas pipeline) and was 0.11 °, which was smaller than 4 °, indicating that the section of parallel oil and gas pipelines met displacement requirements.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of brake application delays in Australian train brake systems {{began with a}} literature review of pneumatic train braking systems. Data located in the review gave examples of brake application delays of pre 1990 designs from the U. K., India and North America. Information on application delays on later Australian designs was scarce. Reading of literature has shown {{a difference between the}} Australian and North American control valves in the way the propagation of the pressure reduction rate in the brake pipe is maintained. Control valves of the North American style allow the brake pipe air to be connected for a short time to a small cavity or quick service volume of each valve. The quick service volume is then released to atmosphere. The action of exhausting a small amount of air from the brake pipe helps to ensure a propagation of an adequate pressure reduction rate as it travels to the next valve. Australian control valves rely on the ratio of the volume of brake pipe between control valves {{and the size of the}} quick service volume or bulb to ensure the propagation of an adequate pressure reduction as it travels to the next valve. The air in a bulb of an Australian valve is not expelled to atmosphere until a brake release is made. The research explored possible reductions in application delays by utilizing an experimental pipe test rack that included 4 control valves and 120 meters of brake pipe. Experiments with different configurations of exhaust orifices or chokes, valves and branch pipe lengths that supplied the valves gave a record acquired by data acquisition of the timing of each valve and the local pressure drop from a valve or each valve for comparison. Experiments with exhaust chokes that gave a reduction drop rate in the brake pipe that approached the minimum required to operate a control valve resulted in instability of the application operation of the control valve. The quick service volume of different sizes was included in the experiments to give comparisons in the propagation of the pressure reduction toward the end of a long train. Further increases into the size of the bulb of a control valve to enhance the propagation features toward the end of a long train are discussed. The branch pipe with different diameters from 12 mm to 20 mm and lengths from 160 mm to 800 mm when fitted to an adaptor <b>pipe</b> <b>bracket</b> were investigated and results show that larger diameters gave larger gulps in the brake pipe. Other components that were studied included the <b>pipe</b> <b>bracket</b> that is fitted on some control valves. The <b>pipe</b> <b>bracket</b> and isolation cock was found to add 282 mm of additional length to the air path and while not changing the operation of the valve, the results showed a smaller drop in local pressure in the brake pipe to assist the pressure reduction rate than shown in valves without pipe brackets...|$|E

50|$|Although {{the chassis}} monocoques for 701/2 and 701/4 had been {{manufactured}} by March, the final buildup {{of the cars}} was by Tyrrell mechanics. As a result, the blue Tyrrell cars incorporated {{a significant number of}} differences and tweaks in their configuration to the cars run by the works March team and those supplied to other customers. The first major difference was the specification of Dunlop tyres, rather than the Firestone rubber with which the works cars were equipped and the 701 had been designed around. In an attempt to develop the car and improve its handling the Tyrrell team made adjustments to the position of the suspension mounting points and added a damper to the steering system. More subtle variations related to the positioning of exhaust <b>pipe</b> <b>brackets,</b> wing struts, the oil radiator, and the pipe runs for lubrication and coolant fluids.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} used for small {{castings}} requiring good tensile strength {{and the ability to}} flex without breaking (ductility).

5000|$|Inside {{the church}} the nave is {{separated}} from the aisles by arcades of four bays supported on alternate round and octagonal piers. All the fittings date {{from the time of}} the building of the church. These include the pews with poppyhead ends, the stone font, the stone pulpit, and the wooden chancel screen. [...] The original gas fittings are still in the church, although they are no longer functioning. These include the <b>pipes,</b> the wall <b>brackets,</b> and on the top of the chancel screen, a burner bar consisting of a row of gas jets. [...] The organ formerly in the church has been removed.|$|R
