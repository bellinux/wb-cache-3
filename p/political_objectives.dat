5|$|Due to Muhammad's rushed actions, Ibrahim {{failed to}} {{co-ordinate}} his own uprising with his brother's, and only declared himself {{two weeks before}} Muhammad's death, on 23 November. Ibrahim's revolt at first met with quick success, securing control over Ahwaz, Fars and Wasit, and his army register (diwan) was said to number 100,000 names. When the news of Muhammad's death arrived, the rebels acclaimed Ibrahim as his successor. Ibrahim now {{was faced with a}} choice: a group of dedicated Alid supporters, which had managed to escape from Kufa, urged him to march on the city, while the Basrans preferred to stay in place and reach a negotiated settlement. This dissension is indicative of the disparate nature of Ibrahim's supporters. The Alid cause was fractured into several competing groups with different <b>political</b> <b>objectives,</b> and Ibrahim represented the Hasanid branch only. The Husaynids refused to take part in an uprising, while Ibrahim quarrelled with the Zaydi branch on everything from <b>political</b> <b>objectives</b> and leadership to the tactics to be followed or the provisioning of their troops. Elsewhere, support for the uprising was cautious and most Alid supporters adopted a wait-and-see attitude, limiting themselves to verbal support or contributions of money.|$|E
5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} within the past ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other <b>political</b> <b>objectives.</b> , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 war was {{the first}} time since the fall of the Soviet Union that the Russian {{military}} had been used against an independent state, demonstrating Russia's willingness to wage a full-scale military campaign to attain its <b>political</b> <b>objectives.</b> The failure of the Western security system to respond swiftly to Russia's attempt to forcibly revise the borders of an OSCE member country revealed its weaknesses. The division between Western European and Eastern European nations also became apparent over the relations with Russia. Ukraine and other post-Soviet states received a clear message from the Russian leadership that the possible accession to NATO would cause a foreign invasion and the break-up of the country. Effective annexation of Abkhazia was also one of Russia's geopolitical goals. The construction of the EU-sponsored Nabucco pipeline connecting Central Asian reserves to Europe in Transcaucasia was averted.|$|E
5|$|After Zhou and Lin {{negotiated}} Stalin's approval, Peng {{attended a}} conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered {{the first wave of}} Chinese soldiers—in total more than 260,000 men—to cross into Korea on the night of October 19. On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign. From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty-eighth parallel. Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel in order to fulfill Mao's <b>political</b> <b>objectives</b> for the war. About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign, but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 – June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops, but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th parallel. In the evaluation of Korean War historian Roy Edger Appleman, Peng's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng's successful campaigns, from October–December 1950, were fought under Mao's direction, but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January–May 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao's instructions. Modern scholars reject this interpretation, and credit Peng with both the successes and failures of the war.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge communists {{had formed}} an {{alliance}} to fight U.S.-backed regimes {{in their respective}} countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to pre-empt {{an attempt by the}} Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc. In spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978, the Vietnamese military withdrew because their <b>political</b> <b>objectives</b> had not been achieved—the Khmer Rouge remained unwilling to seriously negotiate.|$|E

25|$|In July 1910 Germans in Omaha rallied {{with other}} {{immigrant}} organizations {{across the city}} to create the National German-American Alliance. At least 54 social, farming and cultural organizations from around Omaha were represented at the first meeting.

By masking <b>political</b> <b>objectives</b> within a German cultural event, National German-American Alliance leaders were able to openly politicize the event without scrutiny from the mainstream press.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{historian}} Yuri Felshtinsky {{compared the}} takeover of the Russian State by the siloviki to an imaginary scenario of the Gestapo coming to power in Germany after World War II. He pointed out a fundamental difference between the secret police and ordinary political parties, even totalitarian ones, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Russia's secret police organizations are wont to employ the so-called active measures and extrajudicial killings. Hence, they killed Alexander Litvinenko and directed Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their <b>political</b> <b>objectives,</b> according to Felstinsky.|$|E
40|$|The author {{wishes to}} prove: a) From 1914 to 1916 the {{existence}} of a Portuguese National Strategy was subordinated to Political Power measures in order, at the same time, either to control, maintain, reduce or solve the internal conflict, or to reduce the external threat. b) The changes in <b>political</b> <b>objective,</b> at the same period of time, were mostly derived from the perception of the need to connect the threat to {{the existence of}} a republican system and the sovereignty of Portugal instead of the changes that took place at Political Power level. In order to obtain the proposed goal the author analyses with the changes in the national <b>political</b> <b>objective</b> related to the political, economical, social and military measures which were being adopted and the changes of the struggle scene. After identifying the several changes in the <b>political</b> <b>objective</b> and in the struggle scene we come to the National Strategy draft.

25|$|Economic {{activity}} was governed by Five year plans, divided into monthly segments, with government planners frequently attempting to meet plan targets {{regardless of whether}} a market existed for the goods being produced.
