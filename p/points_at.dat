40|$|International audienceHumans usually <b>point</b> <b>at</b> {{objects to}} {{communicate}} with other persons, although they generally avoid <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> the other's body. Moreover, patients with heterotopagnosia after left parietal damage cannot <b>point</b> <b>at</b> another person's body parts, although they can <b>point</b> <b>at</b> objects and at their own body parts and although they can grasp the others' body parts. Strikingly, their performance gradually improves for figurative human body targets. Altogether, {{this suggests that the}} body of another real person holds a specific status in communicative pointing. Here, we test in healthy individuals whether performance for communicative pointing is influenced by the communicative capacity of the target. In Experiment 1, <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> another real person's body parts was compared to <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> objects, and in Experiment 2, the person was replaced by a manikin. While reaction times for <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> objects were shorter compared to <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> other person's body parts, they were similar for objects and manikin body parts. By adapting Experiment 1 to PET-scan imaging (Experiment 3), we showed that, compared to <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> objects, the brain network for <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> other person's body parts involves the left posterior intraparietal sulcus, lesion of which could cause heterotopagnosia. Taken together, our results indicate that the specificity of <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> another person's body goes beyond the visuo-spatial features of the human body and might rather rely on its communicative capacity...|$|R
