40|$|Aripiprazole and the {{candidate}} antipsychotics, S 33592, bifeprunox, N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC) and <b>preclamol,</b> are partial agonists at D(2) receptors. Herein, we examined their actions at D(2 L) and D(3) receptors expressed separately or together in COS- 7 cells. In D(2 L) receptor-expressing cells co-transfected with (D(3) receptor-insensitive) chimeric adenylate cyclase-V/VI, drugs reduced forskolin-stimulated cAMP production by approximately 20 % versus quinpirole (48 %). Further, quinpirole-induced inhibition was blunted by aripiprazole and S 33592, confirming partial agonist properties. In cells co-transfected with {{equal amounts of}} D(2 L) and D(3) receptors (1 : 1), efficacies of aripiprazole and S 33592 were attenuated. Further, in cells co-transfected with D(2 L) and an excess of D(3) receptors (1 : 3), aripiprazole and S 33592 were completely inactive, and they abolished the actions of quinpirole. Likewise, bifeprunox, NDMC and <b>preclamol</b> lost agonist properties in cells co-transfected with D(2 L) and D(3) receptors. Accordingly, at split D(2 trunk) /D(3 tail) and D(3 trunk) /D(2 tail) chimeras, agonist actions of quinpirole were blocked by aripiprazole and S 33592 that, like bifeprunox, NDMC and <b>preclamol,</b> were inactive alone. Conversely, when a 12 amino acid sequence in the third intracellular loop of D(3) receptors {{was replaced by the}} homologous sequence of D(2 L) receptors, aripiprazole, S 33592, bifeprunox, NDMC and <b>preclamol</b> inhibited cAMP formation by approximately 20 % versus quinpirole (42 %). Moreover, at D(2 L) receptor-expressing cells co-transfected with modified D(3 i 3 (D 2)) receptors, drugs behaved as partial agonists. To summarize, low efficacy agonist actions of aripiprazole, S 33592, bifeprunox, NDMC and <b>preclamol</b> at D(2 L) receptors are abrogated upon co-expression of D(3) receptors, probably due to physical association and weakened coupling efficacy. These findings have implications for the functional profiles of antipsychotics...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} aripiprazole, S 33592, bifeprunox, N-desmethylclozapine and <b>preclamol</b> acting as partial {{agonists}} on recombinant D(2 L) and D(3) receptors expressed both separately and concomitantly in COS- 7 cells are evaluated here. Aripiprazole, S 33592, bifeprunox, N-desmethylclozapine and <b>preclamol</b> behave as partial agonists on D(2 L) receptors coupled with adenylyl cyclase, but they behave as antagonists on co-expression of D(3) with D(2 L) receptors. These data raise the intriguing hypothesis that antipsychotic actions of "partial agonists" such as aripiprazole may not reflect inefficient stimulation of D(2) and/or D(3) receptors but, by analogy with other antipsychotics, may instead represent a blockade of D(2) /D(3) heterodimers (and/or D(3) receptors) that are "weakly" coupled to transduction mechanisms postsynaptically of the dopaminergic pathway...|$|E
40|$|A domino aza-Cope/aza-Prins cascade {{enabled the}} {{synthesis}} of {{a new class of}} 4 -hydroxypiperidine-appended mono, bis, tris, and tetrakis unimolecular compounds that served as efficient ligands to catalyze Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions under aerobic conditions. Various biaryls, terphenyls, and heterocyclic biphenyls were obtained in good to excellent yields. The ligands were also capable of catalyzing the Heck-Mizoroki reaction. As an application, the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction was used in {{the synthesis of}} incrustoporin, its analogs, and the drug molecule <b>preclamol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using {{asymmetric}} catalysis {{to simultaneously}} form carbon-carbon bonds and generate single isomer products is strategically important. Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling {{is widely used}} in the academic and industrial sectors to synthesize drugs, agrochemicals and biologically active and advanced materials. However, widely applicable enantioselective Suzuki-Miyaura variations to provide 3 D molecules remain elusive. Here we report a rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura reaction with important partners including aryls, vinyls, heteroaromatics and heterocycles. The method {{can be used to}} couple two heterocyclic species so the highly enantioenriched products have a wide array of cores. We show that pyridine boronic acids are unsuitable, but they can be halogen-modified at the 2 -position to undergo reaction, and this halogen can then be removed or used to facilitate further reactions. The method is used to synthesize isoanabasine, <b>preclamol,</b> and niraparib â€“ an anticancer agent in several clinical trials. We anticipate this method will be a useful tool in drug synthesis and discovery...|$|E
