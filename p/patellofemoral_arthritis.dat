30|$|Medial osteoarthritic (OA) {{knees with}} {{symptomatic}} <b>patellofemoral</b> (PF) <b>arthritis</b> were {{not recommended for}} UKA in the past (Kozinn and Scott 1989; Berger et al. 2004). However, the Oxford UKA has shown good clinical results in patients with medial OA knee with symptomatic PF arthritis (Beard et al. 2007 a, b; Kang et al. 2011). But, the patient with very severe arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella that include bone loss, grooving, and ebernation still were not recommended for the procedure (Beard et al. 2007 a, b). Presently, <b>arthritis</b> of the <b>patellofemoral</b> compartment, especially <b>arthritis</b> of the lateral facet of the patella, is a controversial issue for the recommendation of UKA (Kang et al. 2011; Beard et al. 2007 a, b; Song et al. 2016). Therefore, some surgeons choose patients with asymptomatic PF arthritis for UKA (Kozinn and Scott 1989; Berger et al. 2004; Hernigou and Deschamps 2002). Some orthopedists accept symptomatic PF arthritis, but the arthritis has to involve only the medial facet or with minimal involvement of the lateral facet (Song et al. 2016). Some orthopedists ignore the symptom of PF arthritis. However, if the patella has very severe arthritis of the lateral facet with bone loss, grooving and ebernation; total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is recommended as the first line (Beard et al. 2007 a, b).|$|R
40|$|Isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> (PF) <b>arthritis</b> of {{the knee}} is a common cause of {{anterior}} knee pain and disability. Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) is a bone conserving solution for patients with PF degeneration. Failure mechanisms of PFA include growing tibiofemoral arthritis and loosening of components.

This research work aims at determining the structural effects of the implantation of PF prosthesis Journey PFJ (Smith&Nephew, USA) on femur cancellous bone. For this purpose, the finite element (FE) method is considered to perform computational simulations for different conditions, such as well-fixed and loosening scenarios. From the global results obtained, in the well-fixed scenario, a strain decrease on cancellous bone was noticed, which can be related to bone resorption. In the loosening scenario, when the cement layer becomes inefficient, a significant increase of cancellous bone strain was observed, which can be associated with bone fatigue-failure. These strain changes suggest a weakness of the femur after PFA. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Severe {{arthritis}} of {{the knee}} is a disabling condition, with over 50, 000 knee replacements performed {{each year in the}} UK. Isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> joint <b>arthritis</b> occurs in over 10 % of these patients with the treatment options being patellofemoral arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty. Whilst many surgeons believe total knee arthroplasty is the 'gold standard' treatment for severe knee <b>arthritis,</b> <b>patellofemoral</b> arthroplasty has certain potential advantages. Primarily, because this operation allows the patient to keep the majority of their own knee joint; preserving bone-stock and the patients' own ligaments. Patellofemoral arthroplasty has also been recognised as a less 'invasive' operation than primary total knee arthroplasty, facilitating a more rapid recovery. There are currently no published results of randomised clinical trials comparing the two arthroplasty techniques. The primary objective of the current study is to assess whether there is a difference in functional knee scores and quality of life outcome assessments at one year post-operation between patellofemoral arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. The secondary objective is to assess the complication rates for both procedures. Methods/design Patients who are deemed suitable, by an Orthopaedic Consultant, for patellofemoral arthroplasty and medically fit for surgery are eligible to take part in this trial. The consenting patients will be randomised in a 1 : 1 allocation to a total knee or patellofemoral arthroplasty. The randomisation sequence will be computer generated and administered by a central independent randomisation service. Following consent, all participants will have their knee function, quality of life and physical activity level assessed through questionnaires. The assigned surgery will then be performed using the preferred technique and implant of the operating surgeon. The first post-operative assessments will take place at six weeks, followed by further assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months. At each assessment time point all complications will be recorded. In addition, community and social care services usage will be collected using a patient questionnaire at 3, 6 & 12 months. The patients will then be sent an annual postal questionnaire. The questionnaire will ask about any problems, knee pain and function following their knee arthroplasty to monitor long-term function and failure rates.

30|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} patients younger than 50  years old with isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> is initially aimed at preserving the patellofemoral joint. Osteotomy to transfer load from lateral to medial and from distal to proximal on the patella {{has been described}} with positive results in these patients [37, 38]. Patients with advanced arthritis including femoral trochlear disease are not good candidates for osteotomy. Patellectomy and isolated patellar resurfacing have been advocated in the past even if with both poor long-term results and potential negative effects on a future TKR [39, 40]. In literature different authors reported excellent results following total knee arthroplasty {{for the treatment of}} isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> in elderly patients [41 – 43].|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{considering}} {{the anatomy of}} native MPFL as a thin fascial band, hamstring tendons fail to reproduce basic anatomic features. Being thick, cord-like and much stronger, reconstruction with hamstring grafts can lead to medial patellar overload and excessive tensioning of the graft, thus causing graft failure with the risk of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction Isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> (PF) <b>arthritis</b> is rare, {{and there}} is no {{complete}} agreement about the best surgical treatment. The operative treatments are total knee arthroplasty and patellofemoral replacement (PFR). The incidence of many early complications of PF arthroplasty has decreased with the introduction of newer designs. Nowadays, the main cause of revision surgery is the progression of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. In the past, PF arthroplasty was contraindicated in patients with evidence of osteoarthritis or pain in medial or lateral tibiofemoral compartments. The improvement in implant designs and surgical techniques has allowed the addition of a monocompartmental arthroplasty for the medial or lateral tibiofemoral compartment. In this work, we evaluate our first experience with PF arthroplasty and its combination with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Materials and Methods From May 2014 to March 2016, we treated 14 patients. An isolated PF arthroplasty was performed in six knees (five patients), and a combined PF and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty was performed in nine cases. We observed a significant improvement in the clinical and functional Knee Society Scores (KSSs) after surgery in our patients. Results We obtained good results in our cases both for clinical and functional KSSs. Patellar clunk was recorded in one case. Discussion and Conclusion We are going toward a new attitude in which partial osteoarthritic changes could be treated with partial resurfacing prosthetic solutions such as unicompartmental, bi–unicompartmental or PFR alone, or unicompartmental combined, which respects the cruciates and achieves maximal bone preservation, which is vital, particularly, for young patients...|$|R
40|$|Isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> (PF) <b>arthritis</b> of {{the knee}} affects {{approximately}} 10 % {{of the population in}} general. Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) is a bone conserving solution for patients with isolated PF degeneration. Typical failure mechanisms of PFA include growing tibiofemoral arthritis or loosening of components. The implant loosening can be related to bone resorption, or fatigue-failure of bone by overload. This work aimed to determine the structural effects of the implantation of PF prosthesis on femur cancellous bone, because studies on the state of strain/stress on PFA are very limited. The hypothesis here considered {{lies in the fact that}} the nature and magnitude of PF cyclic loads generate strain/stress levels at bone that exceeds the fatigue strength of these materials. The Journey PFJ was the prosthesis taken into consideration in this study. The finite element (FE) method is used to model, simulate and analyze the effect PF loads on cancellous bone. These FE models were previously validated with prior experimental results. The implanted model was simulated with two different cement-cancellous bone interface conditions, with the aim of representing well-fixed and loosening scenarios, for the prosthesis. From the global results produced, in the well-fixed scenario, a strain decrease on cancellous bone was noticed, which can be associated with bone resorption risk. In the loosening scenario, when the cement layer becomes inefficient, a large increase of cancellous bone strain was observed, which can be associated with bone fatigue-failure risk. These insights given by strain changes suggest a vulnerability of the femur after PFA. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - SFRH/BD/ 63882 / 200...|$|R
30|$|In the past, medial {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) knee with symptomatic <b>patellofemoral</b> (PF) <b>arthritis</b> has {{not been}} recommended for a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). However, recent studies have reported that UKA has shown good results in patients with medial OA of the knee, including those with PF arthritis. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the results between patients with medial OA knees; those with severe arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella and patients without severe arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella following mobile bearing UKA. We have prospectively evaluated 104 patients (114 knees) who had undergone an Oxford mobile bearing UKA. The mean follow-up was 19.05  months (range 12.30 – 29.70  months). The patients were divided into two groups: group I consisted of eighty patients (88 knees) who did not have severe arthritis of the lateral facet (Outerbridge grade 0 – 2) and group II had twenty-four patients (26 knees) who had severe arthritis of the lateral facet (Outerbridge grade 3, 4). We recorded the incidence of anterior knee pain, knee scores, pain scores, and functional scores in comparison of the two groups. The visual analog scale (VAS) and incidence of post-operative anterior knee pain had not shown any significant differences. The VAS for post-operative anterior knee pain was 0.11 (SD 0.56, range 0 – 3 point) versus 0.12 (SD 0.59, range 0 – 3 point) for group I and group II patients, respectively (P =  0.98). The incidence of post-operative anterior knee pain was 4.5 versus 3.8  % for group I and group II patients, respectively (P =  0.88). The pain scores and functional scores had not exhibited any differences. However, the knee scores of patients with severe arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella was worse than those seen in patients without severe arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella with a statistical significance. It was scored as 96.78 (SD 4.56, range 85 – 100) versus 94.43 (SD 4.50, range 81 – 100) for group I and group II patients, respectively (P =  0.02). Anterior knee pain, pain scores, and functional scores were not different between the two groups following a medial Oxford UKA. However, the knee scores of patients with severe arthritis of the lateral facet were worse than those in patients without severe arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{patellofemoral}} arthroplasty {{has attracted}} increased interest as a salvage treatment for isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis.</b> However, {{there are very}} few reports of the experience with modern generation patellofemoral arthroplasties. This investigation describes a collective experience of four centres reporting on the outcome in patients of the use of one patellofemoral arthroplasty device. There were 70 patients (79 knees) who had failed an extensive non-operative treatment regimen and/or various conventional alternative surgical treatments. At a mean follow-up of three years (range: 2 – 6  years), there were 66 knees that had Knee Society Scores greater than 80 points (84 %). Seventy-one knees (90 %) functioned without pain in daily activity and stair climbing.

30|$|Likewise young {{patients}} with advanced isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis,</b> not candidates for osteotomy, patellectomy, isolated patellar resurfacing, or total knee arthroplasty still represent {{a challenge for}} the orthopaedic surgeons. The dramatic increase in use of traditional UKR with a much more conservative approach to the knee, {{have resulted in a}} rekindled interest in the concept of isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty.|$|E
30|$|Likewise {{patellofemoral}} arthroplasty is {{an attractive}} alternative to TKR with potential advantages.

40|$|Background: Distal femoral varus {{osteotomy}} is {{a procedure}} that is performed {{for the treatment of}} lateral-compartment osteoarthritis of the knee as well as for correction of the associated valgus deformity. However, its role remains con-troversial and its efficacy in the treatment of associated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> has not been well studied. The pur-pose {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the outcome after distal femoral osteotomy performed for the treatment of painful genu valgum and to assess the influence of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> on the results. Methods: Thirty patients (thirty knees) were managed with distal femoral varus osteotomy for the treatment of nonin-flammatory lateral-compartment arthritis of the knee associated with a valgus deformity. Twelve knees had isolated lateral-compartment arthritis, ten had mild-to-moderate degenerative changes in the other two compartments, and eight knees had severe <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> in addition to lateral-compartment disease. The osteotomy site was fixed with a 90 ° blade-plate. After a mean duration of follow-up of ninety-nine months, all patients were evaluated with use of the Hospital for Special Surgery knee-rating system and a physical examination. Results: At the time of the most recent follow-up, twenty-five patients (83 %) had a satisfactory result and two had a fair result according to the Hospital for Special Surgery rating system. The remaining three patients had had a conver-sion to a total knee arthroplasty.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} in our study. First, {{the subjects in}} our study were not randomized into the two groups as the finding of arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella would have been evaluated during surgery and thus the patients were classified into one or another group. However we were blinded {{in the evaluation of}} the anterior knee pain, pain scores and functional scores of the patients, post operatively. Second, the preoperative demographic data was not the same between the two groups. The patients with arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella have shown a lower ROM, lower knee scores, and more varus deformity than had been seen in patients without arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella. Third, we decided to determine the arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella through direct observation during the surgical procedure. There is a study from Koike et al. that had demonstrated that determining <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> by a skyline view radiograph has shown to be inaccurate and it was technically demanding (Koike et al. 2015). Fourth, this study was done from a short follow-up. However our study did not find the progressive <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> in both groups of patients following an Oxford UKA.|$|E
40|$|Background: Multiple {{treatment}} {{methods have been}} advocated for <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis.</b> The {{purpose of the present}} study was to report on our experience with the use of total joint replacement for the treatment of prima-rily severe <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> of the knee in patients more than fifty-five years of age. Methods: Between January 1980 and December 1994, thirty knee replacements were performed in twenty-seven patients for the treatment of arthritis that primarily involved the patellofemoral joint. The Ahlbäck radio-graphic evaluation scale was used to grade the severity of arthritis; the mean score was 4. 83 points (range, 4 to 5 points) for the patellofemoral compartment and 0. 6 point (range, 0 to 1 point) for both the medial and lat-eral compartments. The patients included eighteen women and nine men who had a mean age of seventy-three years (range, fifty-nine to eighty-eight years). None of the patients had had any prior procedures on the knee, but all had been treated for a minimum of six months with nonoperative measures. The mean preoperative Knee Society score was 50 points (range, 20 to 64 points). Results: At a mean duration of follow-up of eighty-one months (range, forty-eight to 133 months), there were twenty-eight excellent, one good, and one poor result.

The poor result was in a patient who sustained a rupture of the patellar tendon post-operatively as the result of a fall, which necessitated a tendon reconstruction...|$|E
30|$|We {{performed}} {{recently a}} matched paired study comparing UKR to computer assisted TKR {{in the treatment}} of isolated medial femoro-tibial arthritis. In the study strict criteria were used for patient selection and matching. These criteria included bone mass index, pre-operative range of motion and grade of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis,</b> which have not been documented in previous studies. Alignment of all the computer-assisted TKR prosthesis in this study in the frontal plane was within 4 ° of ideal for the Hip–Knee–Ankle angle reducing any influences of malalignment upon the final outcome. Both Knee Society Score and a dedicated UKR outcome score (GIUM) [28] were used to evaluate the results [29].|$|E
30|$|Few {{studies in}} the {{literature}} have compared the clinical outcomes of UKR with TKR. Newman et al. [20] presented a randomized study comparing UKR to TKR showing a greater range of motion following UKR. This difference was not shown to be statistically significant using the Bristol scoring system. The authors did not however analyse the grade of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> in each group and performed a patella resurfacing in all patients in the TKR group. The degree of patellofemoral degeneration may have adversely affected the results in the UKR group. However this retrospective study was not based on patients with matched grades of arthritic change.|$|E
40|$|In {{this review}} the {{evidence}} {{for the management of}} patients with patellofemoral disorders is presented confined to anterior knee pain and patellar dislocation (excluding <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis).</b> Patients present along a spectrum of these two problems and are best managed with both problems considered. The key to managing these patients is by improving muscle function, the patient losing weight (if overweight), and judicious use of analgesics if pain is an important feature.

Operations should be reserved for those with correctable anatomical abnormalities that have failed conservative therapy.

30|$|Based on the {{outcomes}} after medial soft-tissue reefing and lateral release procedures, non-operative treatment {{was still the}} leading recommendation after primary patellar dislocation until the last 4 to 5  years, except {{in the presence of}} an osteochondral flake fracture (Stefancin and Parker 2007; Smith et al. 2011; Zheng et al. 2014). However, patellar redislocation occurs in 15 % to 72 % of patients treated non-operatively, and even patients who did not report recurrent patellar instability episodes following non-operative treatment often did not restore their pre-injury function and reported persistent limitations in their daily life activities within 3  years after the primary dislocating event (Magnussen et al. 2017). In addition, recent studies have shown a high risk of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> after non-operative treatment of lateral patellar dislocation in the long term (Sanders et al. 2017; Salonen et al. 2017).|$|E
30|$|The {{patients}} who had progressive arthritis of the patellofemoral compartment and needed a revision TKA following UKA was minimal. Parrette et al. {{has shown that the}} mode of failure of a fixed bearing UKA in long-term follow up was from polyethylene wear, they found that only one patient had symptomatic <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> and needed a revision TKA (Parratte et al. 2009). Foran et al. have also shown that the incidence of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> following a fixed bearing UKA were increased after long-term follow up. However, most patients did not have symptoms (Foran et al. 2013). Presently, the UKA procedure for {{patients who}} have medial OA knee with arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella remains a topic of debate among orthopedic surgeons. Few recent studies have shown good clinical results for this subgroup (Kang et al. 2011; Song et al. 2016). There is a belief that the reasons for reducing anterior knee pain should come first and that the cartilage damage and full thickness cartilage loss has been generally found in the elderly (Emery and Meachim 1973). Second, the overload to the patellofemoral compartment is reduced by the correction of any deformity to a normal alignment and generates a new contact surface between the femoral condyle and the patella (Beard et al. 2007 a, b). Third, no impingement between the femoral condyle and the facet of the patella as the osteophyte at the femoral condyle and patella are removed during the surgery (Beard et al. 2007 a, b). Therefore, patients with OA that have arthritis of the lateral facet of the patella would not be a contraindication to a UKA. This study aims to compare the results between patients with non-severe arthritis (group I) and severe arthritis (group II) of the lateral facet of the patella following a medial Oxford UKA. The post-operative outcomes were evaluated by assessing the incidence of anterior knee pain, the VAS for anterior knee pain, pain scores, functional scores, and knee scores.|$|E
40|$|Background: Ten {{to fifteen}} percent of knee {{arthritis}} {{is reported to}} be isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis.</b> Total knee arthroplasty is not recommended for isolated patella femoral arthritis particularly in young patients. We present the retrospective review of 45 consecutive patellofemoral replacements performed in 41 such patients, between June 2002 and January 2007. Materials and Methods: All patients were operated by single surgeon (SM) or under his supervision. All forty five patients had minimum three year followup and had the data collected prospectively. No patient was lost to followup. This data was later collated by review of notes, radiographs, and a clinical followup. The patients were assessed using knee function score and Melbourne patellofemoral score. Results: The average followup was 4. 5 years. The preoperative average Melbourne (Bartlett) score was 10 (range 5 - 21). Preoperative knee functional score averaged 57 (range 23 - 95). The average range of movement was 116 ° (range 100 °- 140 °). Postoperatively, the average Melbourne knee score improved to 25 (range 11 - 30), while the knee function score was 85 (range 28 - 100). The difference was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Eighty-five percent rated the result as good or excellent, while 12 % rated it as fair. Five percent thought the result was poor. The most common complaint was clicking at 40 ° of flexion (n= 7). Six patients underwent arthroscopic lateral release, which improved the symptoms in four patients. Two knees were revised one due to progression of tibiofemoral arthritis and the other due to persistent clicking, yielding a survival rate of 95. 6 % at an average five year followup. Conclusion: The Avon patellofemoral joint replacement provides predictably good results and excellent survivorship in the medium term, for isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis.</b> However, progression of tibiofemoral arthritis remains unpredictable and therefore patient selection is crucial to ensure success.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the healing potential of the cartilage. Arthroscopy was performed in 18 patients at the time of implant removal. The mean age of the patients was 42. 1  years. The time elapsed from the index surgery to the arthroscopy and implant removal surgery was 12. 9  months. During the arthroscopy, we inspected articular step-off, cartilage loss, and joint surface irregularities. Cartilage irregularities were observed in 13 of the 18 patients. Five patients had well-healed cartilage at the patellar surface. Although none of the patients had displacement at final follow-up X-rays, step-off was detected in two patients during arthroscopy. Our observation showed that cartilage lesions did not correlate with clinical and radiological evaluation. Despite good knee scores, we observed surface irregularities, chondral lesions, and fibrillation in most of the cases implicating subsequent <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis...</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{previous}} studies have shown similar results with our study. Song et al. used a fixed bearing UKA, and they selected the patients who had only mild to moderate arthritis of the medial and lateral facet of the patella seen in intra-operative findings. They {{have shown that the}} post-operative VAS for anterior knee pain of patients with patellar arthritis was low (1.7 – 2.3 points). Kang et al. have also shown that the patients with <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> at medial and lateral facets on preoperative radiographies had shown good results following a medial Oxford UKA. Beard et al. have shown that preoperative anterior knee pain and intra-operative full thickness cartilage loss of the medial and lateral facet of the patella were not contraindications for the Oxford UKA. However, all of the {{previous studies}} did not include patients with ebernation of the lateral facet of the patella. In contrast, our study had 3 patients who presented with ebernation. Two patients had not experienced anterior knee pain following the surgery. Another one had anterior knee pain, but described it as only an occasional pain, mild in intensity.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 56 -year-old male with {{bilateral}} total knee prostheses suffering from bilateral knee pain mainly on the right side and referred for bone scintigraphy. The medical history of the patient revealed an opening wedge high tibial osteotomy performed nine years earlier, with insertion of two blocks of ceramic made of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate in a wedge configuration as synthetic bone substitutes. The porous structure of these implants is analogous to the architecture of cancellous bone and permits fibrovascular and bone ingrowth, promoting the healing process. Planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT showed an intense uptake within those implants in the early phase {{as well as in the}} late phase of the bone scan. It also showed bilateral <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis.</b> A (99 m) Tc-labeled antigranulocyte antibody scintigraphy was negative for infection or inflammation. Bilateral patellar resurfacing led to complete symptom regression, confirmed at 10 months follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this scintigraphic pattern with such a high tracer uptake reflecting bone substitute osteointegration has not yet been published. This should be considered in patients with such bone replacement materials that are increasingly used, in order to avoid false diagnosis of inflammation or infection...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patellofemoral {{replacements}} {{are used}} to treat isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> in carefully selected patients. The Kinematch® custom-designed implant is placed directly on subchondral bone, leading critics of the device {{to believe that this}} results in overstuffing and limitation of flexion in cases of trochlear dysplasia; the current study aims to evaluate this premise. Methods: A retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 24 patients (32 knees) was conducted.   Trochlear dysplasia was evaluated using pre-operative axial CT scans, and knees were categorized as having minimal or moderate/severe dysplasia (moderate = flat trochlea, severe = convex trochlea). The primary outcome was post-operative knee flexion. Results: There was no statistical or clinical difference in post-operative knee flexion between the minimal (120 °+ 12) and the moderate/severe dysplasia (117 °+ 9) groups (p=. 34).   Conclusions: Use of the Kinematch® patient-specific custom trochlear component does not significantly limit flexion in cases of trochlear dysplasia, and although the surgeon has the ability to deepen the trochlea by way of the pre-operative model, this is not necessary.   Keywords: Patellofemoral replacement; custom; flexion; trochlear dysplasia Level of Evidence: III, Case-control stud...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} outcome of 94 Miller-Galante unicompartmental knee {{replacements}} done by a single surgeon over 16  years in a district general hospital in the UK. <b>Patellofemoral</b> <b>arthritis</b> was considered a contraindication only if symptomatic and confirmed on radiography and surgery. Deformity when present was correctable. The mean age at surgery was 66. 54  years. The mean follow-up was 10. 8  years (2 – 16  years). The mean Bristol knee score was 43. 1 (28 – 50); 86 % of the patients had good or excellent scores. The average range of flexion was 110. 6 ° (80 – 130 °); 89 % of the knees had an appropriate alignment. Using revision as the endpoint, outcome for every knee was established. The survival rate for medial unicompartmental knee replacements was 94 % at ten years and 87 % at 15  years. Although the survival rate for the lateral unicompartmental knee replacement was 97 % at five years, it dropped to 41 % at eight years. Lateral unicompartmental knee replacements formed only 9. 6 % of all the replacements in this series. The results for medial unicompartmental knee replacements are similar to reports by other authors for similar and mobile bearing designs. Unicompartmental knee replacement results in a more kinematic knee and produces good functional results...|$|E
