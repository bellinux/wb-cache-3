50|$|A <b>pilot</b> <b>plant</b> is a pre-commercial {{production}} system that employs new production technology and/or produces small volumes of new technology-based products, mainly {{for the purpose}} of learning about the new technology. The knowledge obtained is then used for design of full-scale {{production system}}s and commercial products, as well as for identification of further research objectives and support of investment decisions. Other (non-technical) purposes include gaining public support for new technologies and questioning government regulations. <b>Pilot</b> <b>plant</b> is a relative term in the sense that <b>pilot</b> <b>plants</b> are typically smaller than full-scale production plants, but are built in a range of sizes. Also, as <b>pilot</b> <b>plants</b> are intended for learning, they typically are more flexible, possibly at the expense of economy. Some <b>pilot</b> <b>plants</b> are built in laboratories using stock lab equipment, while others require substantial engineering efforts, cost millions of dollars, and are custom-assembled and fabricated from process equipment, instrumentation and piping.

40|$|AbstractA {{new type}} of thermal energy storage (TES) with wide {{potential}} for renewable energy sources as well as conventional energy sources will be presented. The main energy storage medium is a special type of concrete that has significantly higher thermal conductivity than normal concrete. Although the recipe of this material is quite complex the main component is quartzite, a natural geo-material readily available {{in many parts of}} the world. Further, heat is transported in and out of the storage by way of a heat transfer fluid (HTF) which flows through steel pipe heat exchangers that are cast into concrete storage elements. These elements are specially designed to deal with thermal deformations and stressing. The flow through the modular system is typically arranged in parallel and serial fashion. A NEST TES is fully scalable and may consist of thousands of storage elements compactly arranged within an insulated building. The scalability implies that there is virtually no limit to size; for instance, an installation may have storage capacity for several GWhth. Thermal oil, pressurized water/steam, or compressed gases may be used as HTF. The storage is suited for high temperature applications up to 550 °C for electric power generation as well as moderate temperature applications such as process heat down to 100 °C. The storage is well suited for concentrated solar power (CSP) and other applications with direct generation of heat. The storage can equally well be used for storing “surplus” electricity, converted to heat, in areas with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources such as wind energy and/or <b>photovoltaic.</b> The first <b>pilot</b> <b>plant</b> will be built at the solar energy research facility at Masdar Institute in Abu Dhabi this year...|$|R

In this paper an actual case history is cited {{as an example of the}} problems and benefits of conducting <b>pilot</b> <b>plant</b> tests which set the commercial design bases for a distillation train.
