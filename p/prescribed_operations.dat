40|$|We {{question}} whether creativity requires functions exclusive {{to the human}} mind or it can rather be obtained by the mere performance of well-defined <b>prescribed</b> <b>operations.</b> The natural thinking process involves a complexity of sensory inputs, psychological factors, cognitive background, social rules and constraints which interfere (constructively and at times, destructively) with the results and evaluation of the creative process. It is therefore desirable to study the intrinsic properties of the creative thought dynamics in contexts in which creativity represents a dominant factor. Among the domains in which creativity plays an essential role is advertising. By structural analysis of a large mass of past advertising ideas we isolated a set of conceptual structures which characterize generically creative ideas. In order to validate these findings, we constructed idea-generating routines that lead to these conceptual structures. To ensure that human creativity does {{not interfere with the}} performance of those routines, we implemented them by computer. The computer-generated ideas ranked significantly higher on a creativity scale than the ideas produced by the human subjects. In {{view of the fact that}} the computerized routine is not performing any complex creation, the focal question raised is why do human judges perceive its outcomes as superior to human ideas performing the same task?...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for higher {{production}} capacity and natural-gas energy savings, improvements {{were made to the}} rotary dryers in the drying process of wet pelletized oil-furnace carbon blacks. Since the rotary dryers were originally designed for drying semi-wet pelletized oil-furnace carbon blacks, they did not entirely satisfy optimal conditions for drying wet pelletized oil-furnace carbon blacks. Figure 1 shows the drying principle with key dimensions. The energy for drying the wet pelletized oil-furnace carbon blacks was provided by natural gas combustion in an open-furnace system with an uncontrolled feed of combustion air. Improvements on the rotary dryers were carried out by adjusting the excess oxygen in the gases passing through the butterfly valve on the dryer exhaust stack. By regulating the butterfly valve on the dryer exhaust stack, and applying the <b>prescribed</b> <b>operations</b> for drying wet pelletized oil furnace carbon blacks, the excess oxygen in the tail gases was adjusted in the range of φ = 3. 0 % and 5. 0 %, {{depending on the type of}} oil-furnace carbon blacks. Suggested also is installation of a direct-reverse automatic butterfly valve on the dryer exhaust stack to automatically determine the volume fraction of oxygen in the tail gas, and the volume flow rate of natural gas for combustion. The results the improvements carried out are shown in Tables 3 to 5. Table 2 shows the thermal calculations for the hood of the rotary dryer. Preheating of the process water in the temperature range of 70 °C and 80 °C is also recommended using the net heat from the oil-furnace process for wet pelletization. The results of preheating the process water are shown in Table 1. Depending on the type of oil-furnace carbon black, the aforementioned improvements resulted in natural gas energy savings ranging from 25 % to 35 % in relation to the average natural gas requirement in the drying process, and thus a reduction in carbon emissions of up to 40 %, which is shown in Table 6. A schematic of the next proposed situation for complete automatization of the process for drying wet pelletized oil-furnace carbonblacks is shown in Figure 2...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{algorithm}} has two facets. It has a text —a written text—, {{which usually}} {{appears to be}} an enumerated list of operations. In addition, whenever an algorithm is applied to a specific set of numerical values, practitioners derive from its text a sequence of actions, or operations, to be carried out. In the execution of the algorithm, these actions generate events that constitute a flow of computations eventually yielding numerical results. This chapter aims mainly to develop some reflections on the relationship between these two facets: the text and the different sequences of actions that practitioners derive from it. Two tools prove useful in developing the argumentation. Firstly, the author uses the description of textual enumerations, as developed by Jacques Virbel, to find out how enumerations of operations were carried out in the text of algorithms and how these enumerations were used. This approach deals with the text of the algorithm as text. Then the chapter focuses on the language acts carried out in some of the sentences composing the texts, since, when <b>prescribing</b> <b>operations,</b> the texts of the algorithms differ in that they use distinct ways of carrying out directives...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} {{is to develop a}} {{framework}} to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of sustainability assessment practice in different jurisdictions. To do this, it is important to clarify what is meant by effectiveness. Chapter 3 set out a typology of effectiveness criteria derived from the academic literature and identified that effective sustainability assessment involves procedural, substantive, transactive and normative elements. The key message from Chapter 3 is that effectiveness is difficult to measure in absolute terms because of the diverse and even divergent reference points against which effectiveness might be judged. Consequently, in comparing and evaluating sustainability assessment in different places, the way that the ecological, social, political and cultural pluralism that provides {{the context in which the}} work of sustainability assessment is done must be recognised and accommodated as a central point of any comparative discussion. The framework outlined in this chapter considers how this emerging field of practice integrates learning and knowledge into continuous improvement (Boothroyd et al., 1995; Jha-Thakur et al., 2009). Figure 8. 1 depicts the four categories of effectiveness introduced in chapter 3, and incorporates the critical influences of pluralism, and knowledge and learning, into a typology that provides a coherent framework for comparative evaluation of sustainability assessment across different jurisdictions, times and approaches in terms of methods and data availability. We recognise that sustainability assessment is a relatively new practice, and that like any field of professional practice, it needs constant review, development and improvement within the community of practice. Therefore it is inappropriate to attempt to create here a single hard-and-fast set of criteria to compare and evaluate effectiveness. Rather, this section explores how both the formally <b>prescribed</b> <b>operation</b> of sustainability assessment (equivalent to external sustainability assessment as defined in chapter 7), and the less formal cultures of professional practice (equivalent to internal sustainability assessment as defined in chapter 7) are evolving in different places, and what that experience brings to the task of improving future sustainability assessments...|$|R

The point ignition densities at which high mortality rates were observed were higher than those described in Johansen (1984), where no effect of density on canopy injury was observed. It {{is not clear whether}} the greater effects on trees from dense arrays of point ignitions were related to merging fire-lines or the existence of an area source of heat rather than a line source.

40|$|We {{show that}} the class of polynomial-size {{branching}} programs can be obfuscated according to a virtual black-box notion akin to that of Barak et. al., in an idealized black-box group model over pseudo-free groups. This class is known to lie between NC 1 and P and includes most interesting cryptographic algorithms. The construction is rather simple {{and is based on}} Kilian’s randomization technique for Barrington’s branching programs. The black-box group model over pseudo-free groups is a strong idealization. In particular, in a pseudo-free group, the group operation can be efficiently performed, while finding surprising relations between group elements is intractable. A black-box representation of the group provides an ideal interface which permits <b>prescribed</b> group <b>operations,</b> and nothing else. Still, the algebraic structure and security requirements appear natural and potentially realizable. They are also unrelated to the specific function to be obfuscated. Our modeling should be compared with the recent breakthrough obfuscation scheme of Garg et al. [FOCS 2013]: While the high level structure is similar, some important details differ. It should be stressed however that, unlike Garg et al., we do not provide a candidate concrete instantiation of our abstract structure. ...|$|R
