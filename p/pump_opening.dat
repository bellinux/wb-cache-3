Many States have tried to achieve this over the past 50 years through centrally planned public tube-well programs.

Subsidies and import restrictions have kept pump prices in India artificially inflated, by more than 35 - 45 %, over those of neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh.

A good example of this approach is the jointly managed subsidy programs that have helped usher in eastern India's belated Green Revolution.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} hydraulic systems by eliminating valve throttling losses, a direct displacement open circuit is proposed to control a single rod hydraulic actuator.

The experimental results are compared with modeling of cavitating conditions that includes cavity dynamics, turbulence generated by individual oscillating cavity, cell wall strength and geometrical & operating parameters of cavitation device. Theoretical model for quantifying the cavitationally generated turbulent shear and extent of microbial disinfection has been developed.

It was also observed that shock waves generated due to cavitation is not the sole cause for zooplankton disruption.

The leakage of high pressure CO 2 involves complex phenomena, including the expansion and flashing of the CO 2 jet, dispersion of a dense CO 2 cloud, falling of the solid CO 2 and sublimation of the dry ice bank, as well as changes of pressure and temperature in the pipelines. A new experimental setup is developed to study the leakage behavior of high pressure CO 2 flow in a circulation pipeline system, which is about 23 m long. The inner diameter of the pipeline is 30 mm.

Most of the EtO gas mixture was released to the indoor atmosphere at the air gap located at the connection of the drain to the outlet of the water sealed vacuum <b>pump.</b> The <b>opening</b> of the sterilizer door at the completion of the sterilization cycle can result in a very short high exposure to the operator, followed by an increase in the workroom EtO concentration.

The composition and size of the sterilized load, the location of the sterilizer and the time constraints on sterilization, the type of sterilizer and the types of controls selected, and the level to which EtO exposures are to be controlled all affect the level or extent of control needed by a hospital. In chamber aeration is the best means of control.

We hypothesize that increased P availability increases ATP concentration, driving rapid increases in root concentration of several cations by stimulating the proton <b>pump</b> and <b>opening</b> gated ion channels. Considering the rapid turnover of ATP in plant tissues, P-induced changes in root mineral element concentrations should be observed {{in a relatively short}} time. Therefore, experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of P on root tissue cation concentrations over the time course of 30 min to 8 hrs. Squash plants were grown hydroponically in a complete nutrient solution (500 µM P) for six days, following by four days with 50 µM P. Treatments of 50 and 500 & µM P were started on day 10 and roots were harvested after 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours. Roots were rinsed in DI H 2 O, blotted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and freeze-dried. Freeze-dried samples were ground, digested in nitric acid using a closed-vessel microwave system, and macro- and micronutrient concentrations were determined using ICP-OES. As expected, higher P in nutrient solution resulted in higher P concentrations in squash roots. This increase was first observed after 2 hrs. As for other cations, high P increased leaf magnesium, sodium, and calcium concentrations, and decreased zinc and potassium concentrations. Interestingly, the change in concentration of all these elements was observed within 30 min. This is, to our knowledge, the first study showing a short-time impact of P nutrition on root cation composition. It supports the hypothesis of the role of P in cation uptake.

For each pattern, the mechanism and control of gas exchange is analyzed {{in terms of a}} two-step model, consisting of tracheolar and trans-spiracular steps in series. During the intermittent gas exchange that characterizes the most quiescent grasshoppers, spiracles open and close in response to changing carbon dioxide, and trans-spiracular resistance controls gas exchange. In resting but alert grasshoppers, abdominal pumping occurs, and gas exchange is controlled equally by tracheolar and trans-spiracular re-sistances; tracheal oxygen and carbon dioxide are regulated by variation in abdominal <b>pumping</b> and spiracular <b>opening.</b> During hopping, abdominal pumping does not occur, and bulk gas flow is driven by cuticular deforma-tions associated with locomotion. Increased cellular oxygen consumption de-pends on use of internal oxygen stores and increased partial pressure gradi-ents. After hopping ceases, abdominal pumping increases dramatically and restores tracheal gas composition; however, the rise in abdominal pumping after hopping is not affected by tracheal gas levels. During flight, bulk flow to the flight muscles is driven by tidal thoracic auto-ventilation, while the remainder of the body is ventilated by abdominal pumping. During both hop-ping and flight, the greatest resistances to gas transport exist in the tracheo-lar rather than the trans-spiracular step...|$|R

A micro viscous pump design with unequal inlet and outlet areas is proposed in this paper. The flow field of the viscous pump is investigated using 2 D laminar simulations. The mass flow rate and driving power are studied with different opening angles. The effects of the Reynolds number and the pressure load on the working performance are discussed in detail.

40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} mechanism of glacial erosion is quarrying: the growth and coalescence of cracks in subglacial bedrock and dislodgement of resultant rock fragments. Although evidence indicates that erosion rates depend on sliding speed, rates of crack growth in bedrock may be enhanced by changing stresses on the bed caused by fluctuating basal water pressure in zones of ice-bed separation. To study quarrying in real time, a granite step, 12 cm high with a crack in its stoss surface, was installed at the bed of Engabreen, Norway. Acoustic emission sensors monitored crack growth events in the step as ice slid over it. Vertical stresses, water pressure, and cavity height {{in the lee of}} the step were also measured. Water was pumped to the lee of the step several times over 8 days. <b>Pumping</b> initially caused <b>opening</b> of a leeward cavity, which then closed after pumping was stopped and water pressure decreased. During cavity closure, acoustic emissions emanating mostly from the vicinity of the base of the crack in the step increased dramatically. With repeated pump tests this crack grew with time until the step 2 ̆ 7 s lee surface was quarried. Our experiments indicate that fluctuating water pressure caused stress thresholds required for crack growth to be exceeded. Natural basal water pressure fluctuations should also concentrate stresses on rock steps, increasing rates of crack growth. Stress changes on the bed due to water pressure fluctuations will increase in magnitude and duration with cavity size, which may help explain the effect of sliding speed on erosion rates...|$|R
40|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{increasing}} petroleum consumption {{on a world}} wide basis {{there is a need}} to find new resources. As mature fields are drained, reservoir pressure falls, which again leads to tight pressure margins. To reduce down time due to hole stability problems (e. g. kicks) there is a demand for accurate control of the pressure profile in the well. As the pressure profile is not known and depends on unknown factors such as friction loss {{there is a need to}} estimate the pressure. In this thesis an observer that adapts to unknown factors, such as friction and density changes, and estimates the bottomhole pressure is presented. Furthermore, a parameter estimator for the bulk modulus in the annulus is developed as an extension to the observer to facilitate for future control design. Both designs are based on a third order model and provide rigid proofs of stability and convergence of the estimated pressure and parameters. The pressure estimate from the observer is shown to converge to the true pressure under reasonable conditions. For parameter estimates to converge to their true values conditions on excitation are presented.

In this study, we show that the H+-ATPase in guard cells is reversibly inhibited by Ca 2 + at physiological concentrations. Isolated microsomal membranes of guard cell protoplasts from fava bean exhibited vanadate-sensitive, ATP-dependent proton pumping. The activity was inhibited almost completely by 1 [mu]M Ca 2 + with a half-inhibitory concentration at 0. 3 [mu]M and was restored immediately by the addition of 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N[prime],N[prime]-tetraacetic acid, a calcium chelating reagent. Similar reversible inhibition by Ca 2 + was shown by the generation of electrical potential in the membranes. Activity of ATP hydrolysis was inhibited similarly by Ca 2 + in the same membrane preparations. The addition of 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N[prime],N[prime]-tetraacetic acid and EGTA, Ca 2 + chelators, to epidermal peels of fava bean induced stomatal opening in the dark, and the opening was suppressed by vanadate. This suggests that the lowered cytosolic Ca 2 + activated the proton pump in vivo and that the activated <b>pump</b> elicited stomatal <b>opening.</b> Inhibition of H+-ATPase by Ca 2 + may depolarize the membrane potential and could be a key step in the process of stomatal closing through activation of the anion channels. Furthermore, similar inhibition of the proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis by Ca 2 + was found in isolated plasma membranes of mesophyll cells of fava bean.

However, it is actually the summation of the action potential from the sinoatrial node, the atria, the atrioventricular node, the His-Purkinje system, and the ventricles. Although the action potential can be divided grossly into 5 phases, its characteristics vary in different cardiac tissue. This is because the action potential is the end-result of multiple ion channels, <b>pumps,</b> and exchangers <b>opening</b> and closing in concert, and the properties and distribution of these components can be different from one tissue to another. The ion channels can be activated by changes in the membrane voltage and specific ligands, and can be modulated by factors such as neurotransmitters (e. g., through the G-protein system), the G-proteins directly, or other ions. Only in the last 10 years have investigators been able to use molecular biology techniques to peek into the primary structure of ion channels and to develop more workable models of the channel functions. The primary structure and the putative secondary structure of the ion channels show resemblance among the groups, suggesting that, except for IsK, the development of ion channels started with IK 1 and IK(ACh), followed by Ito and IK, and then by INa and ICa.

40|$|The Lower Permian {{reservoirs}} in {{the western}} Sichuan Basin are ultra-deep with high temperature, high pressure and developed natural fractures. Leakage and contamination of drilling fluid is the main factor restricting reservoir stimulation effects, so the acidification will be the solution also as the first choice to enhance the gas recovery. In view of this, an acidification design was proposed to minimize the contamination skin factor to the highest degree. A model was first developed to calculate the critical <b>pumping</b> rate for <b>opening</b> natural fractures in deep beds. Then, the acidification model for the rock samples of natural fractures in the experimental scale was modified, and a model was established for predicting the effective penetration distance of acid and the fracture aperture in the conditions of wellbores. Accordingly, a skin factor calculation model for network-fracture acidification was developed. It is indicated that when the acid pumping rate is 5. 0  m 3 /min, all natural fractures around Well S 1 - 1 can be opened, regardless of their dip angles. Besides, the advantage of high-rate acid injection emerges gradually when the injected acid is more than 100  m 3. Moreover, for minimizing the skin factor, the network-fracture acidification in Well S 1 - 1 was optimized by pumping 210  m 3 acid {{at the rate of}} 4. 5  m 3 /min.

Not {{for want}} of a {{crowning}} intellect, for none of the many minds concerned in the development strikes one--as the mind of Newton, Shakespeare, or Darwin strikes one--as being that of an unprecedented man. It is not that the need for the railway and steam engine had only just arisen, and--to use one of the most egregiously wrong and misleading phrases that ever dropped from the lips of man--the demand created the supply; it was quite the other way about. There was really no urgent demand for such things at the time; the current needs of the European world seem to have been fairly well served by coach and diligence in 1800, and, on the other hand, every administrator of intelligence in the Roman and Chinese empires must have felt an urgent need for more rapid methods of transit than those at his disposal. Nor was the development of the steam locomotive the result of any sudden discovery of steam. Steam, and something of the mechanical possibilities of steam, had been known for two thousand years; it had been used for <b>pumping</b> water, <b>opening</b> doors, and working toys, before the Christian era. It may be urged that this advance was the outcome of that new and more systematic handling of knowledge initiated by Lord Bacon and sustained by the Royal Society; but this {{does not appear to have}} been the case, though no doubt the new habits of mind that spread outward from that centre played their part. The men whose names are cardinal in the history of this development invented, for the most part, in a quite empirical way, and Trevithick's engine was running along its rails and Evan's boat was walloping up the Hudson a quarter of a century before Carnot expounded his general proposition. There were no such deductions from principles to application as occur in the story of electricity to justify our attribution of the steam engine to the scientific impulse. Nor does this particular invention seem to have been directly due to the new possibilities of reducing, shaping, and casting iron, afforded by the substitution of coal for wood in iron works; through the greater temperature afforded by a coal fire. In China coal has been used in the reduction of iron for many centuries. No doubt these new facilities did greatly help the steam engine in its invasion of the field of common life, but quite certainly they were not sufficient to set it going. It was, indeed, not one cause, but a very complex and unprecedented series of causes, that set the steam locomotive going. It was indirectly, and in another way, that the introduction of coal became the decisive factor. One peculiar condition of its production in England seems to have supplied just one ingredient that had been missing for two thousand years in the group of conditions that were necessary before the steam locomotive could appear.|$|R
40|$|The sudden {{ionization}} of {{a molecule}} by an attosecond pulse {{is followed by}} charge redistribution on a time scale from a few femtoseconds down to hundreds of attoseconds. This ultrafast redistribution {{is the result of}} the coherent superposition of electronic continua associated with the ionization thresholds that are reached by the broadband attosecond pulse. Thus, a correct theoretical description of the time evolution of the ensuing wave packet requires the knowledge of the actual ionization amplitudes associated with all open ionization channels, a real challenge for large and medium-size molecules. Recently, the first calculation of this kind has come to light, allowing for interpretation of ultrafast electron dynamics observed in attosecond pump–probe experiments performed on the amino acid phenylalanine [Calegari et al., Science 2014, 346, 336]. However, as in most previous theoretical works, the interpretation was based on various simplifying assumptions, namely, the ionized electron was not included in the description of the cation dynamics, the nuclei were fixed at their initial position during the hole migration process, and the effect of the IR probe pulse was ignored. Here we go a step further and discuss the consequences of including these effects in the photoionization of the glycine molecule. We show that (i) the ionized electron does not affect hole dynamics beyond the first femtosecond, and (ii) nuclear dynamics has only a significant effect after approximately 8 fs, but does not destroy the coherent motion of the electronic wave packet during at least few additional tens of fs. As a first step towards understanding the role of the probe pulse, we have considered an XUV probe pulse, instead of a strong IR one, and show that such an XUV probe does not introduce significant distortions in the pump-induced dynamics, suggesting that pump–probe strategies are suitable for imaging and manipulating charge migration in complex molecules. Furthermore, we show that hole dynamics can be changed by shaping the attosecond <b>pump</b> pulse, thus <b>opening</b> the door to the control of charge dynamics in biomolecules...|$|R
