Greater opacity means investors form more dispersed beliefs about an intermediary's profitability. The endogenous benefit of opacity is lower fragility when <b>profitability</b> <b>is</b> {{expected to be}} high. However, the endogenous cost of opacity is a "partial run," whereby some investors receive bad private signals about profitability and run, even though the intermediary is solvent.

Furthermore I show that customer –and supplier <b>profitability</b> <b>is</b> correlated, and that the suppliers that are linked to high (low) profitability customer firms also have high (low) profitability.
