5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote Bluetooth {{protocol}} can {{be implemented}} on other devices including cell phones, which often have poor usability with games. Two students have demonstrated this concept by creating a driver software that has the capability to connect the Wii Remote to a Symbian smartphone.

25|$|On June 5, 2013, Argentine chef Federico Tobares {{disappeared}} {{while driving}} from Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. He was {{speaking on the}} <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend and {{told her he was}} driving a vehicle for his boss to exchange for another. He has been missing ever since. Tobares had moved from Argentina to Mexico in 2009 to pursue a career as a chef specialized in Mexican cuisine. He worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki, a hotel and restaurant in Jalisco. According to investigators, these two businesses were owned by Gerardo González Valencia, a suspected drug lord of Los Cuinis, a branch of the Jalisco-based criminal group Jalisco New Generation Cartel.|$|E

25|$|Paperless geocaching means hunting a geocache {{without a}} {{physical}} printout of the cache description. Traditionally, {{this means that}} the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a PDA or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA. Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with a web-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.|$|E

500|$|In 1983, {{a class-action}} lawsuit was {{filed against the}} Trump Organization, {{concerning}} unpaid labor union pension and medical obligations. Trump testified in 1990 that he was unaware that 200 undocumented Polish immigrants, some of whom lived at the site during a 1980 transit strike and worked round-the-clock shifts, {{were involved in the}} destruction of the Bonwit Teller building and the Trump Tower project. Trump said that he rarely visited the demolition site and never noticed the laborers, who were known as the [...] "Polish Brigade" [...] and who were visually distinct for their lack of hard hats. A labor consultant and FBI informant testified that Trump was aware of the illegal workers' status. In testimony, Trump stated that he and an executive used the pseudonym [...] "John Baron" [...] in some of his business dealings, although Trump said that he did not do so until years after Trump Tower was constructed. A labor lawyer testified that he was threatened over the <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> $100 million lawsuit by a John Baron who supposedly worked for the Trump Organization. Donald Trump later told a reporter, [...] "Lots of people use pen names. Ernest Hemingway used one." [...] A judge ruled in favor of the Polish laborers in 1991, saying that the organization had to pay the workers. The case went through several appeals from both sides as well as non-jury trials, and was reassigned to different judges several times. At one point, it was compared by a presiding judge to Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the seemingly unending case that forms the backbone of Charles Dickens' Bleak House. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in 1999, with its records sealed.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show Picket Fences, which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of Picket Fences, and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of Picket Fences. Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> producer of Picket Fences. We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The Picket Fences episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to Picket Fences has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the Picket Fences episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson. Ladner, British Columbia served as a location for Delta Glen, while the beef processing plant was shot in a facility in Cloverdale, with the local employees being used for the butchering and cleaning up scenes.|$|E

2500|$|Gabrion's {{neighbors were}} also interviewed by police. They {{reported}} that Gabrion had a handyman named John Weeks, {{but that he}} hadn't been seen around the property in a few weeks. Investigators contacted Weeks' girlfriend, who identified a photo of Gabrion as a man introduced to her as [...] "Lance". She reported that Lance had left the area with Weeks and she hadn't heard from him and was unsure {{of how to get}} a hold of him. She also reported to police that on one occasion she caught John on the <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl named Rachel. When she confronted him, she was told that he was trying to do a favor for Lance, who was interested in being set up with her. Authorities believe that Weeks was the mystery date who picked up Rachel and Shannon on the day they were last seen and that he arranged the date at the behest of Gabrion.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, Lindsey {{is finally}} exposed as the Gloved Hand Killer. When Lindsey tries {{to hide from}} the police, Silas {{contacts}} her and helps her escape. She recognises him from the hospital, and he reveals his true identity to her. Silas tells her that he wants to help her as he, [...] "knew a Lynsey once before", and it is a beautiful name. He expresses a deep admiration for her work so far and offers her the chance to go into hiding with him as he feels that with the right tuition from him, the pair would make an unstoppable force. As Lindsey gives him a willing smile, the two serial killers drive off into the night. Lindsey later calls Silas in desperate need of his help after she attempts to convince Kim to steal her son, JJ from her ex-fiancé, Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Silas replies by saying that he knew she would return to him, and hangs up the <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sinister smile. Silas turns his attention to Kim, using a fake name [...] "Edward" [...] on social media, to lure her in. Believing that he has information on Lindsey's whereabouts, Kim inadvertently goes along with it. Silas tells her he is a retired policeman and uses her as a decoy so that the two killers can go ahead with their dastardly plans. Silas later meets Lindsey at a car park and tells her that he has Kim on side and that the plan is proceeding perfectly: that sooner or later, Lindsey will be reunited with her son and he will finally get another chance to claim the life of Mercedes.|$|E
