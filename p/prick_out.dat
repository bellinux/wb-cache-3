40|$|In my proposal, I principally draw on {{the central}} role the “Non(e) “ plays {{in the field of}} phenomenological research. Hereby I mean the very {{heterogeneous}} field opened up by concepts like Epoché, the invisible, “passio”, the diverse tacit dimensions of knowing, the alien, the incalculable etc. It will not be my aim to display all these aspects and to systematize them, but as a contribution to the conference-theme I would like to illuminate their ethical dimensions to a certain degree. First in an argumentative way and then by means of an example, I want to show that the ethical and also moral dimensions of experience are based in a special awareness of difference. I will work out important aspects of this difference by referring to Bernhard Waldenfels et al. It will come out that such awareness is neither merely given nor is it completely enacted, much less cognitively. By asking whether it is possible to pursue important ethical aims through works of art, I will use an example to outline the mode of a pre-predicative aesthetical perception of an artwork in its body-based ethical aspects. Hereby, it is taken into account that an artwork could <b>prick</b> <b>out</b> existential possibilities of man as a theme sometimes in an inhuman way. Deviant behaviour and thinking might be imaged. The difference between images and ethical thinking is sometimes even shown as a sharp contrast. Irritations might not only be caused by the artwork itself, also the spectator may misunderstand the ethical impacts of a work of art. Thus, an ambiguity of art becomes apparent. This ambiguity signifies the edge of our ethical experiences. At the same time it is comparable with a basic experience in educational processes. Deviant and insolent behaviour of children day by day puts the ethical and moral judgement of pedagogues in a pre-predicative and not fully intelligible way to the test. I will take the reception of art as an example to deal with ambiguity by pointing out that as an experience it is ruled by unknown criteria {{and at the same time}} by the task to get an orientation. The thesis will be unfolded that not mainly the rational thinking but the body is the medium of this quest. ...|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the feelings}} of characters in Seneca’s tragedies prior and after recognising their guilt. Expression of {{the feelings of}} the characters in Seneca’s two tragedies Hercules Furens and Oedipus is compared, features characteristic of tragedies of recognition and the main feelings of their characters are revealed: disintegration and social fear, guilt and shame. The latest studies on Seneca’s dramas are reviewed, as well as historical knowledge about the Roman theatre in Seneca’s time, the impact of the pantomime on tragedies is presented. In the opinion of the present-day scholars (George W. M. Harrison, A. J. Boyle, Denis and Elisabeth Henry, Bernhard Zimmermann, Alessandra Zanobi) Seneca’s tragedies were devoted to being played in the theatre rather than to be recited. Pantomime that was popular in Rome in the first century exerted great influ­ence on the structure of Seneca’s dramas. Descriptive scenes, stopping the time of the play, remarks made aside, long introductory monologues are seen today as the specificity of fabula saltata rather than a lack of Seneca’s theatre experience. The chorus or an actor in these tragedies relates of what the character is doing on the stage so that the spectators should understand what the only pantomime dancer performing all the roles without words is doing on the stage. The distinguishing feature of Seneca’s tragedies is representation of the characters’ feelings. The poet, when creating scenes of chaos, the horror of the world to come, the pending world catastrophe of the Earth in his tragedies, seeks to frighten the spectators. Seneca, with the help of adynata, a figure of speech, portrays the characters’ anger and their fear of disintegration. The idea, which was popular in the first century, that man’ sin would cause a world catastrophe is used in Seneca’s tragedies to strengthen the culmination mo­ments and social fear of the characters. Having recognised their crime, Seneca’s characters feel shame. They express this feeling by the desire to hide from people, to kill themselves, to leave the town, to <b>prick</b> <b>out</b> their eyes. A feeling of shame causes anger in Seneca’s characters; however, later the shame makes them control their aggression. In his tragedies Seneca treats the crime as a mis­take, shows lots of pangs that the characters suffer so that we should feel pity for them rather than feel horrified by the characters’ cruelty. Nonetheless, Seneca’s characters understand that fate might send a misfortune, however, guilt is born in man’s heart and it is an individual himself that chooses evil. Therefore main characters of tragedies feel guilt after recognising their crime. Oedipus and Hercules express their guilt through a sense of dirtiness, soiling themselves. It seems to them that they would never wash their hands; they feel indebted to their town and their own people. Having experienced a feeling of guilt Hercules chooses a greater suffering than death – to live in shame because he wants his father to be happy having his son alive. Atoning for his guilt Oedipus also chooses a greater suffering than death – tearing out his eyes and going into exile so that he should clear the town of plague by his suffering. Being consumed with guilt the characters behave in an altruistic way. Hercules does not lay blame on his stepmother Juno, and Oedipus blames neither Apollo nor his parents. Seneca expects from us – readers and spectators – the moral progress so that having learned a lesson from his characters’ misfortunes we should apprehend our haughtiness, anger, a desire to rule others and the world. We can guess that the moralist – philosopher and poet Seneca expects that spectators, having experienced bitter feelings of fear, guilt and shame that hard to overcome, together with the characters, will feel the desire to become honest because it is the feeling of shame and guilt that is the driving force of the moral progress...|$|E
