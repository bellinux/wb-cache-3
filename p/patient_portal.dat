As part of the push to encourage implementation of electronic health records in hospitals and private practices, the US government has set [...] "meaningful use" [...] objectives and benchmarks.

50|$|Portal {{applications}} for individual practices typically exist {{in tandem with}} <b>patient</b> <b>portals,</b> allowing access to patient information and records, as well as schedules, payments, and messages from <b>patients.</b> Most <b>patient</b> <b>portals</b> require the practice to {{have some type of}} electronic medical record or patient management system, as the patient data needs to be stored in a data repository then retrieved by the patient portal.While lauding its ease-of-use, some physicians note {{that it is hard to}} encourage patients to utilize online portals to benefit both themselves and the medical practice staff.|$|R
2500|$|The terms {{electronic}} health records, {{personal health}} records, and patient portals {{are not always}} used correctly. [...] The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the ownership of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are {{the property of the}} provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient. [...] A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an electronic copy as well. In the UK, according to the governments's information strategy for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015. In 2012, only 1% did so. Electronic health records and electronic medical records contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care. [...] The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system. [...] The <b>patient</b> <b>portal</b> is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records. [...] In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, electronic case management, etc. [...] Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing. [...] This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, but the point is it now resides in a location of the patient's choosing. [...] Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.|$|E

Results: Although findings have not been uniformly positive, several studies {{of the effectiveness of}} health care system <b>patient</b> <b>portals</b> in chronic disease management have shown promising results with regard to patient outcomes. <b>Patient</b> web <b>portals</b> have also shown promising results in increasing adherence with screening recommendations.

50|$|Patient Portals are healthcare-related online {{applications}} that allow patients to interact {{and communicate with}} their healthcare providers, such as physicians and hospitals. Typically, portal services {{are available on the}} Internet {{at all hours of the}} day and night. Some <b>patient</b> <b>portal</b> applications exist as stand-alone web sites and sell their services to healthcare providers. Other portal applications are integrated into the existing web site of a healthcare provider. Still others are modules added onto an existing electronic medical record (EMR) system. What all of these services share is the ability of patients to interact with their medical information via the Internet. Currently, the lines between an EMR, a personal health record, and a <b>patient</b> <b>portal</b> are blurring. For example, Intuit Health and Microsoft HealthVault describe themselves as personal health records (PHRs), but they can interface with EMRs and communicate through the Continuity of Care Record standard, displaying patient data on the Internet so it can be viewed through a <b>patient</b> <b>portal.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{potential}} contribution of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enable patient-centric and coordinated care, {{and in particular}} to explore the role of <b>patient</b> <b>portals</b> as a developing ICT tool, to assess the available evidence, and to describe the evaluation challenges. Methods: Reviews of IMIA, EFMI, and other initiatives, together with literature reviews. Results: We present the progression from care coordination to care integration, and from patient-centric to person-centric approaches. We describe the different roles of ICT as an enabler of the effective presentation of information as and when needed. We focus on the patient's role as a co-producer of health {{as well as the}} focus and purpose of care. We discuss the need for changing organisational processes as well as the current mixed evidence regarding <b>patient</b> <b>portals</b> as a logical tool, and the reasons for this dichotomy, together with the evaluation principles supported by theoretical frameworks so as to yield robust evidence. Conclusions: There is expressed commitment to coordinated care and to putting the patient in the centre. However to achieve this, new interactive <b>patient</b> <b>portals</b> will be needed to enable peer communication by all stakeholders including patients and professionals. Few portals capable of this exist to date.
