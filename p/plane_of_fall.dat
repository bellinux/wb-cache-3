The integrated Dual Imaging Detector (IDID) consists of a polarizing beam splitter bonded to a charge-coupled device (CCD), with signal-analysis circuitry and analog-to-digital converters, all integrated on a silicon chip. The polarizing beam splitter can be either a Ronchi ruling, or an array of cylindrical lenslets, bonded to a birefringent wafer.

By using such a result and the latest spectroscopic optical data of the HDE 226868 supergiant star we get M = (24 ± 5) M ⊙ for its mass. It turns out that deviations from the third Kepler law significant at more than 1 -sigma level would occur if the inclination i of the system’s orbital plane to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the sky <b>falls</b> outside the range ≈ 41 ÷ 56 deg: such deviations cannot be due to the first post-Newtonian (1 PN) correction to the orbital period because of its smallness; interpreted in the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravitation as due to the stellar quadrupole mass moment Q, they are unphysical because Q would take unreasonably large values. By conservatively assuming that the third Kepler law is an adequate model for the orbital period we obtain i = (48 ± 7) deg which yields for the relative semimajor axis a = (42 ± 9) R ⊙ (≈ 0. 2 AU).
