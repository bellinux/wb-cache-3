5|$|Once the 2006–2007 {{television}} season ended, NBC {{planned to}} air reruns {{throughout the summer}} {{in the hopes of}} gaining new viewers during the summer hiatus. Despite rising ratings for the reruns, NBC abruptly <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> from the network's schedule on June 24, 2007. NBC resumed airing reruns in late August/early September, timed to the Season 1 DVD release.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{fragments of}} the building— the wash-basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt, {{as well as some}} parts of a column— were saved by Ivo Kraus. He <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> from the rubble shortly after the end of World War II. The wash-basin and the memorial tables are now in the Zagreb City Museum. The column fragments are kept by the Jewish Community of Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Woodriff's {{resistance}} had {{an important}} indirect effect on Allemand's cruise. In drawing the squadron southwards, Woodriff had <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> {{out of the line}} travelled by the Illustrious convoy. In the aftermath of the engagement, it took two days to repair the battered Calcutta and in that time the convoy had safely passed Allemand's former position without sighting the French force. With his object frustrated, Allemand completed the repairs to Calcutta and crewed her with men drawn {{from the rest of the}} squadron, adding the ship to his force. Aware that news of his presence would rapidly spread, Allemand subsequently turned southwards, sailing from the North Atlantic to the coast of North Africa to avoid pursuing British forces. There Allemand anchored for a time at the Spanish island of Tenerife, where he was able to repair and resupply his squadron before embarking on a lengthy cruise against the British convoys that regularly crossed the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Lex Luger {{challenged}} Yokozuna. Mr. Perfect {{was revealed}} to be the guest referee for the match, while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper. After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna, Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring. After getting back into the ring, Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from {{a corner of the}} ring. Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger. As he tried to throw Luger's head into the exposed turnbuckle, however, Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle. Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash. Yokozuna's managers, Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger, and Luger <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> into the ring and attacked them. Luger covered Yokozuna, but Mr. Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count. When Luger pushed him, Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring, thereby turning heel.|$|E

25|$|The second {{match was}} between Sting and Lex Luger. Sting gained the early advantage, and {{performed}} a diving crossbody. Sting attempted another diving crossbody, but Luger caught him, and performed an inverted atomic drop. Luger had the advantage, and they fought outside the ring. As both {{were on the}} apron, Luger <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> both over the top rope and into the ring. Luger fell on top of Sting, and pinned him while holding the rope, and having {{his foot on the}} rope.|$|E

25|$|During the Battle of Stalingrad, the Hungarian Second Army {{suffered}} terrible losses. The Soviet breakthrough at the Don River sliced {{directly through}} the Hungarian units. Shortly {{after the fall}} of Stalingrad in January 1943, the Hungarian 2nd Army was crushed by the Soviets at the Battle of Voronezh. Ignoring German orders to stand and fight to the death, the bewildered Hungarian troops, fighting without antitank weaponry or armored support, turned and fled. Harassed by partisan groups and Soviet air attacks, and having to endure the Russian winter weather, they tried in vain to retreat. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner by the Soviet army, and total casualties numbered more than 100,000 men. The Hungarian army ceased to exist as an effective fighting force, and the Germans <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> from the front.|$|E
25|$|Washington State, the region's fourth seed, {{was first}} to earn {{a spot in the}} Charlotte, North Carolina East Regional by handily beating fifth-seeded Notre Dame, 61-41 in Denver, Colorado. The rout came as a shock to many sportscasters, who {{expected}} Notre Dame's offense, which was averaging about 80 points a game, to outdo the Cougars. Instead, Notre Dame shot 24% from the field, their worst offensive effort since 1983 and the fifth-worst {{in the history of the}} NCAA tournament's opening rounds. Washington State's win brought them to their first-ever trip to the Sweet 16. Top-seeded North Carolina will challenge the Cougars after defeating Arkansas, the ninth seed, 108-77. The win marked only the third time the Tar Heels had won their first two tournament games by more than 20 points. The other two UNC teams to do this, in 1993 and 2005, went on to win the championship. With the win, North Carolina also set a school record for wins in a season, with 34. Second-seeded Tennessee survived an upset bid from number seven seed Butler, winning in overtime 76-71. Butler was behind throughout regulation, but managed to keep the game close and bring it to overtime, where they gained their first lead, 68-66, about 2 minutes into overtime. Some key defensive stands and free throws by the Volunteers, however, <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> ahead. They will play third seed Louisville, who beat sixth seed Oklahoma, 78-48. Sooner star Blake Griffin had trouble scoring against Louisville's double-teams, and Louisville's 30-point win was the school's best tournament win since 1968.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Matt and Jeff Hardy with Lita as the Special Guest Referee. In the beginning, {{the two had}} several {{reversals}} until Matt got in control. Jeff sidestepped when Matt attempted a diving leg drop. Jeff hit a falling headbutt and a clothesline. Jeff went on to deliver a diving leg drop of his own. Jeff went to the top rope but Matt trapped him in a Tree of Woe. Matt then applied the sunset flip, which Jeff countered and both men were lying outside the ring. In the ring, Jeff injured his left knee, which Matt would work on. He hit a chop block {{and a series of}} moves. He tried a powerbomb, but Jeff countered it into a Compactor Clutch. Matt assaulted Jeff again with a Half Boston Crab. Jeff got to the ropes, breaking the hold, and kicked Matt to the outside. Jeff went to the top, but, because of his hurt knee, he fell down. Matt grabbed Jeff's leg but Jeff hit a mule kick. Matt tried a Twist of Fate, but Jeff countered it into a leg drop. Jeff hit a suplex, and went to the top rope again but, because of his knee, Matt took advantage and clutched him. Matt tried to hit a Twist of Fate but Jeff reversed it into his own. Matt attempted a pinfall on Jeff and used ropes for leverage but Lita ordered him to break it. Jeff went to the top rope again, but Matt caught him, and tried to hit him a Twist of Fate from the top. Jeff forced Matt off and hit a Swanton Bomb. Matt tried to get his feet on the ropes, but Jeff <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> off, and won the match.|$|E

25|$|Botham's {{international}} début for England was on 26 August 1976 in a Limited Overs International (LOI) {{against the}} West Indies at the North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough. The series {{was called the}} Prudential Trophy and the teams had 55 overs each per innings. Botham, still only 20, was the youngest player. At Scarborough, England captain Alan Knott lost the toss and Clive Lloyd, captaining the West Indies, elected to field first. Botham was number seven in the batting order and came in at 136 for five to join Graham Barlow. He scored only one before he was caught by Roy Fredericks off the bowling of his future Sky Sports colleague Michael Holding. England's innings closed at 202 for eight with Barlow 80 not out. West Indies lost Fredericks almost immediately but that brought Viv Richards to the crease and he hit 119 not out, winning {{the man of the}} match award, and leading West Indies to victory in only 41 overs by six wickets. Botham had the consolation of taking his first international wicket when he had Lawrence Rowe caught by Mike Hendrick for 10. He bowled only three overs and took some punishment from Richards, his return being one for 26. In the second match at Lord's, Botham was replaced by returning England captain Tony Greig. England lost by 36 runs as Richards, this time with 97, was again the difference between the teams. Having lost the series, England recalled Botham for the final match at Edgbaston on 30–31 August. The match was extended to two days and overs reduced to 32 per side. Tony Greig won the toss and decided to field. England began well and dismissed Fredericks and Richards, for a duck, in only the second over. West Indies were then seven for one but a powerful innings by Clive Lloyd <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> out of trouble and they reached 223 for nine, innings closed. Botham bowled three very expensive overs, conceding 31 runs, but he did manage to bowl out Michael Holding for his second international wicket. England were never in the hunt and were bowled out for 173, West Indies winning by 50 runs and claiming the series 3–0. Botham again batted at number seven and made a good start, scoring 20 at a run a ball, but he was then caught by Bernard Julien off Fredericks and England were 151 for seven with only Knott and the tailenders left.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of Since I Left You in 2000, the Avalanches toured and {{continued}} to produce music.

The album was described in 2005 as [...] "ambient world music", and by early 2007, the band was considering over 40 tracks for an album which had become mostly hip hop-oriented. The record's production was stalled due to Chater being ill for three years, and the group had also become more involved in separate projects which <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> away from the album. Some of their most time-consuming work included the score to a musical, King Kong (2013), and an animated musical film described as a [...] "hip hop version of Yellow Submarine" [...] which lost funding and was never completed. Wildflower features many remnants from these projects and was compiled using these tracks in a similar fashion of making a mixtape.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, {{however, the}} Red Roses' performance {{fell short of}} the previous season when it placed second, with 63 wins and 47 losses. [...] According to Spalding's Baseball Guide (1911), the Lancaster organization {{was one of several}} teams in the league caught off guard by a surprisingly strong new club from Altoona, Pennsylvania, which was [...] "sent along at a clip that practically clinched the season". While the Red Roses pulled out of a mid-season slump, the [...] "Altoonas" [...] prevailed with a 7238 record. In an article regarding this outcome, Sporting Life stated that [...] "nothing can be found to cast discredit upon the Lancaster team or its popular manager, Marty Hogan". [...] The paper added, [...] "With a team that never stood high in club hitting or fielding, Marty <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> through and anchored them in second place, which position they attained more by dint of their cleverness in inside work than with their prowess with the stick or in the field". [...] In December 1910, {{a little more than two}} months after the article appeared, Hogan reportedly set down roots in Lancaster, opening a cigar shop and billiard hall in the city. [...] His relationship with the Red Roses would not last more than another season, however. [...] In 1911, Hogan's final year as manager of the Lancaster team, the club placed fourth in the eight-team league, with 54 wins and losses, respectively.|$|E
