60|$|He had two Spaniards {{who could}} be trusted to keep the steamer more or less on the course he gave them, while the Cumbria steerd handily, {{which is more than}} all steamers do. There was a {{large-scale}} chart, considerably mildewed, but still legible, in the skipper's room, as well as a pilot guide to the West African coast, while the <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> that towed astern to record the distance run appeared to be working accurately. He could thus, it was evident, depend in some degree upon what is termed dead reckoning, which is comparatively reliable in the case of short distances run in the vicinity of a high, well lighted coast. The one the Cumbria steamed along was, however, not lighted at all, and most of it scarcely rose a foot above sea-level, while when he had ruled the line she was presumed to be travelling on across the chart, and pricked off the distance the <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> told him she had run, there remained the question how far the tide and the Guinea stream had deflected it, and whether the steering and her compasses could be trusted.|$|E

Since the second half of the twentieth century, sailors continue to use more modern mechanical and electro-mechanical versions based upon a small impeller or paddle wheel attached to (or through) the bottom of the hull, especially on smaller yachts.|$|R
60|$|When {{the light}} came it was blowing very hard indeed, {{and the sky}} was utterly overcast, so that we got no glimpse of the sun, or of the stars on the {{following}} night. Unfortunately, there was no moon visible; indeed, if there had been I do not suppose that it would have helped us because of the thick pall of clouds. For quite seventy-two hours we ran on beneath bare poles before that gale. The little vessel behaved splendidly, riding the seas like a duck, but I could see that Captain Astley was growing alarmed. When I said something complimentary to him about the conduct of the Star of the South, he replied that she was forging ahead all right, but the question was--where to? He had been unable to take an observation of any sort since we left Samoa; both his <b>patent</b> <b>logs</b> had been carried away, so that now only the compass remained, and he had not the slightest idea where we were in that great ocean studded with atolls and islands.|$|R

60|$|They {{passed through}} the small main-cabin, climbed a steep {{companion}} ladder, and emerged on deck. The sun was setting, and the promise was for a clear tropic night. The Samoset, with fore- and main-sail winged out on either side, was slipping a lazy four-knots through the smooth sea. Through the engine-room skylight came a sound of hammering. They strolled aft to where Captain Dettmar, {{one foot on the}} rail, was oiling the gear of the <b>patent</b> <b>log.</b> At the wheel stood a tall South Sea Islander, clad in white undershirt and scarlet hip-cloth.|$|E

[...] "It's a straight run to the Isleta, Grand Canary. Whether you'll ever get there with the compass and the <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> is another matter, though, of course, {{if you go on}} long enough, you'll fetch some part of America. I don't want to be unduly inquisitive, but you will have lost, at least, an hour of our time before I put Pills on board again, and I really think there is a little you should tell me." ...|$|E

30|$|Once it {{was noted}} that just two {{doctoral}} student used the results and findings of his/her thesis to apply for a patent - and being their only two records as co-inventor in patent documents – the study moved through to the next stage of analysis. The following step was to determine if other students had patent applications on other topics unrelated to their theses. It was found that none of 35 students remaining held any other patent according to Thompson Innovation data bank. This data shows that the protection of findings via patents does not tend to be a common occurrence among post-graduate students. Based on this information, we moved to the next stage: to examine if the lack of patents among students was a trait of the post-graduate environment. In order to do this, we conducted a profile check on the students’ supervisors, with respect to patent ownership. The results showed that of the 17 supervisors whose students finished their doctorate in 2010 to 2012, only 8 were reported as inventors in patent documents (Figure  2). In assessing the number of patents that university professors had, it was found that only one supervisor (S. 1) stood out for having made 10 patent applications. This indicates that this particular supervisor has a consistent interest in protecting his discoveries at university by patents; representing 43.5 % {{of the total number of}} patents in which supervising professors appear as inventors (Figure  2). Furthermore, another two supervisors (S. 3 and S. 4) registered patents which they co-authored with S. 1, also S. 5 and S. 6 share the same patent registry, both being the only one record of patent ownership by the supervisors. It was noted that only three supervisors have continued studies regarding patents that they have applied for. All <b>patents</b> <b>logged</b> by supervisor 1 deal with the core themes of his/her students’ theses, arising from the discovery of a DNA vaccine for tuberculosis. This shows the researcher is interested in producing or continuing to produce new products and applications that enhance their discoveries.|$|R
60|$|The chief {{engineer}} looked around. The deck was empty {{as far as}} the taffrail. All the native passengers had left in Batu Beru this time, and no others had joined. The dial of the <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> tinkled periodically in the dark {{at the end of the}} ship. It was a dead calm, and, under the clouded sky, through the still air that seemed to cling warm, with a seaweed smell, to her slim hull, on a sea of somber gray and unwrinkled, the ship moved on an even keel, as if floating detached in empty space. But Mr. Massy slapped his forehead, tottered a little, caught hold of a belaying-pin at the foot of the mast.|$|E
60|$|But of Leach’s behaviour—By {{the time}} I had {{finished}} cleansing the cabin {{he had taken}} care of Johnson. I had come up on deck for {{a breath of fresh}} air and to try to get some repose for my overwrought nerves. Wolf Larsen was smoking a cigar and examining the <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> which the Ghost usually towed astern, but which had been hauled in for some purpose. Suddenly Leach’s voice came to my ears. It was tense and hoarse with an overmastering rage. I turned and saw him standing just beneath the break of the poop on the port side of the galley. His face was convulsed and white, his eyes were flashing, his clenched fists raised overhead.|$|E
60|$|One {{does not}} mind the trades. We have held the {{north-east}} trade for days now, and the miles roll off behind {{us as the}} <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> whirls and tinkles on the taffrail. Yesterday, log and observation approximated a run of two hundred and fifty-two miles; the day before we ran two hundred and forty, and the day before that two hundred and sixty-one. But one does not appreciate {{the force of the}} wind. So balmy and exhilarating is it that it is so much atmospheric wine. I delight to open my lungs and my pores to it. Nor does it chill. At any hour of the night, while the cabin lies asleep, I break off from my reading and go up on the poop in the thinnest of tropical pyjamas.|$|E
5000|$|When Kyle Maclachlan guest hosted Saturday Night Live in 1990 at {{the height}} of Twin Peaks popularity, the episode {{contained}} many references to the series throughout. Also featured was a sketch parodying the show and in particular Dale Cooper. Cooper is portrayed in the sketch as being extremely attentive to detail in his messages to Diane, including informing her of how many hairs he found in his shower the night before. Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Kevin Nealon) then visits Cooper, telling him that Leo Johnson (Chris Farley) has confessed to the murder of Laura Palmer and that he can go home. Cooper raises concerns that the investigations may not be over because he had a dream last night in which [...] "A hairless mouse with a pitchfork sang a song about caves." [...] He discards Leo's confession in spite of the overwhelming evidence against him. He is then visited by several Twin Peaks residents all played by SNL cast members: Audrey Horne, played by Victoria Jackson, who gives Cooper a going away gift and ties the ribbon with her tongue; Leland Palmer, played by Phil Hartman, who requests that Cooper dance with him; Nadine Hurley (Jan Hooks), who wants Cooper to take her silent drape runners to the <b>patent</b> office; The <b>Log</b> Lady, also played by Hooks, following Truman's observation that there were only two female SNL cast members; and finally Leo in custody of Deputy Andy Brennan (Conan O'Brien). Cooper protests that the case can't be over so soon and insists in vain that he and Truman perform several pointless tasks in order to aid him in the already solved investigation, including going to a graveyard at midnight disguised as altar boys. As everyone begins to leave, Cooper declares that they can't leave because they still don't know who shot him at the end of Season One. Leo, however, confesses to shooting Cooper, adding that Cooper himself saw him do it. Cooper reluctantly goes to sleep as The Man from Another Place (Mike Myers) begins to dance at the foot of his bed.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pike {{put one of}} the sail-makers at the wheel, and the steward, {{relieved}} and starting below, was attracted to the port quarter, where the <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> that towed astern was made fast. Margaret had returned his knife to him, and he was carrying {{it in his hand}} when his attention was attracted astern to our wake. Mike Cipriani and Bill Quigley had managed to catch the lazily moving log-line and were clinging to it. The Elsinore was moving just fast enough to keep them on the surface instead of dragging them under. Above them and about them circled curious and hungry albatrosses, Cape hens, and mollyhawks. Even as I glimpsed the situation one of the big birds, a ten-footer at least, with a ten-inch beak to the fore, dropped down on the Italian. Releasing his hold with one hand, he struck with his knife at the bird. Feathers flew, and the albatross, deflected by the blow, fell clumsily into the water.|$|E
60|$|A draught of air, fanned from {{forward by}} {{the speed of the}} ship, passed {{steadily}} through the long gloom between the high bulwarks, swept over the rows of prone bodies; a few dim flames in globe-lamps were hung short here and there under the ridge-poles, and in the blurred circles of light thrown down and trembling slightly to the unceasing vibration of the ship appeared a chin upturned, two closed eyelids, a dark hand with silver rings, a meagre limb draped in a torn covering, a head bent back, a naked foot, a throat bared and stretched as if offering itself to the knife. The well-to-do had made for their families shelters with heavy boxes and dusty mats; the poor reposed side by side with all they had on earth tied up in a rag under their heads; the lone old men slept, with drawn-up legs, upon their prayer-carpets, with their hands over their ears and one elbow {{on each side of the}} face; a father, his shoulders up and his knees under his forehead, dozed dejectedly by a boy who slept on his back with tousled hair and one arm commandingly extended; a woman covered from head to foot, like a corpse, with a piece of white sheeting, had a naked child in the hollow of each arm; the Arab's belongings, piled right aft, made a heavy mound of broken outlines, with a cargo-lamp swung above, and a great confusion of vague forms behind: gleams of paunchy brass pots, the foot-rest of a deck-chair, blades of spears, the straight scabbard of an old sword leaning against a heap of pillows, the spout of a tin coffee-pot. The <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> on the taffrail periodically rang a single tinkling stroke for every mile traversed on an errand of faith. Above the mass of sleepers a faint and patient sigh at times floated, the exhalation of a troubled dream; and short metallic clangs bursting out suddenly in the depths of the ship, the harsh scrape of a shovel, the violent slam of a furnace-door, exploded brutally, as if the men handling the mysterious things below had their breasts full of fierce anger: while the slim high hull of the steamer went on evenly ahead, without a sway of her bare masts, cleaving continuously the great calm of the waters under the inaccessible serenity of the sky.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the seventeenth day I came on deck, to find the {{schooner}} under double reefs, and flying rather wild before a heavy run of sea. Snoring trades and humming sails had been our portion hitherto. We were already nearing the island. My restrained excitement had begun again to overmaster me; and for some time my only book had been the <b>patent</b> <b>log</b> that trailed over the taffrail, and my chief interest the daily observation and our caterpillar progress across the chart. My first glance, which was at the compass, and my second, which was at the log, were all that I could wish. We lay our course; we had been doing over eight since nine the night before, and I drew a heavy breath of satisfaction. And then I know not what odd and wintry appearance of the sea and sky knocked suddenly at my heart. I observed the schooner to look more than usually small, the men silent and studious of the weather. Nares, in one of his rusty humours, afforded me no shadow of a morning salutation. He, too, seemed to observe the behaviour of the ship with an intent and anxious scrutiny. What I liked still less, Johnson himself was at the wheel, which he span busily, often with a visible effort; and as the seas ranged up behind us, black and imminent, he kept casting behind him eyes of animal swiftness, and drawing in his neck between his shoulders, like a man dodging a blow. From these signs I gathered that all was not exactly for the best; and I would have given a good handful of dollars for a plain answer to the questions which I dared not put. Had I dared, with the present danger-signal in the captain's face, I should only have been reminded of my position as supercargo--an office never touched upon in kindness--and advised, in a very indigestible manner, to go below. There was nothing for it, therefore, but to entertain my vague apprehensions as best I should be able, until it pleased the captain to enlighten me of his own accord. This he did sooner than I had expected--as soon, indeed, as the Chinaman had summoned us to breakfast, and we sat face to face across the narrow board.|$|E

40|$|The fishery {{investigations}} in northern polar waters {{carried out by}} the Norwegian Fishery Administration have since 1933 been concentrated solely on the deep sea banks off the west coast of Spitsbergen in order to develop and support the commercial fishery which has come into existence here. The fishery investigations carried out annually since 1923 were during a series of years mainly centered upon the waters around Bear Island, with the intention of opening these waters for the commercial fishery, which also succeeded. But the Norwegian fishery interests stretch over the vast area of the Barents Sea - Jan Mayen - Southeast Greenland, and several cruises have been untertaken also in these waters {{in order to get a}} survey of the fishery conditions. On all these cruises fishing vessels or sealing vessels leased for the purpose have been employed, the majority of them being of about 50 gross tons, but also larger vessels have been used. On all the cruises the essential work has of course been to carry out practical fishing experiments, to collect biological and oceanographical material and to obtain information on depth and bottom conditions. Besides these primary tasks we have collected botanical and geological material in localities incidentally visited, and from which little or no material of this kind previously had been collected, as for instance Southeast Greenland, Jan Mayen and many places in the Svalbard area. My coworker on nearly all these cruises, mag. sci. EINAR KOEFOED, has through his wide knowledge and interest added to the value of the material collected. We have also had the opportunity to visit the lonely, arctic Hope Island which lies in the Barents Sea about 115 miles due east of the southern point of Spitsbergen. After my visit to the southern part of Hope Island in 1924 the results were published in the Skrifter om Svalbard og Ishavet, Vol. I, no. 10, Oslo 1926. During our later fishery {{investigations in}} these waters in 1929 and 1930 I had the opportunity to visit also the northern part of the island. During these latter landings I have taken a number of photographs and measured some heights on the island. According to these measurements it has been possible to draw the equidistances more correctly than on my sketch map of 1924. The localities which have been paid most attention in 1929 and 1930 are Hermansenskardet (Hermansen Gap) with Småhumpen (Small Hummock), ancl Bråstadskardet (Bråstad Gap) with Lyngefjellet (Lynge Hill). Some measurements of the sun's altitude were also taken. The distance between the south and north points, and the distances between the different mountains and gaps were determined by sailing to and from along the coast and using the <b>patent</b> <b>log.</b> On the basis of the observations taken in 1924 and in 1929 - 1930 I have made a new sketch map of Hope Island (fig. 36). On this new sketch map the south point has been shifted 4 miles to the south and 1 mile to the west. Hope Island is 18 miles long, i. e. 2 miles shorter than on the previous sketch map, and the angle formed by the longitudinal direction of the island with the meridian is somewhat larger. The measurements of the sun's altitude taken at one and the same spot on various occasions show differences on account of bad horizon, and I have therefore been compelled to use the mean values. On account of the varying tide currcnts I have also had to use the mean of the distances sailed along the coast from the south to the north points. These investigations on Hope Island have been carried out when the opportunity arose, and they must be considered only as a small contribution to the discription of the island. An accurate survey of Hope Island is still lacking. In accounts dealing with the whaling period in Spitsbergen waters walrus is mentioned at Hope Island. Walrus is not found at the island nowadays, although single specimens may be encountered here as well as in many other localities in the Svalbard area, and even at the Norwegian coast. The great quantities of skeletal fragments of walrus found at Koefoed Point might be remains from walrus slaughtered in the whaling period. However, by a closer study of these remains I am mostly inclined to believe that a catastrophe has occurred here once or repated times. The skeletal fragments are found partly scattered on the soil surface, but a great part of them are overgrown by vegetation. The size of the craniums shows that they belong to walrus of all age-groups, even new-borns. In many craniums the tusks are fixed in their proper place. As a whole I got the impression that these skeletal fragments were not remains of slaughtered animals. If, however, a natural catastrophe has occurred it might be explained thus: Near the south point of Hope Island the Koefoed point juts out eastwards as a low, grass-clad spit of land with a flat beach. Steep mountain sides mark the bounds on all other sides of this point. A large herd of walrus has been assembled on Koefoed Point during a strong and protracted gale blowing on the shore. This gale has pushed the drift-ice ashore, piling it up into such a high ice-wall that it has been impossible for the Walrus to escape into the sea. The herd has become enclosed for so long time that all the animals ultimately have died from hunger. Hope Island is assumed to be discovered by the Dutchman RIJP who called the island "Visch Eylandt" because he should have found much fish at the southern part of the island. Possibly RIJP by "Visch" meant whales. This mode of expression was at that time common among the whalers, and is even used today by the Norwegian whalers. RIJP was, however, on a voyage of discovery and he was perhaps no whaler, so it is possible that he by "Visch" really meant fish, i. e. cod or haddock or possibly capelan. When we have visited Hope Island we have never seen any indication of fish near the shore, but it is possible that under certain conditions shoals of capelan can be washed ashore, or that cod and haddock can be present in very shallow water near the island. In the 1870 -ies great shoals of cod were found near the beach in the fjords of Spitsbergen and Bear Island, and something similar may have occurred at that time at Hope Island. On August 26. 1923, while steering southwards from Frans Josef land with the M/C "Blåfjell", we encountered on the bank due east of Hope Island a great number of whales gorging in Euphausiidæ and capelan. With a small seine we succeeclecl in catching some hundred liters of capelan. Using the capelan as bait we caught a quantity of cod on long-lines in the same locality. This experiment was repeated a few days later on the edge of the bank southeast of Hope Island, and here very large catches of cod were made. However, these catches were made rather far from the island and in comparatively deep water, namely about 100 fathoms. Also on some occasions after 1923 our fishing experiments on the bank southeast of Hope Island have shown that fish could be found here, and in the last years this fishing region has also been visited by ordinary fishing vessels. When the fishermen get better aquainted with the conditions on Hope Island they may occasionally and under certain weather conditions possibly find it advantageous to seek anchorage to the lee of the island while fishing in this region. It is possible that in the future a meteorological station will be needed on Hope Island, and for this purpose the island seems well suited. In this case Hope Island will be utilised in the same way as the small and lonely Bear Island and Jan Mayen. If there cannot be found very valuable minerals on Hope Island it can hardly be exploited in any other way than for winter hunting or for purposes indicated above. The population of white and blue foxes will perhaps not stand reduction every year, perhaps only every second or third year. It is possible that an interchange occasionally takes place through migration of foxes across the ice from Edge Island or conversely. As for the polar bear the case is somewhat different, as it does not inhabit the island all the year round. The polar bear visits the island together with the drift-ice. It is only a few single individuals, perhaps some quite inexperienced young bears, which let the ice drift away from the island without jumping on to it in time. They stay on the island, often vegetating for long periods in summer, till the drift-ice again touches the shore...|$|E
