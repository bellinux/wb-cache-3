40|$|Physical {{habitat is}} {{important}} in determining the carrying capacity of juvenile brown trout, and within freshwater management. Summer daytime physical habitat selection for the parr lifestage (7 – 20 cm) juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) was assessed in 6 <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> streams. Habitat preference was determined for the four variables; water velocity, water depth, substrate and cover, and the preferences for physical habitat selection were {{expressed in terms of}} habitat suitability indices (HSI’s). The statistical confidence of HSI’s was evaluated using power analysis. It was found that a minimum of 22 fish observations was needed to have statistical confidence in the HSIs for water depth, and a minimum of 92 fish observations for water velocity during daytime summer conditions. Generally parr were utilising the deeper habitats, indicating preference for deeper water. Cover was also being selected for at all sites, but selection was inconsistent among sites for the variables substrate and velocity. The results indicate that during daytime summer conditions water depth is a significant variable for parr habitat selection in these <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> streams, with cover also being important. Therefore, daytime refugia may be a critical limiting factor for parr in <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> streams, and important for stream management actions under the Water Framework Directive...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficiency}} of propagating juvenile trout, Salmo trutta L. in <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> streams and to evaluate the impact of the environmental conditions in the streams on the juvenile fish. Brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) and sea trout (Salmo trutta trutta) early fry fed under controlled conditions were used to stock third-order lowland streams. During summer, fall, and spring catches, fry were counted, measured, and weighed. The following parameters were calculated using the data collected: fry stocking density (ind. m- 2); survival; specific mortality rate (SMR); length range; mean specimen length; body weight; mean body weight; specific growth rate (SGR); body condition (Fulton’s index). The ichthyological studies were accompanied by simultaneous analyses of environmental conditions that were performed monthly, and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in spring and fall. No differences were observed in the biological parameters analyzed between sea trout and brown trout. Variability in environmental parameters such as temperature, oxygenation, conductivity, and stream width and depth were associated with differentiation in the biological parameters of the fry. The results clearly indicate that the considerable potential of <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> streams for the propagation of salmonid juvenile stages is currently underexploited...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFish {{assemblage}} {{data from}} 69 brooks and small streams were analysed to derive a fish-based typology of <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> streams in the “Central Plains” ecoregion of northeastern Germany. Altogether 32 native, 1 non-native fish species and 2 lamprey species were {{detected in the}} lowland rivers studied. Species number and diversity varied significantly according to mean summer water temperatures {{and size of the}} watercourses. Summer-cold brooks contained on average 3 – 5 species, brooks with higher summer temperatures 5 – 8 species and <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> rivers around 10 – 14 species. <b>Small</b> <b>lowland</b> brooks contained a significantly higher number of fish species when they flowed into or out of lakes: typically around 8 – 12. In the northeastern German lowlands the following three different river types were distinguished according to their fish assemblages: (1) The “lowland trout brook”, where brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) are reference species and accompanied by stone loach (Barbatula barbatula (L.)), brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri (Bloch)), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), ten-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius (L.)) and gudgeon (Gobio gobio (L.)); (2) The “perch- and roach-dominated lowland brook”, where perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) are reference species, accompanied by pike (Esox lucius L.), three-spined stickleback and gudgeon; and (3) The “lowland lake connected brook” inhabited by higher numbers of fish species, with higher proportions of cyprinid fishes, and higher proportions of limnophilic fish. Apart from perch and roach, bleak (Alburnus alburnus (L.)), common bream (Abramis brama (L.)), silver bream (Blicca bjoerkna (L.)) and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus (L.)) also occurred frequently. Further two observed fish-based types were not considered: The potential stone loach-dominated brook was not sufficiently represented in this study to be verified, and the stickleback brook was considered to represent degradation of lowland trout brooks. The correspondence between the fish-based typology and the morphology-based German stream typology was rather weak and requires further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystem {{deterioration}} in <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> agricultural rivers {{that results from}} river dredging entails a significant threat to the appropriate ecohydrological conditions of these water bodies, expressed as homogenization of habitats and loss of biodiversity. Our study was aimed at a comparison of abundance and taxonomic structure of bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates in dredged and non-dredged stretches of <b>small</b> <b>lowland</b> rivers and tributaries of the middle Narew River, namely: Czaplinianka, Turośnianka, Dąb, and Ślina. The experimental setup was (1) to collect samples of the bottom material from the river stretches that either persisted in a non-modified state (dredging was not done there {{in the last few}} years) or had been subjected to river dredging in the year of sampling; and (2) to analyze the abundance and taxonomic structure of macroinvertebrates in the collected samples. The study revealed that at the high level of statistical significance (from p = 0. 025 to p = 0. 001), the total abundance of riverbed macroinvertebrates in the dredged stretches of the rivers analyzed was approximately 70 % lower than in non-dredged areas.
