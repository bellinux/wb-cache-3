40|$|This paper {{applies the}} ideas of Brennan and Buchanan (1977, 1978, 1980) to local <b>property</b> <b>taxes.</b> When local governments {{maximize}} their revenues, <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> provide incentives for adequate amenity provision. Local amenity provision determines property values which then determine local tax revenues. As long as the demand for housing is inelastic, property-taxes will provide stronger incentives for local governments than lump-sum <b>taxes.</b> As current <b>property</b> values reflect expectations about future amenity levels, <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> create incentives {{for even the most}} myopic government to invest for the future. Local <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> can also act to limit the incentives of localities to tax; there are cases where higher levels of local <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> lead to lower overall tax burdens. These ideas are applied to the tax reform in the late 1970 s; one reason that tax reform may have been so successful is that in a period where land prices are driven by many forces other than government amenities, <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> lose their value as incentive devices. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E
