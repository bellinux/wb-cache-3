40|$|The European Union {{has been}} {{applying}} a top-down and centralized approach to management of fish stocks to try {{dealing with the}} complexity of the marine environment. Since the establishment of the Common Fisheries Policy in 1983 the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> has maintained the main resource “conservation” component of the policy, despite all its criticism for being the major driving factor for discards in for example the North Sea fisheries. In addition a focus has been placed on landings rather than catches, simplifying the problem of incidental catches to remove liability of the fishermen. A ban on discards and an obligation to land all commercial catches are now to be implemented. The obligation has received much attention from the public, governing agencies of member states and fishers themselves. The success of the change depend both on new regulations and if the EU gets fishers on the same page through normative and cognitive change among the fishers. This way it is possible to create governmentality which will favor governability of a landing obligation as fishers will self-govern themselves and others to avoid wasting marine resources. The ecological complexity combined with the complex regulative framework consisting of a path dependent <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> makes it difficult to change the system...|$|E
40|$|Distribution of {{fisheries}} resources {{is based on}} the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability,</b> from which the total allowable catches (TACs) are divided into national quotas based each year on a fixed percentage per stock. This does not fit well with the interaction of economic dynamics of fishing fleets and the Community's legal framework (right of establishment, free movement of workers). This has led to the so-called "quota-hopping". The Member State can nevertheless require a ship under its flag to have a "real economic link". But this is too vague to afford fisheries-dependent regions an efficient tool to meet their demands. Quotas Relative stability Real economic link Fisheries-dependent regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} {{managing}} fisheries under the CFP using TACs and quotas {{has not been}} sufficiently effective, {{and is no longer}} adequate. Direct control of fishing effort has always been a possible alternative, but has not been implemented except in special cases because of the difficulties of measuring and comparing the fishing effort of different vessels and fishing gears, and ensuring fair sharing of the resources available. I suggest that both of these problems can be overcome by adopting a scheme based on uniform pro rata adjustments to individual vessel entitlements to fishing effort, based on track records, and thus also maintaining the important <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability.</b> Such a scheme is well adapted to a system of regional management of the fisheries, could be effectively enforced using satellite monitoring, and should be seriously considered as an alternative to TACs and quotas in the CFP after 2002...|$|E
40|$|Several {{physical}} models {{have recently been}} proposed to obtain unidirectional motion of an overdamped Brownian particle in a periodic potential system. The asymmetric ratchetlike form of the periodic potential {{and the presence of}} correlated nonequilibrium fluctuating forces are considered essential to obtain such a macroscopic motion in homogeneous systems. In the present work, instead, inhomogeneous systems are considered, wherein the friction coefficient and/or temperature could vary in space. We show that unidirectional motion can be obtained even in a symmetric nonratchetlike periodic potential system in the presence of white noise fluctuations. We consider four different cases of system inhomogeneity We argue that all these different models work under the same basic <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> alteration <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> otherwise locally stable states in the presence of temperature inhomogeneity...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of obtaining unidirectional current in a symmetric (periodic) potential system without the application of any obvious (apparent) externally applied bias. There are many physical models proposed to accomplish this nonequilibrium effect. In the present work we consider inhomogeneous systems so that the friction coefficient and/or temperature could vary in space. We find out a model with minimal conditions that the inhomogeneous system assisted by fluctuating forces must satisfy, {{in order to obtain}} unidirectional current. In the process we discuss about thermal and frictional ratchets that are of current interest. We argue that different models of frictional ratchets work under the same basic <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> alteration <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> otherwise locally stable states in the presence of temperature inhomogeneity. We also discuss in detail the nature of currents in rocked frictional ratchets. In particular we analyse a novel phenomenon of multiple current reversals and the efficiency of the energy transduction in these systems. Comment: 40 pages, 9 figures, two sty file include...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{elements}} of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> ‘relative stability’. <b>Relative</b> <b>stability</b> means that yearly established Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for each fish stock are divided between the Member States of the European Union (EU) according to a fixed allocation key. One way to circumvent the <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> is the (increasing) practice of swapping quota with other Member States. These swaps have a temporary character, but continuously repeated yearly swaps occur. In recent decades many Member States have shifted resource management responsibilities more towards the industry {{and the process of}} quota swapping is in several Member States managed by Producers Organisations (POs) rather than by government administrations. Networks of fishermen and POs try to establish solid relationships and try to put at the same time stability and flexibility into the system. Information and networks {{play an important role in}} the process of quota swapping. However, not all POs and fishermen tend to have (equal) access to the required information for quota swapping which raises questions on how transparent this process is. With the upcoming implementation of the landing obligation, the quota swaps between Member States are expected to increase further. This paper describes the extent and the practice of quota swapping, the implications for one <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> good governance, transparency, as well as the effects of swapping for the <b>relative</b> <b>stability...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} political economy of the Common Fisheries Policy and investigates how traditional concepts can hinder the success of the European fisheries management. The first paper focuses on the institutional set-up of the decision-making process. This process is modeled as a dynamic non-cooperative game in discrete time. It is shown that due to the uncertainty in the annual TAC setting the optimal feedback strategy for the impatient decision-makers is to set inefficiently high TACs in Markov-perfect Nash equilibrium. According to this theoretical analysis, the institutional set-up of the decision-making process itself promotes inefficient TACs. A binding commitment between the two groups of decision-makers to a long-term management plan could lead to a more sustainable fisheries management. The second paper is concerned with an empirical analysis of the distribution of bargaining power between different interests groups in the TAC decision-making of the European Union. The process is modeled as a cooperative game between two players with different interests regarding TACs. The estimation results show that the player representing interests of the fishing industry has the stronger bargaining position compared to the player representing conservation interests. The analysis also shows that scientific recommendations have a greater influence in the bargaining when the underlying data is of good quality. The conclusion is that effective TAC management requires both, a sound scientific assessment and a stronger inclusion of scientific advice. The third paper investigates the regional trade-offs of different management options of a multi-species management in the Baltic Sea. An ecological-economic model of the Baltic Sea is developed simulating the stock dynamics of interacting population in order to investigate a set of different strategic management options. The profits for each country participating in the Baltic fishery differ between the management options. We show that the inflexibility of TAC distribution according to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> can lead to regional inequality in future profits. A reallocation of profits is required to achieve a concordant agreement on strategic multi-species management goals. The fourth paper examines the efficiency of different segments of the Baltic trawler fleet in order to evaluate whether quota trade between vessels of different countries could improve the situation. The distance function approach is used to derive an equation to estimate the efficiencies of different fleet segments. Data for different vessel length categories for different countries is used. The estimation reveals significant asymmetries in the efficiencies between countries. Allowing for quota trade in the Baltic fleet could improve the overall efficiency. Such a transnational quota trading system would enable the fleet to coordinate its fishing activities far more flexible than under the fixed allocation of TACs according to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fishing {{limitations}} to protect fish stocks can develop to {{different types of}} property rights. A move towards full private rights is promoted by some authors. The article questions whether such a move is desirable and it also investigates whether private rights are indeed becoming more important in EU fisheries. A study on property rights in the Danish, Dutch and UK fishery (WP Davidse, ed., Property Rights in Fishing, LEI-DLO, The Hague, 1997, OV 159) sector forms the background of this approach. Bromley's definition of property rights (D W Bromley, Environment and Economy: Property Rights & Public Policy, Blackwell, Oxford, 1991), including 'a right to a benefit stream', {{has been used to}} identify rights in these three EU fishing sectors. These property rights regimes vary from a domination of state property, the Danish one, to a complete system of individual rights, the Dutch case. The UK position is between these extremes, showing characteristics of common property, apart from kinds of state- and individual property of fishing rights. The article ends with a consideration of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2002 from the viewpoint of property rights. Negotiations in the run up to 2002 will demonstrate conflicts between views on state property and on private property rights. This regards the tension between the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> of quota allocations and the EU principle of free movement of capital, goods and services. Finally, two possibilities are suggested to combine both these principles. Property rights Fishing policy ITQs...|$|E
40|$|The {{state and}} {{co-operation}} {{are of a}} very complex character and relations between them based on different principles occur in various spheres. In each sphere, however, of relations {{between the state and}} co-operation movement in socialism some persistent or relatively persistent principles of action (rules of play) should be operative. The aim of the article is development and determination of some of these principles. As the most important principles of action in relations between the socialist state as. a political institution and co-operation as a definite social movement and a form of economy following ones can be called: acceptance of relative stability of co-operative movement in socialism, assertion of free and open character of co-operative organizations, protection of democracy in management and controlling activities of co-operative units and in share of obtained profits. A <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> of co-perative forms in socialism, which is discussed deeply in the article, means that co-operation can exist and be developed in a given country in a relatively long period of time. Such principles as: incorporation of different elements of co-operation and particular co-operatives into the planned economy system, guaranty of similar conditions of functioning and development of co-operative and state economies when differences between them taken into account, etc., are also of great importance in relations between the state, i. e. a disposal centre in the planned economy system, and. particular elements of co-operation. Equality, economic character of connections and consideration of differences in the scale of economic enterprises belong to the most important principles in relations between the state and co-operative economies and between the state and co-operative units. Basing on the analysis of these principles the author occupies himself with a problem of competition between state and co-operative enterprises in socialism. He points out the necessity of a more differentiated approach in this sphere. It is indicated in the article that approval of some principles in relations between the state and co-operation in socialism is faced with some difficulties, especially in practice. It makes it difficult for co-operation to develop as well as social and economic effectiveness of co-operative forms to increase in socialism.
