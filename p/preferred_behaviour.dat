40|$|Stream: How are {{relations}} of power manifest in ICT? Control in organisations is achieved in many ways, ranging from direct surveillance to feedback systems, {{to social and}} cultural controls (Simons, 1995). Control {{can be interpreted as}} both monitoring activities, and then taking action to ensure a <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a system being controlled (Aken, 1978; Otley and Berry, 1980). The concept that monitoring and control can be used to promote a <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a system is particularly relevant to information and communication systems (ICT). An email system is one such ICT, that is becoming increasingly subject to monitoring and control in organisations. As email systems evolve to become integral to organisational communication, users increasingly apply these systems for external and new communication and for group activities, increasing their strategic importance (Van den Hooff, 1997). Used proactively, email systems have continuing potential, but these benefits won’t accrue automatically (Ruggeri, et al., 2000). Many organisational research studies have highlighted numerous incidents of email systems abuse and viruses. In fact, Van den Hooff (1997) reports that over time, email systems users report significantly more negative effects. In particular, emai...|$|E

40|$|Gait {{patterns}} {{have been}} widely studied in different fields of science for their particular characteristics. A dynamic approach of human locomotion considers walking and running as two stable behaviours adopted spontaneously under certain levels and natures of constraints. When no constraints are imposed, people naturally prefer to walk at the typical speed (i. e., around 4. 5 km. h- 1) that minimises metabolic energy cost. The preferred walking speed (PWS) is also known to be an indicator of mobility and an important clinical factor in tracking impairements in motor behaviours. When constrained to move at higher speeds (e. g., being late), people naturally switch their preference to running for similar optimisation reasons (e. g., physiological, biomechanical, perceptual, attentionnal costs). Indeed, the preferred transition speed (PTS) marks the natural seperation between walking and running and consistently falls within a speed range around 7. 5 km. h- 1. This chapter describes the constraint-dependant spontaneous organisation of the locomotor system, specifically on the walk-to-run speed continuum. We provide examples {{of the possibility of}} long-term adaptations of <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviours</b> to specific constraints such as factors related to traditional clothing or practice.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the relationship between personality type and leadership focus. Personality type is studied {{from the perspective of}} Jungian Theory and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator instrument, and leadership focus is explored through the development and application of a Leadership Focus Questionnaire. South African executives form the target population for this research. The overall research problem concerns how best to address the challenges of optimising focus and managing risk that is inherent in strategic leadership. Both functionalist and interpretive approaches were applied to produce a rounded understanding of what constitutes leadership focus. The application of a functionalist approach resulted in three primary theoretical hypotheses being derived from the literature, namely, that leadership focus is a function of (1) optimising the balance of focus between external and internal priorities, (2) the fit between the leadership personality type and the organisation type, and (3) the capacity to manage a multiple focus. The interpretation of the responses from the sample of executives participating in the research study yielded a related set of first and second order factors relating to leadership focus that revolve around the level of comfort experienced by executives in managing focus in the leadership role. The approach to this research was one of methodological triangulation. A survey-based methodology was employed, containing both quantitative and qualitative questions. The results of the quantitative analysis of the relationship between personality type and leadership focus were contrasted and extended by a qualitative content analysis of the qualitative survey responses. The propositions were tested on a sample of South African executives attending management development programmes run by Wits Business School, University of Witwatersrand, in both Johannesburg and Cape Town. The findings show that Extraverted personality types are more comfortable with the challenges of focus in the leadership role than are Introverted types. In addition, Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking and Judging types experience a greater degree of fit with their organisations than do Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving types. The implications are that in a business environment of ongoing change, market innovation and increasing stakeholder expectations, organisation leaders of all personality types need to develop a greater consciousness of their preferred and less <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and a greater ability to complement their <b>preferred</b> leadership <b>behaviours</b> with less <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviours</b> when necessary, to optimise their leadership focus over time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis project is to carry out research, {{analysis}} and interpretation {{of the nature and}} effects of cultural influences on individual values and perceptions of preferred explicit managerial leader behaviour of businesspeople in New Zealand and Guangzhou City, China. In the course of the investigation theories of cultural value dimensions and leader behaviour theories are reviewed. Shalom Schwartz’ theory of individual values within national cultures and the Ohio State explicit leader behaviour theories are employed as the tools for the study. Investigations of the validity of the theories are carried out and reported, along with analyses and interpretations of the two field research survey instruments operationalising the theories, the Schwartz Values Survey (SVS) and the Leader Behaviour Description Questionnaire XII (LBDQXII). Results of the study indicate that neither of the theories or the survey instruments produces value and leader behaviour dimension structures that are invariant between the two samples of businesspeople. The invariance is not debilitating, and the theories and survey instruments produce useful comparisons of adequate validity and reliability to provide useful descriptions of differences in <b>preferred</b> leader <b>behaviours</b> between New Zealand and Guangzhou businesspeople. Based upon interpretation of these differences, suggestions are made concerning managerial leader behaviour suitable in managing and leading subordinates from each society. An adjunct to the study is investigation and validation of deficiencies in effectiveness of business leader behaviour in New Zealand identified by survey research studies interviewing samples of managers in countries important to New Zealand’s international businesspeople; some consistent attitudinal and behavioural problems are identified related to values and national character. The project is not directed at assessing organisational behaviour. It is directed toward identifying relationships amongst <b>preferred</b> leader <b>behaviour</b> priorities and individual value priorities in culture areas represented by two samples of businesspeople. When businesspeople from the two culture areas engage with one another in leadership, management, and commercial processes and transactions, differences in opinions attitudes, beliefs, and behaviour will be encountered that are attributable to individual values and <b>preferred</b> leader <b>behaviour</b> dimensions. Differences in <b>preferred</b> leader <b>behaviour</b> are identified and these differences are related to individual value priorities between the two samples. These differences are framed {{in the context of a}} theory of individual values and a theory of <b>preferred</b> leader <b>behaviour.</b> From the outcomes identified it is reasonable to expect that understanding and explanations of the sources of differences can be attributed to cultural value dimension differences.

PageRank provides efficient and simple method to find out ranking of Web pages exploiting hyper-link structure of the Web. However, it produces just an approximation of the ranking since the random surfer model uses just uniform distributions for all situation of choice happening during the surf process. In particular, this implies that the random surfer has no preferences. The assumption is limited by its nature. Personalized PageRank was designed to solve the problem but it is still quite restrictive since it assumes non-uniform preferences just at jumping to arbitrary page on the Web and non-preferring behaviour when following outgoing hyper-links.

Immediacy, a term coined by Mehrabian (1967), refers to verbal and nonverbal behaviours used by interlocutors to decrease physical and physiological distance between them, thus creating affinity, liking and affect. However, a number of questions arise as to the suitability of the various immediacy scales and their cultural significance in a non U. S. context, such as Hong Kong. Furthermore we were interested in possible differences in teachers' perception based on students' motivation. This paper presents the first part of an immediacy study, based on students of the Department of English of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (looking into mapping patterns of behaviours that increase immediacy). The results indicate that Hong Kong students prefer the holistic approach of the Chinese traditional teacher, a teacher who goes beyond just teaching in class, and that nonverbal actions are not high in their list of <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviours</b> in teachers, such as gestures, walking around the classroom or standing close to students (unlike what has been observed among U.

30|$|Finally, MODAM {{facilitates}} model comparisons {{and validation}} of behavioural sub models. Indeed, {{data can be}} used to set the parameters of sub models, that some behaviours use to inform their decisions. As an example, our implementation of solar PV behaviours can be informed by historical solar PV output data or weather data, see Figure  4. The weather data is used to populate a weather-driven model of expected electrical output of solar PV subject to weather with the passage of clouds, while the historical solar PV data simply gives the electrical output of specific solar PVs recorded over a period of time. Because these two approaches require different data input, two data readers were written to be used by each method. When the user chooses their <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviour</b> method, the required data provider will then be called upon. This has the advantage of extending the model, but also offers model comparison and validation of the behavioural sub models. Indeed, the weather-driven solar PV output model could be validated by comparing its output with the actual observations of solar PV output. The dynamic agent composition therefore has the additional benefit that validation of models can be done easily by setting two simulations and simply changing the datasets and data providers, and comparing their outputs.|$|E
40|$|Residual malaria {{transmission}} can persist despite high coverage with effective long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and/or indoor residual spraying (IRS), because many vector mosquitoes evade them by feeding on animals, feeding outdoors, resting outdoors or rapidly exiting from houses after entering them. However, {{many of these}} behaviours that render vectors resilient to control with IRS and LLINs also make them vulnerable to some emerging new alternative interventions. Furthermore, vector control measures targeting <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviours</b> of mosquitoes often force them to express previously rare alternative behaviours, which can then be targeted with these complementary new interventions. For example, deployment of LLINs against vectors that historically fed predominantly indoors on humans typically results in persisting transmission by residual populations that survive by feeding outdoors on humans and animals, where they may then be targeted with vapour-phase insecticides and veterinary insecticides, respectively. So while the ability of mosquitoes to express alternative behaviours limits the impact of LLINs and IRS, it also creates measurable and unprecedented opportunities for deploying complementary additional approaches {{that would otherwise be}} ineffective. Now that more diverse vector control methods are finally becoming available, well-established entomological field techniques for surveying adult mosquito behaviours should be fully exploited by national malaria control programmes, to rationally and adaptively map out new opportunities for their effective deployment...|$|R

The transplanted organ can function properly only if the patients change their lifestyle. <b>Preferred</b> health <b>behaviours</b> are the basis. Aim: Defining the relation between <b>preferred</b> health <b>behaviours</b> and health locus of control, as a determinant of returning to opti‑ mal health. Material and research methods: The research was conducted in the Transplant and Surgery Clinic and Transplant Outpatients Clinic in the University Hospital number 1 in Bydgoszcz. It was carried out among 98 patients after kidney transplant. They were tested using Health Behaviour Inventory by Juczyński and Multidi‑ mensional Health Locus of Control scale. Results: Patients differ among each other regarding health behaviours, however, all of them present {{a high level of}} health behaviours. Preventive behaviours, health practices and positive attitude were assessed high, whereas eating habits got a small amount of points. People between 41 and 50 years of age who have children, those living in the countryside, women and those patients for whom it was the first trans‑ plant, manifested more health behaviours. The vast majority of patients were convinced about the influence of oth‑ ers on their health, however they also claimed that their health was dependent on chance. Conclusion: The obtained results may help to enable better understanding of the needs of the patients after kidney transplant. Additionally, they may assist in education planning which may raise the level of knowledge and therefore help patients in taking care of their own health. The research may also serve as educational material for the patients and their families...|$|R

Concomitant with this aspect of the study, an investigation is also undertaken of the differences exhibited and expressed by both Australian and overseas students. 64 resident students, 39 Australian and 25 Overseas, were observed once over 15 tutorials with 15 different tutors. Actual participation for each member was rated using Bales Interaction Process Analysis to categorise students along each of the dimensions of task performance and social emotional behaviour. At the conclusion of a tutorial, each student rated his satisfaction with that tutorial along an 11 point scale, and then dichotomised into HIGH or LOW satisfaction groups. Two months after the observation period, students were given a questionnaire based on Bales 12 I. P.

40|$|Previous studies {{undertaken}} {{in determining the}} relationship between national cultural distance and entry mode selection decisions by multinational corporations (MNCs) {{in the context of}} Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) has produced conflicting results. Numerous studies, {{undertaken in}} the field of international business strategy have drawn differing conclusions, with some showing culture distance has strong impact on the selection of wholly owned subsidiary or joint ventures, while some claim existence of no significant relationship. While many researches taking the challenge in coming forward to solve this paradox, the study undertaken by the Brouthers brothers, namely Keith and Lance Brouthers in their paper Explaining the National Cultural Distance Paradox has seen to take centre stage in solving this issue. The principles, and the findings, regarded as a breakthrough of all sorts is replicated {{to the study of the}} FDI scene in Malaysia. Looking at the behaviour of MNCs, this study focuses to answer is there any existence of culture on the trends of entry mode practiced by investing MNCs from 1995 to 2002, touching eight industries. Hofstede’s culture distance indices are used in this study. Next, for the observed periods, the study looks at how industry attributes and characteristics attract a particular mode of entry among firms. Underlying specific attributes at firm levels and industry levels are mentioned. In addition, a study is also undertaken to see trends and the <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviour</b> in selecting mode of entry by corporations based on nationality and geographical origin. The analysis covers periods split accordingly from pre and post financial crisis periods. There is a distinction noted in the preferred selection based on firm origin nationality during the observed periods. Reasons are forwarded on the behaviour with linking the findings to the previous studies undertaken. Both empirical and theoretical evidence is used to explore in providing to explain inference on the selection choices of entry modes in the Malaysian FDI context. On the whole, it’s concluded that culture besides other micro and macro factors do play a role in businessdecision-making where entry mode is concern, despite statistical findings proving otherwise...|$|E
40|$|Cross-national merger and {{acquisition}} (M&A) activity is common and is argued to be a strategic {{tool for the}} growth of multinational corporations. Yet, M&A activity has a high failure rate which theorists have explained being due to cultural clashes. Previous research has explained these clashes being due to cultural distance. Other studies have focused {{on the extent to which}} the firms are culturally integrated and its relation to cultural clashes. In this study we investigate the relation between cultural distance and the extent to which the firms are culturally integrated as we believe that this relation in turn influences how cultural clashes are perceived by managers. As the human side of M&A has become of great interest within research we stress the importance of understanding what happens with managers in the organization during the post-acquisition process. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate the managers’ perception of cultural clashes, in relation to the perceived extent of cultural integration and perceived cultural distance, in cross-national mergers {{and acquisition}}s. In order to achieve an in-depth understanding of a series of cross-national M&As and to answer the purpose of this thesis, a qualitative case study design was used. Semistandardized interviews were made with ten managers from a Swedish firm that has gone through a series of cross-national M&As involving Swiss, French and German managements. The findings show that managers’ perception of cultural clashes differs depending on to what extent two firms are culturally integrated and in relation to the cultural distance between the two firms. No matter if high or low cultural distance managers perceive few cul-tural clashes if the extent to which the firms are integrated is low. If the cultural integration, on the other hand, is high and the cultural distance is high, the cultural clashes are perceived as many. Our findings indicate that cultural clashes are perceived differently depend-ing on how they affect the managerial role and the organizational behaviour. We refer to these clashes as implicit agreements and explicit statements. Clashes in implicit agreements are evolved from behaviour deeply rooted in national culture and corporate culture. These clashes have minor effects on the managerial role and the organizational behaviour. Never-theless, managers need to be aware of the differences and adapt to the <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviour</b> when interacting with the acquiring firm’s management. Explicit statements, on the other hand, affect the managerial role and organizational behaviour and lead to cultural clashes that conduce to frustration, lack of motivation and inefficiency. These clashes are more ap-parent when the extent of culturally integration is high. Therefore, the acquiring firm should not attempt to assimilate its target company in cross-national M&As...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} project examined drivers {{for the performance}} of Environmentally <b>Preferred</b> <b>Behaviours</b> (EPB), and a rigorous and accessible theoretical framework for drivers of this category of behaviours was created. Factors that influence the performance of EPBs, as well as some initial models of drivers for these types of behaviours, were identified from the literature. Three studies were subsequently conducted. Study 1 involved gathering the previously unexplored knowledge regarding drivers for EPB performance held by practitioners in the field using qualitative interviews with 19 participants. This information was then combined with that from the literature to create an original proposed model of the predictors for EPB performance. Study 2 involved creating a questionnaire to test the proposed model, and Study 3 used this questionnaire to test the proposed model with 503 office-based employees from Melbourne, Australia, focusing on two paper saving behaviours. Results from Study 3 were used to refine the proposed model to create the B-ECO Model. This model forms the basis for the B-ECO Theory which states that habit, convenience, procedural information, social norms, leadership, nature experience and self-efficacy are direct influences on EPB performance, and that they work in conjunction with environmental knowledge, connection to the environment and self-transcendence which affect behaviour indirectly through attitudes. Further, the B-ECO Theory states that these factors interact to produce an EPB, and that some factors are more influential than others. This theory differs from previously used psychological theories by including a range of contextual factors that have been identified individually. Further, it specifies the factors that may be influential predictors for the particular type of behaviours classified as EPBs...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Corporate {{governance}} and management by values have become vital for organisations in South Africa. Recent allegations of corruption, corporate failures and the abuse of leadership power highlight the need for solid moral and ethical foundations. A set of shared values in an organisation {{may prove to be}} a significant competitive advantage. The competence of employees as reflected through the evaluation of their individual job goals has been widely measured for many years. Currently, limited information is available on the measurement and evaluation of the conformance of employees to corporate values. This study explores the conformance of individual members to core values as part of a regular, systematic performance measurement system. Introducing such a system may assist in enforcing accountability for individual ethical behaviour. Literature on the topic advises that the core values of an organisation should be carefully and correctly identified before individual conformance to the values can be measured. Managing by values entails that <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviours</b> should be entrenched in all codes, policies, and procedures of an organisation, including the performance measurement system. A 360 -degree evaluation is considered the most appropriate method to evaluate individual conformance to corporate values. Information gathered from the model development part of this study indicates the following: 360 -Degree evaluation of values conformance may be incorporated into any existing performance measurement system that conforms to the criteria established in this study. A performance/values template used for the evaluation of job performance and values conformance results effectively differentiates employees into categories. The model developed in this study was effectively implemented and tested in an organisation. It is expected that the implementation of the model will enhance the performance of individuals and ultimately facilitate the creation of a motivating climate within the organisation. Master...|$|R
40|$|In my diploma thesis I {{dealt with}} {{functional}} behavioural assessment {{used on a}} student with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and weak cognitive control. In the theoretical part I introduced the basic characteristics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and functional behavioural assessment (FBA). At the centre of my concern was the ADHD phenomenon in school-age children, as the symptoms and sway of the disorder are usually the most conspicuous at that age. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder demonstrate numerous difficulties behaviour-wise, which in turn causes poor quality interaction of the child with their environment. Different experts in the field of mental health care have come up with various approaches to milden or replace the inappropriate behaviour with that which is socially more effective. One of such approaches is the functional behavioural assessment, an informal assessment technique intended for systematic gathering and analysis of information necessary when creating a positive behavioural intervention plan. In the empirical part of my thesis, {{in the form of a}} study, I tested the applicability and effectiveness of the functional behavioural assessment on an eighth-grader. The student had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and weak cognitive control, and had been put on an adjusted study program accordingly. The object of my concern was whether a systematic definition of (in) appropriate behaviours and environment factors, which influence the occurrence of a behaviour, offers insight into a possible cause of an inappropriate behaviour in the student observed. I was also curious to see if an inappropriate behaviour could be replaced with a more appropriate and socially <b>preferred</b> <b>behaviour</b> with the help of a behavioural intervention plan created on the basis of conclusions gathered from the functional behavioural assessment. Using the formal steps of FBA, I analysed the inappropriate behaviours and made assumptions about possible reasons for a behaviour and its function. On the basis of my conclusions I created a behavioural intervention plan for the student to be systematically carried out in the period of two weeks. After it was carried out, the short-term and long-term effectiveness of the behavioural intervention plan was evaluated. The functional behavioural assessment helped to establish a short-term effective behavioural intervention plan for the observed student, who was then able to replace his inappropriate behaviour during school lunch break with that which is more appropriate. Behaviour change was visible and positive immediately after the behavioural intervention plan was applied. Long-term effectiveness was not confirmed. In the conclusion I evaluated the performance of the behavioural intervention plan and emphasised those features that might or should be improved. ...|$|E
40|$|Since {{approximately}} two decades fractal geometry offers tools for the quantification of rock fabrics, and new methods are currently under development {{to investigate the}} inhomogeneity of crystal distributions, grain- and phase-boundary patterns {{as well as their}} anisotropy behaviour (Kruhl et al. 2004). These methods are now adapted for automated processing and suitable to quantify the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of rock fabrics from macro to microscale. Applications for quantifying inhomogeneity are mainly based on the box-counting and map-counting (Peternell 2002) methods, for anisotropy behaviour mainly based on modified Cantor-dust methods and provide fractal dimensions, fractal-dimension isolines and azimuthal anisotropies of fractal dimension (AAD, Volland & Kruhl 2004). For instance, the results provide information about the local variations of fabric patterns and their <b>prefer</b> orientation <b>behaviour</b> at macro and microscale...|$|R
50|$|Various critiques {{exist in}} print, {{although}} these tend {{to concentrate on}} the eclectic spirituality of the Findhorn Foundation rather than the environmental aspects of the Ecovillage. There is a statement of core values for the Ecovillage and its associated community called ‘Common Ground’ but other than affirming a commitment to “active spiritual practice” (which is diversely understood and interpreted) it concentrates largely on <b>preferred</b> interpersonal <b>behaviours</b> rather than prescribing a spiritual philosophy. Objections were raised by a local pressure group against the expansion of the wind park but the concerns of local people about the Ecovillage appear to have reduced, partly due to the proactive stance of the ecovillagers themselves, especially perhaps {{as a result of the}} gift of some amenity land to a local land trust by Duneland Ltd., an Ecovillage company.|$|R
500|$|Beyoncé is then {{announced}} by the contest's host as [...] "Miss 3rd Ward", and she then appears on stage, smiling and singing the first verse of the song a cappella. An applause follows from the crowd while the contest's judges write notes about her. The song then begins during a depiction of Beyoncé in the preparations for the show, in which she combs and sprays her hair, depilates her face and whitens her teeth. The scene transitions to a judge, played by the fashion model Shaun Ross, directing the contestants, during which Beyoncé is seen consuming diet pills. He measures her abdomen with tape and hits her thighs {{as an indication of}} <b>preferred</b> onstage <b>behaviour.</b> The second verse follows, during which Beyoncé is pictured exercising at her home and measuring her weight to her own dissatisfaction.|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) are {{entering}} the market for improving both safety and comfort. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is an ADAS application that has high interaction with the driver. ACC systems use limited sensor input and have only few configuration possibilities. This may result in the behaviour of the ACC not matching user's preferences in all cases, resulting in lower acceptance of the system. In this work, we examine the possibilities for a Personalised ACC (PACC), which adapts the ACC settings such that it matches the driver preference {{in order to increase}} the acceptance. The driver <b>preferred</b> ACC <b>behaviour</b> is predicted using machine learning techniques and manual driving data. On-road experiments showed that the method is promising as it is able to discriminate between two preference clusters with an accuracy of 85 %...|$|R
40|$|Comparatively speaking, the {{performance}} of Thai administrators in international studies of Thailand's relatively weak human resource base has been pinpointed {{as one of the}} underlying factors in the cause of the economic and financial crisis that has hit the country over recent years very poor. This research reports on a study that investigated the role that Thai administrators’ interpersonal relationships with their teachers play in enhancing the teachers’ teaching plan and students’ achievement in the subject and in forming or changing the teachers’ attitudes to teaching arrangement. The questionnaires were administered to a sample of 716 teachers in 80 schools under the Office of Basic Education Commission (OBEC) throughout of Thailand. Administrator-teacher interactions were assessed with the 48 -item Questionnaire on Administrator Interaction (QAI) which was adapted version from the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) (Wubbles & Levy, 1993). This questionnaire has an Actual and Preferred Forms. Teachers’ attitudes were assessed with the Test of Administrator-Related Attitudes (TOARA) which was based on the Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA) (Fraser, 1981). Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the teachers’ perceptions of actual and <b>preferred</b> administrator interpersonal <b>behaviours.</b> It was found that administrator interpersonal behaviour was high on factors such as Leadership, Helping/Friendly, Understanding and Teacher Responsibility/Freedom behaviour, while factors such as Uncertain, Dissatisfied, Admonishing, and Strict behaviours were far less prominent. Significant differences were found between teachers’ perceptions of actual and <b>preferred</b> administrator interpersonal <b>behaviours,</b> and a typology comparison of teachers’ perceptions of Thai administrators could be classified as Authoritative in both the actual and <b>preferred</b> administrators’ interpersonal <b>behaviours.</b> Associations between teachers’ perceptions of their administrators’ interpersonal behaviour with their attitudes to their school administration were found. The multiple correlations were significant for the Actual Form of the QAI and the TOARA, 39 % of the variance in teacher’s attitude to their schools was attributable to their perceptions. Based on the findings, suggestions for determining and effecting the school administrations by school’s administrator interpersonal behaviour for improving sustainable educational development in school’s administration in Thailand with teachers’ perceptions are provided...|$|R
