Introduced in 1959, ten of the class were built by Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, each with two 230 hp British United Traction - Albion engines. The class was built specifically for parcels, fitted out with <b>parcel</b> <b>racks</b> and bike storage at each end, and did not feature any passenger accommodation. The last {{members of the class}} were withdrawn in 1991, and none were preserved.|$|R
2500|$|The Paramount II {{launched}} for the 1985 season {{brought a}} tidier frontal appearance. (See the picture with the Paramount 4000) Gone was the black plastic moulding below the windscreen and the [...] "hole" [...] like {{appearance of the}} centre of the grille between the lights. The rectangular headlights were retained within a bright silver like surround. Other modifications included deeper <b>parcel</b> <b>racks</b> that were capable of supporting air conditioning. A tweed like material was used to cover the interior skirt and {{a large part of the}} racks.|$|R
5000|$|The Paramount II, {{the first}} update to the {{original}} single-deck design, was later launched for the 1985 season. It incorporated only minor visual changes, gone was the black full width grille moulding above the headlights and the [...] "hole" [...] like appearance of {{the centre of the}} grille between the lights. The rectangular headlights were retained within a bright silver like surround. Other modifications included deeper <b>parcel</b> <b>racks</b> that were capable of supporting air conditioning. A tweed like material was used to cover the interior skirt and {{a large part of the}} racks. Some important options were introduced, most notably bonded glazing, alongside the gasket glazing.|$|R
2500|$|... 1986 saw {{the final}} and most elegant version of Paramount, the Mark III. According to {{brochures}} {{it was even}} stronger than the Paramount II. The sloping front window was gone and in its place a stepped front window that formed the first bay. In the glass Plaxton's [...] "castle" [...] logo was etched, the rear window contained a blind like decal at the base with a castle badge in the centre. The dashboard consisted of a moulded cabinet, ceasing the use of wood and formica of earlier versions of Plaxton coaches since the Panorama's. In {{the centre of the}} black finished cabinet was a large castle logo. Airline-style locker doors were now available on the <b>parcel</b> <b>racks</b> to further give a sleek appearance like a 747.|$|R
25|$|The Panorama Elite II range {{built on}} the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up {{although}} it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. <b>Parcel</b> <b>racks</b> were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|R
5000|$|The Paramount III was {{launched}} in 1986, it introduced still stronger body structures than before and to quote a Plaxtons advert of the time [...] "Progress is Paramount". It had bonded glazing as standard, it also introduced some more obvious changes to the design, notably {{the replacement of the}} small and sloping [...] "feature windows" [...] (with white screen printing lines) with a pentagonal one immediately behind the cab or door, with Plaxton's [...] "castle" [...] logo being engraved on it. Changes to the front end consisted of a new grille and bumper, and changes to the shape and angle of the windscreen. The rear window contained a blind like decal at the base with a castle badge in the centre. The dashboard consisted of a moulded cabinet; gone was the Formica and wood of the earlier versions. In the centre of the black finished cabinet was a large [...] "castle" [...] logo. Airline style locker doors were now available on the <b>parcel</b> <b>racks</b> to further give a sleek appearance like a 747.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the accident, some {{passengers}} {{became concerned}} about their safety. Regular travellers were aware that the train was travelling at excessive speed and one who had moved from his seat to stand with friends in another carriage was forced {{to return to his}} seat as the movement of the train made it uncomfortable to stand. In the minutes immediately preceding the accident, luggage and <b>parcels</b> fell from <b>racks</b> above the seats.|$|R
