500|$|While he {{was still}} on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third {{interview}} with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then [...] "without being asked a further question" [...] he stated, [...] "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." [...] Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while {{he was looking for}} his stash of beers. According to Webster, they walked to the saltbushes together, where he <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking her for a while before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he [...] "thought she would squeal on [...] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the judge did not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a highly}} {{positive}} review, The Express Tribune called the film [...] "a visual masterpiece", adding that [...] "it sets {{a very high}} benchmark for future Indian action films. [...] It proves that Bollywood has {{what it takes to}} go beyond half hearted action flicks." [...] It praised Khan's performance writing that [...] "he actually managed to infuse a raw viciousness into to the character" [...] that was sorely missing in the prequel. The review also praised Chopra's portrayal of Roma noting that she <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> role with aplomb, adding that [...] "she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood." [...] Komal Nahta rated the film 3.5 out of 5 calling it [...] "a winner" [...] but felt that the first half was slow paced. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 out of 5, feeling that the second half took the film to another level, and wrote [...] "Farhan chooses an entirely new concept, garnishes it with classic action, stunning visuals, giving it an international look and feel". [...] Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis gave three out of five complimenting Khan's performance and action sequences, which he thought made the film work. Mid Day gave it 2.5 out of 5, praising Khan's performance and wrote [...] "The film is slick, the cinematography is captivating but the racy, edge of the seat pace that you expect from an action thriller of this kind is sorely missing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Say, but I'm hungry!" [...] she exclaimed, <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> gloves. She {{smiled at}} him, wanly, yet with a brazen coquettishness become habit.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{decrepit}} old crone, {{poor old}} body! She {{will soon have}} to give in. She can't even keep the children from <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> spectacles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That hill! The last of my breath!" [...] she gasped, <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> mittens. [...] "Never saw such luck!" [...] she {{declared}} none the less vehemently the next moment.|$|R
60|$|Sabina blushed again--this time scarlet; and, to Lancelot's astonishment, <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> slipper, and brandishing it daintily, uttered some unintelligible threat, in an Oriental language, at the {{laughing}} Claude.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} that I am glad of that," [...] {{answered}} the girl, as she <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> wet clothes. [...] "Life isn't a very happy thing, is it, mother, at least for those who live as we do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jim's mother {{heard the}} hurrahing and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> apron, {{and saw that}} Jim was safe and sound there before her. She {{gave him a look}} that made him slip round behind Blue Bob, and she went in and got a table-knife, and she came out and went to the pear-tree and cut a sucker.|$|E
6000|$|When Betty {{came into}} the room a few minutes later to <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> father's boots she found him sitting like one transfixed. He held out the letter, saying, [...] "Read that, child." ...|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, a {{pregnant}} woman wearing the hijab was attacked by teenagers in Montreal, {{when they tried to}} <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> hearscarf, causing her to fall. Quebec's National Assembly responded by passing a unanimous resolution against Islamophobia.|$|R
60|$|The {{moment he}} had done so the strange young woman had one more mad movement, and {{deliberately}} drove the car a few yards farther. Then she got out with an almost cruel coolness and began <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> long gloves and almost whistling.|$|R
60|$|My little Charley, {{with her}} {{premature}} experience {{of illness and}} trouble, had <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> bonnet and shawl and now went quietly up {{to him with a}} chair and sat him down in it like an old sick nurse. Except that no such attendant could have shown him Charley's youthful face, which seemed to engage his confidence.|$|E
6000|$|Seeing {{that her}} dinner {{was a success}} {{in spite of its}} homeliness, Edith added the last surprise, which had also been one to Patty and herself when it arrived, just in time to be carried out. She forgot to be Madam now, and said with a face full of mingled merriment and satisfaction, as she pushed her cap askew and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> mitts: ...|$|E
60|$|Lanty was by {{this time}} trying to drag Victorine over the rocks and through the water. The poor Parisienne was very helpless, falling, hurting herself, and {{screaming}} continually; and trebly, when a couple of natives seized upon her, and dragged her ashore, where they immediately snatched away her mantle and cap, <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> gold chain and cross, and tore out her earrings with howls of delight.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} home Anne sank upon a stool outside the door, {{fatigued}} with her excursion. Her first act {{was to try}} to <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> shoe--it was a difficult matter; but John stood beating with his switch the leaves of the creeper on the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mary has {{dispensed}} with much {{that belongs to}} a bride,' said Louis. 'See here!' and, seizing her hand, he began <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> glove, till she did it for him; 'did you ever see such a wedding-ring?--a great, solid thing of Peruvian gold, with a Spanish posy inside!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, I want to {{have some}} serious {{conversation}} with you upon a subject in which I take an interest {{for the first time in}} my life," [...] began Miss Kitty, seating herself and <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> gloves as if the subject was one which needed a firm grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think I have,' and Violet <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> glove. 'There--that forget-me-not--the first ring I ever had. From {{the day he}} gave me that it has {{all been}} so strange, that now and then I have been almost afraid to awake, for fear {{it should not be}} true. But may I look at that diamond {{butterfly}} of yours? It shines as if it would flash in the dark.' ...|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after this}} {{incident}} Hutter sounded {{what he called}} the roll-call for bed. Following Flo's instructions, Carley sat on their bed, <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> boots, folded coat and sweater at her head, and slid down under the blankets. How strange and hard a bed! Yet Carley had the most delicious sense of relief and rest she had ever experienced. She straightened out on her back with a feeling that she had never before appreciated the luxury of lying down.|$|E
60|$|Ethel sat submissively down on {{the lowest}} step, and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> boots. As she did so, her father and brother came in--the former {{desiring}} Richard to come {{with him to the}} study, and write a note for him. She hoped that thus she might have Margaret to herself, and hurried into her room. Margaret was alone, maids and children at tea, and Flora dressing. The room was in twilight, with the red gleam of the fire playing cheerfully over it.|$|E
5000|$|The opening credits {{begin with}} a heart transition, with Mikura dressed as an old woman, <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> mask {{and looking at the}} camera. This is based on a scene in the Majokko Megu-chan opening in which Megu appears as an old witch, removes her mask, and winks to the camera.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{go right}} off, Eldad. Hitch up, and I'll {{be ready in}} less'n no time," [...] said Mrs. Bassett, wasting not a minute in tears and lamentations, but <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> apron as she went in, with her mind in a sad jumble of bread, anxiety, turkey, sorrow, haste, and cider apple-sauce.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Faith stated in horror. This was terrible. Here {{was a little}} girl, almost a neighbour, half frozen because she had no shoes or {{stockings}} in this cruel spring weather. Impulsive Faith thought of nothing but the dreadfulness of it. In a moment she was <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> own shoes and stockings.|$|R
60|$|She listened attentively, then {{stretched}} up her {{own hand}} to test the cutting as he had done; she was not quite tall enough; she would step upon this piece of wood. Having done so she tried again, and succeeded in putting her finger on the spot. No; she could not understand it through her glove even now. She <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> glove, and, her hand resting in the stone channel, her eyes became abstracted in the effort of realization, the ideas derived through her hand passing into her face.|$|E
60|$|Trotty {{really had}} picked up the kettle somewhere or other {{in the course of his}} wild career and now put it on the fire: while Meg, seating the child in a warm corner, knelt down on the ground before her, and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> shoes, and dried her wet feet on a cloth. Ay, and she laughed at Trotty too—so pleasantly, so cheerfully, that Trotty could have blessed her where she kneeled; for he had seen that, when they entered, she was sitting by the fire in tears.|$|E
6000|$|One day {{the young}} woman who took in the letters had not got change, and she called her mistress. An old lady in a poke-bonnet came out of the parlor, and put on her spectacles, and looked at the letter, and fumbled in her pocket for eightpence, and apologized to the postman for keeping him waiting. And when I said, [...] "Never mind, Ma'am, it's no trouble," [...] the old lady gave a start, and then she <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> spectacles, and {{staggered}} back; and then she began muttering, as if about to choke; and then she gave a great screech, and flung herself into my arms, and roared out, [...] "MY SON, MY SON!" ...|$|E
50|$|Ruth - Ruth {{starts on}} the mortar and the tiles simultaneously, {{causing her to}} not use the trowel to create the grooves needed to hold the tiles in place, causing the mortar to fill the gaps between tiles, and also causing her tiles to fall. Frustrated by <b>her</b> work, Michelle <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> tiles and tries {{to put them on}} again.|$|R
60|$|His {{sister-in-law}} came {{round to}} the other side of the fire with her cup of tea in her hand, holding it out at arm's-length, so that she might not spill it on her dress, and uttering little cries of alarm. She placed the cup on the mantel-shelf and begun to unpin <b>her</b> veil and <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> gloves, looking meanwhile at Newman.|$|R
50|$|Jenner's {{character}} is shown again, still modeling but increasingly {{focusing on the}} protest. The cellist passes her, and gestures with his head for her to join them. Jenner responds by <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> blond wig to reveal her dark brown hair, cutting {{to a shot of}} her hair being blown forward. She hands the wig to a woman assistant without looking at <b>her,</b> wipes <b>off</b> <b>her</b> dark lipstick, and heads toward the protest.|$|R
60|$|Ursula, trembling, hardly able {{to contain}} herself, <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> clothes, {{put on her}} tight bathing-suit, {{and opened the door}} of her cabin. Two girls were in the water. The {{mistress}} had not appeared. She waited. A door opened. Miss Inger came out, dressed in a rust-red tunic like a Greek girl's, tied round the waist, and a red silk handkerchief round her head. How lovely she looked! Her knees were so white and strong and proud, and she was firm-bodied as Diana. She walked simply {{to the side of the}} bath, and with a negligent movement, flung herself in. For a moment Ursula watched the white, smooth, strong shoulders, and the easy arms swimming. Then she too dived into the water.|$|E
60|$|It was, in {{the first}} place, {{necessary}} {{to provide for the}} Mercury, because even a god cannot be sent away after the performance of such a journey without some provisions; and Edith, to tell the truth, wanted to look at the ball all round before she ventured to express an opinion to her sister and father. Her father, of course, would not go; but should he be left alone at Morony Castle to the tender mercies of Peter? and should Florian be left also without any woman's hands to take charge of him? And the butter, too, was on the point of coming, which was a matter of importance. But at last, having <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> butter-making apron and having duly patted the roll of butter, she went upstairs to her sister.|$|E
60|$|She rowed, however, her hardest {{for a few}} minutes, as it was all-important to {{get beyond}} {{the range of the}} Indians' guns. When a glance round showed her that she was some hundred and twenty yards ahead of her pursuers, she settled down into a long steady stroke. She knew well that she was now {{practically}} safe, for even if one of their guns could carry to her, it was difficult even for the best shot to aim from a dancing canoe. For half an hour there was no change in the position. The Indians were rowing their hardest, but the weight of their comparatively heavy canoe was telling upon them as much as the labour of driving her light craft was upon the girl. It was well for her that an out-of-door life and daily practice had hardened her muscles and strengthened her frame. She had once paused for a couple of seconds and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> frock, which at once cumbered her movements and was terribly hot. The speed of the canoe had scarcely slackened when the paddle was at work again, and she felt a sensible relief from the freedom of her limbs.|$|E
50|$|Dam's {{performance}} {{in this film}} received a lukewarm response. The Times of India in its review:Paoli Dam doesn't disappoint one bit on the latter aspect, she is not bad {{in terms of her}} acting abilities either. She doesn't incite the pathos that one could fervently feel for her character's plight. But though her act is not accomplished, she manages to <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> role quite well.|$|R
50|$|Alisha Klass {{tried to}} shock the {{audience}} during the show, first by coming out wearing a microscopic dress {{and with a}} ball-gag in her mouth to announce the winner of Best New Starlet, then later by <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> clothes as adult stars jumped on stage to dance to orchestra Jimmie Lykes and the Club Swingers prior to announcement of the final two awards.|$|R
50|$|She wastes no time {{punishing}} the informant. As Servilia's litter travels {{through the city}} streets the following day, her guards and servants are ambushed by several of Timon's men, the same men who killed Octavia's husband. When the litter falls to the ground, Servilia herself is attacked, a veiled Merula chopping <b>off</b> <b>her</b> long red hair as several men <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> dress. They leave the noble woman naked down to her hips in a heap on the street. As Timon looks on at the sad spectacle, his expression turns to grief.|$|R
