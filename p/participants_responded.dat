In January 1981, Dr. O'Brien and colleagues reported that primidone had {{a positive effect on}} the essential tremor of one of their patients. This led them to initiate a twenty-person prospective study. Twelve of the <b>participants</b> <b>responded</b> well. By 1984, valproic acid was the drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and not the equally effective primidone. However, as late as 1985, primidone was {{still one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. At the close of the 1980s, primidone was still the preferred anticonvulsant for complex partial seizures in Germany. In 1989, Dainippon Pharmaceutical launched Exegran (zonisamide), the first new, chemically unique, non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant in decades.|$|E

30|$|Wells, Smalarz, et al. (2015) {{proposed}} two {{arguments for}} why discriminability was an inappropriate {{interpretation of the}} lineup advantage. The first was that ROC analysis imposes an inappropriate response structure by forcing a 3 [*]×[*] 2 response structure into a 2 [*]×[*] 2 response structure. The 2 [*]×[*] 2 structure they referred to was the classic signal-detection structure (2 stimulus types: noise vs. noise[*]+[*]target[*]×[*] 2 responses: positive or negative). That is, on every trial with a 2 [*]×[*] 2 structure, a decision must be made regarding whether a previously shown stimulus was studied or not. If the stimulus was studied before and a <b>participant</b> <b>responds</b> positively, it is a hit; if a <b>participant</b> <b>responds</b> negatively, it is a miss. Conversely, if the stimulus was not studied before but the <b>participant</b> <b>responds</b> positively, then this is a false alarm, and if the <b>participant</b> <b>responds</b> negatively, it is a correct rejection. Lineups, however, correspond to a 3 [*]×[*] 2 structure due {{to the presence of}} known-innocent fillers. Participants are presented with a target-present (includes the guilty suspect) or a target-absent (the guilty suspect is replaced by an innocent suspect) lineup, and can make a positive selection of a suspect, a positive selection of a filler, or a negative response rejecting the lineup. Because ROC analysis focuses on suspect identifications (IDs) (correct IDs of the guilty suspect from target-present lineups and false IDs of a designated innocent suspect 1 from a target-absent lineup), Wells et al. argued that the positive selection of a filler was treated as a rejection, which made ROC analysis misleading (see Rotello & Chen, 2016, for a counterargument). This ignoring of fillers is central, given the explanation that Wells et al. favor.|$|R
30|$|When a <b>participant</b> <b>responded</b> {{incorrectly}} {{to any of}} the tests, phase 3 {{was performed}} again, followed by the learning tests (phase 4) being reapplied. The phase was finished when either the <b>participant</b> <b>responded</b> correctly in all learning tests or after 10 repetitions of phases 3 and 4, whichever occurred first. Therefore, considering that the procedure could potentially take a long time—given the criteria of 10 repetitions for the closure of this phase—baseline trials between the tests were not introduced. Reinforcers contingent on correct responses or participation in the activity were not used in this phase. Thus, after fixing the figure chosen by the child to the page of the trial, the page would be turned and the following trial started, without providing differential consequences programmed for the responses considered correct or incorrect.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the {{processes involved in}} human contingency learning using the color-word contingency learning paradigm. In this task, <b>participants</b> <b>respond</b> to the print color of neutral words. Each word is frequently presented in one color. Results show that <b>participants</b> <b>respond</b> faster and more accurately to words presented in their expected color. In Experiment 1, we observed better performance for high-relative to medium-frequency word-color pairs, and for medium-relative to low-frequency pairs. Within the medium-frequency condition, {{it did not matter}} whether the word was predictive of a currently-unpresented color, or the color was predictive of a currently-unpresented word. We conclude that a given word facilitates each potential response proportional to how often they co-occurred. In contrast, there was no evidence for costs associated with violations of high-frequency expectancies. Experiment 2 further introduced a novel word baseline condition, which also provided no evidence for competition between retrieved responses...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} of published material on conducting focus groups, scant specific information exists on how to analyze focus group data in social science research. Thus, the authors provide a new qualitative framework for collecting and analyzing focus group data. First, they identify types of data that can be collected during focus groups. Second, they identify the qualitative data analysis techniques best suited for analyzing these data. Third, they introduce what they term as a micro-interlocutor analysis, wherein meticulous information about which <b>participant</b> <b>responds</b> to each question, {{the order in which}} each <b>participant</b> <b>responds,</b> response characteristics, the nonverbal communication used, and the like is collected, analyzed, and interpreted.

30|$|We ran a {{comparison}} {{across the two}} experimental versions in order to investigate whether event completion differs between <b>participants</b> <b>responding</b> immediately after the contact moment and <b>participants</b> <b>responding</b> {{at the end of}} each clip. First, we compared contact-detection performance across experimental versions using a mixed ANOVA containing the factors causality (causal, non-causal; between) and experiment (immediate, delayed; within) and the dependent-measure sensitivity (d’). There was a significant main effect of causality, F(1, 62)[*]=[*] 13.44, p[*]=[*]. 001, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 18, indicating a reduced contact-detection performance in the causal condition as compared with the non-causal condition. The main effect of experiment was also significant, F(1, 62)[*]=[*] 5.80, p[*]=[*]. 019, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 09, indicating a higher contact-detection performance in the delayed-response experimental version than the immediate-response experimental version. Importantly, however, the interaction of causality and experiment was not significant, F(1, 62)[*]=[*] 0.26, p[*]=[*]. 613, ηp 2 [*]<[*]. 01. Thus, the effect of causality on contact-detection performance was not influenced by the experimental version.|$|R
50|$|Meatless Monday focuses its {{initiative}} on Mondays for several reasons. Friday is traditionally already a meat-free day among Catholics and Orthodox. Monday is typically {{the beginning of}} the work week, the day when individuals settle back into their weekly routine. Habits that prevailed over the weekend can be forgotten and replaced by other choices. A weekly reminder to restart healthy habits also encourages success. A 2009 trial published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine provided individuals with weekly health prompts and encouragement.

5000|$|Another study {{compared}} {{differences in}} speed of processing information between {{people of different}} ages. The task they used was a go/no go task where <b>participants</b> <b>responded</b> if a white arrow moved in a specific direction but did not respond if the arrow moved {{in the other direction}} or was a different color. In this task, children and young adults showed similar speed of processing but older adults were significantly slower. Speed of processing information effects how much information can be processed in working memory. [...] People with faster speed of processing can encode information into memory better than people that have slower speed of processing. This can lead to memory of more items because more things can be encoded.|$|E

Participants were given short prompts from lines in the monologue, which were excluded from the memory test. Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes for improvisations. The recall test was the monologue with 96 words or phrases missing. Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible.|$|E
