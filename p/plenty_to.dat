The farmers used every means they could, including bait, nets, and even sledgehammers, to catch enough to make sure their families had <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> eat whatever the outcome of their harvests. By the 1840s the Esopus's trout fishery was beginning to attract anglers from outside the region. Many stayed at Milo Barber's Inn in Shandaken.|$|E
25|$|Proposals to link Taupo with Rotorua and {{the greater}} Bay of Plenty with a railway date back to 1911. It had long been {{intended}} that the Rotorua Branch would be extended into the Bay of <b>Plenty</b> <b>to</b> connect with the line being built from Gisborne. A railway into the Bay of Plenty would link Rotorua and surrounding regions to the Port of Tauranga. Rotorua interests at the time lobbied very hard to have a line built between Rotorua and the Bay of Plenty, claiming the considerable amounts of land which would be opened up and linked to the port, particularly if the line were to be extended to Taupo.|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Andy Gill of The Independent {{felt it was}} [...] "not as {{immediately}} engaging" [...] as Big Boi's Speakerboxxx album, noting [...] "a laziness {{about some}} of the rhyming". While noting his boastful [...] "lyrical slackening" [...] as a minor flaw, Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo found Big Boi [...] "consistently in fine, tongue-tying form" [...] and described the album as [...] "rigidly focused and almost uniformly strong [...] by-the-books hip-hop with just the right proportion of ingredients". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau complimented the record's [...] "pervasive albeit incoherent musicality" [...] and observed [...] "a succession of enjoyable songs with <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> offer".|$|E

500|$|Crash of the Titans {{received}} mixed {{to average}} reviews upon its release. GameSpot credited it as a [...] "fairly sturdy, combat-heavy platformer {{with a good}} hook", but concluded that it lacked the distinctive style of past Crash Bandicoot games. The DS version of the game was reviewed positively, with IGN naming it [...] "one of the better handheld Crash games to hit the market". Nintendo World Report gave the DS version a higher score than the home console version by half a point, but dismissed it as [...] "a short game that has very little gameplay variety". GameSpot proclaimed that [...] "there's <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> do, and controlling the enemy is a neat twist", but criticized the game's small length of only six to eight hours.|$|E
500|$|Knowledge of Chekhov will {{increase}} the enjoyment of this work's in-jokes, {{but not as much}} as an understanding of Durang's absurdism, according to Theatermania.com's Brian Scott Lipton. Brantley noted that the work was suitable for any audience: [...] "Even if you’ve never read a word of Chekhov, you’re likely to find <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> make you laugh: Mr. Hyde Pierce’s skillfully low-key comic discomfort; Ms. Nielsen’s segues from manic eruption into glazed smiling stupor; Ms. Weaver’s game sendup of every self-loving, self-doubting movie queen there ever was." [...] He noted the play does not compare with some of Durang's most absurd work, calling it [...] "blander and thinner". Brantley said there was comfort in an evening of deliverance of Chekhov's [...] "lost souls", by Durang.|$|E
500|$|A {{frequent}} complaint among critics was the album's lack of lyrical depth. [...] Black {{wrote that}} [...] "Satisfy Me" [...] "delivers a message listeners have likely heard {{a time or}} six before", and Scott Fryberger of Jesus Freak Hideout opined that DecembeRadio struggle to [...] "be blatant about [...] faith without sounding cheesy". [...] Breimeier described the lyrics as walking [...] "a fine line between open expressions of faith and CCM clichés" [...] and granted that while [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] "relies heavily on platitudes, it's still powerfully affecting and relatable testimony". [...] Argyrakis, though, remarked that the band [...] "has <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> say" [...] and their [...] "stacked sounds are never {{at the expense of}} a meaningful gospel message".|$|E

500|$|The {{price of}} VVVVVV {{when it was}} {{originally}} released was $15. [...] This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's [...] "one unfortunate barrier" [...] to entry: [...] "While there's <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off." [...] Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost [...] "does strike you as a lot for an Indie lo-fi platformer", while insisting that [...] "it is worth the money". [...] Since its original release, the price of VVVVVV {{has been reduced to}} $5. [...] On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, [...] "I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people".|$|E
500|$|J Hurtado of Screen Anarchy {{called the}} {{cinematography}} [...] "astonishingly good" [...] and added that, [...] "Murugadoss and Vijay have never {{worked on a}} better-looking movie", but called the film [...] "an enjoyable, though largely forgettable film". N. Venkateshwaran of The Times of India said, [...] "Thuppakki will definitely {{be picked up by}} a big Bollywood star for a remake. For, the gun was bang on target". In contrast, Vivek Ramz from in.com rated it 3 out of 5 and said that it [...] "doesn't meet the huge expectations it had created for itself", calling it [...] "another regular commercial film which entertains in bits and pieces". Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff rated the film 2.5 out of 5, saying [...] "Vijay fans will find <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> rejoice in this subdued avatar of their star, but audiences who seek intelligence in their movies will find it rather dull".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{from both}} Rolling Stone and Blender made strong {{comparisons}} between Long Distance and the English musical duo Everything but the Girl.

In a more mixed review, a critic from SonicNet stated that [...] "Ivy specialize in nebulously oriented dream-pop: too ethereal for straight pop fans, too structured for the 4AD crowd." [...] In a divided review, Michaelangelo Matos of City Pages noted that he preferred Ivy's previous releases, but stated, [...] "If your band had spent four years getting dropped and picked up and dropped again by record labels, you'd sound tired too." [...] Similarly, a reviewer from Alternative Press was negative, expressing that [...] "the 13 tracks here are improbably edgeless, all love-me-do/love-me-don't plaints that evaporate on impact".|$|E

500|$|Music critic Keith Harris of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Janet Jackson has {{abandoned}} the plastic R of 2006's 20 Y.O. for a sexier brand of digitized megapop [...] you can dismiss any {{images of the}} abusive Jackson clan that flit into your mind. Just lie back and enjoy the sensations as pure aural autoeroticism." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were [...] "as innocent, universal, and inviting as anything else in Janet's past", and called the songs [...] "Rock with U" [...] and [...] "2Nite" [...] "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's [...] "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying [...] "Still, if not perfect, there's <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> like on Discipline, and while {{none of it is}} exactly vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list for a little while longer." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Mask of the Betrayer were {{generally}} favorable. Obsidian Entertainment's handling of epic {{levels in the}} expansion was particularly praised, although some reviewers said that at higher levels the expansion became unbalanced. A number of reviewers mentioned that the expansion allows for more customization of both characters and levels, with Game Informer saying that [...] "Piles of new feats, spells, and classes will give even seasoned D vets <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> explore, either in the official campaign or custom scenarios built by the community. Likewise, builders can benefit from the ever-improving toolset and (supposedly) fixed persistent-world implementation." [...] Eurogamer also described the new classes, prestige classes, and races as [...] "pretty damn neat". Eurogamer stated that starting Neverwinter Nights 2 over from the beginning after installing Mask of the Betrayer is also interesting because the expansion [...] "integrate with the previous game (i.e. you can select {{one of the new}} races and classes and go back and play NWN2 with them)".|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{have placed}} parts the novel in the mystery genre. Edinger found {{that despite the}} broad genres, the novel is mainly [...] "a thrilling puzzle". She relates the pieces slowly; clues {{are found in the}} story itself, on the map, in words and chapter titles. At {{the end of the book}} {{everything}} is tied together and makes sense. Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event. Each note is [...] "skillfully" [...] integrated into the novel, along with subsequent clues, until the climax is reached and all the clues come together. Stead's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre, in that [...] "there's <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> wonder about after you finish the book. Just as we wonder why our feelings change so suddenly, or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day." [...] Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb, adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery, the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post, {{who gave}} it 4 stars out of 5, stated that the film [...] "boasts the purest of Disney raptures: It unites the generations, rather than driving them apart". Leah Rozen of People stated that the film [...] "has imagination, humor aplenty and moves briskly", and that [...] "the animation, {{combining}} traditional and digital techniques, is ravishing." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today said that the film's most noteworthy feature is [...] "the artful way it combines the futuristic and the retro", {{and went on to}} say that the film doesn't have the [...] "charm of Lilo & Stitch" [...] nor the [...] "dazzling artistry of Spirited Away", but concluded that Treasure Planet is [...] "a capable and diverting holiday season adventure for a family audience." [...] Kim Hollis of Box Office Prophets stated that [...] "there's <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> recommend the film–the spectacular visuals alone make Treasure Planet a worthwhile watch," [...] though expressing disappointment because she felt that the characters were [...] "not all that creatively rendered".|$|E

[...] "1, 2 Step," [...] which continues the club music theme, is built around a simple dance and features Missy Elliott in a pas de deux. and according to Mike Pattensden of The Times, [...] "owes <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> classic New York electro." [...] "Oh," [...] a downtempo song, features a heavy bassline and has been called [...] "brooding electronic grind," [...] and, according to Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian, [...] "sounds like R reimagined by Gary Numan." [...] "Pick Up the Phone" [...] was described as a rip-off of Aaliyah's [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] by Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine. [...] "Next to You," [...] written by R. Kelly, is part of the album's second half of ballads, and was said to capture [...] "Ciara's youthful indecisiveness." [...] "Hotline" [...] features a [...] "funky clap" [...] and beatboxing.|$|E
500|$|Ida Skelton, {{who held}} {{multiple}} jobs {{to support her}} family {{after the death of}} her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but [...] "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined [...] "Doc" [...] R.E. Lewis's traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: [...] "We get <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> eat, and we sleep in the wagon." ...|$|E
