5|$|Cher {{starred in}} three films in 1987. In Suspect, {{she played a}} <b>public</b> <b>defender</b> who is both helped and romanced {{by one of the}} jurors in the {{homicide}} case she is handling.

In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow in love with her fiancé's younger brother.

5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, <b>public</b> <b>defender</b> Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the term}} <b>public</b> <b>defender</b> {{is often used}} to {{describe}} a lawyer who is appointed by a court to represent a defendant who cannot afford to hire an attorney.

The court appoints the public defender's office to represent the defendant, and the office assigns a lawyer to the defendant's case. In the federal criminal court system and some states and counties, representation is through a publicly-funded <b>public</b> <b>defender</b> office.|$|E
