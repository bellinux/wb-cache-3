5|$|Due to the {{inheritable}} {{nature of}} coats of arms the College {{have also been}} involved in genealogy since the 15th century. The College regularly conduct genealogical research for individuals with families in the British Isles of all social classes. As the College is also the official repository of genealogical materials such as <b>pedigree</b> charts and family trees. The College's extensive records within this realm of study dates back over five centuries. An individual could, if he so wishes, have his family's <b>pedigree</b> placed inside the College's records. This would require the services of {{an officer of the}} College who would then draft a <b>pedigree.</b> The officer would ensure that the <b>pedigree</b> was in the correct format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft. After this is done, the officer would submit the <b>pedigree</b> to a chapter of two other officers, who would then examine the <b>pedigree</b> for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research. After this examination is completed the <b>pedigree</b> would then be scrivened and placed into the <b>pedigree</b> register of the College.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{complexity}} and approximation {{of the problem of}} reconstructing haplotypes from genotypes on <b>pedigrees</b> under the Mendelian Law of Inheritance and the minimum recombinant principle (MRHC). First, we show that MRHC for simple <b>pedigrees</b> where each member has at most one mate and at most one child (i. e. binary-tree <b>pedigrees)</b> is NP-hard. Second, we present some approximation results for the MRHC problem, which are the first approximation results in the literature {{to the best of our}} knowledge. We prove that MRHC on two-locus <b>pedigrees</b> or binary-tree <b>pedigrees</b> with missing data cannot be approximated (the formal definition is given in section 1. 2) unless P=NP. Next we show that MRHC on two-locus <b>pedigrees</b> without missing data cannot be approximated within any constant ratio under the Unique Games Conjecture and can be approximated within ratio O (). Our L-reduction for the approximation hardness gives a simple alternative proof that MRHC on two-locus <b>pedigrees</b> is NP-hard, which is much easier to understand than the original proof. We also show that MRHC for tree <b>pedigrees</b> without missing data cannot be approximated within any constant ratio under the Unique Games Conjecture, too. Finally, we explore the hardness and approximation of MRHC on <b>pedigrees</b> where each member has a bounded number of children and mates mirroring real <b>pedigrees...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Consistency {{checking}} of genotype {{information in}} <b>pedigrees</b> {{plays an important}} role in genetic analysis and for complex <b>pedigrees</b> the computational complexity is critical. We present here a detailed complexity analysis for the problem of counting the number of com-plete consistent genotype assignments. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm for counting the number of complete consistent assign-ments for non-looping <b>pedigrees.</b> We further classify <b>pedigrees</b> according to a number of natural parameters like the number of generations, the number of children per individual and the cardinality of the set of al-leles. We show that even if we assume all these parameters as bounded by reasonably small constants, the counting problem becomes computa-tionally hard (#P-complete) for looping <b>pedigrees.</b> The border line for counting problems computable in polynomial time (i. e. belonging to the class FP) and #P-hard problems is completed by showing that even for general <b>pedigrees</b> with unlimited number of generations and alleles but with at most one child per individual and for <b>pedigrees</b> with at most two generations and two children per individual the counting problem is in FP. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the emerging problem of comparing {{the similarity between}} (unlabeled) <b>pedigrees.</b> More specifically, {{we focus on the}} simplest <b>pedigrees,</b> namely, the 2 -generation <b>pedigrees.</b> We show that the isomorphism testing for two 2 -generation <b>pedigrees</b> is GI-hard. If the 2 -generation <b>pedigrees</b> are monogamous (i. e., each individual at level- 1 can mate with exactly one partner) then the isomorphism testing problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then {{consider the}} problem by relaxing it into an NP-complete decomposition problem which can be formulated as the Minimum Common Integer Pair Partition (MCIPP) problem, which we show to be FPT by exploiting a property of the optimal solution.

40|$|We have {{recently}} reported a whole-genome scan {{in a sample}} of 630 subjects from 53 extended <b>pedigrees,</b> in which several genomic regions that may contain quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for obesity were suggested. In the present study, with an attempt to confirm our previous findings, we performed a follow-up linkage study in an expanded sample of 79 <b>pedigrees</b> with 1816 subjects (including expanded previous 53 <b>pedigrees</b> and 26 newly recruited <b>pedigrees</b> containing 1058 subjects). A new set of microsatellite markers spanning previously identified regions were selected, with the average genomic distance narrowed from approximately 10 cM to approximately 5 cM in this study. Using a variance component method, we performed two- and multipoint linkage analyses in the following three sample sets: expanded previous 53 <b>pedigrees</b> (758 subjects), 26 new <b>pedigrees,</b> and 79 total <b>pedigrees.</b> For body mass index, analyses of the expanded 53 <b>pedigrees</b> attained a LOD score of 2. 32 near marker D 1 S 468 in two-point analysis and a maximum LOD score (MLS) of 2. 21 in multipoint analysis; 2 q 14 near marker D 2 S 347 attained a LOD score of 3. 42 in two-point analysis and a MLS of 3. 93 in multipoint analysis. The linkage peaks at 1 p 36 and 2 q 14 were further supported in the analyses of all 79 <b>pedigrees,</b> with multipoint MLS being 1. 38 and 0. 90, respectively. For fat mass, genomic region 6 q 27 achieved a LOD score of 1. 24 in two-point analysis and an MLS of 0. 92 in multipoint analysis in all 79 <b>pedigrees.</b> Our data support that 1 p 36, 2 q 14, and 6 q 27 are promising regions that may harbor QTLs for obesity phenotypes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|A less pure form of Limousin is bred up (also {{known as}} graded up) from a base animal over a defined number of generations. A parent of each generation's progeny must be {{registered}} as a Limousin in the respective country's herd book.

Unlike the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which allow both purebred and Full French bulls and dams {{to be used for}} grading up, in Britain grading up can only occur using Full French bulls.
