5000|$|It was {{the first}} iron truss bridge {{to be built in}} New South Wales, and was {{designed}} by William Bennett, Engineer and Commissioner for Roads [...] and constructed by Francis Bell. [...] The trusses were assembled from iron work imported from England and the cast-iron cylinders for the main piers were cast at the Fitzroy Iron Works at Mittagong. The <b>pin-jointed</b> Warren truss section is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia.|$|E
50|$|A pure truss can be {{represented}} as a <b>pin-jointed</b> structure, one where the only forces on the truss members are tension or compression, not bending. This {{is used in the}} teaching of statics, by the building of model bridges from spaghetti. Spaghetti is brittle and although it can carry a modest tension force, it breaks easily if bent. A model spaghetti bridge thus demonstrates the use of a truss structure to produce a usefully strong complete structure from individually weak elements.|$|E
50|$|It was a deck-type iron {{bridge with}} <b>pin-jointed</b> lattice girders on {{cast-iron}} cylinder piers. It had substantial abutments (extant) made from sandstone, {{similar to that}} used in the abutments of the Heiner Road Bridge over the former Wharf Branch Line. The stone {{is believed to have been}} quarried locally at Denmark Hill. Comprising three spans of 150 ft (45.7m), it was 67 ft (20.4m) above the high tide level. 12 ft (3.7m) of the width of the bridge was reserved for rail and 23 ft (7m) for general traffic. It was an uncommon example of a road-rail bridge and this explains its wide abutments.|$|E
5000|$|A {{drawback}} of the spaceframe chassis {{is that it}} encloses much of {{the working}} volume {{of the car and}} can make access for both the driver and to the engine difficult. Some spaceframes have been designed with removable sections, joined by bolted pin joints. Such a structure had already been used around the engine of the Lotus Mark III. [...] Although somewhat inconvenient, an advantage of the spaceframe is that the same lack of bending forces in the tubes that allow it to be modelled as a <b>pin-jointed</b> structure also means that such a removable section need not reduce the strength of the assembled frame.|$|E
50|$|This mutual {{stiffening}} also permits simple construction: Stewart platform hexapods chains use {{prismatic joint}} linear actuators between any-axis universal ball joints. The ball joints are passive: simply free to move, without actuators or brakes; their position is constrained solely {{by the other}} chains. Delta robots have base-mounted rotary actuators that move a light, stiff, parallelogram arm. The effector is mounted between the tips of three of these arms and again, it may be mounted with simple ball-joints. Static representation of a parallel robot is often akin {{to that of a}} <b>pin-jointed</b> truss: the links and their actuators feel only tension or compression, without any bending or torque, which again reduces the effects of any flexibility to off-axis forces.|$|E
50|$|The Vierendeel truss, unlike common <b>pin-jointed</b> trusses, imposes {{significant}} bending forces {{upon its}} members â€” but {{this in turn}} allows the elimination of many diagonal elements. It is a structure where the members are not triangulated but form rectangular openings, and is a frame with fixed joints {{that are capable of}} transferring and resisting bending moments. While rare as a bridge type due to higher costs compared to a triangulated truss, it is commonly employed in modern building construction as it allows the resolution of gross shear forces against the frame elements while retaining rectangular openings between columns. This is advantageous both in allowing flexibility {{in the use of the}} building space and freedom in selection of the building's outer curtain wall, which affects both interior and exterior styling aspects.|$|E
50|$|A truss {{arch bridge}} {{combines}} {{the elements of}} the truss bridge and the arch bridge. The actual resolution of forces will depend upon the design. If no horizontal thrusting forces are generated this becomes an arch-shaped truss, essentially a bent beam - see moon bridge for an example. If horizontal thrust is generated but the apex of the arch is a pin joint, this is termed a three-hinged arch - see The Iron Bridge for an example. If no hinge exists at the apex, it will normally be a two-hinged arch.In the Iron Bridge shown below, the structure of each frame emulates the kind of structure that previously had been made of wood. Such a wood structure uses closely fitted beams pinned together, so the members within the frames are not free to move relative to one another, as they are in a <b>pin-jointed</b> truss structure that allows rotation at the pin joint. Such rigid structures (which impose bending stresses upon the elements) were further developed in the 20th century as the Vierendeel truss.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper shows, {{using only}} {{elementary}} mathematics, that, for a <b>pin-jointed</b> structure with non-linear elastic members, the classical minimum principles {{can be derived}} from one fundamental inequality. This is constructed from: (1) Youngâ€™s inequality, which is applied to the forceâ€“extension law, which has been expanded to include terms for thermal expansion or lack of fi t; (2) the principle of virtual work, which is fi rst demonstrated using a compact version of an existing proof. The method clearly shows why the theorems of minimum total potential energy and minimum complementary energy are extremum principles and not just stationary ones. The energy theorems of Castigliano and Engesser are also derived from the same inequality. The case of Hookean behaviour is particularly simple, as Youngâ€™s inequality reduces to the sum of the squares of the error in satisfying the forceâ€“ extension law. The stiffness method for linear elastic <b>pin-jointed</b> frames is established without the need to use rotation matrices to generate the set of equations for the full frame. Matlab code for the analysis of a three-dimensional <b>pin-jointed</b> frame is included in an appendix.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} the modified seismic response of framed structures {{in the presence of}} masonry infills, proper models have to be formulated. Because of the complexity of the problem, a careful definition of a diagonal <b>pin-jointed</b> strut, able to represent the horizontal force-interstorey displacement cyclic law of the actual infill, may be a solution. In this connection the present paper shows a generalized criterion for the determination of the ideal cross-section of the strut mentioned before. The procedure is based on the equivalence between the lateral stiffness of the actual infilled frame scheme during the conventional elastic stage of the response and the lateral stiffness of the same frame stiffened by a strut at the same stage. Unlike the usual empirical approaches available in the literature, the proposed technique involves the axial stiffness of the columns of the frame more than their flexural stiffness. Further, the influence of the bidimensional behaviour of the infill is stressed and, consequently, the dependence of the dimensions of the equivalent <b>pin-jointed</b> strut on the Poisson ratio of the material constituting the infill is also shown. The proposed approach is extended to the case of infills with openings, which is very common in practical applications...|$|E
