40|$|Efficient {{methods for}} {{simulating}} operators performing <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> tasks in manufacturing plants are needed. The simulation of <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> motions {{is an important}} step towards the implementation of virtual manufacturing for the purpose of improving worker productivity and reducing injuries in the workplace. However, industrial assembly tasks are often complex and involve multiple interactions between workers and their environment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a series of industrial simulations using the Human Motion Simulation Framework developed at the University of Michigan. Three automotive assembly operations spanning scenarios, such as small and large parts, tool use, walking, re-grasping, reaching inside a vehicle, etc. were selected. A conceptual model for describing relationships among task objectives, the environment, parts and tools, as well as worker variability, work methods, motion patterns, and musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) risks is proposed as a structure for conducting the case studies. The conceptual model is implemented using simulation strategies and the HUMOSIM Framework. Analyses demonstrate that the HUMOSIM Framework provides improvements on simulation capabilities over the built-in Jack functionality, such as the prediction of force-exertion posture and stepping motions. But knowledge gaps are also identified for <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> simulations, in particular the prediction of grasping and re-grasping.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{technical characteristic}} of a <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> and transport system which supports a factory layout of machine tools or an FMS is the required part transport speed from machining-(inspection-, assembly-) station to station. This speed is imposed by the production programme for which the layout has been designed and {{is a function of}} more parameters: number of stations; net production plus part loading-unloading times; buffer capacities; topology; and size scale of the machine layout. It is also dependent on the machine operation scheduling and on the maximum machine utilization requirement. In the paper, a new machine serving methodology is presented and analysed. It takes into account, in addition to the mentioned parameters, the position of the part transport means at each decision step, the part availability for further processing as well as the space availability in the machine buffer storages and evaluates the required minimum part transport speed. This minimum transport speed can then be used as a criterion for the final design of the <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> and transport system.

The method can be easily implemented even on existing manipulators, requiring minimal computational cost and knowledge of the dynamic parameters of the manipulator, and it is quite versatile, leading to guidance functions properly adapted to the specific manipulator requirements. However, the basic advantage of the method is the extensive robustness characteristics it offers at large payload variations and/or uncertainties of possible non-linearities of the manipulator, overcoming to a significant degree this traditional disadvantage of guidance-based methods over the methods based on closed-loop control.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of {{the environment in which}} a robot is performing its assigned tasks is obtained from a class of sensors called external state sensors in which vision is most widely used. Vision assisted robots are employed for a variety of <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> tasks. Pick and place is one of the well-established tasks utilizing vision for part geometry identification. The perception of depth is a major task to be accomplished in any picking application involving inconsistent parts to be handled. Since a single camera gives only 2 D information of the 3 D world, the third dimension perception is often achieved using multiple cameras, range sensors and other single camera depth perception techniques with the help of special optical arrangements and methods. The paper proposes a low cost time of flight technique assisting the vision data for depth perception and later for the robot to pick the part. The components considered for the experimentation of the idea are cubical and cylindrical, which are totally inconsistent as for as the vision computing is considered, because they are indistinguishable in an image (silhouette). The paper demonstrates the use of an ultrasonic range sensor to estimate the third dimension which is mounted {{in the vicinity of the}} robot's end effector. Once the depth is perceived the position and orientation of the end effector to pick the desired component can be estimated. For a given material the weight of the part is computed from which the gripping force is calculated. A strain gauge is used as a force sensor in the closed loop gripping force control system.
