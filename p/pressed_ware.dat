2500|$|The next {{twenty-five years}} were a golden era for the South Wheeling glassworks. The firm became [...] "famous for the variety, quality, {{and beauty of}} its <b>pressed</b> <b>ware,</b> and the {{richness}} of its cut, engraved and blown ware". [...] Wheeling became a [...] "hub for chemical and technological improvements to the composition of glass {{and the development of}} furnaces, molds, and presses" [...] for making glass. [...] J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier & Company was the most important glass manufacturer in West Virginia, {{and one of the most}} important in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|An {{official}} at the <b>press</b> conference called <b>Ware's</b> conduct [...] "outrageous," [...] saying, [...] "here you have two United States Senators in Baghdad giving first-hand reports while Ware is laughing and mocking their comments. I've never witnessed such disrespect. This guy is an activist not a reporter." [...] Matthew Drudge ...|$|R
2500|$|That fall, in {{addition}} to articles he wrote for the [...] "underground" [...] and [...] "aboveground" [...] Communist <b>press,</b> Hal <b>Ware</b> compiled an exhaustive survey of American agriculture, including maps showing the distribution of types of farms, farm incomes, and so forth in different sections of the country. This research was transmitted to the Communist International in Moscow, where it was read and praised by Lenin himself. The distinction between the preparation of such original research material for the international Communist movement and Ware's involvement a decade later in collecting government documents for the same purposes is a fine one indeed.|$|R
5000|$|Ware first {{revealed}} {{the details of}} the song during a live performance in London on 2 July 2017. She released a snippet of the song on 25 and 27 July 2017 respectively. On 27 July 2017, Ware debuted the song via Annie Mac's self-titled radio show on BBC Radio 1, and was named as Mac's [...] "hottest record in the world". The track was described as [...] "fantasy mixed with complete and utter desire" [...] in the <b>press</b> release. <b>Ware</b> said [...] "Midnight" [...] "is the song I've always {{wanted to be able to}} sing but perhaps didn't have the confidence until now".|$|R
50|$|In these {{successful}} circumstances it was {{not surprising}} that <b>Ware</b> <b>pressed</b> for entry to the expanding Isthmian League. This was achieved for season 1975-76 and they have maintained their place in the league ever since. This is thanks most recently to their Division 2 championship season of 2005-06 which carried them into Division 1 just before Division 2 was disbanded. Another FA Cup first round appearance in 2007 has added further distinction with a narrow home defeat against Kidderminster Harriers being watched by 2,123 people, a record for the current ground at Wodson Park.|$|R
