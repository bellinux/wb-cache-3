40|$|It is {{possible}} to create laminae that have spatially varying fiber orientation with a tow placement machine. A laminate which is composed of such plies will have sti#ness properties which vary {{as a function of}} position. Previous work had modelled such variable-stiffness laminae by taking a reference fiber path and creating subsequent paths by shifting the reference path. This thesis introduces a method where subsequent paths are truly parallel to the reference fiber path. The primary manufacturing constraint considered in the analysis of variable-sti#ness laminates was limits on fiber curvature which proved to be more restrictive for parallel fiber laminae than for shifted fiber. The in-plane responses of shifted and <b>parallel</b> fiber variable-sti#ness <b>laminates</b> to either an applied uniform end shortening or in-plane shear were determined. Both shifted and <b>parallel</b> fiber variable-stiffness <b>laminates</b> can redistribute the applied load thereby increasing critical buckling loads compared to traditional straight fiber laminates. The primary differences between the two methods is that <b>parallel</b> fiber <b>laminates</b> are not able to redistribute the loading to the degree of the shifted fiber. This significantly reduces the increase in critical buckling load for <b>parallel</b> fiber variable-sti#ness <b>laminates</b> over straight fiber laminates...|$|R

40|$|Current {{understanding}} of submarine sediment density flows is based heavily on their deposits, because such flows are notoriously difficult to monitor directly. However, it is rarely possible {{to trace the}} facies architecture of individual deposits over significant distances. Instead, bed-scale facies models that infer the architecture of ‘typical’ deposits encapsulate current {{understanding of}} depositional processes and flow evolution. In this study, the distribution of facies in 12 individual beds has been documented along downstream transects over distances in excess of 100 km. These deposits were emplaced in relatively flat basin-plain settings in the Miocene Marnoso Arenacea Formation, north-east Italy and the late Quaternary Agadir Basin, offshore Morocco. Statistical analysis shows that the most common series of vertical facies transitions broadly resembles established facies models. However, mapping of individual beds shows that they commonly deviate from generalized models in several important ways that include: (i) the abundance of <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> sand, suggesting deposition of this facies from both high-density and low-density turbidity current; (ii) three distinctly different types of grain-size break, suggesting waxing flow, erosional hiatuses and bypass of silty sediment; (iii) the presence of mud-rich debrites demonstrating hybrid flow deposition; and (iv) dune-scale cross-lamination in fine-medium grained sandstones.

Unit D, a thin, resedimented siliciclastic-carbonate unit deposited on a sequence boundary at the end of unit C progradation, displays a lateral facies change from well bedded 'outer shelf deposits in the east to basin-slope debris flows in the west.

A detailed study, with focus on internal facies distribution and local parasequence stacking pattern, has been carried out in an approximately 70 km 2 study area. A total of twelve aggrading and forwards stepping parasequences of a fluvio-wave dominated deltaic origin are recognized. Local variations and complex geometry of the parasequences in the formation are best explained by autogenic mechanisms and accompanied delta lobe switching, characteristic of a delta with a fluvial dominated morphology (Helland-Hansen, 2010). In contrast, facies analysis of the formation reveals a predominance of wave generated structures. However, the parasequences locally show a characteristic development of alternating plane <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> sandstone units (5 - 30 cm set thickness) and symmetrical small scale ripples. These units reflect deposition in front of, or close to, an active river mouth bar system, strongly influenced by hyperpycnal flow processes during flood events and accompanying wave reworking during waning flood and fair weather aggradation. The local variations of this facies makes it possible to recognize and map the position of the most fluvial influenced shoreface/delta front successions and their spatial distribution as a consequence of auto-cyclic lobe change processes.

The vertical bar succession {{is characterized by a}} fining-upward profile with an increase in mud content and mud-bed thickness from the shallow subtidal zone to the upper intertidal zone. There is also {{an increase in the number}} and lateral continuity of mud beds from the upstream side to the downstream side of the bar. Sand beds are dominated by current ripples in the intertidal zone, and by current ripples and trough cross-beds in the shallow subtidal zone. The channel base is mantled by downstream (ebb) -oriented dune-scale bedforms. Mud beds are dominantly <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated,</b> although current ripples may develop in silt-rich and sand-rich mud beds. Current-generated bedforms are predominantly ebb-oriented. Sediment deposition is seasonally controlled. Sand deposition occurs during periods of high discharge (snowmelt-induced freshet), and mud is deposited during waning freshet flow and low discharge (base flow). In mud-dominated deposits, current ripples may develop in sand-rich mud beds deposited during the freshet. Seasonal cyclicity in sediment deposition is also recorded in the ichnological characteristics of the IHS. Bioturbation is significantly more common in base-flow deposits (mud beds) than freshet deposits (sand beds). Burrows in sand beds typically subtend from overlying mud beds. Diminutive, vertical burrows dominate the trace suite, reflecting a very low diversity of infauna. Bioturbation is more common on the downstream side of the bar, associated with the thicker and more laterally contiguous mud beds...|$|R
40|$|AI~STIL~CT: Very poorly sorted, non-laminated thin {{layers of}} clayey to silty sand {{designated}} as "a"-division of turbidites occur among thinly laminated, free-grained spill-over deposits {{on the natural}} evees of the relatively steep upper channel segment of the Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel (NAMOC) of the Labrador Sea. These layers are non-graded and the transition to overlying ripple-cross <b>laminated</b> silt or <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> terrigenous mud is abrupt {{both in terms of}} grain-size and sorting. The "a"-division is interpreted as a head spill-over deposit from channelized turbidity currents. Turbulence in the current head causes a wide range of available grain sizes to be thrown up high enough so that lateral overflow over the channel banks can carry them to the levees where they are deposited as massive, ungraded sand layers containing ranule to clay-sized material. These head-spill overflows may be supercritical at times. Subcritical body spill from the dilute upper parts of the (same or a later) flow generally deposits thinly laminated (d-division) or homogeneous (e-division) muds which represent the bulk of the spill-over deposits. Locally, body spill deposits include ripple cross-laminated ['me sand and silt (c-division), and rarely a- and b- divisions. The common occurrence of the "a"-division on the upper channel levees (channel slope greater or equal 0. 002) and the scarcity of such layers further downchannel (slope gradient less than 0. 002) supports Komar's (1972) choice of a critical slope gradient of 0. 002 for head spill-over to occur.

[...] Thirteen facies and four facies associations were recognized in the field. The thirteen facies are: (1) coarse- to fine-grained, graded sandstones; (2) "slurry" sandstone beds; (3) sandstones containing abundant shale clasts; (4) sandstones that feed injections; (5) sandstones with shallow erosional bases; (6) cross <b>laminated</b> or/and <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> sandstones or siltstones; (7) thinly bedded, laminated sandstones or siltstones; (8) sandstones containing large laminated slabs; (9) sandstones with bidirectional paleoflow indicators (Megaturbidite); (10) bi-partite sandstones; (11) thinly bedded sandstones; (12) concretions; and (13) laminated, silty mudstones. [...] The four facies associations are: (1) erosively based sandstone packets; (2) sandstones interealated with mudstones or siltstone; (3) interealated sandstones, siltstones and silty mudstones; and (4) silty mudstones interealated with siltstones or sandstones. [...] The interpretation of sandstone facies and facies associations described from the β 7 member suggests that these turbidites accumulated in the distributary channels, the outer fan, and the fan fringe of a transverse fan near the margin of the foreland basin, and on the adjacent basin plain. The proximal parts of the marginal fans are believed to have been destroyed by later tectonic uplift and erosion. [...] The turbidite succession, where bed-by-bed tracing is possible, contains outer fan and fan-fringe deposits of a transverse fan, and basin-plain deposits.

Thus it replaced the timber as joist in TCC to produce higher strength of flooring system and name as LVL-concrete composite (LCC). But due to the light-weight of LCC in long span, it might highly susceptible to vibration by service load. Therefore the main objective of this research is to study the vibration behavior of Malaysian LCC in various parameters such as concrete topping thickness, span length and stiffness connector; and full scale flooring system by using SAP 2000 finite element modeling. The SAP 2000 software and model were verified through Abd Ghafar's (2008) experiment results and analytical in order to produce accurate modeling. The properties results of LVL Rubberwood from testing are dramatically higher than its origin Rubberwood properties with bending strength of 36. 29 N/mm 2 and modulus of elasticity of 14327 N/mm 2. The performance of LVL Rubberwood is increase by at least 26. 8 % to maximum 89. 73 % based on properties comparison of Rubberwood. The 150 mm rectangular notch with 10 mm diameter screw connector is the best connection by produced a maximum strength of 54. 75 kN from experiment.

Relatively complex triaxially braided fiber architectures have been found to yield the best performance for the fan cases. To properly work with and design these structures, robust analytical tools are required {{that can be used in}} the design process. A new analytical approach models triaxially braided carbon fiber composite materials within the environment of a transient dynamic finite-element code, specifically the commercially available transient dynamic finite-element code LS-DYNA. The geometry of the braided composites is approximated by a series of <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> composites. The composite is modeled by using shell finite elements. The material property data are computed by examining test data from static tests on braided composites, where optical strain measurement techniques are used to examine the local strain variations within the material. These local strain data from the braided composite tests are used along with a judicious application of composite micromechanics- based methods to compute the stiffness properties of an equivalent unidirectional laminated composite required for the shell elements. The local strain data from the braided composite tests are also applied to back out strength and failure properties of the equivalent unidirectional composite. The properties utilized are geared towards the application of a continuum damage mechanics-based composite constitutive model available within LS-DYNA. The developed model can be applied to conduct impact simulations of structures composed of triaxially braided composites. The advantage of this technology is that it facilitates the analysis of the deformation and damage response of a triaxially braided polymer matrix composite within the environment of a transient dynamic finite-element code such as LS-DYNA in a manner which accounts for the local physical mechanisms but is still computationally efficient. This methodology is tightly coupled to experimental tests on the braided composite, which ensures that the material properties have physical significance. Aerospace or automotive companies interested in using triaxially braided composites in their structures, particularly for impact or crash applications, would find the technology useful.

40|$|Submarine flows can {{transport}} huge {{volumes of}} sediment across the large submarine fans that dominate {{many parts of}} the deep ocean floor. Active flow events are notoriously difficult to monitor directly, and therefore our understanding of such flows still strongly relies on the analysis of the deposits they leave behind. This thesis aims to investigate the transport and depositional processes, the stacking patterns and the time frequency distribution of turbidites and debrites deposited in the Miocene Marnoso Arenacea Formation (Italian Apennines). This location is unique because deposits from individual flow events (beds) can be traced for long distances, allowing the lateral and down flow evolution of single flow events to be analyzed in detail. Lateral changes in individual flow deposits are documented through extensive correlation of beds deposited in a stratigraphic interval below the most prominent Contessa Marker bed. The observed transitions in facies, and the external shape of different types of deposit, are used as an independent test of models that capture our understanding of submarine flow processes. This work highlights how deposits of submarine density flows can be complex, even in relatively simple basin plain settings. A single event can comprise different flow types, and transformations can occur between these flow types. The initial volume, sediment concentration and grain size (including the proportion of fine cohesive mud) control the external shape of the deposits. Low density turbidity currents deposit clean sandstone beds with an exponentially tapering shape, while coarser grained high density turbidity currents produce massive or <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> layers that maintain their thickness for longer (10 ’s of kilometers) distances. Cohesive debris flows form istinctive ungraded mud-rich sandstone that can either pinch-out abruptly or gradually taper. Liquefied debris flows with elevated pore pressures can deposit clean (mud-poor) sand over large areas (up to 30 km) of the Marnoso Arenacea basin plain. This is suggested by the distinctive swirly, patchy fabric of a particular type of clean sandstone, that records pervasive liquefaction during the late stages of the flow, and confirmed by the rapid pinch-out geometry of flow deposits at their margins. Such debris flows most likely form through transformation from an initial high density turbidity current. A similar flow process may characterize the distal, rapid pinch out of sandstone lobes in Fan 4 of the Skoorsteenberg Formation (Karoo basin, South Africa). The observed stacking pattern of turbidite beds in a 530 meters thick stratigraphic section indicates a long-term clustering. Debrite intervals however occur randomly, and bed correlation suggest that almost every large volume flow deposited clean or muddy debrite (or both) intervals in different positions of the basin. Hemipelagic marl thickness is used as a proxy for time between flow events. The distribution of time between events is exponential, therefore related to a Poisson Process. This indicates that flow events (most likely triggered by submarine slope failures) occur independently one from the other through time. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Small {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (SUAVs) {{are used}} in today's world for mapping, surveillance, recreation, environmental monitoring, delivery, and structural maintenance. Typical manufacturing methods of UAVs limit rapid prototyping due {{to the use of}} expensive components and rigid designs. An expansion of laminate manufacturing will provide an alternative to this complex method of 3 D UAV construction. Current self-folding techniques based on laminate manufacturing produce structures with greater strength to weight ratios, faster fabrication times, and lower fabrication costs but are incapable of generating continuous enclosed curved structures. This thesis describes an expansion on laminate manufacturing that utilize laminate buckling to create curved structures. A smart composite is constructed by sandwiching a shape memory polymer (SMP) with structural layers and two <b>parallel</b> constrained <b>laminates.</b> When the polymer is activated, the contraction induces buckling along adjacent laminate surfaces generating predefined curved structures. Stronger actuator force, expanding foam, and epoxy layering are explored to increase stiffness of curved surfaces. Using the approach described, SUAVs can be constructed using low cost materials, assembled in two dimensions, and optimized for specific environmental conditions. The most important feature of flight is lift, and the capability of lift is due to the design of airfoil profiles. Minor adjustments to a planar laminate design can create various National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics (NACA) airfoils by overlaying layers of laminate material, heat activated SMP, and hardening epoxy to morph a layered composite into a stiff curved structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{adhesive}} layer on crack propagation in composite materials is investigated. The composite medium consists of <b>parallel</b> load carrying <b>laminates</b> and buffer strips arranged periodically and bonded with thin adhesive layers. The strips, assumed to be isotropic and linearly elastic, contain symmetric cracks of arbitrary lengths located normal to the interfaces. Two problems are considered: (1) thin adhesive layers are approximated by uncoupled tension and shear springs distributed along the interfaces of the strips for which only the case of internal cracks can be treated rigorously; (2) broken laminates and the true singular behavior {{in the presence of}} the adhesive layer are studied. The adhesive is then treated as an isotropic, linearly elastic continuum. General expressions for field quantities are obtained in terms of infinite Fourier integrals. These expressions give a system of singular integral equations in terms of the crack surface displacement derivatives. By using appropriate quadrature formulas, the integral equations reduce to a system of linear algebraic equations which are solved numerically...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} has been to determine the environments of deposition of the Grindslow Shales and Kinderscout Grit in an area north of the Derbyshire Dome. These units overly the Mam Tor Sandstones and Shale Grit, which are thought to be turbidites showing increasing proximity to scource. The Grindslow Shales had been interpreted as the slope down which the turbidity currents were generated. Little was known of the depositional environment of the Kinderscout Grit, though shallow water conditions had been suggested. The sequence, {{from the base of the}} Mam Tor Sandstones to the top of the Kinderscout Grit, falls within the zone R 1 c of the Namurian. The outcrops of the Kinderscout Plateau, Derwentdale and Longendale have been mapped and numerous sections measured. In all, 17 facies have been recognised, described and interpreted in hydrodynamic terms on the basis of their internal evidence. Three silts tone facies and one of silty sandstone are thought to be largely deposited from suspension, while fine sandstone, showing ripples and cross-lamination, is interpreted as showing lower flow regime conditions. <b>Parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> fine sandstone is interpreted as an upper flow regime deposit. Facies 8, Massive Bedded Coarse Sandstone, is not, in the first instance, interpretable in hydrodynamic terms. Facies 9, Parallel Bedded Coarse Sandstone, is interpreted as an upper flow regime deposit, while Facies 10, Medium Scale Cross-Bedded Coarse Sandstone is attributed to the lower flow regime along with Facies 11, Medium Scale Cross-Bedded Fine Sandstone. Facies 12, Large Scale Cross-Bedding, consists of single tabular sets of cross-bedding up to 40 m. thick, mainly of very coarse sandstone. These are ascribed to the advance of delta-like sedimentation units into bodies of standing water. Other facies, of minor importance,are Sharp-Based Clean Sandstone Beds, Orthoconglomerates, Seat Earths and Coals, Mudstone Melange and Turbidite-like Sandstones. Three types of trace fossil have been recognised, though it is concluded that they are probably of little environmental significance. Five facies associations are recognised, in which facies succeed one another with variable predictability. The Major Channel Association involves Facies 8, 9 and 10, Massive, Parallel and Cross-Bedded Coarse Sandstones, resting in channels up to 40 m. deep. Other details of channel geometry are not clear, though widths of 300 - 400 m. have been calculated. There is a preferred upwards facies sequence within the channels of Erosion Surface → Facies 8 → Facies 9 → Pacies 10. From hydrodynamic considerations of the sequence, it is suggested that the Facies 8 Massive Bedded Sandstone was deposited by currents flowing in the upper part of the upper flow regime, the whole channel sequence representing a waning flow. The Large Scale Cross-Bedding Association involves Facies 12 and 10, the medium scale cross-bedded sandstone being separated from the underlying Large Scale set by an erosion surface. It is suggested that the Association represents delta cones which advanced into bodies of standing water, subsequent to sudden deepening. The Fluviatile Channel Association is a fining upwards sandstone sequence with a horizontal erosion surface at its base. Facies 10, Medium Scale Cross-Decided Coarse Sandstone forms the bulk of the association, though thin beds of Orthoconglomerate and mudflake conglomerate may occur above the erosion surface. In the top of the association, the cross- bedded sandstone passes into <b>parallel</b> or ripple <b>laminated</b> fine sandstone and sometimes into seat earths and coals. The association is interpreted as the result of the lateral migration of a fluviatile channel, probably of the meandering type. The Slope Association, which has limited stratigraphical position, is a broadly coarsening upwards silts tone and silty sandstone sequence. Thin turbidites occur in the base and burrows become abundant towards the top. It has occasional large channels, filled mainly with turbidites. The association is interpreted as the prograding slope of a coastline receiving abundant sediment supply. The Interdistributary Complex Association is a random sequence of predominantly fine grained facies, showing a variety of flow conditions. It is interpreted as forming in shallow water conditions, probably in interdistributary areas of a delta top. An analysis of the relationships of the facies associations throughout the area gives the following generalised sequence:- 'Gracile' Marine Band. Fluviatile Channel Association Slope or Interdistributary Complex Upper Kinderscout Grit Butterley Marine Band Fluviatile Channels and Interdistributary Complex Association Large Scale Cross-Bedding Lower Kinderscout Grit Major Channels Interdistributary Complex Association Grindslow Shales Slope Association From a consideration of this sequence, it is concluded that the Grindslow Shales represent the main southwards advance of the delta slope and delta top environments across the area. The major channels which erode into the Interdistributary Complex Association sediments of the top of the Grindslow Shales were non-migrating distributaries which underwent frequent diversion and cut-off. They had high flow regime currents and were possibly associated with a period of eustatically falling sea level. A subsequent eustatic rise led to the ponding up of sediment on the delta, top with the formation of delta cones. Above the delta cones, meandering river channels and interdistributary areas were the main features of the palaeogeography. The Butterley Marine Band and its overlying unit of Slope Association suggest a further eustatic rise of sea level. The Upper Kinderscout Grit is thought to be the deposit of laterally migrating rivers. Comparison with the succession further north gives additional evidence of eustatic changes of sea level and suggests ways in which the palaeogeography might have responded to these. It is suggested that the turbidity currents in the basin possibly originated as high flow regime traction currents in the major channels on the delta top, at times of flood. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is {{a massive}} {{engineered}} wood product made of orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber, and is intended for roof, floor, or wall applications. Although it was developed in Europe in the early 90 s, CLT is relatively new to North America. CLT products must be certified for structural use. First North American product standard stipulating test methods and qualification criteria for benchmark structural properties and adhesive bond integrity in structural CLT is ANSI/APA PRG 320 - 2012. These methods and criteria have been adapted from existing laminated timber products (glulam), sometimes disregarding substantial differences between <b>parallel</b> <b>laminates</b> and CLT, in which layers are perpendicular to each other. From {{the point of view}} of long term sustainability of the CLT industry in North America, the critical questions are: 1. Is it possible to use low-grade timber harvested in the Pacific Northwest region in CLT products without compromising critical engineering parameters? Utilization of low- grade lumber, which is typically under-valued, in value-added engineered products should reduce the pressure on the high end structural lumber supply and may also provide a substantial outlet for lower-grade lumber timber species, including beetle-killed pine (BKP) harvested in the affected areas. 2. Can alternative adhesive systems, currently used in related engineered wood products and manufactured by domestic industry, be successfully used in CLT production? This is an important question, and is related to the fact that polyurethane (PUR) is the primary adhesive currently used by CLT manufacturing industry, and is supplied worldwide by a single Europe-based company. This adhesive is optimized for the species commonly used in CLT products to-date. ANSI/APA PRG 320 - 2012 standard allows alternative adhesive types (PRF and EPI are specifically named), but to-date, only one alternative (MUF) has been used in commercial products. The objective of this project is to determine effective adhesive systems and bonding pressures for the hybrid cross-laminated timber (CLT) combinations. A secondary objective is to evaluate the testing methods prescribed in PRG 320 - 2012 for cross-laminated bond integrity. Integrity of hybrid CLT layups was evaluated on small specimens derived from CLT billets fabricated in-house using test procedures and qualification criteria specified in ANSI/APA PRG 320 - 2012 section 8. 2. 3. Test results were compared to prescribed qualification criteria. The Hybrid CLT combinations for this study include both structural grade lumber and low-grade lumber. For a reference species, lodgepole pine was selected, since it is a member of the US-SPF group closely related to the European species commonly used for CLT construction. The structural-grade, local species will be represented by Douglas-fir, while the low-grade species will be represented by low-grade lodgepole Pine, Douglas-fir, and Western Hemlock. The two adhesive systems investigated were 1) polyurethane-based PUR (currently the most common adhesive used by the CLT industry), which will serve as a reference system, and 2) phenol-resorcinol formaldehyde (PRF), which will represent a potential domestic alternative. PRF was chosen because it is a cold setting adhesive commonly used by the engineered wood products industry in North America; however, no CLT manufacturers utilize this adhesive system. The variables included species combinations (6), adhesive types (2), and clamping pressures (3), with repetition of 9 specimens per combination coming from at least three different CLT billets. The specimen’s bond integrity was assessed by the qualification panel requirements in PRG 320 - 2012 section 8. 2. The qualification tests are block shear and cyclic delamination. A combination must pass both of the test requirements to qualify. The results of the study show that, of the 36 combinations, six failed the block shear test requirements and twenty-five failed the delamination test requirements. The 10 variable combinations that passed both requirements were DDL 10 F, DDL 40 F, DPL 40 F, PPH 10 F, PPH 69 F, PPH 10 U, PPH 40 U, PPL 10 U, PPL 69 U, and PHL 69 U. Initial inspection of test results show that no single variable that seems to make a significant impact on the bond integrity. It did reveal that no combinations with the use of Douglas-fir as a face material and PUR as an adhesive met the requirement, and only one combination with western hemlock as a core material met the requirements. It is evident that the delamination test was the major restriction on whether or not a combination passes the bond qualification. We believe that the adaption of a delamination test standard designed for layers with parallel grains makes the passing requirement too strict for an orthogonally bonded product. In conclusion, there were 10 combinations that passed both bond integrity test requirements. It was unclear whether the species and/or grade combination, adhesive system, or clamping pressure made the biggest impact on the bond integrity. Relative to the reference adhesive (PUR), and species combination (lodgepole pine), the hybrid panels performed similarly and showed that certain species and/or grade combinations could pass the qualification requirements for specific requirements. The knowledge gained by this screening study will allow further qualification testing of the passing combinations per PRG 320 - 2012. This also has the potential to supply the CLT manufacturing community with greater flexibility of manufacturing techniques and materials, as well as offer value to underutilized lumber...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} the evolution of damage and the residual stresses in Ti 6 Al 4 V-Al 3 Ti metal-intermetallic laminate (MIL) composites were carried out. Crack morphology and density of as-processed MIL composites were quantified, and quasi-static and dynamic compression tests were conducted on pure Al 3 Ti, as well as on MIL composites, with different volume fractions of Ti 6 Al 4 V (14 %, 20 % and 35 %) under different loading directions (perpendicular and <b>parallel</b> directions to <b>laminate</b> plane), to different strains (̃ 1 %, ̃ 2 %, ̃ 3 %), and at different strain rates (0. 0001 /s and 800 - 2000 /s). Crack densities and distributions were measured, and the differences in crack propagation and damage evolution in MIL composites under quasi-static (0. 0001 /s) and dynamic (800 - 2000 /s) deformation were observed anddiscussed. The fracture stresses under different testing conditions do not exhibit significant strain-rate sensitivity, which is indicative of the dominance of microcracking processes in determining strength. The crack density after dynamic deformation is higher than that after quasi-static deformation. This is attributed to the decreased time for crack interaction in high-strain rate deformation. The effect of crack density, quantified by a damage parameter, on elastic modulus were quantified and the results were compared with experimental results. The principal damage evolution mechanisms were identified. The elastic properties and anisotropy of the laminates were calculated and successfully compared with Resonant Ultrasonic Spectroscopy (RUS) measurements. The residual stress in MIL composites was evaluated from the differences in the thermal expansion coefficients of Ti 6 Al 4 V and Al 3 Ti. The residual stress evolution during cooling process was modeled by incorporating two stress release mechanisms: creep and crack propagation, and implemented through analytical modeling and finite element simulation. The obtained results indicate good agreements with the X-ray measurements. The fracture toughness of MIL composites was modeled as a combination of the crack initiation toughness and the stress intensity, and the calculation predicts the maximum fracture toughness occurs at 57 % volume fraction of Ti 6 Al 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} bend-twist {{coupling}} on typical commercial airplane wings are evaluated. An analytical {{formulation of the}} orthotropic box beam bending stiffness matrix is derived by combining Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and classical laminated plate theory. The out-of-plane displacement due to the twist of the cross section is modeled by a bilinear warping function. The analytical model is evaluated and validated against finite element analysis and experimental results. The model can accurately predict the twist and deformation of orthotropic box beams within 15 % of the benchmarking data and provides best results for beams of higher aspect ratios and with layup angles below 30 degrees. Airplane level aero-structural simulations are performed in ASWING using models of Boeing's 737 and 777. The composite wings are sized for a static load increase {{and a set of}} gusts as prescribed by the FAA. Using unbalanced laminates to generate the structural coupling leads to significant strength penalties if the loading is not <b>parallel</b> to the <b>laminate's</b> fiber directions. The optimal laminate angle for which the weight saving benefits of bend-twist coupling are maximized corresponds to the wing's principal stress direction. Beyond that angle, the wings will exhibit more coupling but the laminate strength penalties are too large to be overcomed by the benefits of bend-twist coupling. The addition of coupling to the wings leads to reductions in peak spanwise bending moments in the order of 20 % to 45 %. It is demonstrated that the mechanism behind this reduction involves increased wing tip twist which alleviates part of the outboard wing load. This ultimately results in weight savings in the order of 2 % to 4 %. The findings suggest that the benefits of bend-twist coupling are more important on heavier airplanes such as the 777 due to the effects of the cube-square law. by Sébastien Gauthier Perron.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 İstanbul ilinin batısında yer alan Sazlıbosna-Kayabaşı civarında ayrıntılı jeolojik incelemelerle bölgedeki formasyonların litolojik, stratigrafik ve yapısal özellikleri araştırılmıştır. Bu araştırma kapsamında 1 / 25000 ölçeğinde jeoloji haritası ve kesitleri hazırlanmıştır. Bölgede Alt Karbonifer yaşlı Trakya Formasyonu, Eosen yaşlı Hamamdere, Soğucak ve Ceylan Formasyonları ve Miyosen yaşlı Çukurçeşme Formasyonları yer almaktadır.

Lithological, stratigraphic and {{structural}} properties of formations {{in the area}} have been investigated in the Sazlibosna-Kayabasi vicinity placed west of İstanbul. A 1 / 25. 000 scale geological map and cross sections were prepared. Lower Carboniferious aged Trakya Formation, Eocene aged Hamamdere, Sogucak and Ceylan Formations, and Miocene aged Cukurcesme Formation were seen in the area. The Lower Carboniferous age Trakya Formation with a dominant lithology of sandstone and shale forms {{the base of the}} field. On the top of the Trakya Formation, the Upper-Middle Eocene aged Hamamdere, Sogucak and Ceylan Formation lie unconformably. Eocene formations show lateral and vertical transitions with each other. The Upper Miocene Cukurcesme Formation covers these lithologies. Alluvium sediments occasionally cover these formations. The field of investigation is dominated by <b>parallel</b> <b>laminated</b> shales which are, green-yellowish and green-brown-grey-bluish on color and thin-medium layered. Cleavage progression {{can be seen in the}} shales within the formation. The formation structure is very fractured, folded, and faulted. There are parallel and small scale, cross sediments within the sand stones and lower sediment layers are sharp and eroded. Ripples are observed on the upper surface of the sandstones were interpreted to be formed by turbuditial flows. The petrographic research that was carried out on the thin sections of the sansdstone samples within the formation revealed that the grains are scattered randomly. The grains can be mostly classified as angular – semi round and of metamorphic quartz origin. Fillate type, metamorphic originated rocks (usually mica fillate), muscovite, and occasional feldspar (usually plagioclase) are also observed. The Hamamdere Formation starts with mudstone depositions in a marine-shelf environment and builds up with thin intermediate layers of limestone carried upwards from the reef. The formation developed primarily in three facies, namely: backreef (biomicrit), (Folk, 1962) reef (biolithite), and forereef. These facies generally change lateral and horizontal to one another. Petyrographical observation reveals that the limestones are generally composed of coral and red algae colonies of variable size.  The age of the formation is determined as Bartonian, by Özcan and Less (2011), via the determination of fossils within. Sogucak Formation is formed by reef limestones. It is observed as thin layers through the shelf (Hamamdere Formation) and the deeper basin. The unit starts with carbonate enriched mudstones. This varying thickness stratigraphy changes first to thin and scarce, then to medium and common, yellowish grey colored carstic and transported coral reef substratas at the top of the formation.     The petrographic research that was carried out on the thin sections of the limestone samples within the unit revealed that they were made up of biomicritic limestones transported from the reef. Ceylan Formation is composed of marl and mudstone deposited in the deep marine-basin environment, intercalated with clastic limestones. The field can be observed above the Hamamdere formation at some levels as a result of trangression. Unconformity over Trace formation is also observed to the west of the Bent river and to the North - Northwest of the field. Microcrystalline carbonate mud has revealed benthic Foraminifera and Nummulit fossils upon the thin section samples of the limestones. Cukurcesme Formation was deposited fluvial environments and determined to be composed of sand and gravel with occasional clay layers within the field. These lithologies interact as eroded surface related lens structures. It contains unit wedged and galliot type cross strata. Cross stratigriphication scale diminishes towards the surface. Four different deformation periods and tensional directions were determined as a result of bedding, fold and fault analyses. First deformation period, which effected the Trakya Formation, is considered to be caused by the Hercynian Orogeny in the E-W direction after the Carboniferous; whereas the second deformation period is considered to be caused by the Cimmerian Orogeny in the N 20 W direction after the Triassic. Third deformation period that effected the Trakya Formation is possibly caused by the Alpine Orogeny in the N 15 E stress direction. The fourth deformation that is determined in the area of investigation was observed on the Eocene sediments. This deformation was not intensive as much as others and occured between Eosen and Upper Miocene in the N 45 W stress direction. Deformations are detected in the Carboniferious Trace formation within the field being observed in different periods; and the Eocine sediments reflect traces of these deformations. When the field data, map remarks, and streographic projection analysis are evaluated together, it is concluded that the first deformation that effected the rocks in the field are developed through EW direction compression (Figure 3. 1). While studying the structural geology of the Trace formation, Ketin and Guner (1989) have concluded that the EW direction compression was effected by Hercynian orogeny. As referenced by the current geographical location, the field is effected by a new deformation period dominated by N 20 W direction compression (Figure 3. 2). The drifting structures (normal faults) which are positioned perpendicular to this compression trend are the products of the same period (Figure 3. 7). Even though it is not seen in the field of observation, sedimentation is apparent within the Triassic period and that it is completed by the end of the Triassic period when the stratigrapy of the Istanbul zone is studied. This is a significant proof of the deformation of the Istanbul zone following the Triassic period. The N 20 W direction compression is considered to be related to the developing Kimmerian orogeny. The third deformation that effected the Trace formation within the boundries of the field of observation is the N 15 W direction compression (Figure 3. 3) and the North varying structures (Figures 3. 5 and 3. 6). Upper Cretaceous Volcano sedimentary rocks to the north of both sides of Istanbul and that the Paleozic rocks are pushed and overlapped towards these sediments to the north are well known (Altınlı, Kaya, Ketin and Akyüz).     It is observed that this structure has developed as a result of the same orogeny. It is also known that the Volcano sedimentery structure shows conformity up until the lower Eocene. That is why this orogeny is accepted as developed between lower and middle Eocene and attributed to the Alpine orogeny. Ketin and Guner (1989) indicated that these NW direction compressions are developed effected by the Alpine orogeny. The fourth and the last deformation period that effected the field of observation is characterized by the NW-SE direction compressions (Figure 3. 4) whose Middle-Upper Eocene sediments are slightly folded and the normal faulting that has developed perpendicular to it (Figure 3. 8). Since the Upper Miocene aged Çukurçeşme Formation does not show any deformation, this last deformation is interpreted to happen sometime between the Upper Eocene and the Upper Miocene according to the data in the field.
