60|$|The Labour Company had {{originally}} been a charitable organisation; its aim was to supply food, shelter, and work to all comers. This it was bound to do by the conditions of its incorporation, {{and it was also}} bound to supply food and shelter and medical attendance to all incapable of work who chose to demand its aid. In exchange these incapables paid labour notes, which they had to redeem upon recovery. They signed these labour notes with thumb-marks, which were photographed and indexed {{in such a way that}} this world-wide Labour Company could identify any one of its two or three hundred million clients at the cost of an hour's inquiry. The day's labour was defined as two spells in a treadmill used in generating electrical force, or its equivalent, and its due performance could be enforced by law. In practice the Labour Company found it advisable to add to its statutory obligations of food and shelter a few pence a day as an inducement to effort; and its enterprise had not only abolished <b>pauperisation</b> altogether, but supplied practically all but the very highest and most responsible labour throughout the world. Nearly a third of the population of the world were its serfs and debtors from the cradle to the grave.|$|E
60|$|Prominent if not {{paramount}} among world-changing inventions in {{the history}} of man is that series of contrivances in locomotion that began with the railway and ended for a century or more with the motor and the patent road. That these contrivances, together with the device of limited liability joint stock companies and the supersession of agricultural labourers by skilled men with ingenious machinery, would necessarily concentrate mankind in cities of unparallelled magnitude and work an entire revolution in human life, became, after the event, a thing so obvious that {{it is a matter of}} astonishment it was not more clearly anticipated. Yet that any steps should be taken to anticipate the miseries such a revolution might entail does not appear even to have been suggested; and the idea that the moral prohibitions and sanctions, the privileges and concessions, the conception of property and responsibility, of comfort and beauty, that had rendered the mainly agricultural states of the past prosperous and happy, would fail in the rising torrent of novel opportunities and novel stimulations, never seems to have entered the nineteenth-century mind. That a citizen, kindly and fair in his ordinary life, could as a shareholder become almost murderously greedy; that commercial methods that were reasonable and honourable on the old-fashioned countryside, should on an enlarged scale be deadly and overwhelming; that ancient charity was modern <b>pauperisation,</b> and ancient employment modern sweating; that, in fact, a revision and enlargement of the duties and rights of man had become urgently necessary, were things it could not entertain, nourished as it was on an archaic system of education and profoundly retrospective and legal in all its habits of thought. It was known that the accumulation of men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of pestilence; there was an energetic development of sanitation; but that the diseases of gambling and usury, of luxury and tyranny should become endemic, and produce horrible consequences was beyond the scope of nineteenth-century thought. And so, as if it were some inorganic process, practically unhindered by the creative will of man, the growth of the swarming unhappy cities that mark the twenty-first century accomplished itself.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced back}} from my moving cab. Some {{monetary}} transaction was passing {{between him and}} the loafer, but, short-sighted as I am, I found it difficult to decide which of those tall, pale, bearded figures was giving the other one a penny. And by some strange freak an awful vision shot up before me--of myself, and my distant relative, and Claud, and Richard, and Willie, and Alan, all suddenly relying on ourselves. I took out my handkerchief to mop my brow; but a thought struck me, and I put it back. Was it possible for me, and my distant relatives, and their distant relatives, and so on to infinity of those who be longed to a class provided by birth with a certain position, raised by Providence on to a platform made up of money inherited, of interest, of education fitting us for certain privileged pursuits, of friends similarly endowed, of substantial homes, and substantial relatives of some sort or other, on whom we could fall back--was it possible for any of us ever to be in the position of having to rely absolutely on ourselves? For several minutes I pondered that question; and slowly I came to the conclusion that, short of crime, or that unlikely event, marooning, it was not possible. Never, never--try as we might--could any single one of us be quite in the position of one of those whose approaching <b>pauperisation</b> my distant relative had so vehemently deplored. We were already pauperised. If we served our country, we were pensioned.... If we inherited land, it could not be taken from us. If we went into the Church, we were there for life, whether we were suitable or no. If we attempted the more hazardous occupations of the law, medicine, the arts, or business, there were always those homes, those relations, those friends of ours to fall back on, if we failed. No! We could never have to rely entirely on ourselves; we could never be pauperised more than we were already! And a light burst in on me. That explained why my distant relative felt so keenly. It bit him, for he saw, of course, how dreadful it would be for these poor people of the working classes when legislation had succeeded in placing them in the humiliating position in which we already were--the dreadful position of having something to depend on apart from our own exertions, some sort of security in our lives. I saw it now. It was his secret pride, gnawing at him all the time, that made him so rabid on the point. He was longing, doubtless, day and night, not to have had a father who had land, and had left a sister well enough off to keep him while he was waiting for his job. He must be feeling how horribly degrading was the position of Claud--inheriting that land; and of Richard, who, just because he had served in the Indian Civil Service, had got to live on a pension all the rest of his days; and of Willie, who was in danger at any moment, if his health--always delicate--gave out, of having a sinecure found for him by his college friends; and of Alan, whose educated charm had enabled him to marry an heiress and live by managing her estates. All, all sapped of go and foresight and perseverance by a cruel Providence! That was what he was really feeling, and concealing, be cause he was too well-bred to show his secret grief. And I felt suddenly quite warm toward him, now that I saw how he was suffering. I understood how bound he felt in honour to combat with all his force this attempt to place others in his own distressing situation. At the same time I was honest enough to confess to myself sitting there in the cab--that I did not personally share that pride of his, or feel that I was being rotted by my own position; I even felt some dim gratitude that if my powers gave out at any time, and I had not saved anything, I should still not be left destitute to face the prospect of a bleak and impoverished old age; and I could not help a weak pleasure in the thought that a certain relative security was being guaranteed to those people of the working classes who had never had it before. At the same moment I quite saw that to a prouder and stronger heart it must indeed be bitter to have to sit still under your own security, and even more bitter to have to watch that pauperising security coming closer and closer to others--for the generous soul is always more concerned for others than for himself. No doubt, I thought, if truth were known, my distant relative is consumed with longing to change places with that loafer who tried to open the door of my cab--for surely he must see, as I do, that that is just what he himself--having failed to stand the pressure of competition in his life--would be doing {{if it were not for}} the accident of his birth, which has so lamentably insured him against coming to that.|$|E

50|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 1929 riots, the Jewish Communists were split between those who sympathised with victims of the massacres, and others who, like the Arab Communists, considered the moment to be one of an Arab revolt against the British occupation, land seizure and the <b>pauperisation</b> of the peasantry. Based in Haifa, where he supervised the Party's local branch, Sidqi maintained regular contacts with Sheik Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, and defined the latter's death in 1935 as one of martyrdom. The Comintern had instructed the Palestine Communist Party to Arabise as early as 1924, without much success. One of the tasks the Party assigned to Sidqi was to undertake this Arabisation. The Palestine branch of the party was largely dominated by Jews with socialist tendencies and was suspected of having in its ranks militants with crypto-Zionist sympathies. In 1930, Sidqi was picked up by the British police in Jaffa and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, which he served in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Akka. His elder brother Ahmad, who had also studied with him at KUTV, was the chief witness for the prosecution. In Sidqi's recollection, Ahmad is described as fragile and being coerced into confessions by beatings. British reports cast him as a police informer, who provided extensive details of Comintern contacts and training. Towards the end of 1932, on his release from prison, where he made the acquaintance of Abu Jilda, the 'Dillinger of the desert,' the Party ordered him to contact Awni Abd al-Hadi in order to begin to coordinate with the Istiqlal Independence Party. As British surveillance intensified, the Communist Party smuggled him abroad in June 1933 to Paris where he assumed the editorship of the Comintern's Arabic-language journal, The Arab East. The French authorities subsequently arrested him and had him deported back to Palestine. He later dated his opposition to Nazism to this period - Hitler assumed power in 1933.|$|E

In Queensland, church missions were used by the state government as a cheap way of carrying out its policies for Aborigines. Even though missionaries acted with apparently complete authority on the Mission there was a complex interplay of politics involving Aborigines, missionaries, higher church officials, the national mission agency of the Church of England, and the state government.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an extensive inquiry into urban consumption of foodstuffs in Flanders between 1800 and 1860. The octroi tax, an indirect tax levied on various consumer items, formed the principal source. During the initial phase of Belgian industrialisation the inhabitants of the eight cities under study (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Courtrai, Ghent, Lokeren, Leuven and Mechelen) experienced a sharp decrease in the consumption of bread grains, meat, fish, beer, wine and gin. A number of other indicators suggest at the same time an accelerated widening of the gap between rich and poor. This process of impoverishment and <b>pauperisation,</b> which occurred in all cities (small or large, industrial or merchant centre), is explained as a result of Malthusian tensions. The rapid population growth, which started around 1750, generated the division of arable land and a sharp increase in land prices. The growing demand for food, stagnating agricultural output, and the trade and agricultural policy of the government led to {{a significant increase in the}} price level of foodstuffs.

30|$|At first glance, {{it appears}} that the East German {{initiative}} succeeded in making an impact in Bonn. There was intense engagement with the issue by both the government and the Bundestag (West German parliament). The SED scored a brief victory in terms of opinion leadership in the divided Germany. But in fact both the government and the opposition parties in the Bundestag were of one mind in their assessment of the proposals, resulting in a consensus on German policy that lasted until the Stalin Notes of spring 1952. Closer scrutiny shows that the SED leadership’s propaganda offensives did not succeed. Its aggressive strategy even forged a temporary solidarity between the West German government and opposition. Its attempt to split the SPD failed. Schumacher did not deviate from his firm line against the SED leadership, confident that in this point he had his party wholly behind him. Pieck, Grotewohl and Ulbricht now decided to concentrate on using public campaigns to influence the West German public and media. But the SED’s adaptive abilities were limited: there was no deviation either from its <b>pauperisation</b> strategy or its unshakeable belief that the West German people would topple Adenauer’s government.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} based on a panel sample of small farm {{households}} drawn from eight rural communities in Chile interviewed in 1968 and 1986. The incidence and intensity of poverty based on primary income increased over this period. However, after including earnings from the minimum employment programmes and public transfers, both the headcount ratio and squared poverty gap fell markedly between the two surveys. Mobility analysis showed more households moving out of than into poverty. Of those households who became impoverished, around half may have suffered a transitory decline in income in 1986. The other half experienced <b>pauperisation</b> as a result of investing in projects with negative rates of return, investing in the accumulation of human capital by their children, sustaining a large rise in the household's dependency ratio or suffering political discrimination in the labour market. Per capita income was positively related to schooling of the household head (in 1968), land ownership (in 1986) and living in the Central Valley (in both years).

40|$|The {{extensive}} <b>pauperisation</b> of {{the population}} in Serbia in the early 1990 s, caused by the economic crisis and the UN sanctions, had a tremendous impact on the people’s everyday diet. Many basic, locally produced foods became unavailable as food retailers severely limited their stock to save it from depreciation caused by hyperinflation. Following the introduction of the UN embargo, official trade came to a halt and imported foods disappeared from shops. Limited stock of basic foods, such as flour, sugar, cooking oil, white bread and milk, was supplied through state-owned food retailers, but these were rationed and difficult to obtain. However, food scarcity in early- 1990 s Serbia boosted the population’s resourcefulness and creativity on various levels, resulting in increased solidarity, support networks, barter, smuggling and a return to cooking recipes from the period of the Second World War. Survival during hyperinflation and the UN embargo was predicated on transmission of knowledge from the preindustrial period, suggesting that this was possible mainly because of the simultaneous coexistence of the pre-industrial and industrial periods in Yugoslavia.
