5|$|The wave-like {{nature of}} the {{electron}} allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as {{would be the case}} for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a <b>probability</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, after {{originally}} {{being placed}} as a radio operator, {{he was moved}} to research duties regarding sound ranging due to his specialist knowledge. In 1921, Born returned to Göttingen, arranging another chair for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck. Under Born, Göttingen {{became one of the}} world's foremost centres for physics. In 1925, Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. His influence extended far beyond his own research. Max Delbrück, Siegfried Flügge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf all received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at Göttingen, and his assistants included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Léon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{convolution}} of regularly varying <b>probability</b> <b>densities</b> is proved asymptotic {{to their}} sum, and hence is also regularly varying. Extensions to rapid variation, O-regular variation, {{and other types}} of asymptotic decay are also given. Regularly varying distribution functions have long been used in probability theory; see e. g. Feller [7, VIII. 8], Bingham, Goldie and Teugels [5, Ch. 8]. This note addresses some questions on regularly varying <b>probability</b> <b>densities</b> that seem— surprisingly—to have been overlooked. 1. Convolution of regularly varying densities Theorem 1. 1. If f and g are <b>probability</b> <b>densities</b> on R, both regularly varying at ∞, then their convolution has the property (1. 1) f ∗ g(x) → 1 (x → ∞), f(x) + g(x) and so is regularly varying (with index the maximum of the index of f and the index of g) ...|$|R
