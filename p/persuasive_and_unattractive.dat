40|$|Trade offs between life-history {{traits are}} well studied; however, most studies examine only two life-history traits at a time. For instance, in invertebrates, {{there is much}} {{evidence}} for the trade-off between reproduction and immunity but no studies that consider how investment in attractiveness might mediate this trade-off. In this study, I test two hypotheses. First, attractive male crickets (Gryllus texensis) have acquired larger resource pools than <b>unattractive</b> males <b>and</b> can invest more in all life-history traits. Attractive males should therefore have better body condition and show a less pronounced trade-off than unattractive males. Second, that attractive <b>and</b> <b>unattractive</b> males start with similar sized resource pools and allocate these resources differently. Since attractive males have invested some of their limited resources on sexual attractiveness they should have fewer resources left at their disposal than the <b>unattractive</b> males <b>and</b> should have worse body condition and show a more pronounced trade-off between reproduction <b>and</b> immunity than <b>unattractive</b> males. I tested these hypotheses by comparing body condition and testes size in attractive <b>and</b> <b>unattractive</b> males <b>and</b> injecting them with saline or LPS and examining their behavior. Attractive <b>and</b> <b>unattractive</b> males {{did not differ in}} their body condition or testes size. Attractive males increased their calling activity when immune-challenged. These results support the hypothesis that attractive <b>and</b> <b>unattractive</b> males have similar sized resource pools and attractive males invest in sexual attractiveness at the expense of immune-competence...|$|R

40|$|Findings on both {{attractiveness}} {{and memory}} for faces suggest {{that people should}} perceive more similarity among attractive than among unattractive faces. A multidimensional scaling approach {{was used to test}} this hypothesis in two studies. In Study 1, we derived a psychological face space from similarity ratings of attractive <b>and</b> <b>unattractive</b> Caucasian female faces. In Study 2, we derived a face space for attractive <b>and</b> <b>unattractive</b> male faces of Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Both studies confirm that attractive faces are indeed more tightly clustered than unattractive faces in people's psychological face spaces. These studies provide direct and original support for theoretical assumptions previously made in the face space and face memory literatures...|$|R

Three-types of same-age and sex dyads were formed on the basis of physical attractiveness (attractive, <b>unattractive,</b> <b>and</b> mixed-attractiveness) and wer. e observed in a semi-naturalistic play setting. A categorical observational system was used to record Positive social behaviors, aggressive oehaviors, activity and object-directed behaviors, and sex-stereotyped behaviors.
