In this scenario, an unknown electric field results in <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotation</b> of a laser beam propagating through the electro-optic crystal; through inclusion of polarisers to modulate the light intensity incident on a photodiode, a time-resolved electric field measurement can be reconstructed from the obtained voltage trace. As the signals obtained from the crystalline probes are optical, they are inherently resistant to electrical noise pickup, hence {{can be used for}} low-noise field measurement even in areas with high levels of electromagnetic noise {{in the vicinity of the}} probe. Furthermore, as the <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotation</b> due to the Pockels effect scales linearly with electric field, absolute field measurements are obtained, with no need for numerical integration to reconstruct electric fields, as is the case with conventional probes sensitive to the time-derivative of the electric field.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model of <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotation</b> in optically thin relativistic jets of blazars. The model {{is based on}} the development of helical (kink) mode of current-driven instability. A possible explanation is suggested for the observational connection between polarisation rotations and optical/gamma-ray flares in blazars, if the current-driven modes are triggered by secular increases of the total jet power. The importance of intrinsic depolarisation in limiting the amplitude of coherent polarisation rotations is demonstrated. The <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotation</b> amplitude is thus very sensitive to the viewing angle, which appears to be inconsistent with the observational estimates of viewing angles in blazars showing polarisation rotations. Overall, there are serious obstacles to explaining large-amplitude polarisation rotations in blazars in terms of current-driven kink modes.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotation</b> in a semiconductor optical amplifier is presented. Two techniques are used to investigate the gain and birefringence along the two eigenmodes of the component waveguide, with and without injection. The first investigation {{is based on the}} residual reflectivity of the facet mirrors. From the modulation depth of polarisation resolved spectra, the gain and the refractive indices of these modes are determined. The second investigation takes into account the variation of the eigenmode gain and refractive indices as a function of injected power over the range 83. 3 to 413 /spl mu/W. The results of these two experiments are compared, and it is determined that the refractive index and the single-pass gain along the horizontal axis of the waveguide are higher than those along the vertical axis. Both gain and refractive index differences increase as a function of injected power in the sample under test. Furthermore, it is concluded that <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotation</b> in this component is heavily influenced by the power dependence of the relative gain in the TE and TM modes and birefringence...|$|E

30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have addressed the}} depolarisation effect, providing statistical models for the channel depolarisation effects based on measurements, while only few have provided physical models explaining the actual source of depolarisation [4, 5]. An important step in understanding the depolarisation of MPCs was made in [4], where channel coefficients corresponding to orthogonal polarisation components of MPCs at the Rx are obtained from a three-dimensional geometry environment, accounting for Tx and Rx’s relative positions. The model assumes ideally conducting reflection surfaces, therefore, neglecting the depolarisation due to different attenuation of the perpendicular and parallel components. On the other hand, depolarisation due to realistic scattering is modelled in [5, 6]. In [7], the depolarisation effect due to antennas’ mismatch is analysed, where the derivation of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotation</b> angle for the LoS component {{is based on a}} three-dimensional geometry, for arbitrary orientations of Tx and Rx antennas.
