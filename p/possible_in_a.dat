5|$|In Belize, the {{tropical}} storm produced a wind gust of 71miles per hour (115km/h) in Caye Caulker, although stronger winds were <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> convective band to the north.

5|$|Off-Road Velociraptor Safari {{is a free}} {{downloadable}} vehicle combat {{video game}} released on January 29, 2008 by Flashbang Studios. The game requires the Unity plug-in to run, and can be downloaded from the developers' website. Players {{assume the role of}} a Velociraptor wearing a pith helmet and monocle, driving a jeep with a spiked flail attached, and must accrue as many points as <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-minute period by performing stunts and running down other Velociraptor. Each time a Velociraptor is struck, the game's speed is reduced to slow motion and its catapulted body becomes the focus of the in-game camera. The game operates a global highscore, after each game the player is given a rank for that day and a separate rank compared to the highest ever scores, along with a breakdown of the bonuses they were awarded during play.|$|E
5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed <b>possible.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> letter to his superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of}} the ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E

5|$|The Second Boer War had {{alerted the}} army to the dangers posed by fire zones that were covered by long-range, magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing and frontal attacks, there was a greater {{emphasis}} on advancing in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance as far as <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> firing line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances. Low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions {{of cold air}} are often required. A majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs, providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convection—thunderstorms—and heavy precipitation. The baroclinic properties of the Mediterranean region, with high temperature gradients, also provides necessary instability {{for the formation of}} tropical cyclones. Another factor, rising cool air, provides necessary moisture as well. Warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are mostly unnecessary, however, as most medicanes' energy is derived from warmer air temperatures. When these favorable circumstances coincide, the genesis of warm-core Mediterranean tropical cyclones, often from within existing cut-off cold-core lows, is <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conducive environment for formation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{covalent}} binary nitrides are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent {{silicon nitride}} (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E
