50|$|The typical neoclassical {{economic}} approach {{appeals to}} differences in human capital {{between women and men}} in estimating the factors that drive gender pay gaps around the world. The main hypothesis of the human capital theory is that women might earn lower wages because they have on average lower education, less training and less work experience. The neoclassical explanation usually relies on women's deliberate choices to acquire less education, invest less into their training and choose shorter working hours. The heterodox approach, mostly the feminist approach, by contrast, emphasizes the effect of gender socialization on skill acquisition and labor market discrimination. Despite these divergences, both schools agree that differences in human capital might be to some extent responsible for <b>pay</b> <b>differentials</b> between men and women.|$|E
50|$|The {{corporate}} {{cost advantage}} {{is nothing more}} sophisticated than access to cheaper workers, but because the pay of those workers goes farther in low-income countries than high, the relative <b>pay</b> <b>differentials</b> (inter-country) can be sustained for longer than {{would be the case}} otherwise. (This is another way of saying that the wage rate is based on average local productivity and that this is below the per capita productivity that factories selling tradable goods to international markets can achieve.) An equivalent cost benefit comes from non-traded goods that can be sourced locally (nearer the PPP-exchange rate than the nominal exchange rate in which receipts are paid). These act as a cheaper factor of production than is available to factories in richer countries.|$|E

5000|$|The case of {{transitional}} Russia {{does not}} support the human capital theory.

Contrary to the human capital hypothesis, women in Russia are actually at an advantage when it comes to human capital endowments and that the gross gender differential would have been even higher if women's human capital endowments were the same as men's. Other researchers who analyzed the pay gap in transition Russia reach similar conclusions.|$|E

Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (<b>pay</b> <b>differentials</b> under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with {{the overwhelming majority of}} salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children.

5000|$|Lower-wage, middle-wage, blue-collar, {{and high}} school educated workers {{are also more likely}} than high-wage, white-collar, and college-educated workers to be {{represented}} by unions.

The explanation that is given for this sector is that it is receiving more than the white collar sector with wage premiums. As well as with larger wages these workers have more purchasing power and their household incomes also increase, thus this wage premium not only affects their budget line but also their household budget line. Another study also backs up the emphasis of importance of wage union premiums among pay structures, especially with the wages of the lowest paid having an effect on <b>pay</b> <b>differentials</b> among gender, ethnicities, health, and different types of occupations. Thus although unions have become smaller in size and participation among the different worker sectors throughout time, those that have survived are more apt and able to negotiate and demand a higher wage premium from their firms and businesses. [...] Union wages also hold up better with increased international competition than those of non-union workers wages although this might mean less union employment in their sector.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPhysicians {{are the most}} difficult health care professional group to retain on active duty beyond their first obligated tour. A major problem is the disparity between military and civilian physician income. In fiscal year 1997, the Department of the Navy spent approximately $ 135 million in specialty pay on the Navy's 4, 000 active duty physicians. Health care reform has altered the demand for specialty and primary care physicians, accelerating the movement toward managed care. In this thesis, the authors quantify {{the role of the}} <b>pay</b> <b>differential</b> using a multivariate logistic model and conclude that the civilian- military <b>pay</b> <b>differential</b> has a significant influence on the probability that a physician remains in the Navy. Physician personnel and earnings data were gathered from the Defense Manpower Data Center, the American Association of Medical Colleges, and the Hay Group. Results indicate that recent shifts in demand have resulted in a greater sensitivity of retention to pay for primary care physicians. Specialty specific elasticities can be applied to analyze the expected impact of pay on retention of representative pay plans. Increases in pay to the civilian median level would substantially increase retention, but would be costly. This changing military environment in union with health care reform may be cause for the Navy to re-evaluate its physician pay structure and examine options for the amount, attached obligation, and recipients of medical special pays[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
