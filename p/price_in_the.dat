40|$|We analyze tacit {{collusion}} {{in an industry}} characterized by cyclical demand and long-run scale decisions; …rms face deterministic demand cycles and choose capacity levels prior to competing <b>in</b> <b>prices.</b> Our {{focus is on the}} nature of prices. We …nd that two types of price wars may exist. In one, collusion can involve periods of mixed strategy <b>price</b> wars. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> other, consistent with the Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) de…nition of price wars, we show that collusive prices can also become countercyclical. We also establish pricing patterns with respect to <b>the</b> relative <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> booms and recessions. If the marginal cost of capacity is high enough, holding current demand constant, <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boom will be generally lower than <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recession; this reverses the results of Haltiwanger and Harrington (1991). <b>In</b> contrast, if <b>the</b> marginal cost of capacity is low enough, then <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boom will be generally higher than <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recession. For costs in an intermediate range, numerical examples are calculated to show speci…c pricing patterns...|$|R

This would enable Morningstar, Inc. to move before its early 2009 lease expiration at its present location, 225 W. Wacker Drive. However, financial troubles have caused delays that have necessitated that Morningstar who had intended to occupy over half of the building seek lease proposals from other downtown office towers. Morningstar would suffer holdover penalties and other damages if it were unable to move before its lease expires.

5|$|In the 1996/1997 season, O'Sullivan won two ranking titles: the Asian Classic by {{narrowly}} defeating Brian Morgan 9–8 in the final, and the German Open by defeating Alain Robidoux 9–7 in the final. O'Sullivan again {{reached the}} final of the Charity Challenge, where he faced Stephen Hendry in a first-to-nine frame match. O'Sullivan trailed 2–8 before winning six frames in a row to level at 8–8, before Hendry won the deciding frame with a maximum break. At the Masters, O'Sullivan reached his third consecutive final, where he faced Steve Davis. After O'Sullivan took the first two frames with back-to-back century breaks of 116 and 113, the third frame was disrupted by a streaker, Lianne Croft. Davis later stated that the streaking incident affected O'Sullivan's concentration, allowing him back into the match and the afternoon session ended all-square at 4–4. O'Sullivan began the evening session by winning four frames in 49 minutes to take an 8–4 lead, but Davis fought back to win the next six frames and clinch the title with a 10–8 victory. On 21 April 1997, while playing Mick <b>Price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round of the World Championship, O'Sullivan made the fastest ever competitive maximum break in 5 minutes and 20 seconds, an average of one shot every 8.8 seconds. This was also O'Sullivan's first maximum break in professional competition. He exited the World Championship in the second round, losing 12–13 against Darren Morgan. O'Sullivan also won the non-ranking European League, defeating Hendry 10–8 in the final.|$|E
5|$|The brief {{peace in}} Europe allowed Napoleon {{to focus on}} the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of {{political}} autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling <b>price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.|$|E

40|$|Recent housing {{policies}} include measures for home purchase control and shanty town redevelopment. This study proposes sustainable <b>pricing,</b> <b>in</b> that <b>the</b> long-run equilibrium price {{is determined by}} the fundamentals of house prices. We argue that changes in CPI might have led to rapidly growing house prices and rather high price levels. We investigate the long-run or short-run impacts of new commodity housing completions, transacted square meters of commodity housing, and CPI for house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai. We adopt monthly data for the period of 2005 – 2010. We test for unit roots using both the ADF and PP techniques and structural breaks using both the Zivot-Andrews (Model B) and Perron (Model C) methods. Considering Cheung-Lai and Reinsel–Ahn finite-sample corrections, the results suggest a long-run equilibrium. Housing completions negatively impact house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run. A positive volume-price relationship is suggested. Housing sales affect house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run but not vice versa. Hence, the empirical evidence supports <b>the</b> search model. <b>In</b> addition, CPI is strongly exogenous with respect to the long-run relationship and thus is a long-term determinant of house prices. CPI also positively and drastically influences house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run. Therefore, a reduction in inflation rate could stabilize house prices, increasing the chances of sustainable <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This study {{attempts}} {{to establish the}} determinants of house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Namibia and their implications foraffordability of houses. The study made use of the ARDL time series model. The study established that <b>the</b> seven variables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study are cointegrated. The cointegration results enabled the specification and estimation of the ARDL Error Correction Model. The results established that gross domestic product and interest rates are important <b>in</b> explaining <b>the</b> variations <b>in</b> house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run. Ironically, money supply and inflation, which are closely linked, were found not to affect house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run. <b>In</b> addition, national domestic credit, which {{was used as a}} proxy for total mortgages advanced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country,wasnot a significant explanation of house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run. The study also established that the independent variables included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ARDL Error Correction Model collectively influence house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Namibia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run. The implication of this is that policies that are meant to influence house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long term can actually target any one or a combination of <b>the</b> variables included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study. The main recommendation emanating from the study is that the government should redouble its efforts to provide affordable land and housing to the lower and/or middle income households in Namibia...|$|R
