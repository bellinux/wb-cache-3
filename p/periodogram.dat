25|$|The Bayesian Kepler <b>periodogram</b> is a {{mathematical}} algorithm, {{used to detect}} single or multiple extrasolar planets from successive radial-velocity measurements of the star they are orbiting. It involves a Bayesian statistical analysis of the radial-velocity data, using a prior probability distribution over the space determined {{by one or more}} sets of Keplerian orbital parameters. This analysis may be implemented using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the {{discovery}} of a third planet (47 UMa d) was made by using the Bayesian Kepler <b>Periodogram.</b> Using this model of this planetary system it was determined that it is 100,000 {{times more likely to have}} three planets than two planets. This discovery was announced by Debra Fischer and P.C. Gregory. This [...] planet has an orbital period of 14,002 days or 38.33 years and a semi-major axis of 11.6 AU with a moderate eccentricity of 0.16. It would be the longest-period planet discovered by the radial velocity method, although longer-period planets had previously been discovered by direct imaging and pulsar timing.|$|E
2500|$|When the DFT is {{used for}} signal {{spectral}} analysis, the [...] sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal , where t represents time. [...] The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying Fourier transform of x(t) into a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called aliasing. [...] Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see Nyquist rate) {{is the key to}} minimizing that distortion. [...] Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called leakage, which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT. [...] Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect. [...] When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a spectrogram. [...] If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum (also called a <b>periodogram</b> in this context); two examples of such techniques are the Welch method and the Bartlett method; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called spectral estimation.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{technique}} to estimate the power spectrum of a single dimensional or a multidimensional signal as it cannot be calculated accurately. Given are samples of a wide sense stationary random process and its second order statistics (measurements).The estimates are obtained by applying a multidimensional Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the random signal. The estimation begins by calculating a <b>periodogram</b> which is obtained by squaring {{the magnitude of the}} multidimensional Fourier transform of the measurements ri(n). The spectral estimates obtained from the <b>periodogram</b> have a large variance in amplitude for consecutive <b>periodogram</b> samples or in wavenumber. This problem is resolved using techniques that constitute the classical estimation theory. They are as follows:1.Bartlett suggested a method that averages the spectral estimates to calculate the power spectrum. The measurements are divided into equally spaced segments in time and an average is taken. This gives a better estimate.2.Based on the wavenumber and index of the receiver/output we can partition the segments. This increases the spectral estimates and decreases the variances between consecutive segments.3.Welch suggested that we should divide the measurements using data window functions, calculate a <b>periodogram,</b> average them to get a spectral estimate and calculate the power spectrum using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This increases the computational speed.4.Smoothing window will help us smoothen the estimate by multiplying the <b>periodogram</b> with a smoothening spectrum. Wider the main lobe of the smoothening spectrum, smoother it becomes at the cost of frequency resolution.|$|E
