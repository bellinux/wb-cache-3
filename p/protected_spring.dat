40|$|Abstract: Diarrhea kills {{almost two}} million {{children}} annually. We study {{the impact of}} source water quality improvements achieved via spring protection on diarrhea prevalence and other outcomes in rural Kenya using a randomized evaluation, and use a discrete-choice framework to recovery households ’ valuations for improved water quality. Spring protection leads to large improvements in source water quality {{as measured by the}} fecal indicator bacteria E. coli, and there are moderate gains in home water quality. Reported child diarrhea incidence falls by one quarter. Households increase their use of protected springs, and these changes in water source allow us to derive revealed preference estimates of household willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water quality in a travel cost analysis. Under plausible assumptions about the value of water collector time, households are on average willing to pay US$ 4. 52 - 9. 05 annually for <b>protected</b> <b>spring</b> water. Assuming the principal benefit of improved water quality is better child health implies households would pay roughly US$ 0. 84 - 1. 68 to avoid a child diarrhea episode. Stated preference valuations for spring protection yield much higher WTP estimates, by a factor of three. Spring protection appears less cost effective than point-of-use water treatment i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Intestinal {{schistosomiasis}} and soil-transmitted helminthiasis are {{the major}} public health problems globally. Compared with any other age group, pre-school aged children and school-aged children are the most exposed. There are few studies showing the burden of intestinal schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminthiasis among pre-school aged children in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of schistosoma mansoni and soil-transmitted helminths and associated risk factors among preschool aged children of Chuahit and surrounding Kebeles, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross sectional study was conducted from February 2 to March 27 2015. Four hundred one preschool-aged children {{were included in the}} study by using two stage cluster sampling technique. Pretested structured questionnaire was employed to collected data via face-to-face interview technique. A single stool specimen was collected, and a portion of the sample was processed by Kato Katz method. Results Of the total children, 141 (35. 2  %) harbored one or more intestinal helminthes. Schistosoma mansoni was found in 45 (11. 2  %) of preschool age children. Ascaris lumbricoides was the predominant isolate, 77 (19. 2  %) followed by S. mansoni, 45 (11. 2  %). The least parasites isolated were Tania species, 2 (0. 5  %). After adjusting for other variables, being mothers who did not have the habit of washing hands after toilet (AOR[*]=[*] 7. 3, 95 %CI: 2. 97 – 17. 95), being occupationally housewife mothers (AOR[*]=[*] 8. 9, 95 %CI: 2. 27 – 25. 4), using <b>protected</b> <b>spring</b> water as a main family source of water (AOR[*]=[*] 3. 9, 95 %CI: 1. 2 – 12. 3) and child habit of not wearing shoe (AOR[*]=[*] 1. 91, 95 %CI: 1. 01 – 3. 64) were significantly associated with high prevalence of soil-transmitted helminthiasis among preschool-age children in Chuahit. Conclusion The current study showed that relatively higher level of STH and S. mansoni among preschool-aged children in Chuahit. This finding calls for a need of public health education, promotion of women education and provision of safe water to reduce the burden of soil-transmitted intestinal helminthiasis and schistosomiaisis...|$|E
40|$|Target 7 C of the Millennium Development Goals is to "halve, by 2015, the {{proportion}} of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation". However, the corresponding indicator measures the "proportion of population using an improved drinking water source".

This paper tests this hypothesis by comparing microbiological water quality in 346 different water sources across the District of Amuria in Uganda to each other and to defined standards, including the WHO drinking water standard of zero TTC per 100 ml, and the Ugandan national standard of 50 TTC per 100 ml. The water sources were grouped into six different categories: boreholes, <b>protected</b> <b>springs,</b> covered hand dug wells, open hand dug wells, open water and roofwater harvesting. The paper concludes that the ranking from the highest to the lowest microbiological quality water was: boreholes, <b>protected</b> <b>springs</b> and roofwater harvesting, open and covered hand dug wells, open water.

40|$|Abstract Background Intestinal {{parasitic}} infections {{represent a}} public health problem in Tajikistan, but epidemiological evidence is scarce. The present study aimed at assessing the extent of helminths and intestinal protozoa infections among children of 10 schools in four districts of Tajikistan, and to make recommendations for control. Methods A cross-sectional survey {{was carried out in}} early 2009. All children attending grades 2 and 3 (age: 7 - 11 years) from 10 randomly selected schools were invited to provide a stool sample and interviewed about sanitary situation and hygiene behaviour. A questionnaire pertaining to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics was addressed to the heads of households. On the spot, stool samples were subjected to duplicate Kato-Katz thick smear examination for helminth diagnosis. Additionally, 1 - 2 g of stool was fixed in sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin, transferred to a specialised laboratory in Europe and examined for helminths and intestinal protozoa. The composite results from both methods served as diagnostic 'gold' standard. Results Out of 623 registered children, 602 participated in our survey. The overall prevalence of infection with helminths and pathogenic intestinal protozoa was 32. 0 % and 47. 1 %, respectively. There was pronounced spatial heterogeneity. The most common helminth species was Hymenolepis nana (25. 8 %), whereas the prevalences of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Enterobius vermicularis were below 5 %. The prevalence of pathogenic intestinal protozoa, namely Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar was 26. 4 % and 25. 9 %, respectively. Almost half of the households draw drinking water from unimproved sources, such as irrigation canals, rivers and unprotected wells. Sanitary facilities were pit latrines, mostly private, and a few shared with neighbours. The use of public tap/standpipe as a source of drinking water emerged as a protective factor for G. intestinalis infection. <b>Protected</b> <b>spring</b> water reduced the risk of infection with E. histolytica/E. dispar and H. nana. Conclusions Our data obtained from the ecological 'lowland' areas in Tajikistan call for school-based deworming (recommended drugs: albendazole and metronidazole), combined with hygiene promotion and improved sanitation.

40|$|Access to a {{safe and}} {{affordable}} water supply of drinking is universally recognized as a basic human need for preset generation and precondition for the development and care of the next. But, many Tigray rural communities are suffering from lack of safe drinking water supply facilities specifically in Ahferom woreda. So, in order to realize the severity of shortage of safe water in the rural community and to find timely solutions {{it is important to}} take an assessment on the existing accessibility situation of the woreda. To do that, detail accessibility assessment has been taken in the issues of: Type of water technologies introduced to the woreda, growth trend of water schemes, spatial coverage of water schemes and ratio to the beneficiaries, accessibility coverage of safe water in relation to regional standard and the determinant factors for the non-functionality of water schemes were detail analyzed. To do that spatial and non-spatial data were collected from primary and secondary and analyzed using buffer, descriptive statistical tables and graphs and by visualizing the results in the map. As a result, the study identified 520 water schemes spatially distributed in the study area. Of the total, 396 (76. 2 %) and 124 (23. 8 %) were functional and non-functional water schemes respectively. The basic reasons for non-functionality of water schemes were: lack of ownership in the beneficiaries, weakness in maintenance and operation system, lack of spare part accesses and quality, poor financial capacity of the community to repair the breakdown water schemes and for different activities, Lack of training to the water committee and poor management system were accepted by the respondents as key problems to the non-functionality of water schemes in their district. And also the study found that, three types of potable water technologies: Hand dug well, Shallow well and protected springs were introduced to the study area. Hand dug well covered majority of the woreda, 62 percent followed by shallow well 26 percent and <b>protected</b> <b>spring</b> 11. 9 percent. In Ahferom woreda the spatial coverage of water schemes and the ratio to beneficiaries in 2013 was, one water scheme to 3. 25 square kilometers area and 2. 36 water schemes to 1000 beneficiaries. The actual average potable water per capita (L/d) of the beneficiaries in the rural area was 7. 6 l/d. Therefore, in contrast to the regional standard (15 L/d) the consumption level of the Woreda is below the regional standard. Also the distributions of water schemes have not equity to the existing population and to the given area. The accessibility coverage as a standard within 1. 5 km radius of travel distance and 15 l/day also analyzed and the result was found below the regional coverage which is only 39 %(65, 463) population were within 1. 5 km radius and 15 L/day access. The growth rate of water schemes was also analyzed and the result showed an increment from time to time but not in similar ranges throughout the four of the five years plan of the woreda. But, a steady increment has been observed in the first five year (1996 - 2000) with 91. 4 percent and second five years (2001 - 2005) with 13. 1 percent. In general the average growth rate of water schemes throughout the twenty years was 23. 7 percen...|$|E
