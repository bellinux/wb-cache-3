40|$|Abstract Background <b>Pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> <b>sodium</b> (pentosan) is a semi-synthetic drug {{manufactured}} from beech-wood hemicellulose by sulfate esterification of the xylopyranose hydroxyl groups.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction in patients with mild radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA) findings and OA-associated symptoms and signs. Methods Twenty patients were assessed clinically at Nagasaki University Hospital. The radiographic indications of OA were grade 1 to 3 using the Kellgren-Lawrence Grading System (K/L grade). Pentosan used in this study was manufactured and supplied in sterile injectable vials (100 mg/ml) by bene GmbH, Munich, Germany. The study was a single-center, open-label trial. Treatment consisted of 6 weekly subcutaneous injections (sc) of pentosan (2 mg/kg). Patients were clinically assessed at entry and 1 to 8, 11, 15, 24 & 52 weeks post treatment. The results were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Dunnett's method. Results Hydrarthroses were reduced quickly in all cases. The clinical assessments, i. e., knee flexion, pain while walking, pain after climbing up and down stairs, etc, were improved significantly and these clinical improvements continued for almost one year.

40|$|Background: Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} condition of urinary bladder characterized by pelvic pain, urinary frequency, urgency and nocturia {{in the absence}} of other obvious pathology. The public health significance of IC is related to its profound impact on patients' physical and emotional Quality of Life (QOL). The actual prevalence rate is unknown, and estimates range widely from 67 / 100, 000 to 575 / 100, 000. The majority of IC cases are females in the midlife age. This research addressed 1) the extent to which socio-demographic and clinical factors affect both symptom severity and QOL in IC patients, 2) the impact of symptom severity on QOL and 3) the efficacy of a combination of oral and intravesical <b>Pentosan</b> <b>Polysulfate</b> <b>Sodium</b> (PPS) as a new therapeutic option for IC. Methods: Forty one women with IC (age 20 - 71 years) were studied. Demographic, reproductive and clinical characteristics as well as QOL measures were evaluated in a cross-sectional design to assess the first two aims. To examine the third aim, participants were randomized to receive either a combination of oral plus intravesical PPS (treatment group) or oral PPS plus intravesical placebo (placebo group) in a clinical trial design. The main outcomes were the changes in subjective and objective measures of symptom severity, QOL and sexual functions. Results: Unmarried patients reported more severe symptoms compared to married patients. Being unemployed, obese, currently unmarried and never pregnant were associated with a decrement in at least one QOL domain. Moreover, symptom severity was associated with worse QOL on 4 domains, (p< 0. 05). On the other hand, the results from the clinical trial showed a greater significant reduction in symptom severity among the treatment group compared to the placebo group (46 % reduction vs. 24 % reduction respectively, p= 0. 04) and significant improvement in all QOL domains in the treatment group compared to the baseline (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Being unmarried and symptom severity are important factors that may disturb the QOL in IC patients. Moreover, the use of intravesical PPS simultaneously with oral PPS is an effective therapeutic option. The findings of this research will open a new option for IC patients to reduce their devastating symptoms and to improve their quality of life...|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of an abnormal, protease-resistant {{form of the}} protein PrP (PrP-res) in hosts with scrapie and related transmissible spongiform encephalopathies appears {{to be important in}} disease pathogenesis. To gain insight into the mechanism of PrP-res accumulation and the in vivo antiscrapie activity of certain polyanions, we have studied effects of sulfated glycans on PrP metabolism in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells. <b>Pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate,</b> like the amyloid-binding dye Congo red, potently inhibited the {{accumulation of}} PrP-res in these cells without apparent effects on the metabolism of the normal isoform. The inhibition was due primarily to prevention of new PrP-res accumulation rather than destabilization of preexisting PrP-res. PrP-res accumulation remained depressed in the cultures after removal of the inhibitors. The activities of other sulfated glycans, nonsulfated polyanions, dextran, and DEAE-dextran were compared with those of <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> and Congo red. This comparison provided evidence that the density of sulfation and molecular size are factors influencing anti-PrP-res activity of sulfated glycans. The relative potencies of these compounds corresponded well with their previously determined antiscrapie activities in vivo, suggesting that the prophylactic effects of sulfated polyanions may be due to inhibition of PrP-res accumulation. Since PrP-res amyloid is known to contain sulfated glycosaminoglycans, we reason that these inhibitors may competitively block an interaction between PrP and endogenous glycosaminoglycans that is essential for its accumulation in a protease-resistant, potentially amyloidogenic state...|$|R

40|$|Degradation of the {{cartilage}} proteoglycan aggrecan {{is a key}} early {{event in}} the development of osteoarthritis. Adamalysin with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) - 4 and ADAMTS- 5 are considered to be the main enzymes responsible for aggrecan breakdown, making them attractive drugs targets. Here we show that calcium <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> (CaPPS), a chemically sulfated xylanopyranose from beechwood, is a multifaceted exosite inhibitor of the aggrecanases and protects cartilage against aggrecan degradation. CaPPS interacts with the noncatalytic spacer domain of ADAMTS- 4 and the cysteine-rich domain of ADAMTS- 5, blocking activity against their natural substrate aggrecan with inhibitory concentration 50 values of 10 – 40 nM but only weakly inhibiting hydrolysis of a nonglycosylated recombinant protein substrate. In addition, CaPPS increased cartilage levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 3 (TIMP- 3), an endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS- 4 and - 5. This was due to the ability of CaPPS to block endocytosis of TIMP- 3 mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. CaPPS also increased the affinity of TIMP- 3 for ADAMTS- 4 and - 5 by more than 100 -fold, improving the efficacy of TIMP- 3 as an aggrecanase inhibitor. Studies with TIMP- 3 -null mouse cartilage indicated that CaPPS inhibition of aggrecan degradation is TIMP- 3 dependent.
