500|$|In September 2009, Smith's Bill C-268 {{successfully}} {{passed into}} law as An Act {{to amend the}} Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons {{under the age of}} eighteen years). The following September, she released [...] "Connecting the Dots", a national action <b>plan</b> <b>proposal</b> she had been working on for three years. [...] "Connecting the Dots" [...] sought [...] "to rescue and restore the victims and prosecute the offenders" [...] of human trafficking; Smith intended it to address both trafficking within Canada and international trafficking into the country. Smith announced several dozen specific recommendations for the proposed plan, one of which was to create an office to regularly evaluate national human trafficking opposition efforts and generate annual reports of their findings. Other recommendations were to increase funding for organizations that support human trafficking victims; to establish safe houses for victims in every Canadian province; to increase the use of Canada's human trafficking laws by educating police, judges, and lawyers about these relatively new laws; to initiate an extensive public relations campaign on the subject; and to have the federal government coordinate its activities with provincial governments, Aboriginal leaders, NGOs, law enforcement agencies, and human trafficking survivors.|$|E
500|$|Andy says of Jean-Ralphio, [...] "That Ralph Macchio guy's a total douche." [...] This is a {{reference}} to Ralph Macchio, an actor who appeared in the 1983 drama film The Outsiders, which also starred Rob Lowe. The line was improvised by actor Chris Pratt. In another scene, Ben tells Leslie the song he played after getting sworn in as an 18-year-old mayor was [...] "Whoomp! (There It Is)", a 1993 hip hop song by the duo Tag Team. The episode features several quotes from author and outdoorsman Jack London. Among them, which Leslie reads from her master <b>plan</b> <b>proposal,</b> is, [...] "You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club," [...] and [...] "So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot." [...] The original script included about one dozen different London quotes, but most were cut from the final draft. [...] Schur said he used London quotes because he believed the author was one both Leslie and Ron would admire. At {{one point in the}} episode, while discussing April's birthday, Leslie says, [...] "Damn the wheel of the world! Why must it continually turn over?" [...] to which Ron replied approvingly, [...] "Jack London." [...] The line was improvised by actor Nick Offerman.|$|E

2500|$|When the 1946 {{collective}} bargaining agreement expired in 1949, the United Steelworkers demanded that U.S. Steel provide each worker a pension. The Taft-Hartley Act's provisions permitting an injunction against a strike in an industry critical to national security were invoked {{an hour after the}} United Steelworkers walked off the job on July 7. Cyrus S. Ching, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, attempted to mediate a solution to the strike, but these talks broke down on July 11. President Truman proposed a 60-day cooling off period, but Fairless rejected it. Fairless proposed a fact-finding board (which had worked in the 1946 strike) and 60-day cooling off period on July 14, and President Truman accepted the plan the following day. As the fact-finding board conducted its hearings, in August Fairless publicly denounced what he called was [...] "dictatorial" [...] governmental regulation of wages and prices. On September 14, the fact-finding board issued its report, and said that U.S. Steel should provide pensions for its workers. [...] Fairless denounced the recommendation as a [...] "revolution" [...] against free enterprise, and rejected the fact-finding panel's report wholesale. Nonetheless, Fairless agreed to attend a mediation session in Washington, D.C., two days later. On September 17, Murray accused Fairless of imposing a double-standard on workers when he revealed that U.S. Steel was paying the pensions of its executives. Public opinion turned sharply against Fairless, and with the Taft-Hartley injunction due to expire Murray announced that the union would strike. Fairless opened bargaining with the union, and President Truman won a postponement of the strike until October 1 in order to allow negotiations to bear fruit. But the negotiations did not result in a contract, and the union struck on schedule. Murray announced on October 13 that the union would settle for a pension plan funded by a 29 cents per hour contribution from U.S. Steel. Fairless continued to resist the pension plan idea. But as layoffs spread throughout the steel industry, other steel companies began meeting with Ching to seek a resolution. [...] On October 18, Fairless quietly sent an aide to meet with Ching and to discuss the pension <b>plan</b> <b>proposal.</b> On October 31, Bethlehem Steel reached an agreement with the United Steelworkers that implemented a pension plan. [...] Under pressure to agree to the same terms, Fairless agreed to meet with Ching and Murray. But no agreement was forthcoming. [...] Jones & Laughlin Steel signed a pension plan deal with the union on November 7, and Youngstown Sheet & Tube agreed to the union's terms two days later. With all the other major steel companies resuming production, Fairless set aside his previous opposition to the pension plan and signed with the union on November 11.|$|E
