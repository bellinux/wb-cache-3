40|$|Lumen impregnation, {{unlike most}} other wood {{modification}} methods, is typically {{assessed by the}} pore-filling ratio (PFR) (i. e. the fraction of luminal porosity filled) rather than by weight percentage gain (WPG). During lumen impregnation, the impregnants act on the voids in the wood {{rather than on the}} solid mass (e. g. cell walls), but the PFR cannot be measured as conveniently as the WPG during processing. Here, it is demonstrated how the PFR can be calculated directly from the WPG if the bulk density of the untreated wood is known. The relationship between the WPG and bulk density was examined experimentally by applying a <b>pressured</b> <b>impregnation</b> on knot-free specimens from Sitka spruce with a liquid mixture of methacrylate monomers. Based on the validated model, it was possible to further study the effect of different process-related parameters, such as hydraulic <b>pressure,</b> on lumen <b>impregnation.</b> Skeletal density is another key parameter in this model, which directly reflects the amount of inaccessible pores and closed lumens, and can be independently determined by helium pycnometry. The permeability can be qualitatively evaluated by PFR as well as skeletal density. For instance, poor permeability of knotty wood, due to the large extractives content around knots, was reflected by a lower skeletal density and inefficient lumen impregnation (low PFR). Although this model was examined on a laboratory scale, it provides guidance on the precise effect of different parameters on lumen impregnation, thereby improving the fundamental understanding of and enabling better control over the modification of wood by impregnation...|$|R

Care is taken that the fibre forces on the are kept constant. Particular attention is given to possible dry contact between the fibre and the pin. The impregnation rate without a pin in the melt bath is very slow. The impregnation with a pin seems to have two regions: one with a melt film between the fibre and the pin, and the other is a region with ‘dry contact’. The initial rate increase with fibre tension as expected from the Darcy diffusion relationship. The amount of impregnation on a pin and the moment of ‘dry contact’ are for a particular fibre tension, dependent on the contact time of the fibre with thepin. In this process, the melt is dragged into the impregnation zone between the bundle and the pin by the running fibre. The melt layer taht is dragged into the impregnation zone is at least 20 μm thick.

By the current component separation it could be observed that minimum absorption current was required for the new GVPI insulation, which is an indication of superior quality of the insulation. The FDS test revealed important information of the dielectrics in the low frequency region. The results proved that minimum dielectric loss and minimum moisture absorption of all the three samples was for the GVPI insulation.

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} of the {{development}} of cost-effective thermoplastic composites for the aerospace industry is the process quality control. A complete, void free impregnation of the textile reinforcement by the thermoplastic resin is an important measure of the quality of composites. The introduction of new, more thermal resistant and tougher polymers is accompanied by a large number of trial and error cycli to optimise the production process, since the polymer grade strongly influences the processing conditions. Therefore, a study on the impregnation is performed. Thermoplastic manufacturing processes are often based on <b>pressure</b> driven, transverse <b>impregnation,</b> that can be described as a transient, non-isothermal flow of a non-Newtonian fluid, where a dual scale porosity is assumed for the reinforcement's internal geometry. Meso- and micro scale models of isothermal flow revealed a limited sensitivity to the process conditions at the bundle scale for high pressure processes such as plate pressing, with an increasing sensitivity for lower pressures as apply for autoclave processes. The process conditions are significant for the quality of impregnation at filament scale.

The electrochemical performances of sulfur-impregnated MC spheres (S-MC) derived from MC spheres with different pore volume and specific surface area but with the same sulfur loading ratio of 60 wt% (S-MC-X- 60) have been investigated in details. The S-MC- 4 - 60 composite cathode material displayed a high initial discharge capacity of 1388 mAhg and a good cycling stability of 857 mAhg after 100 cycles at 0. 2 C, and shows also excellent rate capability of 864 mAhg at 2 C. More importantly, the sulfur loading content in MC- 4 spheres can reach as high as 80 %, and it still can deliver a capacity of 569 mAhg after 100 cycles at 0. 2 C...|$|R
