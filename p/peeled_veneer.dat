40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} of wood properties affecting {{the quality of}} pulpwood and <b>peeled</b> <b>veneer</b> products is of general interest to tree breeders worldwide. If the wood properties of Eucalyptus nitens (H. Deane & Maiden) Maiden are under genetic control and the correlations between them are favourable, {{it may be possible}} to breed to simultaneously improve the plantation resource for both products. Acoustic wave velocity (AWV) measured in standing trees can predict wood stiffness, basic density, and kraft pulp yield (KPY) and therefore has the potential for use in tree breeding programs. From an E. nitens progeny trial in Tasmania, 540 trees were selected for rotary peeling. Of the wood properties assessed, there were significant differences among races in diameter, stem straightness, standing-tree, log, and billet AWV, and near infrared predicted cellulose content (CC). All traits displayed significant within-race genetic variation, and genetic correlations between AWV and veneer sheet modulus of elasticity (MOE) and between AWV and KPY and CC were strongly positive and highly significant. A similar relationship was found between veneer sheet MOE and KPY and between diameter at breast height and veneer sheet MOE. Basic density was genetically correlated with AWV and veneer sheet MOE. Results indicate that it should be possible for breeders to simultaneously improve properties in pulpwood and <b>peeled</b> <b>veneer</b> products and that AWV measured in the standing tree shows promise as a breeding selection criterion for both pulpwood and <b>peeled</b> <b>veneer</b> products...|$|E

40|$|The Australian {{hardwood}} plantation {{industry is}} challenged to identify profitable markets {{for the sale}} of its wood fibre. The majority of the hardwood plantations already established in Australia have been managed for the production of pulpwood; however, interest exists to identify more profitable and value-added markets. As a consequence of a predominately pulpwood-focused management regime, this plantation resource contains a range of qualities and performance. Identifying alternative processing strategies and products that suit young plantation-grown hardwoods have proved challenging, with low product recoveries and/or unmarketable products as the outcome of many studies. Simple spindleless lathe technology was used to process 918 billets from six commercially important Australian hardwood species. The study has demonstrated that the production of rotary <b>peeled</b> <b>veneer</b> is an effective method for converting plantation hardwood trees.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} quality of beech trees in the Karavanke {{mountain}} range. The data obtained for this study came from the permanent sample plots (here in after PSPs) of the studied area. The timber assortment structure of mature beech trees in stands was calculated {{on the basis of}} the estimated quality of a total of 7, 154 beech trees from 2, 088 plots and a small sample of harvested trees. The established timber assortment structure and the prices of timber ex forest road were then used to determine the value of beech wood. The study showed that the assortment structure was extremely unfavorable, with the share of trees with sliced and <b>peeled</b> <b>veneer</b> quality lower than 1 %, and the share of sawlogs totaling 1. 6 % of the net volume of analyzed trees. The quality is highest in beech trees measuring 50 – 55 cm in diameter at breast height. Quality values were higher in rejuvenation stands, and in stands with a comparatively high share of fir or a low share of conifers (spruce). The value drops with altitude and inclination and is higher on slope sites. Undamaged trees from higher social layers are also more valuable. Furthermore, beech timber value is positively affected by high harvesting intensity. In dense stands with a basal area exceeding 60 – 65 m 2 /ha, the value begins to decline. In order to improve the quality structure of beech stands, beech would have to be grown in beech-dominated clusters or stands, and thinned at the correct time. Particular attention needs to be paid to minimize the damage to dominant trees during harvesting. Quality assessment carried out within the forest inventory enables to assess the stand quality and value potential of forests at different spatial scale. The research has highlighted several possibilities to use quality data in connection with other parameters to enhance the efficiency of forest management...|$|E
40|$|Eucalyptus nitens {{is widely}} planted for pulpwood, and {{increasingly}} also for solid-wood timber products, in cool-temperate climates. This thesis investigated {{the potential of}} tree breeding to improve the properties of E. nitens grown for sawn boards, pulpwood and veneer products. Two studies were undertaken using a 14 - 15 year old E. nitens provenanceprogeny trial established in Tasmania and comprising 420 open-pollinated families collected from three native races. In the first study, methods were developed to track the identities of 560 pedigreed trees through harvesting, transportation and sawmill processing. A second study tracked 548 trees from the same trial through a rotary <b>peeled</b> <b>veneer</b> production system. Genetic parameters were estimated {{for a total of}} 20 tree, log and wood traits relevant to sawn board, veneer and pulpwood products. Genetic differences among races of E. nitens were significant in wood stiffness, growth, stem form and pulpwood traits, but not significant for log end-splitting and sawn board checking traits. The Southern race had the most favourable mean values. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits except log-taper, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens wood products could be improved through breeding. Strongly positive genetic correlations among diameter at breast height (DBH) at ages 4, 9 and 14 years and between DBH all ages and the traits survival, log volume and stem straightness, demonstrated that early-age selection for DBH would not compromise stem straightness and would improve product volume recovery. Log end-splitting was under moderate genetic control but there was a negative genetic correlation between end-splitting and solidwood product volume. Sawn board and veneer sheet stiffness was highly heritable, and strongly correlated with acoustic wave velocity (AWV), measured in standing trees and logs. Consistent with previous studies in E. nitens, wood basic density, near infra red-(NIR) predicted kraft pulp yield (KPY) and cellulose content (CC) had moderate-to-high heritabilities, although coefficients of additive genetic variation for these traits were small. Estimated genetic correlations between standing tree AWV and each of the traits veneer sheet modulus of elasticity (MOE), sawn-board MOE, KPY, CC and basic density were highly significant and strongly positive, suggesting that standing tree AWV could be adopted as an indirect non-destructive selection criterion for improving solid-wood product stiffness, while simultaneously improving wood chemical traits favoured by the pulpwood industry. Basic density had no significant genetic relationship with KPY and CC, although other studies have reported moderate to strong significant values. Surface and internal checking in sawn boards, which are important defects leading to value downgrade, were shown to be under moderate levels of additive genetic control. Internal checking in wedges cut from log disks and in wafer sections cross-cut from processed boards were strongly and positively genetically correlated. However, the genetic correlation of checking traits with density and AWV were generally not significant. Work presented in this thesis clearly demonstrates the potential for genetic improvement of E. nitens for pulpwood, sawn-boards and veneer production. A new method of tracking trees in processing studies has been established. Methods for assessing checking have been developed, and the utility of nondestructive AWV and NIR techniques has been confirmed for use in E. nitens breeding programs, aiming to simultaneously improve the quality and recovered volume of pulpwood and solid-wood products...|$|E

40|$|Although Germany has a {{share of}} 15 % of all plywood {{consumed}} in Europe, the German plywood producers have a market share as low as 1 % in Europe. On the other hand, German forests have a high stock of logs suitable {{for the production of}} plywood. In order to make plywood production in Germany attractive for investors again, improvements in manufacturing technology are necessary, and new technology should enable plywood producers to broaden their raw material basis [1]. Material yield using present technology is estimated to approximately 40 % due to losses caused by defects, peeling, drying, trimming etc. During the drying process and due to anisotropic shrinking of the veneer ribbon splits and wavy edges appear. Although several methods are used to achieve an "ironing effect", drying losses cannot be avoided. A possible solution could be processing veneer sheets in a hot press.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Past {{research}} and industrial sources have implied that preheating Douglas-fir Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco prior to <b>peeling</b> <b>veneer</b> was economically feasible. To test this, {{the effect of}} treatment temperature on veneer yield and thickness variation for three diameter classes of low grade Douglas-fir logs was studied and related {{to the cost of}} preheating. Test results showed that pre-heating No. 3 Douglas-fir Sawmill logs to a peel temperature range of 50 °F to 120 °F had no statistical effect on veneer value, total yield, grade yield, or veneer sheet width yield of 12, 18, and 24 inch diameter blocks. Block diameter, however was found to have a highly significant effect on veneer value expressed as the value of the percentage of the block volume recovered as marketable green veneer. Eighteen inch diameter blocks had the greatest total, grade, and full sheet recovery per unit volume of initial block diameter. Twenty-four inch diameter blocks had the least recovery and value while the 12 inch blocks were intermediate. Veneer thickness variation was found to be independent of peel temperature but significantly influenced by block diameter. The reason for the block diameter-veneer yield and thickness variation interaction was not investigated but was probably due to a complex interaction of wood properties at various diameters and the changing in the lathe setting angles due to the differences between diameters. A microprocessor based data acquisition system was built to record the output of a non-contact infrared temperature sensing instrument that measured the block temperature profile during peeling. The variability of temperature found within the blocks suggest the effects of heating would vary greatly for any one block. The microprocessor proved to be a valuable research tool that has many research uses but more importantly, many industrial process control applications. The equation describing unsteady state transfer for an infinitely long cylinder was solved via numerical analysis to theoretically estimate heating times for veneer blocks. The model may not be applicable to wood because the assumptions used to solve the problem, i. e. constant diffusivity and homogenity of the material, are violated when dealing with wood...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>peeled</b> <b>veneers</b> is {{generally}} quoted considering 3 main criteria: surface roughness, thickness variations and lathe checking. This last criterion impacts on mechanical properties of byproducts. It {{is well known}} that lathe checking occurrence can be reduced applying a good hygrothermal treatment of the round-wood before peeling coupled with optimised setting of pressure bar on the peeling lathe. It is also well known that thicker the veneer is and more difficult it is to reduce lathe checking and the other veneer defects. The tendency being to manufacture more eco-friendly engineering wood products using less glue, it is of interest to design such products with thicker layers and so less glue lines. But using ticker veneers should lead to a deterioration of final products mechanical properties. To quantify this effect, we have made 20 - 21 mm thick LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) boards of beech (Fagus sylvatica) with various compositions (veneers 1, 3 or 5 mm thick). In order to obtained veneers enclosing different grades, several bolts of a same tree have been peeled following 4 different modalities changing wood conditioning temperature (20 / 70 °C) and pressure bar settings (bar acting or not). The quality of all the veneers has been quantified before gluing. In total, 12 sets of boards have been produced for non destructive and destructive mechanical tests. The main results of these exploratory experiments are: - a quite low weakening of LVL mechanical properties when increasing veneer thickness. - the non destructive prediction of MOE by vibration seems not so good on LVL with thick veneers, {{especially in the case of}} edgewise loading, probably because of the presence of important lathe checks. - in some configuration, and especially when using thick veneers, it could be benefit to load LVL flatwise rather than edgewise. - for the measurement of shear strength on LVL, the 5 -point bending test increases its efficiency when increasing veneer thickness.

Peeler logs were steamed, <b>peeled</b> into <b>veneer</b> sheets (with dry target sizes of 2.59  m in length, 1.32  m in width, and 3.8  mm in thickness), dried (using schedules determined by the cooperating mill in accordance with their normal practices), weighed, and measured. Veneer sheet density was derived as the quotient of mass and volume, and all sheets were non-destructively tested for MOE using a Metriguard 2600 ™ veneer tester (Metriguard Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). More detail of the procedure for determining veneer MOE is provided by Lowell et al. (2014). Following data consolidation, a total of 1639 boards and 4645 veneer sheets were available to this study.|$|R
