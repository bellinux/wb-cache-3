5|$|Among major {{structural}} elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse <b>paragraph,</b> and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos.

These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called poetic forms or poetic modes (see following section), as in the sonnet or haiku.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-paragraph resolution. The first <b>paragraph</b> {{declared}} that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second <b>paragraph</b> demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final <b>paragraph</b> demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands. Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E

50|$|Radan's {{reason for}} this opinion is that in relying on <b>paragraphs</b> 2 and 4 of article 5, the Badinter Commission ignored the {{provisions}} of <b>paragraphs</b> 1 and 3. In doing so it was justifying {{the division of the}} SFRY and the alteration of its international borders in violation of <b>paragraphs</b> 1 and 3. Radan argues that the territorial integrity of republics and the sanctity of their borders referred to in <b>paragraphs</b> 2 and 4 of article 5 only applied {{in the context of the}} Yugoslav state whose own territorial integrity and borders remained in place. According to Radan, a republic seeking to violate the provisions of <b>paragraphs</b> 1 and 3 of article 5 could hardly reap the guarantees contained within <b>paragraphs</b> 2 and 4. Consequently, he argues that article 5 provides no support for the application of the Badinter Borders Principle to the fragmentation of the SFRY.|$|R
