Jacobs could only work on the project <b>part</b> <b>time,</b> and so in March 1942 Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him. In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained. With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most of his previous Adventures of Tintin into 62-page colour versions.|$|E

In a one-off Test against New Zealand at the WACA Ground in Perth, he hit his only Test double century, 200 (from 361 balls) out of 361 runs added {{while he was at}} the wicket. However, three of his next five Test innings were ducks, beginning a run of 12 consecutive innings when he failed to make a half-century. Boon broke this run with an important innings of 94 not out in the second Ashes Test in 1990–91. He guided Australia to a victory target of 197 runs after the team began at a shaky 2/10. Dismissed for 97 by the <b>part</b> <b>time</b> bowling of Graham Gooch in the following Test, Boon made amends with 121 in the second innings at Adelaide. He was the leading batsman of the series, scoring 530 at an average of 75.71.|$|E

500|$|Stephen James Walker, {{a writer}} of {{reference}} works on Doctor Who, gave an unfavourable review to Rose's return in [...] "Turn Left" [...] in his [...] "unauthorised guide to Doctor Whos fourth series," [...] Monsters Within. He thought that Billie Piper was [...] "distinctly below par", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised {{her role in the}} episode, stating it had been [...] "far less well worked out" [...] than Donna's. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy also noted a change in Piper's enunciation; he compared her accent to [...] " [...] her mouth numbed with local anaesthetic". In Rawson-Jones' review of the series finalé he notes that whilst having the Doctor and Rose 'cop off' would be divisive with the shows audience, [...] "Davies wisely managed to please both parties" [...] by pairing her off with a human Doctor instead. However, IGN's Travis Fickett reacted unfavourably towards Rose's return and her pairing with the part human Doctor. He thought that it undermined her [...] "perfect send off" [...] in [...] "Doomsday" [...] as she was on the sidelines for much of [...] "Journey's End", and her ending up with the part human, <b>part</b> <b>Time</b> Lord Doctor [...] "feels like an insult to the character". Io9's Charlie Jane Anders also reacted unfavorably to Rose returning and wrote [...] "it was pretty clear that she was only there so she could get her pet faux-Doctor at the end." [...] Reviewers generally reacted positively to Piper's 2013 appearance in 50th anniversary episode [...] "The Day of the Doctor". Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph called her performance as the [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] Rose [...] "transfixing". Neela Debnath of The Independent praised the chemistry between Hurt and Piper and compared Piper's performance to Suranne Jones' portrayal of the TARDIS in [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly eccentric", [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "off-the-wall". Daniel Martin of the Guardian praised Steven Moffat's decision not to extend Rose Tyler's story or re-unite her with the Tenth Doctor. He called Piper [...] "a true and unending legend of Doctor Who" [...] and stated that [...] "her wise rendition of the Bad Wolf avatar made a passable stab at the stealing of the show".|$|E
