The Micom machine countered the problem of obsolescence by avoiding the limitations of a hard-wired system of program storage. The Micom 2000 utilized RAM, which was mass-produced and totally programmable. The Micom 2000 {{was said to be}} a year ahead of its time when it was introduced into a marketplace that represented some <b>pretty</b> <b>serious</b> competition such as IBM, Xerox and Wang Laboratories.|$|E

In late March 2008, she checked out of the treatment center and began filming the mystery drama All Good Things. In May 2008, she went public with this information in order to dispel rumors of drug and alcohol abuse, stating that [...] "Now that I’m feeling stronger, I was prepared to say something … Depression is <b>pretty</b> <b>serious</b> and should not be gossiped about".|$|E
500|$|Major-thirds tuning {{facilitates}} playing chords with closed voicings. In contrast, standard tuning {{would require}} more hand-stretching to play closed-voice seventh chords, and so standard tuning uses open voicings for many four-note chords, for example of dominantseventh chords. By definition, a dominant seventh is a four-note chord combining a major chord and a minor seventh. For example, the C7 seventh chord combines the C-major chord {C,E,G} with B. In standard tuning, extending the root-bass C-major chord (C,E,G) to a C7 chord (C,E,G,B) would span six frets (3–8); such seventh chords [...] "contain some <b>pretty</b> <b>serious</b> stretches {{in the left}} hand". An illustration shows this C7 voicing (C,E,G,B), which would be extremely difficult to play in standard tuning, besides the openly voiced C7-chord that is conventional in standard tuning: This open-position C7 chord is termed a second-inversion C7 drop2 chord (C,G,B,E), because the second-highest note (C) in the second-inversion C7 chord (G,B,C,E) is lowered by an octave.|$|E

[...] A review in The Washington Post of the 2007 Washington, D.C. production was more critical. Peter Marks wrote that [...] "..aside from a weird sci-fi back story involving Prince Xenu, a figure from Scientology lore, the incidents the playwright relates that shape Hubbard's belief system unfold choppily and dryly." [...] The production received a positive review in by Bob Anthony in AllArtsReview4U, who wrote [...] "This is so charming that it rates a [...] "must see" [...] status. [...] The show should be extended at another venue." [...] Manya Brachear reviewed the 2008 Chicago production for the Chicago Tribune, and highlighted the play's [...] "trilling tunes", including [...] "Hey! It's a Happy Day!"

The two Chicago productions in 2009 also received favorable reviews in the Chicago Tribune; the reviewer noted, [...] "this show manages to simultaneously skewer Scientology and showcase the young performers in an upbeat, fun way." ...|$|E
500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a <b>pretty</b> <b>serious</b> complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
500|$|NHL President Clarence Campbell was at {{the game}} and was seated near where the {{incident}} occurred. After receiving {{a report from the}} game's officials, Campbell called a news conference and said the injury was not Kennedy's fault. Campbell also publicly rebuked Ivan for his accusation, saying, [...] "That is a <b>pretty</b> <b>serious</b> business and a very vicious charge." [...] It was also argued that since Kennedy was a right-handed shot, the butt-end of his stick was towards the boards and away from Howe. Sportswriter Ted Reeve of the Toronto Telegram quipped, [...] "How would a right-handed stickhandler going down the left boards give anyone a butt end? Unless he wanted to lift the snappers out of someone in the rail seats." [...] Howe was lost from the playoffs, but the incident influenced the momentum of the series. Detroit won the second game of the series 3–1, a violent and fight-filled affair which included a stick-swinging incident between the Leafs' Jimmy Thomson and Detroit's Leo Reise and a fight between Kennedy and Ted Lindsay. After the game, Campbell threatened the players with fines if the violent play continued, and both teams continued to play hockey {{for the remainder of the}} series. However, Detroit was now determined to [...] "win the series for Gordie" [...] and defeated the Leafs in seven strongly-contested games to eliminate them from the playoffs, going on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E

She must have been eight years old; so in the natural (Indian) order of things she would be a bride in three or four years from now, and then this free contact with the sun and the air and the other belongings of out-door nature and comradeship with visiting male folk would end, and she would shut herself up in the zenana for life, like her mother, and by inherited habit of mind would be happy in that seclusion and not look upon it as an irksome restraint and a weary captivity.|$|R

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, John Wendell was disappointed by Curtis, finding much of Mayfield's music more rhythmic than melodic, [...] "fragmentary, garbled and frustrating to listen to"; {{he called the}} lyrics haphazardly written and mealy-mouthed.

[...] "Sure, it's all subjective, but I can't myself see that what we need is 'Respect for the steeple/power to the people.'" [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was also somewhat unmoved by the album's [...] "essentially middle-class guides to black pride" [...] but qualified his judgment as reflecting a certain degree of cultural relativism on his part, making note of African-American audiences having embraced the record.|$|E
