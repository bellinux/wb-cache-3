40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{report the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> among prisoners and determine the independent predictors for having <b>penile</b> <b>implants.</b> Questions on <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> {{were included in the}} Sexual Health and Attitudes of Australian Prisoners (SHAAP) survey following concerns raised by prison health staff that increasing numbers of prisoners reported having <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> while in prison. METHODS: Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) of a random sample of prisoners was carried out in 41 prisons in New South Wales and Queensland (Australia). Men were asked, "Have you ever inserted or implanted an object under the skin of your penis?" If they responded Yes: "Have you ever done so while you were in prison?" Univariate logistic regression and logistic regression were used to determine the factors associated with <b>penile</b> <b>implants.</b> RESULTS: A total of 2, 018 male prisoners were surveyed, aged between 18 and 65 years, and 118 (5. 8 %) reported that they had inserted or implanted an object under the skin of their penis. Of these men, 87 (73 %) had this done while they were in prison. In the multivariate analysis, a younger age, birth in an Asian country, and prior incarceration were all significantly associated with <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> (p< 0. 001). Men with <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> {{were also more likely to}} report being paid for sex (p< 0. 001), to have had body piercings (p< 0. 001) or tattoos in prison (p< 0. 001), and to have taken non-prescription drugs while in prison (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Penile</b> <b>implants</b> appear to be fairly common among prisoners and are associated with risky sexual and drug use practices. As most of these <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> are inserted in prison, these men are at risk of blood borne viruses and wound infection. Harm reduction and infection control strategies need to be developed to address this potential risk...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{introduction}} of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and intracavernosal vasoactive agents, <b>penile</b> prosthesis <b>implant</b> remains a relevant and desired option {{with sales of}} penile prostheses continue to stay high, as many men became refractory to medical therapy and/or seeking a more effective and permanent therapy. There {{are two types of}} penile prosthesis implants: inflatable and non-inflatable types, and the inflatable <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> can be subdivided into single-, two- and three-piece devices. Non-inflatable penile prosthesis (non-IPP) may be referred to as semi-rigid rod or malleable prosthesis. IPP is considered a superior option to malleable prosthesis as it produces penile rigidity and flaccidity that closely replicates a normal penile erectile function. Since the {{introduction of}} IPP by Scott in 1973, surgical landscape for penile prosthesis implantation has changed dramatically.

50|$|The {{inflatable}} <b>penile</b> <b>implant,</b> {{more recently}} developed, uses a pump system. Saline {{from a small}} reservoir, implanted in the lower abdomen, is moved by manual pressure on a small pump, located, with the relief valve, in the scrotum. The saline is pumped into bilateral chambers implanted in the shaft of the penis, which replace the non- or minimally-functioning erectile tissue. This produces an erection. The glans of the penis, however, remains unaffected. 90-95% of inflatable prostheses produce erections suitable for sexual intercourse. In the United States, the inflateable prothesis has largely replaced (in new cases) the malleable one.|$|E
50|$|A <b>penile</b> <b>implant</b> is one {{treatment}} option {{available to}} individuals {{who are unable to}} achieve or maintain an erection adequate for successful sexual intercourse or penetration. Its primary use is for men with erectile dysfunction from vascular conditions (cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes), congenital anomalies, iatrogenic, accidental penile or pelvic trauma, Peyronie's disease, or as a result of prostate cancer treatments. This implant is normally considered when less invasive medical treatments such as oral medications (PDE5 inhibitors: Viagra, Levitra, Cialis), penile injections, or vacuum erection devices are unsuccessful, provide an unsatisfactory result, or are contraindicated. For example, many drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction are unsuitable for patients with heart problems and may interfere with other medications.|$|E
50|$|Unlike metoidioplasty, phalloplasty {{requires}} an implanted erectile prosthesis {{to achieve an}} erection. This is usually done in a separate surgery to allow time for healing. There are several types of erectile prostheses, including malleable rod-like medical devices that allow the neo-penis to either stand up or hang down. <b>Penile</b> <b>implants</b> require a neophallus of appropriate length and volume {{in order to be}} a safe option. The long term success rates of implants in constructed penises are less than the success rates of reconstruction in men born with penises. Good sensation in the reconstructed penis can help reduce the risk of the implant eventually eroding through the skin.|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{erection}} device helps draw {{blood into}} the penis by applying negative pressure. This type of device is {{sometimes referred to}} as penis pump and may be used just prior to sexual intercourse. Several types of FDA approved vacuum therapy devices are available with a doctor's prescription. When pharmacological methods fail, a purpose-designed external vacuum pump can be used to attain erection, with a separate compression ring fitted to the penis to maintain it. These pumps should be distinguished from other penis pumps (supplied without compression rings) which, rather than being used for temporary treatment of impotence, are claimed to increase penis length if used frequently, or vibrate as an aid to masturbation. More drastically, inflatable or rigid <b>penile</b> <b>implants</b> may be fitted surgically.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{selected}} {{findings of a}} qualitative social network study investigating STI/HIV-related risk among migrant fishermen based at one of Indonesia’s major fishing ports in Bali. Their activities between fishing trips include drinking parties, watching pornographic videos, and vi-siting brothels, while condom use is rare. While on board, they plan and anticipate these activi-ties and many insert <b>penile</b> <b>implants.</b> These fishermen run a high personal risk of contracting STI/HIV, and, with their circular migration patterns among Indonesian and foreign ports such as Thailand and South Africa, and with visits back to their rural hometowns and wives or girlfriends in Java, {{there is a serious}} risk of disease transmission to the general population.

50|$|If reattachment is not {{an option}} (such as the penis not being {{reattached}} long after 24 hours), doctors can reconstruct a penis from muscle and skin grafted from another part of the body like the forearm. However, a <b>penile</b> <b>implant</b> is needed for an erection to be possible, the reconstructed penis would look strange and would either not be able to ejaculate, or ejaculate with less force. The patients are often dissatisfied with the reconstructed penis. Standing during urination is an advantage offered by a reconstructed penis. If penis reconstruction is not done, the patient will have to squat in order to urinate since doctors reroute the entrance of the urethra to below the scrotum.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The Italian Society of Andrology, i. e. “Società Italiana di Andrologia” (S. I. A.), {{launched}} on December 2014 a prospective, multicenter, monitored and internal review board approved Registry for penile implants, the “INSIST-ED” (Italian Nationwide Systematic Inventarisation of Surgical Treatment for ED) Registry. Purpose {{of this first}} report is to present a baseline data analysis {{of the characteristics of}} <b>penile</b> <b>implant</b> surgery in Italy. Material and methods: The INSIST-ED Registry is open to all surgeons implanting penile prostheses (all brands, all models) in Italy, providing anonymous patient, device, surgical procedure, outcome, follow-up data, for both first and revision surgeries. A Registry project Board overviews all the steps of the project, and a Registry Monitor interacts with the Registry implanting surgeons. Results: As by April 8, 2016, 31 implanting surgeons actively joined the Registry, entering 367 surgical procedures in its database, that comprise: 310 first implants, 43 prosthesis substitutions, 14 device explants without substitution. Implanted devices account for: 288 three-component devices (81, 3 %), 20 two-component devices (5, 4 %), 45 non-hydraulic devices (12, 3 %). Leading primary ED etiologies in first implant surgeries resulted: former radical pelvic surgery in 111 cases (35, 8 %), Peyronie’s disease in 66 cases (21, 3 %), diabetes in 39 cases (12, 6 %). Two intraoperative complications have been recorded. Main reasons for 57 revision surgeries were: device failure (52, 6 %), erosion (19, 3 %), infection (12, 3 %), patient dissatisfaction (10, 5 %). Surgical settings for patients undergoing a first <b>penile</b> <b>implant</b> were: public hospitals in 251 cases (81 %), private environments in 59 cases (19 %). Conclusions: The INSIST-ED Registry represents the first European experience of penile prosthesis Registry. This baseline data analysis shows that: three-pieces inflatable prosthesis is the most implanted device, leading etiology of erectile dysfunction (ED) in patient receiving a prosthesis is former radical pelvic surgery, primary reason for revision surgery is device failure, primary settings for first <b>penile</b> <b>implant</b> surgery are public hospitals.

40|$|Abstract Background In a {{group of}} 22 {{patients}} with erectile dysfunction, vasculogenic, neurogenic, endocrinologic or psychogenic investigations failed to find a cause for their erectile dysfunction. The electro-cavernosograms of these patients recorded a diminished activity. We investigated the hypothesis that diminished corpus cavernosum electromyography activity {{was the cause of}} erectile dysfunction in these patients. Methods The study comprised the above mentioned 22 patients (study group, 43. 8 ± 5. 9 SD years) and 15 healthy volunteers (control group, 41. 8 ± 5. 1 SD years). The electro-cavernosograms were recorded in the flaccid, erectile and detumescent phases by 2 electrodes inserted into the corpus cavernosum. Results The electro-cavernosogram of the healthy volunteers registered in the flaccid phase regular slow waves and random action potentials. The wave variables declined significantly in the erectile phase (p Conclusion A novel concept of the cause of erectile dysfunction was presented. Corpora cavernosa showed degenerative changes on histopathologic examination and exhibited diminished electromyography activity. They did not respond to sildenafil administration or intracavernosal papaverine injection. <b>Penile</b> <b>implants</b> were the only treatment.
