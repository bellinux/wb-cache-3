To deliver quality <b>products,</b> <b>process</b> <b>owners</b> must determine the needs, requirements, {{and expectations of}} cus-tomers. They must then ensure the process outputs meet customer needs. In the context of quality, continuous improvement means a systematic approach to closing the gap between customer expec-tations and the characteristics of process outputs.

50|$|Scrum advocates {{that the}} role of <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> be assigned. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> is {{responsible}} for maximizing the value of the <b>product.</b> The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.|$|R
50|$|Empathy {{is a key}} {{attribute}} for a <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to haveâ€”the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> converses with different stakeholders, who {{have a variety of}} backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile <b>product</b> <b>owners.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> can cancel {{a sprint}} if necessary. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> may {{do so with}} input from the team, scrum master or {{management}}. For instance, management may wish the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate {{the value of the}} sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, {{the next step is to}} conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.|$|R
5000|$|Direct {{shipment}} is {{a method}} of delivering goods from the supplier or the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to the customer directly. In most cases, the customer orders the goods from the <b>product</b> <b>owner.</b> This delivery scheme reduces transportation and storage costs, but requires additional planning and administration.|$|R
50|$|The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> {{represents}} the <b>product's</b> stakeholders {{and the voice}} of the customer; and is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> defines the <b>product</b> in customer-centric terms (typically user stories), adds them to the product backlog, and prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies. Scrum teams should have one <b>product</b> <b>owner.</b> This role should not be combined with that of the scrum master. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> should focus on the business side of product development and spend the majority of their time liaising with stakeholders and should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution. This role is equivalent to the customer representative role in some other agile frameworks such as extreme programming (XP).|$|R

Specifically, tailoring of the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> role is discussed. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> identifies and prioritizes customer requirements. But in globalized projects, the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> must reconcile large numbers competing business interests and generate prioritized requirements for many development teams. The study comprises 8 international companies in London, Bangalore and Delhi. Interviews with 46 practitioners were conducted between February 2010 and May 2012. A grounded theory approach {{was used to}} identify that <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> teams comprise nine roles: Groom, Prioritizer, Release Master, Technical Architect, Governor, Communicator, Traveler, Intermediary and Risk Assessor. These <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> roles arbitrate between conflicting customer requirements, approve release schedules, make architectural design decisions, provide technical governance and disseminate information across teams. Understanding these roles will help agile coaches guide large scale agile teams.

These estimates help the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to gauge the timeline and may influence ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> may schedule earlier delivery of {{the one with the}} lower development effort (because the return on investment is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).|$|R

Project failures can attract adverse publicity and damage corporate reputations. Agile methods have been advocated to reduce project risks, improving both productivity and product quality. This article uses practitioner descriptions of agile method tailoring to explore large scale offshore enterprise development programmes {{with a focus on}} <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> role tailoring, where the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> identifes and prioritises customer requirements. In globalised projects, the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> must reconcile competing business interests, whilst generating and then prioritising large numbers of requirements for numerous development teams. The study comprises eight international companies, based in London, Bangalore and Delhi. Interviews with 46 practitioners were conducted between February 2010 and May 2012. Grounded theory was used to identify that <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> form into teams. The main contribution of this research is to describe the nine <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> team functions identifed: groom, prioritiser, release master, technical architect, governor, communicator, traveller, intermediary and risk assessor. These <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> functions arbitrate between conflicting customer requirements, approve release schedules, disseminate architectural design decisions, provide technical governance and propogate information across teams. The functions identifed in this research are mapped to a scrum of scrums process, and a taxonomy of the functions shows how focusing on either decision-making or information dissemination in each helps to tailor agile methods to large scale offshore enterprise development programmes.

40|$|Working Agile in {{software}} development has {{in recent years}} challenged the traditionalworking methods, such as the waterfall method. Within Scrum, which is a way towork Agile, {{the role of the}} <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> and the Scrum master are crucial to howan Agile team succeeds. Both <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> and Scrum masters have many areas ofresponsibility and challenges which make the roles interesting to investigate. Productowners tend to be responsible for being the link between the team that develops thesoftware and its stakeholders. It is therefore a key role within companies in order tosucceed in developing and maintaining software for customers and users. Scrummasters are responsible for facilitating Scrum and its events, as well as removing anyobstacles within the development team. The role of the Scrum Master thereforebecomes important in the application and pursuit of Scrum. Although the roles ofproduct owners and Scrum masters are central in Scrum, there have previously notbeen many studies conducted where the responsibilities and challenges for the roleshave been studied. This case study, conducted at a large Swedish IT company, describes theresponsibilities and challenges of <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> and Scrum masters compared withthe literature. The case study aims to study how <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> identifystakeholders, how they measure the value of the development team's work and howthey shape and convey the vision of the software. The study also aims studying howScrum masters ensures that Scrum is applied and followed, how they evaluate theirteam's work to improve productivity and how they facilitate the team's work. Datawas collected by interviewing ten <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> and Scrum masters, as well as byconducting observations. Both roles have proved been challenging and require great leadership skills. The roleshave been described different depending on the interviewed or observed productowner and Scrum master. The results from the case study show generally thatliterature and how the roles are in practice are in line with each other. They alsoshow that there are some areas of responsibility where <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> and Scrummasters don't think that the literature describes their reality...|$|R

The agile ideology was generally defined with the agile manifesto in 2001 and is widely used for software project management. Scrum {{is the most common}} method within agile and {{has become one of the}} most popular tools in software development in Iceland. The objective of this research was to shed light on how Scrum is applied. The role of the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> is studied; the knowledge and skills he is required to have, according to the Scrum method. This is compared to the perception of a number of actual project owners of their role. Information was gathered by semi structured interviews with a limited number of <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> that have had that role for at least 1 year. The results show that the majority of the participants in the survey are using different project management methods. They apply the methods that best fit their own operations. The understanding of the role and responsibility of the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> is quite different between organizations but seldom in perfect conformance with the official Scrum method. Cases were reported where there are two <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> for the same product. One is then responsible for business aspect but the other is responsible for technical aspects of the product. Scrum has a strong position in software development with its defined roles, collaboration emphasis, understanding, visibility, effective process and fast development...|$|R
