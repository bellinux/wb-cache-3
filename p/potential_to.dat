5|$|After {{intercontinental}} compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes {{suggested that}} bioluminescence and compatibility were independent since bioluminescence {{seemed to be}} geographically restricted.

5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5000|$|Dąbrowski called OE [...] "a tragic gift" [...] {{to reflect}} that the road of the person with strong OE is not a smooth or easy one. <b>Potentials</b> <b>to</b> {{experience}} great highs are also <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> experience great lows. Similarly, <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> express great creativity hold the likelihood of experiencing {{a great deal of}} personal conflict and stress. This stress both drives development and is a result of developmental conflicts, both intrapsychic and social. Suicide is a significant risk in the acute phases of this stress. The isolation often experienced by these people heightens the risk of self-harm.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{amygdala}} {{involvement in}} fear processing {{has been reported}} in behavioral, electrophysiological, and functional imaging studies. However, the literature does not provide precise data on the temporal course of facial emotional processing. Intracranial event-related <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> facial expressions were recorded in epileptic patients implanted with depth electrodes during a presurgical evaluation. Specific <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> fear beginning 200 ms poststimulus were observed in amygdala, both individually in two patients and in a ten patient population study. These potentials occurred 100 ms earlier than <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> disgust recorded in insula in a previous study. <b>Potentials</b> <b>to</b> fear were confined in amygdala during a first transient period and then, during a second period of sustained activity, spread to occipito-temporal, anterior temporal, and orbitofrontal cortex in two patients. This study clarifies the temporal course of the involvement of these structures known {{to be part of a}} neural network recruited to process emotional information...|$|R

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
