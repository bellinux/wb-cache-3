On July 18, 1711, he was officially appointed by the king, but he could only take office when his predecessor's term was over. Prior to arriving to Puerto Rico, Ribea and Enríquez exchanged friendly letters. The privateer lowered his guard, expecting to have a <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> with the future governor. While exchanging letters, Enríquez spent over 20,000 pieces of eight as gifts and other considerations and even lent his best vessel, La Gloria, so that Ribera could arrive. He also made sure that La Fortaleza was fitted with supplies to last several months. Ribera arrived to San Juan on December 23, 1713, replacing Danío. Enríquez was confident that with his previous actions he had gained the governor's favor, but noticing that his ship arrived fully loaded likely offered an early warning that the functionary actually intended to compete with him. Ribera had manipulated the privateer, projecting a benign posture to avoid awaking any suspicion. Having spent the two years after being appointed in the adjacent Cumaná and Margarita, the governor had observed the models used in the Americas and established connections, also becoming familiar with Enríquez's own modus operandi. Shortly after taking office, Ribera attempted to eradicate privateering from Puerto Rico for his own benefit. He quickly employed his connections in attempts to take over Enríquez's market. After completing his first term, Danío left his entire fortune in charge of Enríquez, while he returned to Spain. They agreed that the money would be sent there when needed. However, the arrangement was difficult, since the money was filtered by small quantities or failed to arrive at all. Ribera would employ the privateer's own model against him, mimicking several of his tactics, albeit in a more aggressive fashion. Considering Enríquez a direct adversary, the governor intercepted his mail and took over profitable associations.|$|E
6000|$|I wrote, very copiously, and I {{hope not}} worryingly at all (for I only {{meant to be}} reassuring) to your Mother yesterday, from whom I had had two {{beautiful}} unacknowledged letters within the last days or so: unacknowledged save for a cable, of a cheerful stamp, which I sent off to Irving Street about a week ago, and which will have been sent on to you. But all the while your most blest letter, written during your Christmas moment at Cambridge, has been for me a thing to be so grateful for that I must express to you something of it to-day--even {{at the risk of}} a glut of information. My long silence--since I came up to town, including, I mean, my pretty dismal weeks at that [...] "Garlant's" [...] of ill association--has had a great inevitability, from several causes; but into these I shall have gone to your Mother, whom I think I explicitly asked to send you on my letter, and I don't want to waste force in repetitions. It won't be repeating too much to say again what I said to her, even with extreme emphasis, that I feel singularly justified of this basis for my winter times in London; so much does it appear, now that the preliminary and just postliminary strain of it is over, the very best thing I could have done for myself. My southward position (as to the rooms I most use) immediately over the River is verily an [...] "asset," [...] and not even in the garden-room at L.H., of summer mornings, have I been better placed for work. With which, all the detail here is right and pleasant and workable; my servants extremely rejoice in it--but I am too much repeating!... Above all, my forenoons being by the mercy of the Powers, whoever or whatever they are, my best time, I have got back to work, and, with my uncanny interest in it and zeal for it still unimpaired, feel that it must [...] "mean something" [...] that I am thus reserved, after many troubles, for a <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> with it. The proof-sheets of [...] "A Small Boy and Others" [...] have been coming in upon me rapidly--all but the very last; and it ought, {{by the end of next}} month at furthest, to burst upon the world. Of course I shall have advance copies sent promptly to you and to Irving Street; but, with this, I intensely want you to take into account that the Book was written through all these months of hampering and baffling illness. It went so haltingly and worriedly even last winter (as distinguished from anything I was able to do in the summer and could get at all during the last afflicted three or four months,) last winter having really been a much more difficult time than I could currently confess to, or than dear Bill and Alice probably got any sense of. The point is at any rate that the Book is now, under whatever disadvantages, wholly done, and that if it seems [...] "good" [...] in spite of these, the proof of my powers, when my powers have really worked off more of the heritage of woe of the last three years, will be but the more substantial. A very considerable lot of [...] "Notes of a Son etc." [...] is done, and I am now practically back at it with this appearance of a free little field in spite of everything.... I welcome immensely (what I didn't mention to your Mother--waiting to do it thus) the valuable and delightful little collection received from you of your Grandfather's correspondence with Emerson. What beautiful and characteristic things in it and how I hope to be able to use the best of these, on your Grandfather's part at least. As regards Emerson's side of the matter I doubt whether I can do enough (in the way of extracts from him) to make it even necessary for me to apply to Edward for licence. I think I can hope but at the most to summarise, or give the sense of, some of Emerson's passages; the reason of this being my absolute presumable want of space. The Book will have to be a longer one than [...] "A Small Boy," [...] but even with this there must be limits involving suppressions and omissions. My own text I can't help attaching enough sense and importance and value to, not to want to keep that too utterly under, and I am more and more moved to give all of your Grandfather, on his vivid and original side, that I possibly can. Add to this all the application, of an illustrative kind, that I can't but see myself making of your Dad's letters, and I see little room for any one else's; though what I most deplore my meagre provision of is those of your Aunt Alice, written to our parents mainly during her times, and especially her final time, in Europe. The poverty of this resource cuts from under my feet almost all ground for doing much, as I had rather hoped in a manner to do, with her....|$|E

The governor took control of the shipyard and used it to construct a sloop, a brigantine and a schooner. The animosity between both was fueled by the fact that no side was willing to recognize the authority granted to the other. On one occasion the governor asked him to certify (on behalf of the Royal Guinea Company) that a ship had not returned, after it arrived from St. Thomas loaded with an illegal haul, but Enríquez refused to commit fraud. Due to the pressure involved, he was ultimately forced to do so. However, Enríquez visited the Secretary of Government, who served as witness of the act. The same occurred later with a ship that arrived from Trinidad, but this time he firmly refused, claiming that he was willing to risk his life if that meant conserving his honor.|$|E

In case one of the principals agrees to participate and the other does not, the investment of the first principal is held up and imposes a fixed cost.

Equating this ambivalent character of hybridity with the notions of contamination and quarantine he traces how the critical discourse that accompanies the art from that region has shifted from one that stresses its identitarian strategies to one of distinction from the canon.

40|$|This paper deploys {{the notion}} of “history/becoming” to explore {{architect}} Paolo Soleri’s Arcosanti project; an experimental architectural laboratory still under construction in the Arizona desert. Arcosanti is the built embodiment of Soleri’s conception of “arcology”: the fusion of architecture and ecology. Of particular interest to the present paper is Soleri’s ongoing engagement with {{the notion of}} “becoming” {{as it relates to the}} idea of history and the architecture of Arcosanti. Reference will also be made to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s writings on history, creativity and becoming; as well as a more recent interpretation of their important works—Craig Lundy’s 2012 text History and Becoming: Deleuze’s Philosophy of Creativity. These thinkers are critical of conceptions of history that restrict it to that which has already between actualised or produced. For Lundy: “historical reality is always already more than the actual and in <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> with the virtual and the incorporeal. ” It will be argued that exploring Arcosanti using the notion of “history/becoming” prompts a deeper theoretical engagement with the project; specifically by drawing attention to its relation with history without limiting or constricting the project’s relevance to a particular historical period. As an experimental architectural project, Arcosanti’s power resides in the interplay between that which has already been constructed and actualised on site, and the potential of the project to forge an unknown future in synch with the planet Earth...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I provide an {{interpretation}} of Kant's theories of knowledge, nature, and being in order to argue that Kant's ontology is a productive ontology: it is a theory of being that includes a notion of production. I aim to show that Kant's epistemology and philosophy of nature {{are based on a}} theory of being as productivity. The thesis contributes to knowledge in that it considers in detail Kant's ontology and theory of being, topics which have generally been ignored or misunderstood. In arguing for Kant's productive ontology, I argue against Heidegger's interpretation of Kant, which states that Kant understands being as "produced permanent presence" or as divinely created materiality. Based on Kant's definition of being as positing, I argue, by contrast to Heidegger, that Kant understands being as the original <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> between subject and object. This can also be expressed as the relation between formality and materiality, or between epistemic conditions and existence, that is productive of objects of experience. Being is not producedness but a relation of productivity, through which both subject and object are themselves productive. The subject is productive in its spontaneity, and nature, determined as dynamical interaction, is interpreted as productive. The subject, I will argue, does not understand nature as produced, but approaches it with a comportment towards its production as object of experience. Because of its own subjective productivity - spontaneity or "life" - the subject has a "productive comportment" towards nature. Ontology, I claim, concerns the realm of the <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> of being, the realm of the relation between epistemic conditions and existence, and therefore the realm of possible experience. This marks Kant as divergent not only from what Heidegger calls "the ontology of the extant", but also from the concept-based ontology of the German rationalists. The general aims of the thesis are, first, to argue that being for Kant is the original relation between subject and object, and that ontology concerns this relation; second, to argue that ontology and being are understood in terms of production and productivity; and third, to argue that Heidegger is wrong to ascribe to Kant an understanding of being as "produced pennanent presence". I approach these aims by examining a number of Kant's texts in detail, focusing particularly on Kant's theses about existence and being in The One Possible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God and the Critique of Pure Reason; on Kant's philosophy of nature and dynamical matter in the Transcendental Analytic and Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science; on Kant's doctrine of experience and objectivity in the Transcendental Deductions; on ontological reflection and the productive comportment of "life" in the Critique of Judgment; and on Kant's final theory of matter, life and production in the Opus Postumum.

The idea of a “creative” way to bring into a stronger system all single initiatives (from the promotion of local products to the offering of a new model of involving hosting) is very impressive: people think it can be a strategy to give an attractive interpretation of agriculture as a job with interesting potentialities (quality of life environment, possibilities of multi-functional activities, new social model, …). They also pointed out the value of a shared project to enrich their community, based on the peculiar characters of their landscape.

The New Deal, a major economic stimulus initiative that ran from 1935 - 1943, included the Works Progress Administration Federal One Projects, encompassing fine art, music, theater, writing, and design. These projects provided economic support and cultural enrichment to hundreds of thousands of Americans, in the form of jobs, entertainment, and education in the arts. New Deal Art Now seeks to reframe a period of United States artistic production that is often narrowly cast in exhibitions and their related literature on the subject. The theme of diversity is explored through several critical lenses, such as questioning the relationship between art and artifact, considering that many creative works of the New Deal function as both. The majority of the exhibited artworks are juxtaposed against one another to challenge the designations that contemporary material culture traditionally assigns them. Showcasing 48 objects in total, the exhibits include painting, sculpture, educational models, archival film, and archival audio, which are juxtaposed alongside contemporary paintings, photography, and music, created in conjunction with this exhibition. By situating these works (as well as the very categories of amateur and professional, art and artifact, museum and archive, past and present) in <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> to one another this exhibition argues for the significance of all of these works and artists to the diverse history of twentieth-century American art...|$|E

He is one who has stood ideologically against the inheritance of colonial model in the Bengali narrative world both in terms of form and content consciousness. Off and on, in his writings, Sen has criticized the trend of writing stories of love & sex only in Bengali fiction and pointed out that so called mainstream literature only depicts the life of growing middleclass and rich people, ignoring the struggle for existence of the common mass, their livelihood. Like Debesh Roy, Abhijit maintains the European model of novel is not useful for depicting the heterogeneity of the reality of life of the larger section of people. He says, like the Third World literature, our narrative is to stand politically and ideologically against neo-colonial attack over the heterogeneous culture of marginalized mass and for this. The present day narrative should be emancipated from the domain of time-space contactless middleclass centric story writing, and it should take the way of re-evaluating & re-constructing of myth, folktales & traditions to represent the present day reality. Depiction of reality, in Sen’s idea is a protest against the traditional way of misrepresenting time & space.

40|$|This {{comparative}} {{cultural history}} of urban photography addresses France, Britain and West Germany {{during the period}} of reconstruction after the Second World War. It considers images circulating in the public sphere (including books, professional journals, popular magazines and official publications) and examines how the mediation through photography of architecture, urban space and everyday life shaped ways of seeing and thinking about cities in postwar Western Europe. Analysis focuses on four key fields: ruin photography in commemorative books (1945 - 49); representations of mass housing projects through architectural photography in the architectural press and official publications (1947 - 54); urban scenes in photographic magazines (1949 - 55); and urban photography in UNESCO’s early campaigns regarding human rights and intercultural understanding, as well as images of the institution’s purpose-built headquarters in Paris (1949 - 58). Whether of burned-out façades or sunlit concrete tower blocks, the wealth of publicly circulating images cohered in a set of specific discursive formations which, in dynamic and <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> with one another, offered determinate perspectives on key topics of the reconstruction period. Moreover, in the transition from enmity to unity between the comparator nations which characterised the aftermath of total war and the escalation of the Cold War, the image of the city became a vital component of postwar Western European cultural identity facilitating the expression of important imagined communities, spaces and futures. Informed by the interdisciplinary field of photography studies, this research offers an interpretive analysis of dominant discursive formations, identifying the perspectives offered by postwar urban photography and excavating its relation to questions of cultural memory and forgetting, to national histories and imagined transnational communities, and to international relations and utopian thinking. It develops an innovative methodology for the interpretation of photography in the writing of cultural history and delivers a comparative historical analysis of a vital aspect of transnational postwar visual culture...|$|E
40|$|When he {{described}} poetry {{as that which}} should “delight to move men to take goodnesse in hand,” Philip Sidney was articulating the widely held Renaissance belief that poetry’s principal function is edification. Scholars have tended to observe a tension between Sidney’s description and the English sonnet sequence, as though didacticism and love poetry are fundamentally in opposition. But Petrarch’s Canzoniere–from which these sequences derive–is a conversion narrative; and the perceived opposition between amatory poetry and didacticism dissolves when we read English Petrarchism as a conversion genre. This dissertation begins with the suspicion that the theological infrastructure of these sequences is underplayed in the criticism. It is interested in {{what happens when we}} encounter these collections awake to the historical fact that Petrarchism and the Protestant Reformation came to England at the same time. A. E. B. Coldiron has described Sidney’s historical moment as one marked by both the “problem of how to establish a <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> with the literary past” and “the problem of making poets, not versifiers in England. ” English Petrarchans, I argue, were compelled to write poems in this vein to assert the legitimacy of English lyric from within a genealogy that enthusiastically embraced the literary accomplishments of the Italian poet. But the poets’ employment of Protestant tropes in these collections asserts an explicitly English lyric authorship: at once legitimized by its embeddedness in a literary tradition and morally eclipsing that tradition through recourse to right (Protestant) religion. When the Canzoniere arrived in England, its lover was ripe for comparison with the “spirit-versus-flesh” Paul. Taking a cue from this resemblance, English poets turned to Paul’s Epistles not only to recast Petrarch’s moral instruction (Paul, too, was a convert), but also to legitimize carnal love as a serious–and ineluctable–topic. Amatory poetry proved remarkably amenable to accommodating reformed, Pauline teachings on human will (and thus works, grace, and predestination). Sonnet sequences by Edmund Spenser, Thomas Watson, Sidney, Fulke Greville, Mary Wroth, and Shakespeare testify to an extensive effort among English love poets to offer a Protestant English literary exemplum to rival Petrarch’s Catholic one...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the work}} of Catalan author Quim Monzó {{in relation to the}} transformations that Catalan culture has undergone from the early 1970 s until the present day. Despite the undeniable complexity and diversity of Monzó’s oeuvre, critical studies have tended to follow set patterns, often focusing on his literary production and discussing postmodernist aesthetics in his fiction, while tending to avoid engaging with the political ideologies underpinning it. This thesis, by contrast, explores the multifaceted nature of Monzó’s trajectory by focusing {{on a wide range of}} materials (his fictional texts and regular opinion pieces in the Catalan press, his political cartoons, his translations and his participation in mass media and social networks) through a methodology that combines cultural analysis as well as sociocultural and political commentary with the critical tools provided by Bourdieu’s sociological theories of culture, gender studies and postmodernist cultural theory. With the overarching aim of driving forward a new understanding of Quim Monzó’s trajectory and of the contemporary Catalan cultural field, this thesis concentrates on two interrelated strands of analysis. Firstly, it argues that Monzó’s literary and intellectual programme both accelerated and critically responded to the decline of the resistentialist cultural model and the advent of the discourses of Catalan cultural normalisation under postmodernism and its associated framework of cultural marketisation. Specifically, the thesis analyses Monzó’s public trajectory from countercultural artist in the 1970 s to celebrity author and intellectual in the present day as a phenomenon that has brought to the fore some of the contradictions in the discourse of Catalan cultural normalisation vis-à-vis postmodernist attitudes towards the symbolic roles of culture and the public intellectual. Secondly, the thesis addresses the unremitting presence of a series of political themes and debates in Monzó’s work, with a view to examining how the author’s work interacts with some of the socio-cultural and political transformations of his time, in particular the ongoing Catalan-Spanish national debate and its centrality during the Spanish Transition to democracy, the emergence of libertarian and neoconservative ideologies in Spain and the growing influence of feminist thought. All in all, the thesis contributes both to Monzonian scholarship and the study of the contemporary Catalan cultural field by arguing that there is a singular, intricate and <b>productive</b> <b>relation</b> between the author’s work and its cultural and political context...|$|E

50|$|One {{branch of}} {{industrial}} sociology is Labor process theory (LPT). In 1974, Harry Braverman wrote Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century, which provided a {{critical analysis of}} scientific management. This book analyzed capitalist <b>productive</b> <b>relations</b> from a Marxist perspective. Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organisations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to deskilling and routinisation of the worker. The Taylorist work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.|$|R
