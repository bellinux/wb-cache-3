It loosely {{tells the story of}} Lili Elbe, {{one of the first people}} to undergo sex reassignment surgery, and wife Gerda Wegener. It stars Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, both of whom received Academy Award nominations. Critics were generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.35 million viewers in the UK and {{achieved}} an Appreciation Index of 85. Reviewers were generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> episode; some praised the setting and characters but others commented that the story had not developed enough {{even though it was}} only the first part. The computer-generated effects used for one scene were also disapproved of by a couple of reviewers.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series. Reviewers were <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Tales games, it features an action-based battle system, called the Three-Line Linear Motion Battle System. The game {{was developed by}} the 2D Tales development unit Team Destiny. The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny. The scenario, written by Hiramatsu Masaki, dealt extensively with issues of coexistence between races and ethnic conflicts. The game has received positive reviews and strong sales in Japan, with the PlayStation 2 version eventually selling over 600,000 units and the PSP re-release selling over 83,000. Western sites have been <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game, though neither version of the game have received English localizations.|$|E
5|$|In {{a preview}} of the TGS demo, Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after {{completing}} the demo, along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was highly <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game, citing is story as a return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series. His main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition, along with expressing regret {{that it would not be}} localized.|$|E
5|$|Kristin Lemmerman of CNN {{said that}} it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the {{beginning}} contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.' Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> change of mood and development of characters. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A-, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a nightmare factory for young readers.|$|E

5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted {{to know what was going}} on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E
5|$|The concept, {{which was}} set within the mythos of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, {{was for a}} much darker {{scenario}} than other Final Fantasy games. The main cast were designed by Nomura and Naora, while side characters were handled by Nakaaki. Multiple pieces of merchandise and additional media have been created around the characters, including trading cards and multiple manga. They {{have been the subject}} of positive reviews in Japan and import reviews: the main praise has gone to their interactions and writing, while the main criticism was difficulties arising from handling the large cast. Western reviews were also generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character portrayals, but there were criticisms about dialogue, character interactions, and the quality of the localization.|$|E
5|$|Dredd was {{released}} on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence {{as well as a}} perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30–45 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film.|$|E

5|$|Famitsu Weekly {{found the}} story enjoyable, though noted {{that those who}} had played Destiny would get more {{enjoyment}} out of it, and praised the voice acting. They also found the gameplay and pacing enjoyable, positively noting the option to auto-battle. The game ranked as the 89th all-time favorite game in a 2006 Famitsu readers poll. Japanese website Game Impress Watch found the story impressive, citing its use of time travel and the continued use of Destinys world and lore. The gameplay, mini-games and customization options was also generally praised, with the reviewer recommending the title to players of the series. RPGFan's Woojin Lee was also positive, praising the gameplay despite the very high encounter rate, and was pleased that an auto-battle option was included. One point that received a more mixed response was the game's music, {{with the exception of}} the opening song. In a preview for IGN, David Smith was generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game. While he disliked the art style and its low-tech look compared to its hardware, he found the gameplay enjoyable and the opening parts of the story fairly relatable. He ended by hoping that Namco would put the effort into localizing the title.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the game were changed for its Western release: these changes {{included}} the removal or alteration of several revealing costumes, the removal of visual and dialogue references to Gravure modelling, and changes to the ages of certain characters. Multiple sections of dialogue were re-recorded to match these changes. The game's Hot Springs scenario and associated costumes also went unreleased. The removed outfits were replaced with Western-exclusive outfits. Changes to content were attributed to Nintendo's varying content requirements and regulations for the regions the game was released in. Staff later defended these changes as necessary adjustments based on the regions they would be releasing the game in, while working on keeping the core identity intact. After the game's Western release, staff were divided on the issue: Yamagami was <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's adaption for a Western audience, while Hirata was initially disappointed with the alterations prior to seeing positive responses to the game from Western fans. Following the game's Western release, a fan-developed patch was released that reverted all the localization changes, ranging from cosmetic alteration to script changes.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E

25|$|Krupa {{praised the}} use of the Wii U gamepad as the Camera Obsura and enjoyed combat for most of the game, but found the latter third of the game tedious due to {{repetitive}} battles. Corriae enjoyed {{the use of}} the gamepad despite some control issues, Bates was highly <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> thrill it brought into battles, while Turi found that the function did not bring long-term enjoyment and that backtracking through environments negatively impacted on the experience. Wilson likewise enjoyed the gamepad's role in the game, while faulting most other aspects including the high amount of health items and character controls. Orry said that the new controls made combat more claustrophobic than in previous games, while Brown enjoyed the immersion the gamepad brought. Famitsu was highly <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of the gamepad, saying that it felt like you {{were in the midst of}} battles. These sentiments were echoed by Dengeki, but stated that some combat situations made aiming difficult. Multiple reviewers mentioned and generally faulted the stiff controls and character movement.|$|E
25|$|At about 1850, Sir Moses Montefiore was {{instrumental}} in establishing etrog plantations in the Holy Land, {{in order to help}} the Jewish settlers to survive.

50|$|A {{study done}} by Craig R. Fox {{provides}} an example of how availability heuristics can work in the classroom. In this study, Fox tests whether difficulty of recall influences judgment, specifically with course evaluations among college students. In his study he had two groups complete a course evaluation form. He asked the first group to write two recommended improvements for the course (a relatively easy task) and then write two <b>positives</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> class. The second group was asked to write ten suggestions where the professor could improve (a relatively difficult task) and then write two <b>positive</b> comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> course. At the end of the evaluation both groups were asked to rate the course on a scale from one to seven. The results showed that students asked to write ten suggestions (difficult task) rated the course less harshly because it was more difficult for them to recall the information. Students asked to do the easier evaluation with only two complaints had less difficulty in terms of availability of information, so they rated the course more harshly.|$|R
