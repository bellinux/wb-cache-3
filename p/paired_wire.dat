40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to produce a Communication Area Network (CAN) system that can effectively send messages using an Arduino with a CAN shield and to determine characteristic robustness. CAN systems are the most prominent form of communication between microcontrollers and devices primarily within vehicles. The CAN system itself was analyzed to determine the system’s robustness and weaknesses, along with proving that a twisted-paired wire is much more effective than a non-twisted pair. A relay was used to control the CAN messages to determine CAN practical usability. An Electro-magnetic Field radiation meter {{was used to determine}} the ambient electromagnetic field intensity at which the signal of both the twisted <b>paired</b> <b>wire</b> and the non-twisted <b>paired</b> <b>wire</b> distorted...|$|E

50|$|StarLAN was {{the first}} IEEE 802.3 {{standard}} for Ethernet over twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wiring.</b> It was standardized by the standards association of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as 802.3e in 1986, as the 1BASE5 version of Ethernet.

Distances of 300 m (1000 feet) at 50 Mbit/s up to 8 km at 128 kbit/s is possible. Westermo DDW products are capable of 10 miles at 30.3Mbit/s using SHDSL technology.

40|$|Data {{services}} {{delivered on}} telephone twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wiring</b> can potentially suffer from crosstalk due to data services on other twisted pairs in proximity, limiting the data rate, the maximum loop length and {{the quantity and}} variety of data services that a bundle can support. The crosstalk from other data services couples to the twisted pair in common mode and leaks to differential mode due to imperfect line balance. This thesis uses the common mode signal as a reference to an adaptive wideband crosstalk canceller, {{in an attempt to}} remove or at least lower the effect of crosstalk on the useful differential signal. Simulation results show the potential benefits of using this technique to reduce the level of crosstalk on an ADSL differential signal with crosstalk coming from data services commonly found in the telephone bundles. This technique is not limited to ADSL but can be applied to any technology using twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wiring</b> as its transmission medium...|$|R

50|$|Long Reach Ethernet (LRE) was a {{proprietary}} networking protocol marketed by Cisco Systems, intended to support multi-megabit (5 to 15 Mbit/s) performance over telephone-grade unshielded twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wiring</b> over distances up to 5,000 feet (1.5 km).Supporting such distance ranges, LRE is technically classified a Metropolitan area network (MAN) technology.Technically the protocol {{was similar to}} very-high-bitrate digital subscriber line (VDSL), practically Ethernet over VDSL (EoVDSL).|$|R
50|$|Power Sum NEXT (NEXT) {{is the sum}} of NEXT {{values from}} 3 <b>wire</b> <b>pairs</b> as they affect the other <b>wire</b> <b>pair.</b> The {{combined}} effect of NEXT can be very detrimental to the signal.|$|R
50|$|Legacy T1 {{carriers}} operated {{using the}} {{alternate mark inversion}} (AMI) line code, more recently also B8ZS, on two <b>wire</b> <b>pairs.</b> Each <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> was operated in simplex, that is, one <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> was used for transmission in each direction. The Nyquist frequency of a 1.544 megabaud signal is 772 kHz. Higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly than lower frequencies, motivating the use of technologies that reduce the signal bandwidth. In HDSL, full duplex by means of echo cancellation is used, enabling simultaneous transmission in both directions {{on each of the}} two <b>wire</b> <b>pairs,</b> effectively reducing the symbol rate by a factor two. Through the use of 2B1Q encoding, two bits are combined to one symbol, further reducing the symbol rate by a factor of two. For this two-pair 2B1Q variant of HDSL, framing increases the bitrate from 1.544 Mbit/s to 1.568 Mbit/s, resulting in a symbol rate of 392 kilobaud and a Nyquist frequency of 196 kHz.|$|R
50|$|In copper twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wire</b> networks, copper cable {{certification}} {{is achieved}} through a thorough {{series of tests}} in accordance with Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) or International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. These tests are done using a certification-testing tool, which provide “Pass” or “Fail” information. While certification can be performed by {{the owner of the}} network, certification is primarily done by datacom contractors. It is this certification that allows the contractors to warranty their work.|$|R
50|$|Using an EtherChannel has {{numerous}} advantages, {{and probably}} the most desirable aspect is the bandwidth. Using the maximum of 8 active ports a total bandwidth of 800 Mbit/s, 8 Gbit/s or 80 Gbit/s is possible depending on port speed. This assumes there is a traffic mixture, as those speeds {{do not apply to}} a single application only. It can be used with Ethernet running on twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wiring,</b> single-mode and multimode fiber.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} package fiber into a commercially viable product, it {{typically}} is protectively coated by using ultraviolet (UV), light-cured acrylate polymers, then terminated with optical fiber connectors, and finally assembled into a cable. After that, {{it can be}} laid {{in the ground and}} then run through the walls of a building and deployed aerially {{in a manner similar to}} copper cables. These fibers require less maintenance than common twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wires,</b> once they are deployed.|$|R

50|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, {{the cost of}} digital signal {{processors}} for DSL was prohibitive. All types of DSL employ highly complex digital signal processing algorithms to overcome the inherent limitations of the existing twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wires.</b> Due to the advancements of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology, {{the cost of the}} equipment associated with a DSL deployment lowered significantly. The two main pieces of equipment are a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) at one end and a DSL modem at the other end.|$|R

50|$|Twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wire</b> is {{the most}} widely used medium for all telecommunication. Twisted-pair cabling consist of copper wires that are twisted into <b>pairs.</b> Ordinary {{telephone}} <b>wires</b> consist of two insulated copper <b>wires</b> twisted into <b>pairs.</b> Computer network cabling (wired Ethernet as defined by IEEE 802.3) consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 million bits per second to 10 billion bits per second. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.|$|R
50|$|An {{optional}} extended SHDSL mode allows symmetric {{data rates}} up to 5,696 kbit/s on one pair, using the 32-TC-PAM modulation scheme specified in Annexes F and G. Using M-pair bonding, {{up to four}} <b>pairs</b> of <b>wires</b> may be bonded to yield data rates up to M×5,696 kbit/s. In this way, a single SHDSL interface using four bonded <b>wire</b> <b>pairs</b> can carry up to 22,784 kbit/s.|$|R

50|$|Demand {{priority}} helps increase bandwidth in {{the following}} ways: A node {{does not need to}} keep checking whether the network is idle before transmitting. In current Ethernet implementations, a <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> is dedicated to this task. By making network checking unnecessary, demand priority frees a <b>wire</b> <b>pair.</b> This is fortunate,because the 100BaseVG specifications use quartet signalling, which needs four available <b>wire</b> <b>pairs.</b> Heavy traffic can effectively bring standard Ethernet networks to a standstill, because nodes {{spend most of their time}} trying to access the network.|$|R
50|$|Twisted <b>pair</b> <b>wiring</b> - Twisting wires very tightly {{together}} in a circuit will dramatically reduce electromagnetic noise. Twisting the wires decreases the loop size in which a magnetic field can run through to produce a current between the wires. Even if the wires are twisted very tightly, there may still be small loops somewhere between them, {{but because they are}} twisted the magnetic field going through the smaller loops induces a current flowing in opposite ways in each wire and thus cancelling them out.|$|R
