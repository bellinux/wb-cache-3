40|$|Abstractâ€”Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, due {{to their}} ability to uniquely {{identify}} every individual item and low cost, are well suited for supply chain management and are expected to replace barcodes in the near future. However, unlike barcodes, these tags have a longer range in which they are allowed to be scanned, subjecting them to unauthorized scanning by malicious readers and to various other attacks, including cloning attacks. Therefore, a security protocol for RFID tags is necessary to ensure the <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> between each tag and their reader. In order to accomplish this, we propose PAP, a <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol for passive RFID tags. This protocol requires little computation and achieves both <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication,</b> making it sufficient enough for use in supply chain management; however, this protocol is also suitable for use in other RFID applications as well.

40|$|Abstract. Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{is expected}} to become an important and ubiquitous infrastructure technology. As RFID tags are affixed to all items, they {{may be used to}} support various useful services. However, this pervasive use of RFID tags opens up the possibility for various attacks violating user <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> among communication participants. Security mechanisms for RFID systems will be therefore of utmost important. In this paper, we describe problems of previous works on RFID security protocol and specify several known attacks with Casper, CSP and then verify their security properties such as secrecy and authentication using FDR model checking tool. Finally, we propose an RFID security protocol based on strong authenticaion that guarantees data <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> between a tag and a reader...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communications}} {{are being}} driven by the need for providing network access to mobile or nomadic computing devices. The need for wireless access to a network is evident in current work environments. A number of new protocols have been recently published {{with the goal of}} providing both <b>privacy</b> of data <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> of users for mobile systems. Such protocols can employ private-key and/or public key cryptographic algorithms. Publickey algorithms hold the promise of simplifying the network infrastructure required to provide security services such as: <b>privacy,</b> <b>authentication</b> <b>and</b> non-repudiation, while symmetric algorithms require less processing power on the mobile device. In this paper a selection of protocols are reviewed and they are broadly divided into two categories: second generation and third generation protocols.

The authors claim that the protocol, being resistant to commonly assumed attacks, requires little computation and provides privacy protection and authentication. Nevertheless, we propose two traceability attacks and an impersonation attack, in which the revealing of secret information (i. e., secret key and static identifier) shared between the tag and the reader is unnecessary. Moreover, we review all basic assumptions on which {{the design of the}} protocol resides, and show how many of them are incorrect and are contrary to the common assumptions in RFID systems.

40|$|Different {{applications}} {{have different}} security requirements for data <b>privacy,</b> data integrity, <b>and</b> <b>authentication.</b> Encryption is one technique that addresses these requirements. Encryption hardware, {{designed for use}} in high-speed communications networks, can satisfy {{a wide variety of}} security requirements if the hardware implementation is key-agile, key length-agile, mode-agile, and algorithm-agile. Hence, context-agile encryption provides enhanced solutions to the secrecy, interoperability, and quality of service issues in high-speed networks. Moreover, having a single context-agile encryptor at an ATM aggregation point (such as a firewall) reduces hardware and administrative costs. While single-algorithm, key-agile encryptors exist, encryptors that are agile in a cryptographic robustness sense, are still research topics. Different applications have different security requirements for data <b>privacy,</b> data integrity, <b>and</b> <b>authentication.</b> Encryption is one technique that addresses these requirements.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} our {{attention}} {{on the problem of}} assigning initial secrets to users in ad-hoc network (respectively, sensors in a sensor network) so that they can use those secrets to ensure authentication and privacy during their communication. The goal of this assignment is to ensure that any two users can communicate securely with each other even though each user maintains {{only a small number of}} secrets. With pffiffi this motivation, we present a protocol that maintains OÃ° nÃž secrets per user where n is the number of users in the system. We show that our secret distribution protocol suffices for <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> as well as secure multihop communication between two users. Furthermore, we show that the number of secrets maintained in this protocol is within a constant factor of the optimal. For the case where user capability prevents them from maintaining the necessary secrets, we propose two probabilistic protocols that maintain O(log n) secrets and where the probability of security compromise between two users is inversely proportional to the number of secrets they maintain. Thus, our protocols provide a continuum where the level of <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> depends upon user requirements and capabilities. q 2005 Elsevier B. V.
