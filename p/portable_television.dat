25|$|Ted Dexter was {{a talented}} golf player, an amateur {{champion}} {{and could have}} achieved greatness in that sport {{if he had not}} chosen cricket. In Australia in 1962-3 he played a foursome with Norman Von Nida, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player (with Colin Cowdrey as his caddy) and they offered to take him to America to become a tournament golfer, but Dexter refused. He married Susan Georgina Longfield, the daughter of a former Kent cricketer Tom Longfield, whom he met at a party Cambridge University while still an undergraduate and decided to marry on sight. She worked as a model and she joined her husband on the tour of Australia in 1962–63, where she generated considerable press interest and earned more than any of the cricketers. They have a son Thomas and a daughter Genevieve. He owned Jaguar cars, Norton motorbikes, greyhounds, race horses and in 1970 piloted his Aztec BPA-23 Pommies Progress to Australia with his family to cover the Ashes as a journalist, covering 12,000 miles and making 24 stops. He worked for the liberal The Observer and the tabloid The Sunday Mirror and managed his style to suit both their editors.

[...] Resolutions were limited to standard definition, although a number of technologies were pushing displays towards the limits of that standard; Super VHS offered improved color saturation, and DVDs added higher resolutions as well. Even with these advances, screen sizes over 30" [...] were rare as these formats would start to appear blocky at normal seating distances when viewed on larger screens. Projection systems were generally limited to situations where the image had to be viewed by a larger audience.|$|R

50|$|All U.S. full-power analog TV {{broadcasts}} {{were required}} by law to end on June 12, 2009. Since March 1, 2007, all new television devices that receive signals over-the-air, including pocket-sized <b>portable</b> <b>televisions,</b> personal computer video capture card tuners, and DVD recorders, have been required to include digital ATSC tuners. Prior to this, the requirement was phased-in starting with larger screen sizes. Until the transition was completed, most U.S. broadcasters transmitted their signals in both analog and digital formats, though a few were already digital-only. Digital stations transmitted on another channel, which was assigned to each full-power broadcaster in a three-round digital channel election.|$|R

50|$|In the United States on 12 June 2009, all {{full power}} U.S. {{television}} broadcasts became exclusively digital, under the Digital Television and Public Safety Act of 2005. Furthermore, from 1 March 2007, new television sets that receive signals over-the-air, including pocket sized <b>portable</b> <b>televisions,</b> include ATSC digital tuners for digital broadcasts.

Most U.S. stations were not permitted to shut down their analogue transmissions prior to 16 February 2009, unless doing so was {{required in order to}} complete work on a station's permanent digital facilities. In 2009, the FCC finished auctioning channels 52-59 (the lower half of the 700 MHz band) for other communications services, completing the reallocation of broadcast channels 52-69 that began in the late 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|All NWR {{channels}} {{are available on}} stand-alone [...] "weather radio" [...] receivers that are currently sold online and in retail stores (available for prices ranging from US$20 and up), {{as well as on}} most marine VHF radio transceivers, amateur radios and digital scanners. In addition, more mainstream consumer electronics, such as clock radios, portable multi-band receivers and two-way radios (such as FRS, GMRS and CB radio), now feature the ability to also receive NWR channels. Many of the aforementioned devices also incorporate alerting capabilities. With the American digital television transition making most existing <b>portable</b> <b>televisions</b> obsolete and no longer usable and the current infant and development stage of mobile digital television, along with the need to provide a public service to their viewers and encourage the use of the NWR system, many American television station weather operations cooperate with radio manufacturers and local retail outlets to offer weather radios at discounted pricing to viewers (especially in highly tornado-prone areas), where they are often marketed as an essential safety device on par with a smoke alarm for home fires.|$|R
