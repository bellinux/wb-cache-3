50|$|The {{simplest}} fluoroplastic is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, DuPont brand Teflon), {{which is}} a simple linear chain polymer with the repeating structural unit:-CF2-. PTFE has a backbone of carbons single bonded in a long chain, with all side bonds to fluorines.

PTFE has high chemical and thermal stability, as expected for a perfluorocarbon, much stronger than polyethylene. Its resistance to van der Waals forces makes PTFE the only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. The compound, however, lacks an ability to transform upon melting, which is not a problem for various PTFE deratives, namely FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene, with some fluorines replaced with the-CF3 group) or PFA (<b>perfluoroalkoxy,</b> some fluorines replaced with -OCF3).

5000|$|To {{be able to}} {{transfer}} heat well, the tube material should have good thermal conductivity. Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a temperature difference through {{the width of the}} tubes. Because of the tendency of the tube material to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, thermal stresses occur during operation. This is in addition to any stress from high pressures from the fluids themselves. The tube material also should be compatible with both the shell and tube side fluids for long periods under the operating conditions (temperatures, pressures, pH, etc.) to minimize deterioration such as corrosion. All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, thermally-conductive, corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically metals, including aluminium, copper alloy, stainless steel, carbon steel, non-ferrous copper alloy, Inconel, nickel, Hastelloy and titanium. [...] Fluoropolymers such as <b>Perfluoroalkoxy</b> alkane (PFA) and Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures. Poor choice of tube material could result in a leak through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure.|$|E

The successful construction of PFA/nano-Ag coatings was revealed by field-emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FIR) and contact angle measurements, respectively. The additional silver nanopartides play the significant role in regulating the sliding angle of the PFA-based coatings.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{strategy}} for the fabrication of digital microfluidic (DMF) devices by research groups without access to well-equipped facilities. Compared to previously developed methods, it increases considerably device yield, and yet simplifies fabrication and enables flexible operation. To this end, we use large (260 and 400 µm) interelectrode gaps to optimize substrate fabrication, breaking the established constraint that gap dimensions must be small (usually 1 mm). Smooth droplet actuation is ensured by films of <b>perfluoroalkoxy</b> (PFA), which do not require additional coatings; films can be instantly replaced, without the necessity of annealing. Finally, our tests indicate that DMF devices can operate with large distances between plates and droplet volumes (up to 2 mm and 60 µL, respectively), which implies in a flexibility in device operation not observed before.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to communicate effectively with other individuals plays {{a critical role}} in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage colouration, indicators of individual’s quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally suited as indicators of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual’s oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to oxidative stress. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic (persistent organic pollutants) contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling.

Four levels of Re were tested for each milk type, each tube size and each bacteria type. Inactivation efficiency increased as the Re increased in both the reactors for both types of milk. The inactivation of both bacteria was higher in the 1. 6 mm UV reactor than the 3. 2 mm UV reactor.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of some operating conditions on the simultaneous removal of NOx and SO 2 from simulated NO–SO 2 –air flue-gas mixtures in a scrubber column. The gaseous components were absorbed into 6 M HNO 3 electrolyte in the scrubber in a counter-current mode, and were oxidatively removed by the Ag(II) mediator oxidant electrochemically generated in an electrochemical cell set-up. The integration of the electrochemical cell with the scrubber set-up ensured continuous regeneration of the Ag(II) mediator and its repeated reuse for NOx and SO 2 removal purpose, thereby avoiding: (1) the usage of chemicals continuously for oxidation and (2) the production of secondary waste. The influences of packing material (raschig glass rings, raschig poly(vinylidene) fluoride rings, Jaeger tri-pack <b>perfluoroalkoxy</b> spheres), feed concentrations of NO and SO 2 (100 – 400 ppm NO and 100 – 400 ppm SO 2), superficial gas velocity (0. 061 – 0. 61 m s� 1) and liquid velocity (0. 012 – 0. 048 m s� 1) were investigated. The raschig glass rings with high surface area provided highest NO removal efficiency. NO and NOx showed decreasing abatement at higher feed concentrations. The removal of nitrogen components was faster and also greater, when SO 2 co-existed in the feed. Whereas the gas flow rate decreased the removal efficiency, the liquid flow rate increased it for NO and NOx.

Ag nanoparticles with a diameter (φ) of approximately 20 nm were mainly used. To deposit these nanoparticles, Ge surfaces were dipped in HCl solution (10 - 3 M, 100 ml) with AgClO 4 (10 - 4 M, 100 ml) for 5 min. After dipping, they were dried under N 2 flow. We also used Pt nanoparticles of approximately 7 nm φ, which were synthesized {{in accordance with}} the literature [22]. They were coated with a ligand (tetradecyltrimethylammonium) to avoid aggregation and were dispersed in water. This enabled us to obtain near monodispersed particles. The Ge samples were immersed in the resulting solution and dried under N 2 flow. Then, the Ge surfaces loaded with the Pt particles were treated with the ultraviolet ozone generator for 6 h to remove the ligand bound to the Pt surfaces. In this experiment, we used two types of water with different dissolved oxygen concentrations, both of which were prepared from semiconductor-grade ultrapure water. The first type was water poured and stored in a <b>perfluoroalkoxy</b> (PFA) beaker. This water has a saturated dissolved-oxygen concentration of approximately 9 ppm. The second type contained a very low oxygen concentration of approximately 3 ppb. We, hereafter, call these two types of water ‘saturated dissolved-oxygen water’ (SOW) and ‘low dissolved-oxygen water’ (LOW), respectively. By putting a Ge sample in a PFA container connected directly to an ultrapure water line faucet, we were able to treat samples in LOW. The change in the structure of Ge surfaces loaded with metallic particles by immersion in water in the dark was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S- 4800, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).|$|E
40|$|Transformation optics {{offers a}} {{theoretical}} {{tool for the}} design of electromagnetic devices that can manipulate the flow of microwaves in an unprecedented way, but also places demanding requirements on the permittivity ε and permeability μ of materials used to form the devices, along with their spatial variations in three dimensions. Polymers that are light-weight and with high processability are considered potentially useful in realizing transformation optic designs, but only where the effective ε and μ can be increased controllably by loading the polymer with inorganic particles. This thesis focuses on the development of bespoke polymer-based composite materials and robust manufacturing approaches for potential applications in electromagnetic devices. Three main manufacturing approaches have been explored. Firstly, casting was demonstrated to produce bulk materials with equal permittivity and permeability by embedding NiZn ferrite particles in an epoxy matrix. Hybrid composites with a combination of soft magnetic ferrite and metallic magnetic fillers, anisotropic composites with magnetic field aligned fillers, and high magnetic anisotropic materials with multi-layered structures were all produced successfully. Developed materials showed superior electromagnetic properties to many competitor approaches for miniaturization and low profile antenna, especially for the case of magnetically anisotropic cast tiles. Secondly, a spray deposition approach was developed for the fabrication of large-scale nanocomposite polymer-based films. By incorporating Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles or multi-wall carbon nanotubes, as a thin sandwich layer into a <b>perfluoroalkoxy</b> (PFA) matrices respectively, 30 - 50 μm thick flexible multilayer nanocomposite films with enhanced dielectric and magnetic properties were produced. A broadband permittivity and permeability measurement technique was also developed for these films.

First, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the chemical modification which results from Na/naphth treatment were done using a range of derivatizations coupled with infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopic techniques. The etched layer thickness increased with treatment time, to over 300 nm after 4 hrs Na/naphth treatment. After 60 minutes treatment of a <b>perfluoroalkoxy</b> (PFA) film, the surface was defluorinated {{to a depth of}} 115 nm, with almost all the carbons in that region being functionalized in some fashion. Na/naphth treatment introduces C-H, C=O, C-OH, C≡C, and C=C functionalities in the surface of PFA. Carbonyl groups were present at 3. 3 × 10 - 9 equivalents/cm 2 of film surface, which, averaged over the 115 nm affected depth, is equivalent to about 0. 25 carbonyls per 100 carbons. The carbonyl content increased with increasing storage time in air. The other major functionalities were alkene (26 per 100 carbons), with a conjugation length of 10, alkyne (18 per 100 C), aliphatic CH (3. 5 per 100 C), hydroxyl (0. 30 per 100 C), and carboxylic acid (3 ̆c 0. 02 per 100 C). A comparison of the IR and XPS data shows that the unsaturation was distributed relatively uniformly through the 115 nm, while the carbonyl and hydroxyl species were concentrated in the top few nm. It was also found that the etching rate depended more strongly on the surface area of the fluoropolymer rather than on the fluoropolymer type or surface crystallinity. Of the materials studied, the etching rate increased with increasing surface roughness, but showed no correlation to amorphous and crystalline morphology. ^ Also the modification of the fluoropolymer surface by contact with a copper sheet was evaluated using XPS, IR-IRS and DRIFT techniques. An increase of the oxygen content and the carbon-carbon double bond group absorption were identified, but the depth of modification was much less than that of the Na/naphth treatment. ^ The interaction of the acid form sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) with metal oxides (iron oxide and copper oxide) was identified using IR-RAS and DRIFT. The interaction was identified as salt formation between SO 3 - of SPS and the metal oxide. By heating above Tg, the interaction between SPS and a steel shim was increased. ^ The above results can be used to optimize the adhesion of fluoropolymers and SPS to other polymers or metals. ...|$|E
