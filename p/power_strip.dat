5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom <b>power</b> <b>strip</b> to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E
25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a <b>power</b> <b>strip,</b> which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a <b>power</b> <b>strip</b> equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E
2500|$|To protect {{telecommunication}} lines, transient suppression {{devices such}} as 3 mil carbon blocks (IEEE C62.32), ultra-low capacitance varistors, and avalanche diodes are used. [...] For higher frequencies, such as radio communication equipment, a gas discharge tube (GDT) may be utilized. A typical surge protector <b>power</b> <b>strip</b> is built using MOVs. Low-cost versions may use only one varistor, from the hot (live, active) to the neutral conductor. A better protector contains at least three varistors; one across {{each of the three}} pairs of conductors. In the United States, a <b>power</b> <b>strip</b> protector should have an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1449 3rd edition approval so that catastrophic MOV failure does not create a fire hazard.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> have basic surge {{protection}} built in; these are typically clearly labeled as such. However, <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> {{that do not}} provide {{surge protection}} are sometimes erroneously referred to as [...] "surge protectors".|$|R
5000|$|Mains {{electrical}} power circuits are generally grounded (earthed), {{so there will}} be a live (hot) wire, a neutral wire, and a ground wire. Low-cost <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> often come with only one MOV mounted between the live and neutral wires. More complete (and desirable) <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> will have three MOVs, connected between each possible pair of wires. Since MOVs degrade somewhat each time they are triggered, <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> using them have a limited, and unpredictable, protective life. Some <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> have [...] "protection status" [...] lights which are designed to turn off if protective MOVs connected to the live wire have failed, but such simple circuits cannot detect all failure modes (such as failure of a MOV connected between neutral and ground).|$|R

5000|$|Many <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> have {{built-in}} surge protectors or EMI/RFI filters: {{these are}} sometimes described as surge suppressors or electrical line conditioners.

The standard covers both the performance of the {{surge suppression}} circuit and their safety.

50|$|Electrical {{overloading}} can be {{a problem}} with any sort of power distribution adapter. This is especially likely if multiple high-power appliances are used, such as those with heating elements, like room heaters or electric frying pans. <b>Power</b> <b>strips</b> may have a circuit breaker integrated to prevent overload. In the UK, <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> are required to be protected by the fuse in the BS 1363 plug. Some also feature a 13A BS1362 fuse in the socket end.|$|R

5000|$|Some <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> have {{energy-saving}} features, which {{switch off}} the strip if appliances go into standby mode. Using a sensor circuit, they detect if {{the level of}} power through the socket is in standby mode (less than 30 watts), and if so they will turn off that socket. This reduces the consumption of standby power used by computer peripherals and other equipment when not in use, saving money and energy. Some more-sophisticated <b>power</b> <b>strips</b> have a master and slave socket arrangement, and when the [...] "master" [...] socket detects standby mode in the attached appliance's current it turns off the whole strip.|$|R
