5|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} that set it {{apart from other}} species in the genus include the woody rhizome, undivided styles, and the operculate pollen. Droseraregia shares other features with the robust Tasmanian form of D.arcturi, including the lack of stipules and <b>petioles</b> and the non-circinate growth of the scape.|$|E
5|$|When applied through cut <b>petioles</b> in Petunia, HypSys did not {{induce the}} {{production}} of protease inhibitors, but instead increased expression of defensin, a gene which produces a protein that inserts into microbial membranes, forming a pore. Defensin expression is also induced by AtPEP1.|$|E
40|$|The submergence-tolerant species Rumex palustris (Sm.) {{responds}} to complete submergence {{by an increase}} in <b>petiole</b> angle with the horizontal. This hyponastic growth, in combination with stimulated elongation of the <b>petiole,</b> can bring the leaf tips above the water surface, thus restoring gas exchange and enabling survival. Using a computerized digital camera set-up the kinetics of this hyponastic <b>petiole</b> movement and stimulated <b>petiole</b> elongation were studied. The hyponastic growth is a relatively rapid process that starts after a lag phase of 1. 5 to 3 h and is completed after 6 to 7 h. The kinetics of hyponastic growth depend on the initial angle of the <b>petiole</b> at the time of submergence, a factor showing considerable seasonal variation. For example, lower <b>petiole</b> angles at the time of submergence result in a shorter lag phase for hyponastic growth. This dependency of the hyponastic growth kinetics can be mimicked by experimentally manipulating the <b>petiole</b> angle at the time of submergence. Stimulated <b>petiole</b> elongation in response to complete submergence also shows kinetics that are dependent on the <b>petiole</b> angle at the time of submergence, with lower initial <b>petiole</b> angles resulting in a longer lag phase for <b>petiole</b> elongation. Angle manipulation experiments show that stimulated <b>petiole</b> elongation can only start when the <b>petiole</b> has reached an angle of 40 ° to 50 °. The <b>petiole</b> can reach this “critical angle” for stimulated <b>petiole</b> elongation by the process of hyponastic growth. This research shows a functional dependency of one response to submergence in R. palustris (stimulated <b>petiole</b> elongation) on another response (hyponastic <b>petiole</b> growth), because <b>petiole</b> elongation can only contribute to the leaf reaching the water surface when the <b>petiole</b> has a more or less upright position...|$|R
5000|$|In botany, the <b>petiole</b> (...) is {{the stalk}} that {{attaches}} the leaf blade to the stem. The <b>petiole</b> is the transition between the stem and the leaf blade.

5|$|Petiolaris complex: A {{group of}} {{tropical}} Australian species, {{they live in}} constantly warm but sometimes wet conditions. Several of the 14 species that comprise this group have developed special strategies {{to cope with the}} alternately drier conditions. Many species, for example, have <b>petioles</b> densely covered in trichomes, which maintain a sufficiently humid environment and serve as an increased condensation surface for morning dew. The Petiolaris complex comprises the subgenus Lasiocephala.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{cultivated}} Cucurbita {{species has}} five-lobed or palmately divided leaves with long <b>petioles,</b> with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with {{various types of}} trichomes, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each node and are branching in some species. C.argyrosperma has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of C.pepo leaves varies widely. C.moschata plants can have light or dense pubescence. C.ficifolia leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species {{may or may not}} have white spots.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying <b>petioles</b> of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative humidity is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom primordia that are too wet become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause the caps to warp and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E

5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and <b>petioles</b> associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
5|$|In all {{subspecies}} but the type, {{the lower}} stamens are also hairy. In subsp. crassifolium, the hairiness is less dense and often {{absent from the}} upper part of the anthers, while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer <b>petioles.</b> In subsp. giganteum, the hairs are densely white tomentose, and lower leaves strongly decurrent. Subsp. crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20mm in diameter. Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, V.thapsus has had a great many subspecies described. A recent revision led its author to maintain V.giganteum but sink V.crassifolium into synonymy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of these species occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species seems to have taken place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the <b>petioles,</b> sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E

5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, <b>petioles</b> and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E

40|$|The <b>petiole</b> is a plant organ {{that connects}} the stem to the blade of a leaf. The <b>petiole</b> {{is made up of}} a fi brous {{biomaterial}} that consists of three integrated tissues. Each of these specializes in different functions, but they work together to provide basic needs, such as nutrient transport, food storage and plant support. From a structural viewpoint, the <b>petiole</b> resembles a cantilever that should resist wind torsion and gravity bending forces acting on the leaf blade. It has a solid cross-section with a grooved fl attened asymmetric shape with size decreasing lengthwise. As all plant organs, the <b>petiole</b> morphology is developed by adaptive growth, which is the plant response to environmental stimuli. Thus, the <b>petiole</b> grows a shape that best optimizes the use of vital resources. This paper focuses on the structural effi ciency of the shape <b>petiole</b> and it examines the capability of the <b>petiole</b> in reducing the wind drag without sagging under gravity forces. Continuum mechanics and dimensionless factors are used to model the twist-to-bend ratio. Twenty specimens of Polygonaceae Rheum rhabarbarum plants were investigated.
