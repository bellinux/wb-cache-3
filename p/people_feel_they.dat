500|$|Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan {{argued that}} Tamarod protests on 14 August {{had failed to}} live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was {{conflicting}} instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title [...] "Tamarod Storm". Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it [...] "physically impossible" [...] for big numbers to gather in one place. In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, [...] "when everyone listens to the voice of reason, when we reach compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored and when <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> are equal before law and that they all are first class citizens." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{television}} mini-series, The Legend of Billy Sing, was in post-production as of 2010. Despite {{some reports}} {{that it was}} based on Hamilton's book, the author maintained that he was never contacted by the film makers. Although Sing and his father were partly Chinese and fully Chinese, respectively, the mini-series portrayed them with actors of European ancestry. The director, Geoff Davis, was criticised for this decision. Politician Bill O'Chee, a member of the Billy Sing Commemorative Committee, said, [...] "When a person dies, all that is left is their story, and you can’t take a person’s name and not tell the truth about their story." [...] Davis has said, [...] "Whatever [...] genetic background, his culture was Australian. To me, he's very representative of every Australian whose parents were not born here. ... A lot of people are sitting at the back of this bus attacking the driver. A lot of <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> own the story of Billy Sing. But they've probably got more resources than me—if they want to tell that story, then tell it." ...|$|E
500|$|Okereke read Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle and Henri Lefebvre's Critique of Everyday Life, works which analyse {{how people}} {{experience}} leisure in modern societies, and {{was inspired to}} pen several songs which detail the drug and drink culture present in a metropolis. [...] "The Prayer" [...] is based on drug use during nights out in clubs, while [...] "On" [...] specifies the effects and after-effects of cocaine. Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people's actions, rather than moralising tales; he has stated, [...] "In a time when so many <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> can't communicate or feel hemmed in, I can see the appeal of cocaine." [...] "Sunday" [...] details the morning-after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out, while [...] "SRXT" [...] {{takes the form of}} a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis. The album closer is named after Seroxat, a trade name for the antidepressant paroxetine, and was crafted following the suicide attempts of two of Okereke's friends after they left university in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Psychological {{flexibility}} {{has been}} found to improve mental health and absence rates. A mediating variable is job control, which suggests that <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have more psychological flexibility when they have more control over their jobs. This is likely due to workers feeling less restricted by what they are allowed to do and more empowered to solve a problem. A longitudinal study on psychological flexibility and job control showed that these variables predicted workers’ mental health, job performance, and even their ability to learn new software. The study demonstrates the power of psychological flexibility in the workplace as psychologically flexible workers have better mental health and job performance. Allowing workers more job control would likely increase work productivity as it would increase the workers’ psychological flexibility. In leadership studies, flexibility, defined as [...] "the ability to get along with different groups and adapt to the demands of many organizations," [...] is one aspect of portability, or the ability to acquire skills and move from one company to the next.|$|E
60|$|She had {{remained}} at the house, {{not going to the}} Wheatsheaf, the Liberal inn, with the others; preferring to await in privacy and indeed in solitude the momentous result of the poll. She had come down to Harsh with the two girls {{in the course of the}} proceedings. Julia hadn't thought they would do much good, but she was expansive and indulgent now and had generously asked them. Lady Agnes had not a nice canvassing manner, effective as she might have been in the character of the high, benignant, affable mother--looking sweet participation but not interfering--of the young and handsome, the shining, convincing, wonderfully clever and certainly irresistible aspirant. Grace Dormer had zeal without art, and Lady Agnes, who during her husband's lifetime had seen their affairs follow the satisfactory principle of a tendency to defer to supreme merit, had never really learned the lesson that voting goes by favour. However, she could pray God if, she couldn't make love to the cheesemonger, and Nick felt she had stayed at home to pray for him. I must add that Julia Dallow was too happy now, flicking her whip in the bright summer air, to say anything so ungracious even to herself as that her companion had been returned in spite of his nearest female relatives. Besides, Biddy had been a rosy help: she had looked persuasively pretty, in white and blue, on platforms and in recurrent carriages, out of which she had tossed, blushing and making <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> would remember her eyes, several words that were telling for their very simplicity.|$|E

All these--the sort of people that lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to live down that way--they'd be no good. They haven't any spirit in them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one or the other--Lord! What is he but funk and precautions? They just used to skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world. Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on Sundays--fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well, the Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful. They'll be quite glad after a bit. They'll wonder what people did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar loafers, and mashers, and singers--I can imagine them. I can imagine them," [...] he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. [...] "There'll be any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There's hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that I've only begun to see clearly these last few days. There's lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, and that they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things are so that a lot of <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> ought to be doing something, the weak, and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always make for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and submit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you've seen the same thing. It's energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety. And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what is it?--eroticism." ...|$|E
