The Library additionally features a dedicated Electronic Research Room (ERR) for student use.In 1856-57 a collection of law books was purchased {{for the use of the}} students of the college at the suggestion of Mr. E.I. Howard, Bar-at-Law and the then Director of Public Instruction. But this could only be housed at the Native General Library at Dhobi Talao for the lack of space. Eventually, in 1891, Government Law School and its Library were accommodated in Elphinstone College Building at Kalaghoda and on 13 July 1891, the Government sanctioned a grant of Rs.2,000/- for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> and other equipment for the Law Library. Every Principal in its own way tried to enrich the library in order to make it useful to the students as well as to the practitioners. During his tenure Dr. B. R.

In the theoretical part there is an overview of the development of Estonian furniture market to show not only the state at the moment but also the movement and progress. While gathering the theoretical information, I found that there isn’t much research done on consumer behavior for furniture. But some finding from other product groups can also be applied for furniture. Standardized questionnaire was used and distributed through different forums. The selection consisted of 173 people from who 131 were women and 43 were men. The selection consisted of mainly people who had actively looked for furniture recently or at least thought about the subject. The conducted analysis concluded that the importance of different factors depends on the situation and the consumer, but it was possible to do some generalizations and conclusions. Also the importance of different factors has changed in time. Active internet users use mostly internet sources for finding information about furniture, but other channels are also used. The opinions of other people are also of some importance. Finding information about furniture from {{the internet}} was found rather easy, but there was some information which was hard to find.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the pieces of furniture apartment residents had purchased and their use of this furniture within the spatial limitations of their apartments. Comparisons were made between long-term and short-term apartment residents and respective demographic characteristics, furniture purchase patterns, attitudes toward the functional aspects of furniture, attitudes toward multifunctional furniture, and attitudes toward apartment living. A written questionnaire was developed by the investigator and personally administered to fifty-two couples in one- and two-bedroom units throughout two apartment complexes. Data obtained from the resulting twenty-five short-term residents and twenty-seven long-term residents were analyzed by frequency counts and percentages. Potentially significant relationships were tested by the use of the Chi-square statistic with the accepted level being. 05 or less. Analysis of the data indicated that there was an association between income level and the residency category of the respondents. Residents in the lowest income group were predominantly long-term and residents in the highest income group were mainly short-term. There was no association found between residency category and the demographic characteristics of age, education level or presence of children in the home. Similarly, no association was found between residency category and decision-making patterns in the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> degree of emphasis placed upon the functional characteristics of furniture, attitude toward multi-functional furniture, and attitude toward apartment living. These findings indicate that the two respondent groups were not unlike each other in most of the examined areas. Generally, the participants were under thirty-five and had a high level of education. They acquired most of their furniture by purchasing it new or used and gave new purchases a considerable amount of thought before making them. Although the functional aspects of furniture were rated high in importance, awareness of multi-functional pieces was limited. The majority of respondents felt that apartment living somewhat limited their chosen discretionary-time activities. Entertaining was primarily confined to meals for small groups and makeshift overnight accommodations for guests were more common than versatile or convertible situations...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the patronage and collecting of Alexander, l 0 th Duke of Hamilton, premier peer of Scotland, son-in-law of the maniacal collector William Beckford, and arguably the greatest collector {{in the history}} of Scotland. Using archival evidence from many sources, it begins with investigations of the Duke's early collecting of Italian Renaissance paintings and manuscripts, acquisitions associated with Russia between 1807 and 1814, involvement with Princess Pauline Borghese and the Bonaparte family, and <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> porphyry and marble in Rome between 1817 and 1827. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the extension and refurbishment of Hamilton Palace between 1822 and 1832 and parallel <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> furnishings and applied art. Special attention is paid to motivation and the acquisition of items from the Fonthill sale, tapestries made for Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, furniture owned by Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon's 1810 tea service, bronze statues (wrongly) associated with Francis I of France - which served to underline the Duke's status and "support" his claim to the French dukedom of Chatellerault - and porphyry busts of Roman emperors that were "superior" to the bronze copies in the British royal collection. Chapter 7 reviews the last grand projects: the extremely expensive great black marble staircase, planned equestrian monument of the Duke as Marcus Aurelius, and Hamilton Mausoleum. The final chapter concentrates on the later <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> Classical items and plaster copies, second marble bust of Princess Pauline, Thorvaldsen 's Napoleon Apotheosized, and Old Master paintings, and discusses how the Duke displayed his collection, in colourways, running sequences, clusters, and "end statements".

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Labels {{serve as}} a source of {{external}} information during the consumer decision–making process, and frequently contribute to consumers’ prior knowledge of different products as well as their search activities prior to <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> Labelling {{of a wide range of}} products, such as food and clothing has been investigated with regard to the effectiveness of the label, to convey information and draw consumers’ attention to the product, and the usage of the labels by consumers. However, no literature suggests the existence of labels with regard to furniture items, or consumers’ expectations about furniture labels. It is believed that labels on furniture items could assist consumers during the pre–purchase information search of the decision–making process. The current study investigated consumers’ expectations of furniture labels, during the pre–purchase information search of the consumer decision–making process, in order to propose furniture labels. The objectives of the study were to determine what questions regarding product information consumers frequently ask store assistants prior to furniture purchasing; to determine consumers’ expectations regarding furniture labels in terms of the product information on the label, the appearance of the label and the placement of the label on furniture items; and finally to suggest a preliminary furniture label according to consumers’ expectations. A mixed–method research approach was followed, using a two–phase exploratory design. Qualitative findings indicated that consumers enquire about the type of materials used for the manufacturing of furniture items, finishes used on items, quality, guarantees, warrantees, design, performance, maintenance, care instructions and colours of items. Similarly, quantitative results showed that the majority of respondents deemed the price, materials used, cleaning instructions, guarantee and warrantees important to be displayed on the furniture label. Appearance characteristics were summarised and preliminary furniture labels were suggested accordingly. These labels can be used by product developers, marketers, and the furniture industry to assist consumers during their pre–purchase information search of the consumer decision–making process.

Course code: 5 FE 07 E Semester: Spring 2017 Author: Juan Sebastian Duque L. Examiner: Saara Taalas Tutor: Soniya Billore Title: Social media influence Subtitle: Qualitative {{study of}} Colombian consumer attitude toward social media {{and its influence}} Background: The reason for conducting this master thesis {{in the field of}} Colombian consumer perspective and the influences on social media, was due to the realisation that there was a need for an increased understanding of the influences that social media is making on Colombian consumer. Besides, the main question is why Colombia? This country is a developing country that its level of growth in multiple sectors is remarkable. It is a market that is attracting multinational companies and expanding with prestigious national brands. The furniture industry {{is one of the most}} competitive businesses in this country, therefore using every single resource to acquire customers is a relevant aspect to take into consideration. However, the digital marketing and e- commerce are just emerging. Therefore, there is a need to understand how the Colombian consumer perceives and is influenced by the social media. Also, as Colombia is ranked number 15 with the most daily active users worldwide, meaning that the digital market on social media has a high potential. Colombian consumers are different than European consumer regarding online and social media purchase. Therefore, it is important to understand their attitudes and cognition about this subject. Research question: Q 1 : How do Colombian consumers perceive the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> products through social media? Q 2 : In which way social media influence Colombian consumer’s attitudes toward purchasing furniture? Purpose: Identify what is the Colombian consumer’s attitude and perception toward purchase furniture through social media. Also, recognising how does social media influence Colombian consumer attitudes toward buying furniture. Method: The research design was qualitative and abductive manner. The empirical data was collected through Semi-structure interviews. It was essential for this study to settle in the ontological part as consumers’ behaviour was examined. Conclusion: This research found that Colombian consumers have a negative attitude towards social media. Nevertheless, this first attitude tends to change when it comes to the influences that social media have in their final decision making when purchasing furniture. Also, the Colombian consumer is seeking for information on social media for every purchase they make. Reviews are a key aspect that they take into consideration when purchasing an item of furniture. These reviews have the power to influences their perception of products and their final decision either to positive or negative. ...|$|E
5000|$|The Sierra Club, an {{environmental}} organization, argues that secondhand <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> is the [...] "greenest" [...] way of furnishing a home. Used clothing is often donated to charities which sort and distribute {{it to people}} on low incomes for free or a very low price. Rather than distributing the clothing directly, some organizations will sell collected clothing in bulk to a used clothing redistributor, and then use the raised funds to finance either their charitable or for-profit activities, as they see fit. [...] Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as Zambia, secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled and sometimes redistributed to other nations. Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions which enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent {{a great source of}} employment for women as well as men, it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for costumers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations. The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries. [...] A Dress Agent will often deal with a consumer buyer and seller directly, taking unwanted clothes that still have value, and reselling them in a shop.|$|R
