25|$|Rousseau {{continues}} {{to say that}} though Greek and Roman society functioned well with tragic and violent content in theatres because {{it was part of}} the traditions specific to the time and place, <b>putting</b> <b>these</b> plays in a French context would be far more dangerous. However, tragedies are not as dangerous as comedies, because the characters more closely resemble French citizens.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{magnetic}} field {{is applied to}} the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and <b>putting</b> <b>these</b> degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the {{magnetic field}} is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.|$|E

The total land area of the city is recorded to be 142,099.99 hectares or 1,420.99 kilometers.

25|$|Al-Maqrizi notes, that Khufu {{was named}} Saurid, Salhuk and/or Sarjak by the biblical Amalekites.

Another nightmare showed the stars falling down from heaven and kidnapping humans, then <b>putting</b> <b>these</b> beneath two large mountains. King Khufu then received a warning from his prophets about a devastating deluge, that would come and destroy Egypt.

25|$|With core ideas down, the {{remaining}} Titan team began <b>putting</b> <b>these</b> {{together as a}} prototype to present to management. They took the classes they had made for Titan and remade these as Heroes, giving them core abilities from the Titan skill set they believed worked best together, and developing backstory and personality for the heroes. Existing art assets from Titan for the various player avatars were also reused and refined to create {{the appearance of the}} heroes. The initial gameplay used maps they had developed for Titan along with Tracer, one of the reworked Titan heroes; at that point, they had not included any animations so Tracer would fire by shooting lasers out of her eyes. The prototype proved successful within Blizzard, and the team was given the greenlight to proceed. Overwatch became Blizzard's second attempt at launching a new franchise since StarCraft in 1998. Some of the additional heroes came from the classes they created for the Crossroads concept as well as the Starcraft tie-in that they brainstormed prior to settling on Overwatch.|$|E

500|$|Expecting {{to show a}} new {{and more}} mature side visually, TLC were in Los Angeles {{discussing}} about the project when a Matthew Rolston-directed music video for Salt-N-Pepa came on. [...] "We were looking at it and said, 'Whoever did this video has to do the 'Creep' video. We {{fell in love with the}} way it was shot," [...] Thomas said. Often times, she remembered the video that they were seeing was [...] "Whatta Man", however, during their interview with MTV in 1995, the show cited [...] "None of Your Business", a video which was also done by Rolston and had more visual similarities to the final [...] "Creep" [...] video. Lopes also recalled the moment: [...] "We were very, very adamant about redoing the 'Creep' video because we were coming back out [...] And we were like, 'Look at that video Salt-N-Pepa got. Man, we're going to kick nobody's butts <b>putting</b> <b>these</b> videos out. [...] is budi, [...] is whack, we've got to do it over.'" [...] Their management team then suggested going back to the editing room to find better shots and have the video redone, but group declined and said: [...] "There is no better shot." [...] Initially, TLC reached out to Rolston and set up the third version's shooting in LA.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Logan, in his memoirs, {{stated that}} {{after months of}} effort {{in the first half}} of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics. [...] Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of {{knowledge}} of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help. [...] The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract <b>putting</b> <b>these</b> changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director. Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum. [...] Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960). [...] Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when South Pacific was filmed in 1958, as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director. According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, [...] "it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for. [...] Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent. [...] But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of South Pacific would have collapsed during that summer of 1948." ...|$|E
