40|$|Instead of «ground truth» precipitation, rain gauges at {{meteorological}} stations estimate {{a function}} of several variables. In addition to precipitation, these variables include temperature, wind, humidity, gauge type, state of the gauge exposure, and observational practices. Their impact and changes hamper our efforts to estimate precipitation changes alone. For example, wind-induced negative biases for snowfall measurements are higher than for other precipitation types and a redistribution of these types during regional warming can cause an artificial increase in measured precipitation. In such conditions, {{the only way to}} properly estimate actual climatic changes of precipitation would be a use of <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series that are corrected for all known systematic biases. Methodology of such corrections has been developed and recently implemented for Northern Eurasia for the past 50 + years (up to 2010).

50|$|In {{the case}} of RESS, the {{supercritical}} fluid is used to dissolve the solid material under high pressure and temperature, thus forming a homogeneous supercritical phase. Thereafter, the mixture is expanded through a nozzle to form the smaller particles. Immediately upon exiting the nozzle, rapid expansion occurs, lowering the pressure. The pressure will drop below supercritical pressure, causing the supercritical fluid - usually carbon dioxide - {{to return to the}} gas state. This phase change severely decreases the solubility of the mixture and results in precipitation of particles. The less time it takes the solution to expand and the solute to precipitate, the narrower the particle size distribution will be.

40|$|Internal {{friction}} and dynamic elastic modulus of cold drawn dilute AlCr and AlMn alloys were investigated by an inverted pendulum in as received and precipitated state. Internal friction peaks of not relaxational character and modulus increases {{occur on the}} spectra of AlCr alloys. The effects are attributed to the primary and secondary recrystallization during the measurement. Increasing the Cr content up to the solubility limit the temperature range of recrystallization processes is shifted by about 100 K upwards. This effect is considerably smaller than it was found for the dilute AlMn alloys. Investigating the recrystallization behaviour of AlMn and AlCr samples in precipitated state we found that in certain cases the precipitations have a well detectable influence on the recrystallization temperature. This result was confirmed by measurements made after different <b>precipitation</b> <b>times</b> at given temperature...|$|R
30|$|In particular, {{the effect}} of CdTe surface {{enrichment}} with Te, well-known for bulk CdTe crystals and thin films [49], can be even more probable for NC due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and surface curvature. Thus, the sample # 641 can have some radial composition inhomogeneity, with Te enrichment towards surface and therefore a reduced volume of pure (stoichiometric) CdTe. The reasons are the small time precipitation of Cd at its relatively small (compared to other samples) excess in the parental solution (2 : 1). For # 621 obtained at the same <b>precipitation</b> <b>time,</b> the Cd deficiency is, probably, not realized due to higher Cd/Te ratio - 7 : 1. On the other hand, for # 642 with even slightly smaller Cd/Te ratio (1 : 1), no noticeable composition inhomogeneity occurs due to longer <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> - 20 s.|$|E
40|$|Urban water {{infrastructure}} has very long planning horizons, and planning is thus very dependent on reliable {{estimates of the}} impacts of climate change. Many urban water systems are designed using time series with a high temporal resolution. To {{assess the impact of}} climate change on these systems, similarly high-resolution <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series for future climate are necessary. Climate models cannot at their current resolutions provide these time series at the relevant scales. Known methods for stochastic downscaling of climate change to urban hydrological scales have known shortcomings in constructing realistic climate-changed <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series at the sub-hourly scale. In the present study we present a deterministic methodology to perturb historical <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series at the minute scale to reflect non-linear expectations to climate change. The methodology shows good skill in meeting the expectations to climate change in extremes at the event scale when evaluated at different timescales from the minute to the daily scale. The methodology also shows good skill with respect to representing expected changes of seasonal precipitation. The methodology is very robust against the actual magnitude of the expected changes as well as the direction of the changes (increase or decrease), even for situations where the extremes are increasing for seasons that in general should have a decreasing trend in precipitation. The methodology can provide planners with valuable time series representing future climate that can be used as input to urban hydrological models and give better estimates of climate change impacts on these systems...|$|E

40|$|Precipitation is {{the most}} active flux and major input of {{hydrological}} systems. Precipitation controls hydrological states (soil moisture and groundwater level), and fluxes (runoff, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge). Hence, precipitation plays a paramount role in urban water systems. It controls the fluxes towards combined sewer tanks and the dilution of chemical and organic compounds in the wastewater. Furthermore, small catchments (i. e., areas of about 20 ha) have a fast response to precipitation. Therefore, catchment average precipitation is a key component in urban water models. However, average catchment precipitation is not always accurately known when measured at rain gauges, because {{the location of the}} gauge might be outside the catchment boundaries or does not reflect the entire catchment. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a method to estimate the precipitation in a catchment given a known <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series at a location outside of the catchment, while quantifying the uncertainty associated with the estimation.

By contrasting the trends of natural water process in headstream and mainstream, we found that it was anthropogenic activities not climate change that caused the river dried up and vegetation degenerated in the lower reaches of Tarim River. The results of gray correlation analysis show that the runoff of higher latitude distributing river is more closely associated with winter snow stocking, while that of lower latitude is more closely related to summer temperature. Runoff in the headstream is more sensitive to precipitation, while that in the mainstream is more sensitive to evaporation. The strong evaporation caused by increasing temperature weakened runoff to some extent {{in spite of the fact}} that precipitation increased over the past 50 years...|$|E

The generation of runoff is triggered by the rain intensity and soil moisture status, and is calculated as the net <b>precipitation</b> <b>times</b> a runoff coefficient, which depends upon slope, land use and soil type. The runoff is routed through the basin along flow paths determined by the topography using a diffusive wave transfer model, that enables to calculate response functions between any start and end point, depending upon slope, flow velocity and dissipation characteristics along the flow lines. All these calculations can be performed with standard GIS tools. The model is tested on a catchment in Belgium for which topography and soil data are available in GIS form, while the land-use and soil cover is obtained from remote sensed images. The resulting calculated discharges compare favourably with measurements, without any need to model optimisation.

40|$|Quantifying {{the effects}} of future changes in the {{frequency}} of precipitation extremes is a key challenge in assessing the vulnerability of hydrological systems to climate change but is difficult as climate models do not always accurately simulate daily precipitation. This article compares the performance of four published techniques used to reduce the bias in a regional climate model precipitation output: (1) linear, (2) nonlinear, (3) γ -based quantile mapping and (4) empirical quantile mapping. Overall performance and sensitivity to the choice of calibration period were tested by calculating the errors in the first four statistical moments of generated daily <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series and using a cross-validation technique. The study compared the 1961 – 2005 <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series from the regional climate model HadRM 3. 0 -PPE-UK (unperturbed version) with gridded daily <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series derived from rain gauges for seven catchments spread throughout Great Britain. We found that while the first and second moments of the precipitation frequency distribution can be corrected robustly, correction of the third and fourth moments of the distribution is much more sensitive to the choice of bias correction procedure and to the selection of a particular calibration period. Overall, our results demonstrate that, if both precipitation data sets can be approximated by a γ -distribution, the γ -based quantilemapping technique offers the best combination of accuracy and robustness. In circumstances where precipitation data sets cannot adequately be approximated using a γ -distribution, the nonlinear method is more effective at reducing the bias, but the linear method is least sensitive to the choice of calibration period. The empirical quantile mapping method can be highly accurate, but results were very sensitive to the choice of calibration time period. However, it should be borne in mind that bias correction introduces additional uncertainties, which are greater for higher order moments...|$|E
40|$|For derived flood {{frequency}} analysis based on hydrological modelling long continuous <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series with high temporal resolution are needed. Often, the observation network with recording rainfall gauges is poor, especially regarding the limited {{length of the}} available rainfall time series. Stochastic precipitation synthesis is a good alternative either to extend or to regionalise rainfall series to provide adequate input for long-term rainfall-runoff modelling with subsequent estimation of design floods. Here, a new two step procedure for stochastic synthesis of continuous hourly space-time rainfall is proposed and tested for the extension of short observed <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series. First, a single-site alternating renewal model is presented to simulate independent hourly <b>precipitation</b> <b>time</b> series for several locations. The alternating renewal model describes wet spell durations, dry spell durations and wet spell intensities using univariate frequency distributions separately for two seasons. The dependence between wet spell intensity and duration is accounted for by 2 -copulas. For disaggregation of the wet spells into hourly intensities a predefined profile is used. In the second step a multi-site resampling procedure is applied on the synthetic point rainfall event series to reproduce the spatial dependence structure of rainfall. Resampling is carried out successively on all synthetic event series using simulated annealing with an objective function considering three bivariate spatial rainfall characteristics. In a case study synthetic precipitation is generated for some locations with short observation records in two mesoscale catchments of the Bode river basin located in northern Germany. The synthetic rainfall data are then applied for derived {{flood frequency}} analysis using the hydrological model HEC-HMS. The results show good performance in reproducing average and extreme rainfall characteristics {{as well as in}} reproducing observed flood frequencies.
