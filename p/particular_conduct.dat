30|$|Conducting {{polymers}} {{have some}} attractive electrical, chemical, and mechanical properties, {{which lead to}} unique advantages for various applications, such as electronic devices, supercapacitors, actuators, and sensors. In <b>particular,</b> <b>conducting</b> polymers have great potential as efficient chemical sensors and biosensors due to the affinity of the conducting polymer for various molecules, easy immobilization of the receptor, and biocompatibility [24 – 26]. Micro- and nanoscale needles, such as a conducting polymer sensor, {{can be used to}} probe and monitor microenvironments, such as the intracellular environment [27]. As illustrated in Figure 4 b, we successfully coated a polypyrrole (PPy) film on a CNT nanoneedle by electrochemical deposition. The advantage of this method is the potential to control the film thickness by the total charge passed through the electrochemical cell during film production, and to immobilize the receptor during the electrochemical polymerization process.|$|R

Our electrode coatings, prepared by galvanostatic electropolymerisation, significantly reduced the impedance magnitude at frequencies relevant to neural cells, relative to uncoated gold Mylar electrodes (24 3 U at 1 kHz). Cyclic voltammetry was used to explore the electrochemical stability of the coatings, which lose only 23 2 % charge carrying capacity when subjected to 400 redox cycles.
