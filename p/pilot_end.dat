40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a <b>pilot</b> <b>end</b> use water consumption study conducted on the Gold Coast, Australia. Specifically, it aimed to explore the degree of influence of household socioeconomic regions and resident type on end use water consumption levels. Data analysis revealed that higher socioeconomic regions had lower levels of water consumption. End use analysis demonstrated that clothes washing consumption decreases with increasing socioeconomic status and that dishwashing and tap use were unaffected by socioeconomic region. Moreover, the study revealed that households with couples consumed significantly more water on a litre per capita per day basis, than those with families or share houses. Recommendations for further study into the impact of a range of collected socioeconomic and demographic factors on end use water consumption levels are outlined.

50|$|On 12 April 1945 a {{bulletin}} was received from First Air Force re-designating Oscoda AAF as a sub-group of Selfridge, and directing that Oscoda be utilized {{in the future}} as a bombing and gunnery range by Selfridge Field. Training of the French <b>pilots</b> <b>ended</b> and most USAAF personnel were transferred out.|$|R
500|$|To pay for {{construction}} of new planes at his factory, Longren performed frequently at airshows. Barnstorming before crowds across the U.S., he became a popular attraction in his own right, nicknamed [...] "Birdman".

50|$|In his {{subsequent}} life Titov {{continued to work}} for the Soviet space program, playing a major role in Spiral project where he trained to become the first pilot of an orbital spaceplane. However, after the death of Yuri Gagarin in a military aircraft accident in 1968 the Soviet government decided it couldn't afford to lose its second cosmonaut, and so Titov's career as test <b>pilot</b> <b>ended.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{dangerous}} pilot-induced oscillations can occur during landing. Too much up elevator during the flare {{can result in}} the plane getting dangerously slow and threatening to stall. A natural reaction to this is to push the nose down harder than one pulled it up, but then the <b>pilot</b> <b>ends</b> up staring at the ground. An even larger amount of up elevator starts the cycle over again.|$|R
5000|$|James Lindsay Travers (1883-1924) was an {{engineer}} and designer {{who worked for the}} Royal Engineers Balloon Factory and Short Brothers before serving in the RNAS during World War I as a test <b>pilot,</b> <b>ending</b> the war as a lieutenant-colonel in the RAF.

50|$|Decoupled Debit {{gained the}} {{attention}} of the financial services industry in May 2007 when Capital One announced they were going to add a decoupled debit card product. At the time Capital One did not offer checking accounts—only credit cards and this was a strategy to offer a debit card without actually owning the checking account relationship. The one year <b>pilot</b> <b>ended</b> without Capital One citing specific reasons as why, leaving the industry with only speculation as to why.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, NewsTrust piloted a Baltimore-specific site {{focused on}} news local to Baltimore.

50|$|The major idea {{underlying}} the Green Deal is the “pay as you save” principle, whereby a homeowner gets renovation works {{performed by a}} contractor, and then pays the costs according to the amount saved on its energy bill. Pilot programs took place from the 2008 up until mid-2011. When the Pay As You Save (PAYS) <b>pilot</b> <b>ended,</b> the government implemented the “Green Deal”, introducing various new measures: the “Golden Rule” (whereby repayments must not exceed energy savings), financing linked to the energy bill, obligation for the energy suppliers to adapt their billing system to collect repayments, and introduction of the “Energy Company Obligation” (ECO).|$|R
50|$|With {{the sudden}} Japanese {{surrender}} in early August 1945, ordered were received from III Fighter Command that training of replacement <b>pilots</b> was to <b>end.</b> <b>Pilots</b> already in training {{were allowed to}} complete their training, however no new trainees would arrive. By the end of August, the students were being reassigned to other bases, {{and the number of}} base support personnel were being reduced at a rapid rate.|$|R
25|$|The origin {{is similar}} to the one in the {{original}} film as Peyton discovers his synthetic skin, is attacked and left for dead by Durant and his gang. In this version, however, Peyton is already married to Julie, and she is killed in the explosion. As in the films, Westlake becomes the Darkman, and seeks vengeance on Durant and his gang. Darkman's headquarters are in an abandoned observatory overlooking the city, and he is wanted by the police for his actions against Durant's gang. The <b>pilot</b> <b>ends</b> with some scenes from the first film (particularly of Darkman and Durant fighting) and Darkman stating that Justice will answer with a brand new face.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, the EU {{initiated}} the NewsPad program, {{with the aim}} of developing a common mechanism to author and deliver news electronically to consumer devices. The program's name and format were inspired by the devices described and depicted in Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film: 2001: A Space Odyssey. Acorn won a contract to develop a consumer device / receiver, and duly supplied a RISC OS based touch-screen tablet computer for the pilot. The device measured 8.5 xx 11 in and was being trialled in 1996 in Spain by Ediciones Primera Plana. The Barcelona-based <b>pilot</b> <b>ended</b> in 1997, but the tablet format and ARM architecture may have influenced Intel's 1999 WebPad / Web Tablet program.|$|R

Oesau led Stab./JG 1 and I./JG 1, Major Bär led II./JG 1, and accompanied by I./JG 11 and III./JG 54 they initially intercepted sixteen B-17s of 100th Bomb Group who were escorted by P-47s of the 78th Group. Ten B-17s {{went down in the}} first wave, and in several waves of attacks on the bombers from multiple directions most of the <b>pilots</b> <b>ended</b> up exhausting their ammunition, resulting in twenty bombers being shot down in the 25 minutes before the escorting P-47s arrived.|$|R
40|$|With the {{establishment}} of a European E-Health Network, the European Union would like to improve citizens' health by making life-saving information available using E-Health tools, to make E-Health tools more effective, user friendly, and widely accepted by involving professionals and patients in strategy, design and implementation of the network, and to increase healthcare quality and access by making E-Health a part of the European health policy and managing cross national political, financial, and technical strategies on E-Health. In this study, the epSOS project of the European Union on establishing an EU-wide E-Health network was analyzed, main challenges highlighted, and the limitations evaluated.
