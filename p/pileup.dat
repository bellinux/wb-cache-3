5|$|Stewie hitches a {{ride with}} a trucker and so Brian follows {{him all the way}} to Canada. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic <b>pileup</b> by {{discharging}} a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, corecing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.|$|E
5|$|The Route 23 <b>pileup</b> {{scene was}} {{included}} in the lists of best car crashes or disaster scenes by Screen Junkies, Made Man, Unreality Magazine, All Left Turns, Chillopedia, Filmstalker, io9, UGO Entertainment, Filmcritic.com, and New York Magazine. Filmsite.org enlisted all fatalities in its Best Film Deaths Scenes. The demise of Kirk's character entered these listings of the most shocking deaths on film: George Wales of Total Film (#28), James Eldred of Bullz-Eye.com (#20), and Jeff Otto of Bloody Disgusting (#9).|$|E
50|$|Other {{explanations}} {{that have}} been proposed to rationalize the apparent softening of metals with nanosized grains include poor sample quality and the suppression of dislocation <b>pileups.</b>|$|R
50|$|On March 14, 2002, {{a sudden}} heavy fog played havoc with morning traffic {{and contributed to}} one of the worst traffic <b>pileups</b> in history; 125 {{vehicles}} crashed on Interstate 75 North and four people died.|$|R
50|$|In Lancaster, {{two people}} died after the {{snowmobile}} they were riding on {{collided with a}} moving vehicle at an intersection. In Clearfield County, two <b>pileups</b> involving about 25 vehicles on snowy Interstate 80 left at least one man dead and 18 people injured.|$|R
5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, they are involved in a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the <b>pileup,</b> meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{one year}} after the {{explosion}} of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman. On route, Kimberly has a premonition of logs falling off a semi, causing a massive car accident that kills everyone involved. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis; widow Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim; businesswoman Kat Jennings; stoner Rory Peters; pregnant Isabella Hudson; high school teacher Eugene Dix; and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the <b>pileup</b> occurs. Shaina, Dano and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck, but Kimberly is saved by Thomas.|$|E
5|$|On lap17, Paul Menard, with {{assistance}} from Tony Stewart, {{took the lead}} from Labonte. Montoya and Jamie McMurray passed him and Stewart {{for the first and}} second positions four laps later. On lap 22, Harvick's engine failed, allowing the third caution to come out. During the caution, most of the front runners made pit stops under caution for mostly fuel, while some decided to change tires. Afterward, Clint Bowyer lead on the restart. He remained leading the next two laps, while Earnhardt, Jr. moved to the 5th position. On lap29, Reutimann and Michael Waltrip collided, causing a multi-car <b>pileup,</b> involving 17drivers, including three of the four drivers from Hendrick Motorsports: Johnson, Martin, and Gordon. Some of the drivers who have led made pit stops during the caution, while McMurray and Montoya out in front as the race restarted lap35.|$|E
50|$|During this time, Zayre faced several challenges. In {{the first}} half of 1988, Zayre stores had {{operating}} losses of $69 million on sales of $1.4 billion. Observers blamed technological inferiority, poor maintenance, inappropriate pricing, and inventory <b>pileups,</b> and Zayre appeared ripe for takeover. Throughout all this, however, The TJX Companies subsidiary continued to yield a profit.|$|R
5|$|The {{section of}} Highway401 between Windsor and London {{has often been}} {{referred}} to as Carnage Alley, in reference to the numerous crashes that have occurred throughout its history. The term became more commonplace following several deadly <b>pileups</b> during the 1990s. The narrow and open grass median was an ineffective obstacle in preventing cross-median collisions. The soft shoulders consisted of gravel with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers.|$|R
25|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} in McKeesport were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, {{as a result of}} improper usage of a generator after a power outage. A Canonsburg man was found dead {{at the bottom of a}} snow-covered staircase. Twenty five vehicles were involved in two separate <b>pileups</b> on Interstate 80, killing one and injuring eighteen. Two were killed in Lancaster when their snowmobile was struck at an intersection.|$|R
5|$|As {{they had}} been {{compromised}} by the first lap <b>pileup</b> and were {{at the back of}} the field, Dillmann and Coletti chose to make their mandatory pit stops when the window opened at the end of the seventh lap for rear soft compound tyres. Haryanto and Abt made their stops on the next lap and Calado and Lancaster did the same on lap nine. Coletti's early pit stop resulted in him lapping faster than any other driver by two seconds. Other drivers became aware of the significance and Nasr went into the pit lane to keep his position from Calado and Ceccon and Richelmi did the same on the eleventh lap. This placed pressure on race leader Evans who was at this point three seconds a lap slower than Ceccon. Evans made his own pit stop on lap 12 for four soft compound tyres but did not retain first place as Ceccon made up enough time to move in front of him. Evans could not keep close to Ceccon and was three seconds behind the driver after one lap and his diminishing pace hurt the delayed Bird who became the leader when Evans made his pit stop. On lap 15, De Jong made a problematic pit stop: his rear jack failed which delayed him and then crossed the yellow line at the pit lane exit twice, earning him a drive-through penalty.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets 41–21 at Chicago's Soldier Field {{to extend the}} team's winning streak to four games. The Browns scored a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two more in the second. The team led 27–0 at the half. Chicago, however, started to come back in the third quarter after Cleveland coach Paul Brown took out most of his first-string players. Graham, Colella, Lew Mayne and Ed Ulinski sat out most of the game. Chicago quarterback Sam Vacanti threw three touchdown passes in the second half to give the Rockets 21 points, but a score by Cleveland's Boedeker and a fumble return for a touchdown by Spiro Dellerba kept the game out of reach. The Rockets' Bill Kellagher intercepted one of Graham's passes in the first quarter, ending Graham's streak of 91 straight pass attempts without an interception, a professional football record at the time. Chicago had the best passing performance against the Browns of any team the Browns had faced in 1947 as Vacanti threw for 195 yards on 11 completions. Groza kicked through two field goals and five extra points in the game, putting him in third place in scoring in the AAFC behind Motley and New York's Spec Sanders. Motley suffered a head injury during a <b>pileup</b> in the second quarter and was taken to the locker room.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Daytona, Earnhardt was {{involved}} in an early 16-car <b>pileup</b> on the front straightaway on lap 20, but was able to salvage a 14th-place finish {{by the time the}} race was called for rain after 112 of 160 laps.|$|E
50|$|CHiPs is {{an action}} crime dramedy. Over-the-top freeway <b>pileups,</b> which {{occurred}} frequently, {{especially in the}} later seasons, were a signature of the show. There was little violence on CHiPs, and the show can be classified as a light drama. The episodes filled a standard hour-long time slot, {{which at the time}} required 48 minutes of actual programming. For filming, traffic on Los Angeles freeways was non-existent and most chase scenes were done on back roads, usually dirt roads.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{the race was}} often {{ridiculed}} and exploited by local media for its frequent crashes and massive <b>pileups.</b> Several major accidents and fires over the years were blamed on {{the low level of}} experience by several of the drivers, and the older equipment used. The level of prestige held by the event, along with the relatively large purses, attracted numerous independent and one-off entries, contributing to the inexperience of drivers in the field.|$|R
40|$|Internal {{friction}} {{associated with}} dislocation mobility {{can be classified}} into three catagories : (1) Those originated from the intrinsic properties of single dislocations; (2) those originated from the interaction between dislocations and point defects; (3) those originated from dislocation climb and from the coorperative behavior of groups of dislocations (e. g., dislocation <b>pileups,</b> grain boundaries, subgrain boundaries, etc.) which give rise to relaxation phenomena only at higher temperatures. It seems, thus, the topic of internal friction associated with high temperature dislocation mobility (Theme 3) should include catanory (3) and part of catagory (2) concerning with the dislocation-point-defect interaction at high temperatures. The term "high temperature" used here may {{be defined as the}} range of temperature at wich the pinning points or "atmosphere" concerned are "mobile" and migrate with dislocations. The papers of Theme 3 may be discussed under the following headings : I. Mobile pinning points migrating with dislocations; II. dislocation <b>pileups</b> and dislocation climb; III. grain boundary relaxation; IV. high temperature properties of solids related to dislocation mobility at high temperatures. Various models and viewpoints have been proposed by different authors and it is highly interesting to start a critical discussion...|$|R
25|$|On February10, 2008, {{whiteout}} conditions {{caused a}} 36-car <b>pileup</b> near the Scottsville Road exit, {{which led to}} a 17-year-old girl's death. Firefighters had to climb over cars and cut off roofs to get to people. More than 20 people were taken to the hospital.|$|E
25|$|For the Las Vegas race in 2011, GoDaddy {{created a}} {{promotion}} wherein driver Dan Wheldon {{would have won}} $2.5m each for himself and fan Ann Babenco if he won the race, starting from last place. A 15-car <b>pileup,</b> 12 laps into the race, injured 4 drivers and killed Wheldon.|$|E
25|$|At Talladega, Busch led two laps {{and was in}} the top-ten on lap 182 when he was {{collected}} in a large <b>pileup</b> on the back straightaway. He took the worst damage in the crash, as J.J. Yeley got loose from contact with Ricky Stenhouse, Jr., went across the track and hit him with enough force that Busch turned sideways, flipped over once, and landed on top of Ryan Newman, then slid off Newman and struck the outside wall, and was hit again by Clint Bowyer and Bobby Labonte. Busch was uninjured.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} loading rate {{effect on the}} {{mechanical}} behavior of zirconia using nanoindentation and in situ scanning probe imaging techniques. Nanoindentation tests were performed at a peak load of 10 mN and 0. 1 – 2 mN/s loading rates. The {{results show that the}} contact hardness increased by 31 % with the loading rate while the Young׳s modulus was loading rate independent (ANOVA, p> 0. 05). A strain rate sensitivity model was applied to determine the strain rate sensitivity and the intrinsic contact hardness. A pressure-sensitive idealized yield criterion model was applied to analyze the pressure hardening coefficient and the intrinsic compressive yield stress. Extensive discontinuities and largest maximum and contact depths were also observed on the force–displacement curves at the lowest loading rate. These phenomena corresponded to nanoindentation-induced strain softening. The in situ scanning probe images of indentation imprints showed plastic deformation without fracture at all loading rates and dislocation-induced <b>pileups</b> around indentation imprints at the low loading rate. The amount of <b>pileups</b> decreased with increase in loading rate. Finally, these results provide scientific insight into the submicron material removal mechanisms for zirconia during sharp abrasive machining...|$|R
40|$|The {{grain size}} and strain {{dependence}} of work hardening in Type 304 L stainless steel were analyzed between 200 and 250 K where hydrogen damage is greatest. Tensile {{data were obtained}} for specimens of several grain sizes, both with and without prior exposure to hydrogen gas at 69 MPa pressure. The analysis suggests that hydrogen has little influence on lattice friction stress but has a large effect on dislocation interaction and the back stress of dislocation <b>pileups.</b> This report discusses this study...|$|R
5000|$|A Fine Mess {{received}} heavily negative reviews (Rotten Tomatoes gave it an insufficient score), {{including one}} from The New York Times, which stated [...] "Mr. Edwards, who on happier occasions {{gave us the}} Pink Panther movies, piles on the <b>pileups</b> until you may suspect that {{he is trying to}} distract the audience from the absence of a diverting story or dialogue. The 11 musical numbers by some well-known performers (available, you can bet, on record and cassette) seem designed for the same purpose." ...|$|R
25|$|Australian ABC radio {{reported}} on September 24, 2008, that Armstrong would {{compete in the}} UCI Tour Down Under through Adelaide and surrounding areas in January 2009. UCI rules say a cyclist {{has to be in}} an anti-doping program for six months before an event, but UCI allowed Armstrong to compete. He had to retire from the 2009 Vuelta a Castilla y León during the first stage after crashing in a rider <b>pileup</b> in Baltanás, Spain, and breaking his collarbone. Armstrong flew back to Austin, Texas, for corrective surgery, which was successful, and was back training on a bicycle within four days of his operation.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2009, Tony Eury Jr. {{was let go}} as {{crew chief}} of the No. 88 team. Lance McGrew was named interim crew chief and was {{scheduled}} to take over, starting with the June 2009 Pocono Race with team manager Brian Whitesell calling the shots at Dover the previous week. McGrew was scheduled to work with Brad Keselowski at Dover, but after a failed qualifying attempt by Keselowski, {{was able to take}} on his duties for the No. 88 team a week early. Dale Jr. managed to finish 12th at Dover for the Autism Speaks 400 with his new crew chief after contending for the lead. At Pocono Raceway, however, he again ended with a 27th-place finish. After the change in crew chiefs, Earnhardt was consistently better, finishing fifteenth at Chicagoland Speedway; however, during that time he also had one DNF at Daytona International Speedway where he was taken out of the race early in a large <b>pileup.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the season-opening Daytona 500, Earnhardt began well, even leading for a lap. However {{multiple}} misfortunes, {{including a}} missed pit stop and a 1-lap penalty for pitting {{outside of his}} pit box, sent him far {{into the back of}} the running order. Earnhardt was then directly involved in a controversial crash on lap 124, when, while fighting to return to the lead lap, he came in contact with Brian Vickers while fighting to be the first driver one lap down (who gets a free pass should the caution flag come out), causing a 10-car <b>pileup</b> which included Denny Hamlin, Scott Speed, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle and Kurt Busch, Robby Gordon, Jamie McMurray, and Carl Edwards. Vickers and Kyle Busch later criticized Earnhardt, who denied purposely clipping Vickers. Earnhardt criticized Vickers for blocking him on the inside. When the race concluded early due to the rain, Earnhardt ended with a 27th-place finish. Earnhardt later apologized for his actions but maintains to this day that he never intended to wreck Vickers.|$|E
30|$|However, upon further {{inspection}} of the data, {{it is possible to}} find clues, pointing towards a distributed attack. The span between the first rollback and the start of the large attack a 4 is the time during which the alleged crowdsourced attack is most likely to have happened. Incidentally, it is also during this span that the behavior of users deviates most from the norm. This change in behavior is characterized by a high number of <b>pileups,</b> high user MPS and a low total number of moves.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{deformation}} {{is expected}} to be an alternative route for synthesizing nanocrystalline/amorphous matrix composites. However, it is found that nanocrystalline/amorphous Al 90 Fe 5 Gd 5 Al 90 Fe 5 Gd 5 composites produced by cold rolling have lower hardness than the as-spun, fully amorphous, alloy. Much smaller <b>pileups</b> are observed around indents in rolled samples than in the as-spun sample. Combining high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with Fourier transform and image filtering, many nanovoids are observed in the shear bands near the boundary with the undeformed matrix...|$|R
5000|$|Baltimore's police {{officers}} sympathized with other city workers, increasing their readiness to strike. The municipal strike—with garbage <b>pileups</b> and rioting inmates—also created {{an atmosphere of}} crisis, in which the role of police would be especially conspicuous. On July 6, the union formed a Steering Committee, with 84 members, to plan job actions intended to pressure the city for negotiations. According to the findings disclosed by a 1977 court case, these actions had [...] "tacit approval" [...] from Commissioner Pomerleau, who also wanted the city to negotiate further.|$|R
25|$|At Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr. {{came home}} with another third-place finish and at Las Vegas, he {{finished}} fourth, scoring his third Top 5 finish after taking two tires during green flag pit-stops with 30 laps to go. At Phoenix, he had his worst finish of the year, with a last place finish after a tire-blowout. At Auto Club, he finished 6th. At Martinsville, he also ran inside the Top 20 until a tire-blowout made him {{get involved in a}} massive <b>pileup</b> that destroyed the front end of his car. Because of this crash, he would go on to finish 36th. At Texas, he narrowly was beaten by Kevin Harvick for second place. At Bristol, he ran as high as third until a loose wheel put him down two laps down. Although he never got them back, he was able to bring home a 16th-place finish only two laps down. At Richmond, he ran in the Top 10 all day until he and Tony Stewart made contact but managed to finish 14th.|$|E
25|$|The No. 36 team {{returned}} for 2005, expanding Said's schedule {{to a minimum}} of 10 races beginning with the Daytona 500. Like the 10 team which was co-owned by Valvoline executive James Rocco, sponsor Centrix's owner and racing enthusiast Bob Sutton came on as an equity partner for the 36 car, changing the team name to MB Sutton Motorsports. Said had stated {{that he would have}} liked to drive the car on a full-time basis if sponsorship was found. Veteran crew chief Frankie Stoddard would lead the 36 team. Said ultimately attempted 12 races, struggling on oval tracks, with a best finish of 27th at Daytona and Texas and three DNQs. He did run well at Talladega in May, qualifying 12th and running in the top 15 before a 25-car <b>pileup</b> ended his day with 35 laps remaining. Boris was, however, strong as always in his road course element. At Sonoma in June, Said was running well when he entered the pits while they were closed after a caution was thrown with 40 laps to go. Sent back to 32nd place, he made it up to 13th place with 10 laps to go, but was relegated to a 17th-place finish after a caution with 7 laps to go. Said shined later in the year at Watkins Glen, starting 41st after qualifying was rained out, and racing with NASCAR Road Course aces Tony Stewart and Robby Gordon for the win. Said would score a career-best 3rd-place finish. Said left the team to drive for No Fear Racing in the No. 60 Ford in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with Autosport magazine, Villeneuve's manager Craig Pollock confirmed that Villeneuve's Formula One career was over. It was announced on August 24, 2007 that Villeneuve would run the remaining seven {{races in the}} Craftsman Truck Series driving a Toyota Tundra for Bill Davis Racing and undertake a full-time Sprint Cup Series schedule in 2008. In Villeneuve's first Truck Series race on September 22, 2007, in Las Vegas Motor Speedway, he qualified in seventh position, and finished 21st. He made his NASCAR Nextel Cup race debut in the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama over the weekend of October 5–7, 2007. He qualified sixth, however, due to his lack of experience {{in this type of}} car, he elected to start the race {{from the back of the}} field and ran there for most of the race. He finished 21st due to a large number of accidents and mechanical failure on the other cars. Villeneuve failed to qualify for the 2008 Daytona 500. He lost his ride in Bill Davis Racing's No. 27 car due to a loss of sponsorship, two days after he caused a <b>pileup</b> in his qualifying race, when his car got loose, then slid back up the track, colliding with another car. He took part in the Nationwide race in Montreal for Braun Racing. The race started off in the sun, but before halfway, it began to rain and the teams were told to pit and use rain-tires, for the first time in NASCAR. Qualifying 5th, Villeneuve finished 16th after crashing into a car during a caution caused by poor visibility due to the rain. The race ended shortly after.|$|E
25|$|On September 27, 2010, RIM {{announced}} the long-rumoured BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, the first product {{running on the}} new QNX platform known as BlackBerry Tablet OS. The BlackBerry PlayBook was officially released to U.S. and Canadian consumers on April 19, 2011. The PlayBook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly. Following the shipments of 900,000 tablets during its first three quarters on market, slow sales and inventory <b>pileups</b> prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the inventory value by $485 million.|$|R

The giving of challenges for a game and the erection of goalposts and players' benches involved rituals and ceremonies, [...] "superstitions" [...] and [...] "sorceries," [...] in the view of Father Pavia. The Apalachee expanded the superstitions to include Christian elements; after losing two games in a row, one village decided that was because their mission church was closed during the games.
