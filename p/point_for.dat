40|$|There are {{thirteen}} {{types of}} singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> irreducible real quartic curves and seventeen types of singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> reducible real quartic curves. This classification is originally due to D. A. Gudkov. There are nine types of singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> irreducible complex quartic curves and ten types of singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> reducible complex quartic curves. There are 42 types of real singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> irreducible real quintic curves and 49 types of real singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> irreducible real quintic curves. The classification of real singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> irreducible real quintic curves is originally due to Golubina and Tai. There are 28 types of singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> irreducible complex quintic curves and 33 types of singular <b>points</b> <b>for</b> reducible complex quintic curves. We derive the complete classification with proof {{by using the}} computer algebra system Maple. We clarify that the classification is based on computing just enough of the Puiseux expansion to separate the branches. Thus, the proof consists of a sequence of large symbolic computations that cam be done nicely using Maple...|$|R
