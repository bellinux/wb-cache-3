Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol (the letters USB over a drawing of a battery); the feature is simply called <b>Power-off</b> USB.

25|$|In {{early summer}} 2014, the AW609 {{performed}} FAA-monitored autorotation tests; more than 79 <b>power-off</b> conversions from airplane mode to helicopter mode were made across 10 flight hours; during these tests it was {{stated that the}} minimum autorotation altitude is , and that the system keeps rotor RPM above the minimum 70% for stable recovery.

25|$|During the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation, no {{evidence}} of failure or malfunction of the aircraft or any of its systems prior to the crash was found. Further examination of the engine found approximately five fluid ounces of jet fuel in the entire fuel system and that the engine had flamed out due to fuel starvation. The final report from the NTSB lists the probable causes as improper in-flight decisions and mismanagement of fuel by the pilot in command which led to fuel exhaustion. Also listed was improper operation of flight controls during the <b>power-off</b> autorotation.|$|E
25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during <b>power-off.</b> In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E

2500|$|PMPs {{are capable}} of playing digital audio, images, and/or video. Usually, a colour liquid crystal display (LCD) or organic {{light-emitting}} diode (OLED) screen {{is used as a}} display for PMPs that have a screen. Various players include the ability to record video, usually with the aid of optional accessories or cables, and audio, with a built-in microphone or from a line out cable or FM tuner. Some players include readers for memory cards, which are advertised to equip players with extra storage or transferring media. In some players, features of a personal organiser are emulated, or support for video games, like the iriver clix (through compatibility of Adobe Flash Lite) or the PlayStation Portable, is included. [...] Only mid-range to high-end players support [...] "savestating" [...] for <b>power-off</b> (i.e. leaves off song/video in progress similar to tape-based media).|$|E

50|$|This {{has also}} been a problem with the Inspiron 1150, with the same chip giving {{problems}} with broken solder. Re-soldering is not recommended.

In two series of tests of the SharkPOD, data were collected on {{the time needed to}} attack the bait, under <b>power-off</b> and power-on (active) conditions. Conclusions were separately drawn after completion of the first experiment (in which 8 attacks were successful in 98 five-minute active periods), and after completion of the second experiment (in which no successful attacks were recorded in 24 ten-minute active periods). In general, the probability of an attack in at most 5 minutes was reduced from about 0.70 in <b>power-off</b> mode to about 0.08 in power-on mode and in a period of at most 10 minutes from 0.90 to 0.16.|$|E

Also, interrupts are used in typeahead features for buffering events like keystrokes.|$|E
