Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love.

5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in <b>particular</b> <b>is</b> {{the generation of}} the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E

5|$|Hamurabi in <b>particular</b> <b>is</b> mostly {{known for}} its {{appearance}} in Ahl's book. The original game, a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management, was developed by Doug Dyment at DEC in 1968 as The Sumer Game. Dyment created it as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title over the old. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Magical Zoo's The Screamer was a bio-horror RPG {{released}} for the NEC PC-88 {{that was}} set in a post-apocalyptic research facility, while the gameplay featured shooter-based combat and permanent death.

5|$|Mauna Loa {{continued}} its activity, {{and of the}} eruptions that occurred in 1887, 1892, 1896, 1899, 1903 (twice), 1907, 1914, 1916, 1919, and 1926, three (in 1887, 1919, and 1926) were partially subaerial. The 1926 eruption in <b>particular</b> <b>is</b> noteworthy for having inundated of a village near Hoopuloa, destroying 12 houses, a church, and a small harbor. After an event in 1933, Mauna Loa's 1935 eruption caused a public crisis when its flows started to head towards Hilo. A bombing operation was decided upon to try and divert the flows, planned out by then-lieutenant colonel George S. Patton. The bombing, conducted on December 27, was declared a success by Thomas A. Jaggar, director of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, and lava stopped flowing by January 2, 1936. However, the role the bombing played in ending the eruption has since been heavily disputed by volcanologists. A longer but summit-bound event in 1940 was comparatively less interesting.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in <b>particular</b> <b>is</b> extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
