40|$|Venous {{hemodynamics}} {{were evaluated}} by plethysmography in normal sub-jects and patients with venous disorders of the lower extremity, to clarify the pathophysiology of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) due to <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Expelled volume during five active dorsiflexions of the feet and venous recovery time were calculated to evaluate muscle pump efficiency and valvular competence. Limbs with CVI due to <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> showed a higher expelled volume and a more shortened refilling time than limbs with simple varicosities. With application of tourniquets, the refilling time normalized in limbs with CVI, {{as well as in}} limbs with simple varicosities. These results indicate that a high degree of venous congestion in the distal part of the calf and valvular incompetence of the superficial vein system might cause CVI due to <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractAims: we {{suspected}} incompetent perforating {{veins of}} having {{a role in the}} development of recurrent varicose veins in some patients. The aim was to look for an association between perforators and recurrent varicose veins. Methods: a consecutive group of patients presenting with varicose veins were examined using colour duplex ultrasonography by an experienced vascular technologist. Pathological perforating veins were defined as those exhibiting bi-directional flow and a diameter of 4 mm or greater at the fascia. Results: between September 1998 and July 1999, 204 patients were examined. <b>Primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were found in 198 legs (135 patients) and recurrent varicose veins in 91 legs (69 patients). In patients with <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> 88 (44 %) had incompetent perforators compared to 57 (63 %) of those with recurrent varicose veins (Chi-squared, p < 0. 005). Also, for recurrent varicose veins, the percentage of patients with any given number of incompetent perforators was higher than for <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Overall, there was a higher number of incompetent perforators in those with recurrent veins compared to primary veins and this difference was significant at 95 % confidence interval. Conclusion: patients with recurrent varicose veins have both a higher prevalence and a greater number of incompetent perforating veins than patients with <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|E

Materials:one hundred and eleven consecutive patients (142 legs) with <b>primary,</b> uncomplicated <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Methods: legs were examined clinically, with HHD and duplex ultrasonography {{on the same day}} at the outpatient clinic. The plan for the subsequent treatment was recorded separately after each examination. Results: at the sapheno-femoral junction and at the sapheno-popliteal junction, the sensitivity was 56 and 23 %, the specificity 97 and 96 %, the positive predictive values was 98 and 43 %, the negative predictive value was 44 and 91 %, and the Kappa coefficient was 38 and 24 %, respectively. Clinical examination failed to correctly plan the treatment in 21 (26 %) of 80 proposed operations. In 13 limbs (9. 1 %) the HHD-based treatment plan was modified on the basis of duplex ultrasound findings. In seven cases, patients would have undergone only stab avulsion procedure, whereas stripping of a saphenous vein was indicated on the basis of duplex ultrasound findings. In two other cases, HHD findings would have led to resect the wrong saphenous vein. In six cases, the treatment was wrongly planned because of assessment problems during HHD examination at the popliteal fossa. Conclusions: the accuracy of HHD in the preoperative evaluation of <b>primary,</b> uncomplicated <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> is unsatisfactory.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Disordered {{programmed}} {{cell death}} {{may play a role}} in the development of superficial venous incompetence. We have determined the number of cells in apoptosis, and the mediators regulating the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in specimens of varicose vein. METHODS: Venous segments were obtained from 46 patients undergoing surgical treatment for <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Controls samples were obtained from 20 patients undergoing distal arterial bypass grafting surgery. Segments of the distal and proximal saphenous trunk as well as tributaries were studied. Cell apoptoses and mediators of the mitochondrial and trans membrane pathway were evaluated with peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection, Bax and Fas detection, caspase- 9 and 8 detection in the medial layer. RESULTS: Disorganised histological architecture was observed in varicose veins. <b>Primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> also contained fewer peroxidase in situ-positive cells than control veins (2. 6 % S. D. 0. 2 % versus 12 % S. D. 0. 93 %, P=. 0001, Mann-Whitney u test), fewer Bax positive cells (2. 1. % S. D. 0. 3 % versus 13 % S. D. 0. 9 %, P=. 0001) and fewer Caspase 9 positive cells (3. 2 % S. D. 1 % versus 12 % S. D. 1. 3 %, P=. 0001). Similar findings were observed in saphenous trunk, main tributaries and accessory veins. In patients with recurrent varicose veins in whom the saphenous trunk had been preserved showed similar findings to <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Residual varicose veins contained fewer peroxidase in situ-positive cells than healthy veins (3. 2 % S. D. 0. 6 % versus 11 % S. D. 2 %, P=. 0001), fewer Bax positive cells (2. 2 % S. D. 0. 3 % versus 12 % S. D. 0. 7 %, P=. 0001) and fewer Caspase 9 positive cells (2. 6 % S. D. 0. 6 % versus 12 % S. D. 1 %, P=. 0001). Immunohistochemical detection for Fas and caspase 8 remained equal was the same in the varicose vein and control groups. CONCLUSION: Apoptosis is down regulated in the medial layer of varicose veins. This dysregulation is attributable to a disorder of the intrinsic pathway and involves the great saphenous vein trunk, major tributaries and accessory veins.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possible long-term clinical advantages of stripping the long saphenous <b>vein</b> during routine <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. Methods: The study was designed as a 5 -year, clinical and duplex scan follow-up examination of a group of patients who were randomized to stripping of the long saphenous <b>vein</b> during <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery versus saphenofemoral ligation alone. The study was conducted in the vascular unit of a district general hospital. One hundred patients (133 legs) with uncomplicated <b>primary</b> long saphenous <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> originally were randomized. After invitation 5 years later, 78 patients (110 legs) underwent clinical review and duplex scan imaging. Results: Sixty-five patients remained pleased with the results of their surgery (35 of 39 stripped vs 30 of 39 ligated; P =. 13). Reoperation, either done or awaited, for recurrent long saphenous veins was necessary for three of 52 of the legs that underwent stripping versus 12 of 58 ligated legs. The relative risk was 0. 28, with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 13 to 0. 59 (P =. 02). Neovascularization at the saphenofemoral junction was responsible for 10 of 12 recurrent veins that underwent reoperation and also was the cause of recurrent saphenofemoral incompetence in 12 of 52 stripped veins versus 30 of 58 ligated legs. The relative risk was 0. 45, with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 26 to 0. 78 (P =. 002).

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{observational study}} of 63 legs in 49 patients was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} adequacy of <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery performed by surgical trainees. Appropriate surgery {{was carried out by}} a surgical senior house officer (SHO) under direct consultant supervision. All patients underwent pre- and postoperative duplex scanning. The preoperative duplex scan demonstrated incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) or long saphenous vein (LSV) in 59 limbs, a mid-thigh perforator (MTP) in 11 limbs, and saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) in 5 limbs. Surgery successfully abolished all sites of pre-existing reflux. The postoperative duplex scan revealed that 17 new sites of reflux, not identified preoperatively, had developed in 12 limbs. With a consultant-led service and accurate preoperative identification of sites of reflux, the surgical trainee can adequately perform <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery.

40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> wall {{weakness}} and dilatation {{are thought to}} be caused by various biochemical and structural changes. Hypoxia and mechanical stress have been postulated to contribute to <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> wall changes. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are nuclear transcriptional factors that regulate the transcription of genes of oxygen homoeostasis. The HIF pathway is regulated by factors including oxygen tension and mechanical stress. The study aimed to assess the expression of HIF and its target genes in <b>varicose</b> and non-varicose <b>veins,</b> and examine their regulation by hypoxia, mechanical stress and pharmacological agents. Structural variations between <b>varicose</b> and non-varicose <b>veins</b> were demonstrated using histological analysis with special stains. Increased mRNA and protein expression of HIF- 1 α, HIF- 2 α and their target genes was found in varicose compared to non-varicose veins. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that HIF- 1 α was only expressed in some endothelial cells, whereas HIF- 2 α was more widely expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of <b>varicose</b> and non-varicose <b>veins.</b> Furthermore, a vein organ culture model was prepared and validated. Exposure of <b>varicose</b> and non-varicose <b>vein</b> organ cultures to 16 hours of 1 % oxygen or the hypoxia mimetic dimethyloxallyl glycine up-regulated the expression of HIF- 1 α, HIF- 2 α proteins, and their target genes. Micronised purified flavonoid fraction at a concentration corresponding to therapeutic dose appeared to reduce the increases in expression of HIF- 1 α, HIF- 2 α, and their target genes in <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> organ cultures exposed to hypoxia, although the reduction was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, doxycycline at a concentration corresponding to therapeutic dose did not alter the expression of HIF- 1 α, HIF- 2 α, and their target genes in <b>varicose</b> and non-varicose <b>vein</b> organ cultures exposed to hypoxia. In rat inferior vena cava model, prolonged increases in vein wall tension were associated with over expression of HIF- 1 α and HIF- 2 α. The up-regulation of HIF- 1 α and HIF- 2 α secondary to prolonged increases in vein wall tension was associated with elevated MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 expression and changes in venous tone. In conclusion, HIF-α and target genes expression is increased in varicose compared to non-varicose veins. The expression of HIF-α and target genes in venous tissues appeared to be regulated by hypoxia and mechanical stress. The data suggest that the HIF pathway may be an important regulator of various biochemical and structural changes in <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> wall.

40|$|CONTEXT: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} improvement of venous hemodynamics after surgical treatment of <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> of the lower extremities using air plethysmography (APG). PURPOSE: To correlate the venous hemodynamics obtained by APG with the CEAP classification after surgical treatment of <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> METHODS: We studied 63 limbs of 39 patients (35 women and 4 men) aged on average 46. 3 years, operated upon at the University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, {{during the period from}} January 2001 to December 2004. The 63 limbs were divided into the three following groups according to CEAP classification: group C 2 + C 3 (38 limbs), group C 4 (15 limbs) and group C 5 + C 6 (10 limbs). The patients were evaluated clinically before and 30 to 40 days after surgery by preoperative duplex ultrasonography and pre- and postoperative APG. RESULTS: There was an apparent hemodynamic improvement after surgical treatment of the varicose veins in the two groups of lower severity, but the improvement was significant in the most severe group based on venous filling index.

40|$|AbstractObjective: {{this study}} was {{designed}} to assess if the use of a sterile exsanguination tourniquet (Boazul cuff) reduced blood loss from the groin and avulsion wounds during <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery, (saphenofemoral disconnection, stripping to knee and multiple avulsions). Design: prospective, parallel cohort study. Materials: thirty-eight patients undergoing <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. Methods: the blood loss and number of avulsion wounds were recorded for each patient. Results: the tourniquet was used on 21 legs and there were 24 legs in the non-tourniquet group. In the tourniquet group, the median blood loss from the groin was 15 ml, (range 5 – 70 ml), and from the leg was 5 ml, (range 0 – 120 ml). The corresponding figures for the group without the tourniquet were a median of 17. 5 ml, (range 5 – 105 ml), and a median of 95 ml, (range 10 – 505 ml). The mean number of avulsions in the tourniquet group was 25 (range 9 – 38), and in the non-tourniquet group was 15, (range 5 – 40). There was significantly less blood loss from the leg in the tourniquet group (p< 0. 0001) despite the fact that there were more avulsions in the tourniquet group (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: use of the Boazul cuff significantly decreases the blood loss from the avulsion sites during routine <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery, and may encourage the surgeon to perform more avulsions...|$|R

MethodsThe original study was designed as a randomized trial of 100 patients (133 legs) who underwent saphenofemoral ligation with or without long saphenous vein stripping. After invitation 11 years later, 51 patients (74 legs) underwent clinical review and duplex imaging and completed an Aberdeen <b>Varicose</b> <b>Vein</b> Symptom Severity Score (AVVSSS). The hospital notes of the original cohort of patients were used to compile cumulative data and assess predictive factors. ResultsA cumulative total of 83 legs had developed clinically recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> by 11 years (62 %). There was no statistically significant difference between the ligation-only and the stripping groups. Reoperation was required for 20 of 69 legs that underwent ligation alone compared with 7 of 64 legs that had additional long saphenous vein stripping (relative risk [RR], 2. 65; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 20 to 5. 84; P =. 012). By life table analysis, freedom from reoperation at 11 years was 70 % after ligation, compared with 86 % after stripping (P =. 01). The presence of neovascularization (RR, 2. 88; P =. 15), an incompetent superficial vessel in the thigh (RR, 3. 24; P =. 03) or an incompetent saphenofemoral junction on duplex imaging at 2 years postoperatively (RR, 4. 89; P =. 0001) increased the risk of a patient's developing clinically recurrent veins.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Arteriovenous (AV) {{shunting}} {{has been}} postulated as {{the underlying cause}} of varicose veins. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse pressure and oxygen content in <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> in order to determine evidence of arterial shunting. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with varicose veins underwent cannulation of varicosities. The pressure and the blood oxygen content within varicosities were measured in different positions and during exercise. Similar measurements were made in the long saphenous veins of 10 control subjects without venous disease. RESULTS: Mean pressure in varicose veins in the supine position was 12. 3 mmHg (Standard deviation [SD] 3. 6 mmHg). Control subjects had similar pressures measured in the long saphenous vein. No pulsatile pressure tracings were obtained. Varicosity pressures in the erect position averaged 66 mmHg (SD 9 mmHg). In all cases, the pressure correlated with the distance of the varicosity from the heart. Pressure reduction in varicosities after exercise was significantly less than that in control subjects. Recovery time (RT 90) was also significantly shorter than in the control group. Mean venous pO 2 in varicosities was 4. 5 kPa (SD 1. 0) in the supine position dropping to 3. 9 kPa (SD 0. 9) on standing; these values were not significantly different to samples from control subjects.

We compared the frequencies of c. 677 C>T and another polymorphism of MTHFR, c. 1298 A>C, with morphology and types of complicated disease. Morphology was recorded as a trunk or perforator type and peripheral congestive complication was defined as chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP C 3 - 6) associated with edema and skin manifestations. Findings: Multivariate analysis of genotypes for c. 677 C>T and c. 1298 A>C indicated that c. 677 C>T was associated significantly with the trunk phenotype (43 / 53 patients, 81 %, p C was associated significantly with the perforator phenotype (18 / 24 patients, 75 %, p T and c. 1298 A>C displayed a heterozygous genotype, the patients {{were more likely to}} present with both phenotypes.

Some authors have reported that reflux in the superficial venous system accounts for 40 - 60 % of leg ulcers in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Objective: To evaluate the correlation between superficial venous reflux and clinical status (CEAP classification - clinical, etiology, anatomy and pathophysiology) in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> of the lower limbs using duplex scanning. Method: A cross-sectional and descriptive study was performed in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Primary variables were venous reflux and clinical status. Clinical status was characterized by groups A, B, and C, represented by CEAP clinical categories. Types of venous reflux in the great and small saphenous veins were used as complementary data, according to Engelhorn&# 8217;s classification (2004). Hypotheses of interrelationship between incidence and types of reflux were statistically analyzed using Fisher&# 8217;s exact and chi-square tests. Significance was set at 0. 05 %. Results: Of 242 lower limbs, 15 were excluded, so that the final sample was comprised of 227 lower limbs. Ninety-nine (83. 9 %) patients were female. Mean age was 50 years and median was 49 years. Reflux was absent in 93 limbs (41 %), and 134 (59 %) showed isolated and/or associated reflux.

For almost 100 years, the traditional surgical treatment of varicose veins in the UK and most countries has been ligation of the sapheno-femoral junction, stripping and phlebectomies.

40|$|ObjectiveVaricose vein {{recurrence}} {{after surgery}} occurs {{in up to}} 60 % of patients. A variety of technical factors have been implicated, but biological factors such as neovascularization have more recently been proposed. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to recurrence in a large prospective series of recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> MethodsDuplex and operative findings were recorded prospectively in a consecutive series of 500 limbs undergoing surgery for recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> between 1995 and 2005 in a university teaching hospital. Only limbs with previous saphenofemoral junction surgery were included. All limbs had preoperative duplex mapping by an accredited vascular technician who assessed the status of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in the thigh and groin, sought sonographic evidence of neovascularization, and reported on the presence of reflux in the short saphenous vein and perforator sites (typical and atypical). All operations were performed with an attending vascular surgeon as the lead operator. ResultsPrimary GSV surgery was incomplete in 83. 2 % of limbs. A completely intact GSV system was present in 17. 4 % of limbs. An incompetent thigh saphenous vein was present in 44. 2 % of limbs, 37. 6 % had GSV stump incompetence with one or more intact tributaries, and 16 % had both a residual thigh GSV and an incompetent stump with intact tributaries. Non-GSV sites of reflux were identified in 25 % of limbs. Neovascularization was identified on duplex scanning in 41 (8. 2 %) limbs. However, in 27 of these, surgical exploration revealed a residual GSV stump with 1 or more significant tributaries. Each of the remaining 14 (2. 8 %) limbs had a residual incompetent thigh GSV. ConclusionsDespite reports to the contrary, neovascularization occurs in a relatively small proportion of patients with recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> All recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> associated with duplex-diagnosed neovascularization are also associated with persistent reflux in the GSV stump tributaries, thigh GSV, or both. Recurrence after <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery is associated with inadequate primary surgery or progression of disease, and neovascularization alone is not a cause of recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|R

These were seldom mentioned in referral letters, and included fears about thrombosis (31 %), trauma (16 %), ulcers (15 %) and general concerns about the future (57 %).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{diagnosis}} and outcome of a haemodynamic strategy {{for the treatment of}} <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> associated with anterograde diastolic flow (ADF) in the Giacomini vein (GV). MethodsADF in the GV, with the escape point located at the saphenopopliteal junction, was demonstrated in 15 patients (15 limbs) by duplex ultrasound. No other escape points were seen in this group. ADF was defined as the flow present in the relaxing phase after isometric contraction of the lower limb, measured in the standing position. Duplex and clinical follow-up was performed prospectively at 1 week, at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and once per year thereafter, between 1998 and 2001. Surgery consisted of flush division of the GV from the small saphenous vein (SSV) and division of the incompetent collateral veins from the GV. ResultsGV diameter showed an average reduction from 6 to 4 mm 33 months after surgery. Fourteen patients (93 %) showed no symptoms or varicose veins. GV reconnection and recurrent ADF was demonstrated in two patients (13 %). ConclusionsADF is a rare condition associated with <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> ADF occurs when there is a closed venovenous shunt with recirculation in the muscular diastole. This implies that, although a part of the circuit is ascendant, the re-entry point must be located downstream to the scape point. Accurate duplex assessment is required to distinguish this atypical haemodynamic condition from an abnormal systolic circuit bypassing a deep vein obstruction. Interruption of the GV above its junction with the SSV abolished ADF with an acceptable rate of recurrences...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivePrevious animal {{models of}} venous disease, while {{inducing}} venous hypertension and valvular insufficiency, {{do not produce}} superficial <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize a pig-based model of superficial <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> MethodsRight femoral arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) were surgically fashioned in young adult pigs. Animals were examined at postoperative times up to 15 weeks to determine the development of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> and measurement of both blood pressure and flow velocities within the superficial thigh veins. Histology and vascular corrosion casts were used to characterize the resulting structural venous alterations. Porcine pathophysiological features were {{compared with those of}} human <b>primary</b> superficial <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> ResultsGross superficial varicosities developed over the ipsilateral medial thigh region after an initial lag period of 1 - 2 weeks. Veins demonstrated retrograde filling with valvular incompetence, and a moderate, non-pulsatile, venous hypertension, which was altered by changes in posture and Valsalva. Venous blood flow velocities were elevated to 15 - 30 cm/s in <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Structurally, pig <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were enlarged, tortuous, had valvular degeneration, and regions of focal medial atrophy with or without overlying intimal thickening. ConclusionsThe superficial <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> which developed within this model, have a pathophysiology that is consistent with that observed in humans. The porcine femoral AVF model is proposed as a suitable experimental model to evaluate the pathobiology of superficial venous disease. It may also be suitable for the evaluation of treatment interventions including drug therapy. Clinical RelevanceSuperficial <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> do not form spontaneously in lower animals. This represents a considerable barrier to the development and assessment of phlebotropic pharmacological agents. The development and physiological characterization of a reproducible experimental animal model, which develops a vascular pathology that closely mimics human venous disease, may represent a considerable advance in this field...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and economical {{impact of a}} fast-track anaesthesia protocol {{in the management of}} <b>primary</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> (VV) surgery. METHODS: Over a 10 -month period (from 1 December 2009 to 30 September 2011), all patients eligible for open VV surgery (N = 176) were enrolled in a fast-track clinical pathway including titrated analgo-sedation combined with local anaesthesia. This fast-track cohort was compared with a historical cohort undergoing similar procedures and receiving general anaesthesia (GA) or spinal anaesthesia (SA) (between 1 December 2009 to 30 September 2011, N = 200). The length of stay in the operating facilities and postoperative recovery areas were reported and hospital costs were estimated. In addition, the occurrence of adverse events and unplanned hospital admission were compared between the two consecutive periods. RESULTS: Patients characteristics and surgical procedure were not different in the two cohorts. After implementation of the fast-track pathway, the incidence of postoperative adverse events decreased from 41 % to 2. 3 %, with no need for overnight hospital stay (0 % versus 7 %). The reduction in anaesthesia-controlled time (- 47 %) and in postoperative recovery time (- 61 %) were associated with an increased operating capacity (1 extra case per day) and with substantial cost-savings (mean reduction of € 312 per case, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a fast-track pathway for outpatient VV surgery was successful, safe and efficient. Analgo-sedation combined with infiltrative anaesthesia (instead of GA or SA) contributed to increase the operating capacity and to reduce the workload of nursing personnel...|$|R
