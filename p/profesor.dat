40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of <b>Profesors</b> Sanford Klein and Douglas Reindl; 189 pp. A computer simulation program was developed to model {{the performance of a}} side-by-side refrigerator-freezer unit. The program, which employs a quasi steady-state model, is able to predict the refrigeration capacity, compressor power consumption, on cycle time and off-cycle time of the freezer and refrigerator cycles to within 6 % accuracy (maximum deviation from the measured value). To enable an accurate prediction of the parameters in the model, the program relies on the input of, among others, the overall heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) of the condenser and evaporators in the system. Since the UA values of these heat exchangers were not readily available from the refrigerator manufacturer, a set of experiments was performed to measure them. The scope of this experiment was later broadened by performing the UA measurements over a range of different airflow rates to allow a study on the accurate sizing of these heat exchangers. Using this computer program, a number of proposals with the potential of enhancing the performance of the system were evaluated. Specifically, the benefits of mechanical subcooling and the advantages of using a two-stage system as opposed to the present two single-stage cycles were investigated. In addition to these proposals, a detailed study was also conducted on the benefits of using suction-line heat exchangers and the use of mullion tubes to prevent sweating on the outer surfaces of the refrigerator cabinet; suction-line heat exchangers and mullion tubes are currently installed in this refrigerator. In the study of mullion tubes, a comparison was made between the use of these tubes and electric heaters to determine the more economical method to prevent sweating.

40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years, dynamic {{analysis}} of shells {{has been one}} of the most fascinating fields for research. Using the new light materials the building engineer soon discovered that the subsequent reduction of gravity forces produced not only the desired shape freedom but the appearance of ecologic loads as the first factor of design; loads which present strong random properties and marked dynamic influence. On the other hand, the technological advance in the aeronautical and astronautical field placed the engineers in front of shell structures of nonconventional shape and able to sustain substantialy dynamic loads. The response to the increasingly challenger problems of the last two decades has been very bright; new forms, new materials and new methods of analysis have arosen in the design of off-shore platforms, nuclear vessels, space crafts, etc. Thanks to the intensity of the lived years we have at our disposition a coherent and homogeneous amount of knowledge which enable us to face problems of inconceivable complexity when IASS was founded. The open minded approach to classical problems and the impact of the computer are, probably, important factors in the Renaissance we have enjoyed these years, and a good proof of this are the papers presented to the previous IASS meetings as well as that we are going to consider in this one. Particularly striking is the great number of papers based on a mathematical modeling in front of the meagerness of those treating laboratory experiments on physical models. The universal entering of the computer into almost every phase of our lifes, and the cost of physical models, are –may be- reasons for this lack of experimental methods. Nevertheless they continue offering useful results as are those obtained with the shaking-table in which the computer plays an essential role in the application of loads as well as in the instantaneous treatment of control data.

40|$|Resumo: Procurou-se inicialmente, desvelar a necessidade da disciplina de socorros de urgência dentro do currículo da educação física (EF). Foram apontadas questões que demonstram a relação entre atividade física e a ocorrência de acidentes provenientes dessa prática. A importância de um atendimento correto e seguro foi destacada por estudos que comprovam a eficiência e eficácia de socorros de urgência no contexto da EF. Assim, o presente estudo procurou identificar o {{panorama}} da disciplina de socorros de urgência, a partir de quatro cursos de EF, com docentes de diferentes formações (medicina, enfermagem, fisioterapia e educação física) e, ainda, checou-se os conhecimentos absorvidos através de cinco profissionais formados por cada um desses docentes. Nesse sentido, é utilizada no trabalho uma pesquisa qualitativa a partir do estudo de caso, considerando os programas dos docentes alocados e, ainda, a aplicação de questionário aos profissionais por eles formados e que atuam no mercado de trabalho. Os resultados encontrados possibilitaram o entendimento de que a disciplina encontra-se fragilizada por diferentes aspectos, demonstrando a necessidade de revisão programática, aumento da carga horária e maior relação dos conteúdos com a área da educação física. É sugerido finalmente um programa para a disciplina de socorros de urgência nos cursos de EF, visando não só a superação do panorama encontrado, mas que venha suprir e responder às necessidade e demandas do mercado de trabalho desse profissionalAbstract: First of all, it {{was shown}} the necessity of first aid training in the Physical Education curriculum. It was pointed out the questions which demonstrate {{the relation between the}} physical activity and the occurrence of accidents deriving from its practice. The importance of a right and secure first care was pointed out by studies that prove the efficiency and efficacy of the first aids in the Physical Education environment. Therefore, this study searched to identify the scenery of the first aids training, from four Physical Education Courses with professors of different areas (medicine, nursery, physiotherapy and physical education) and also, it was checked the knowledge absorbed through five professionals graduated by any of those professors. In this sense, in this essay it was used a qualitative research from the study of the case, considering the <b>profesors?</b> programme, and also, the application of a questionnaire to the professionals, graduated by them, who are actually working. The results obtained helped with the comprehension that the subject-matter is weakened by different aspects, showing the necessity of a programming revision, increasing the numbers of training hours and wider relation of contents with the Physical Education area. Finally, it is suggested a programme to the subject-matter of first aid in the Physical Education Courses, not only aiming the improvement of the sight found but also as an answer to the necessities and demands of the working market of that professiona...|$|R

Os objetivos especÃficos foram compreender as transformaÃÃes do trabalho docente no Ãmbito da âreformaâ do Estado e da universidade brasileira, compreender a polÃtica pÃblica estadual do ensino {{superior}} no CearÃ e analisar a percepÃÃo dos professores do CESA acerca da condiÃÃo de trabalho na UECE. O percurso metodolÃgico foi realizado mediante pesquisa bibliogrÃfica, busca documental e investigaÃÃo empÃrica com aplicaÃÃo de questionÃrios com docentes do CESA. Verificou-se que as transformaÃÃes no mundo do trabalho repercutem sobremaneira no ensino superior e consequentemente no trabalho docente, tornando-o precÃrio. Isso tem relaÃÃo com as crises do capitalismo global, com as mudanÃas estruturais da educaÃÃo superior brasileira e com as estratÃgias realizadas pelos governos neoliberais. Seguindo as orientaÃÃes dos organismos internacionais, os governos brasileiros delegam para o setor privado responsabilidades de financiamento e fornecimento da educaÃÃo superior, por meio de estratÃgias privatizantes no setor pÃblico, ampliando o raio de aÃÃo do capital. A polÃtica educacional, arrimada nas propostas neoliberais, intensifica as privatizaÃÃes, a terceirizaÃÃo e a informalizaÃÃo, conduzindo o trabalho docente Ã precarizaÃÃo. O mercado de trabalho docente do ensino superior se reestruturou de forma substancial. A flexibilizaÃÃo dos regimes e contratos de trabalho se impÃs nas IES privadas e pÃblicas. Ã crescente a contrataÃÃo de professores substitutos, ocorre a intensificaÃÃo do trabalho nÃo somente no ambiente laboral, mas se estende tambÃm ao espaÃo familiar e pessoal; alÃm disso, nÃo hÃ condiÃÃes adequadas de trabalho, considerando que, na maioria das vezes, as condiÃÃes ergonÃmicas sÃo inapropriadas e os equipamentos sÃo inexistentes ou ineficazes. The research concentrates {{the analysis}} on the faculty member work at âUniversidade Estadual do CearÃâ having as the basis the work conditions of the professors from the social study center and its applicabilites.

All the methodologic process was acyvired through bibliographe research, the documental research and the empiric search with the application of quizzes involuing faculty members from CESA. We verified that the transformations in the labor world has a strong impact on the hioher education system and consequently in the work of faculty members mahing it very weal. This has a oirect relation wizh the global capitalism crisis with the extauctural changes of brasilian hiohez educational system an with the estrategles applied by the neo-liberals governments following the instructions of the international institutions, the brasilian government has been delegating to the private sector the responsibilities of financing and applying the higlen education through different private estrategles in the public sector, expanding the rench of money to use. The education policy forms from the neo-liberals proposals intensifies the privatizations, the outsourcing work, the informal work, leanding the faculty work to be very weak. The faculty work area in the highen education has re-estructed in a substantial way. The flexibility of the hiring process has imposed itself in the private and publics IES. The hiring process of professors for substitution work has been increased and this forces a strong intensification of work hours not only in the environment but also affects the family and personal life furthermore there are no adequate working conditions, if we consider that, most of time the equipment and also the ergonomic conditions are inefficient and non-existent...|$|R
