5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or <b>Powell</b> <b>said.</b> When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E
25|$|In his autobiography, <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> he {{is haunted}} by the {{nightmare}} of the Vietnam War and felt that the leadership was very ineffective.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, Powell {{criticized the}} {{response}} to Hurricane Katrina. <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> that {{thousands of people were}} not properly protected, but because they were poor rather than because they were black.|$|E
5000|$|Shelley Winters {{was cast}} as Willa Harper, {{the woman who}} is killed by <b>Powell.</b> Winters <b>said</b> that this was [...] "the most {{thoughtful}} and reserved performance I ever gave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John A. <b>Powell.</b> He <b>said</b> {{he was an}} {{old school}} chum of yours at Putnam Hall and had been on a {{treasure}} hunt with you during the past summer." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Jukebox Dance" [...] - {{words and}} music by Walter Ruick, danced by Eleanor Powell and Fred Astaire. <b>Powell</b> later <b>said</b> this number was her {{favorite}} out of all her filmed dances.|$|R
25|$|Powell {{ended his}} {{speech on the}} topic of {{government}} policies aimed at providing services to military veterans, including health care and other benefits. On this, <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> that offering those services to military veterans is as much a symbol of thanks as a memorial built in their honor.|$|E
25|$|After the Scarman Report on {{the riots}} was published, Powell {{gave a speech}} on 10 December in the Commons. Powell {{disagreed}} with Scarman {{when he said that}} the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged: the black community was alienated because it was alien. He claimed tensions would worsen because the nonwhite population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25%, of those of secondary school age it was 40%. <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> that the government should be honest to the people by telling them in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.|$|E
25|$|Following the Conservatives' {{defeat in}} the election, he agreed {{to return to the}} front bench as Transport Spokesman. In July 1965, he stood in the first-ever party {{leadership}} election but came a distant third to Edward Heath, obtaining only 15 votes, just below the result Hugh Fraser would gain in the 1975 contest. Heath appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Defence. <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> that he had “left his visiting card”, i.e. demonstrated himself to be a potential future leader, but the immediate effect was to demonstrate his limited support in the Parliamentary Party, enabling Heath to feel more comfortable calling his bluff.|$|E
5000|$|Assistant {{professor}} of biology Scott Powell at George Washington University discovered them while studying turtle ants in Brazil. <b>Powell</b> has <b>said</b> that the mirror turtle ant represents {{a glimpse of the}} early stages of social parasitism, before the parasite has [...] "lost much of its free-living biology".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would win," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Powell,</b> when the {{excitement}} was over. [...] "I bet with Lew Flapp on the result. Garling was stakeholder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tubbs {{is going}} to try for a {{captaincy}} this term," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Powell,</b> who had not minded Tom's interruption of his versification in the least.|$|R
25|$|Blackmun {{continued}} {{to work on his}} opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again. Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s. After the Court heard the second round of arguments, <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> he would agree with Blackmun's conclusion but pushed for Roe to be the lead of the two abortion cases being considered. Powell also suggested that the Court strike down the Texas law on privacy grounds. Justice Byron White was unwilling to sign on to Blackmun's opinion, and Rehnquist had already decided to dissent.|$|E
25|$|Olen Montgomery {{testified that}} he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> that while he was not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white {{teenagers}} from his vantage point between a box car and a gondola car, where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any meaningful way.|$|E
25|$|As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod {{helped to}} found the {{homeless}} charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a {{decision of the}} Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government’s Commonwealth Immigration Bill, believing {{it to be a}} breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod's subsequent dealings with him were, <b>Powell</b> <b>said,</b> as if he was a pariah though Macleod 'knew what I said was not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved as if he did not know'. Powell's speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many {{of the members of the}} public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard that}} Lew Flapp {{was going to}} Cedarville," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Powell,</b> while on the way. [...] "Do you know, Dick, I don't like that fellow at all." ...|$|R
50|$|Australian referee Matt O'Brien officiated the final, but {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his handling of}} the match, with a number of decisions in the latter stages of the match being given in New Zealand's favour and South Africa's coach Neil <b>Powell</b> later <b>said</b> that he would seek clarification from the officials. Some New Zealand observers have commented that the officiating was an embarrassment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I have! I am certain!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Powell</b> forcibly. [...] "I {{was looking at}} you all the time. You've done {{something}} to the drink in that glass." ...|$|R
500|$|Hogan and Powell {{reportedly}} {{worked at}} both Eat: An Oyster Bar and The Parish, switching daily. Like Eat, The Parish was a wholesale supplier of sustainably-farmed oysters to other Portland restaurants. <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> {{about the difference}} between the two restaurants: ...|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Widmerpool" [...] {{was assumed}} by many critics {{to derive from}} Widmerpool a Nottinghamshire village. In a 1978 interview, <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> he first came across the name in a 17th-century book, Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson, which {{features}} a Captain of Horse, Major Joseph Widmerpoole, who served in Cromwell's army under John Hutchinson during the English Civil War. Powell viewed this Widmerpoole as a mean-spirited and disagreeable character and [...] "had his name down for really {{quite a long time}} as a name I was going to use".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry. Powell {{recalled}} that [...] "I was doing some chores at home. I was sitting {{down on the floor}} folding laundry and I had that song in my head. All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and it scared me because that never happens". <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E
50|$|Saïd {{is close}} friends with Charles Powell, {{the former chief}} foreign affairs adviser to Thatcher. <b>Saïd</b> {{appointed}} <b>Powell</b> chairman of his Sagitta Asset Management in 2001, and <b>Powell</b> chairs the <b>Saïd</b> Business School Foundation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe we'll go to Brierroot Grove again," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Powell</b> to Dick. [...] "A farmer {{has built}} a house up there and is {{clearing}} off the land {{as fast as he}} can." ...|$|R
5000|$|Turner {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives in 1865 as a [...] "Conservative" [...] but was not seated. Elected again to the state {{legislature}} after the war, he opposed Republican Gov. William W. Holden, who had Turner arrested in Hillsborough for allegedly assisting the Ku Klux Klan. Turner also used his newspaper, the Raleigh Sentinel, to attack Holden and his party. [...] "Turner's crusade is considered to have been largely responsible for the recapture of the state legislature by the Democrats (then called Conservatives) and for the overthrow of Governor William W. Holden in 1870 and his impeachment in 1871," [...] wrote William S. <b>Powell.</b> But, <b>said</b> <b>Powell,</b> Turner was [...] "no financial wizard" [...] and the paper ended {{up in the hands of}} the publishers of the Raleigh Observer. Eventually, they folded the paper into The News & Observer.|$|R
500|$|The quintet with Sonny Rollins, who {{replaced}} Land on tenor saxophone, recorded what became their last official album early in 1956. Clifford Brown and Max Roach at Basin Street contained playing at even faster tempos than on their earlier album releases. Several of the tunes were composed by Powell; on one, [...] "Time", Powell played celeste {{in addition to}} his usual piano. Another was [...] "Gertrude's Bounce", which <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> was named following his admiration for the way in which artist Gertrude Abercrombie walked. The third of his originals, [...] "Powell's Prances", was [...] "a modal composition, with Brown and Rollins improvising on the scale rather than on the usual chord changes", a form popularized three years later by Miles Davis.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2003, Arsenal gave fans the {{opportunity}} to register their interest in a relaunched bond scheme. The club planned to issue 3,000 bonds for between £3,500 and £5,000 each for a season ticket at Highbury, then at Ashburton Grove. Supporters reacted negatively to the news; AISA chairman Steven <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> in a statement: [...] "We are disappointed that the club has not consulted supporters before announcing a new bond scheme." [...] Though Arsenal never stated how many bonds were sold, they did raise several million pounds through the scheme. The club also extended its contract with sportswear provider Nike, in a deal worth [...] £55million over seven years. Nike paid a minimum of £1million each year as a royalty payment, contingent on sales.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{lingering}} shadow of these accusations, [...] "Cog" [...] drew an unprecedented amount of critical acclaim. It received more awards than any commercial in history; {{so many that}} it was both the most-awarded commercial of 2004 and the 33rd-most-awarded commercial of 2003. The jury for the British Television Advertising Awards gave the piece the highest score of any commercial ever recorded; the jury's chairman Charles Inge commented: [...] "My own opinion {{is that this is}} the best commercial that I have seen for at least ten years." [...] After awarding [...] "Cog" [...] with several Silver awards, the president-elect of the D Awards, Dick <b>Powell,</b> <b>said</b> of the piece: [...] "It delights and entrances, [...] it communicates engineering quality and quality of thinking, and leaves you with a smile." ...|$|E
50|$|The Reverend Powell {{character}} {{has become one}} of cinema's most popular, influential villains. Mitchum's performance has reaped widespread acclaim; he later <b>said</b> <b>Powell</b> was his favorite role. Stephen King has called Powell one of the greatest villains in fiction.|$|R
5000|$|Michael <b>Powell</b> once <b>said</b> of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp {{that it is}} ... a 100% British film but it's {{photographed by}} a Frenchman, it's written by a Hungarian, the musical score is by a German Jew, the {{director}} was English, {{the man who did}} the costumes was a Czech; in other words, {{it was the kind of}} film that I've always worked on with a mixed crew of every nationality, no frontiers of any kind." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2012, Powell {{released}} [...] "Universe Mahalo: Volume #1" [...] {{which was}} the first official release of his solo project, [...] "Spaceship Aloha." [...] The songs are a combination of samples of traditional Hawaiian music with electronic beats. <b>Powell</b> has <b>said</b> the album was inspired by his time spent visiting Hawaii. A limited run of plantable postcards were made available for purchase as well. Each postcard included a download code and could than be planted and grown into blue Lobelias.|$|R
500|$|All {{members of}} the band were {{involved}} in the writing of songs, and there may have been more than one person's set of lyrics appearing in a single release. <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "It's quite interesting to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not sure how many bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life. We've always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band." ...|$|E
500|$|In rehearsal, Haynes, Blanchett and Mara {{realized}} certain {{lines that}} either character {{did not need}} to say should be cut, which Haynes deemed the [...] "stylistic practice that we all took throughout the creative departments. I feel there was an understanding with them that words and dialogue were never carrying the weight of the story." [...] Costume Designer Sandy <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> of working with Haynes, [...] "Todd is super visual, super prepared and he provides his own visuals {{at the beginning of the}} film. He starts with a look book of images that he's compiled over the months and months. He's almost OCD about it. In a good way." [...] The look of the film was influenced by the post-war color photography of Ruth Orkin, Esther Bubley, Helen Levitt, and Vivian Maier, as well as the abstract photography of Saul Leiter. Haynes used their works as a visual reference for depicting a [...] "dirty and sagging" [...] New York.|$|E
500|$|From 4–12 April {{the main}} unit shot on Sienese rooftops. Shooting {{on the real}} rooftops {{turned out to be}} less {{expensive}} than building them at Pinewood. The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at Lake Garda and Carrara. On 19 April, an Aston Martin employee driving a DBS to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined £400 for reckless driving. Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. Filming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents. Stunt co-ordinator Gary <b>Powell</b> <b>said</b> the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action. Rumours of a [...] "curse" [...] spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos' accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the [...] "curse"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know his}} sort," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Powell,</b> {{going to the}} window to look at his cutter still riding to the flood. [...] "He's the sort that's always chasing some notion or other round and round his head just for the fun of the thing." ...|$|R
2500|$|Artist Nick Cardy, a {{colleague}} at the Eisner studio, <b>said</b> <b>Powell</b> [...] "came in later when I was doing [...] 'Lady Luck'. He was sitting behind me. He would help a kid {{around the block}} — tell a newcomer {{to take it easy}} and that sort of thing".|$|R
5000|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right." [...] When Bud Powell was opening for Tatum at Birdland around 1950, {{the end of an}} era when musicians engaged in overt competition and so-called cutting sessions, <b>Powell</b> reportedly <b>said</b> to Tatum, [...] "Man, I'm going to really show you about tempo and playing fast. Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, you come in here tomorrow, and anything you do with your right hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge.|$|R
