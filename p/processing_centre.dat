5|$|Nauru is a {{phosphate}} rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, , are not economically viable for extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign {{state in the}} world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional <b>Processing</b> <b>Centre.</b> As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.|$|E

40|$|An {{assessment}} of cassava processing plant {{was conducted in}} Irepodun local Government Area of Kwara State, Nigeria to evaluate different cassava processing machinery {{being used by the}} processors, the common machines, and costs of machines, type of prime movers and sex of machine operators.

Cassava processors preferred diesel despite its high cost, this may be as a result of incessant petrol scarcity and constant absence of electricity supply from Power Holding Company of Nigeria. This assessment showed that inappropriate and unaffordable cassava processing machinery is responsible for low level of cassava processing and utilization in Nigeria which is the largest cassava producer...|$|R
500|$|Escape from Woomera {{opens with}} three screens of text that explain the game's background.

500|$|The {{original}} plan for Escape from Woomera involved several choices in playable detainees, {{each with a}} different story about how they came to seek asylum in Australia. The game would have players [...] "battle the bureaucracy and try and survive day to day" [...] while working towards any of several escape strategies. As originally envisioned, players could attempt to escape through the legal channels, using lawyers and activists, or could attempt to flee by scaling fences or digging tunnels. The development team worked to create the most realistic depiction of the Woomera centre possible, despite the media not being allowed in the facility. The team utilised interviews with former detainees and activists, existing press reports, {{and a copy of}} the facility's floor plan obtained from a member of the Department of Immigration. Kate Wild, an investigative journalist hired by the development team to conduct research, was able to visit Baxter Immigration Reception and <b>Processing</b> <b>Centre.</b> She witnessed guards using spotlights and helicopters to keep detainees awake throughout the night, and police on horseback trampling over tents. Aside from Woomera and Baxter, Port Hedland Immigration Reception and <b>Processing</b> <b>Centre</b> and Villawood Immigration Detention Centre were also used as influences. Details from the daily lives of detainees, such as their being referred to by number and communicating with the outside world through payphones, were incorporated into the game. Tasks that players had to complete, as well as the escape strategies themselves, were also based on the experiences of real detainees.|$|E
