25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} of Millionaires the band chose to start anew {{in their approach}} to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour {{in the autumn of}} that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, <b>Pleased</b> <b>To</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>You,</b> was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.|$|E

In 1995, U2 and Eno {{joined forces to}} create the album Original Soundtracks 1 under the group name Passengers; songs from which included [...] "Your Blue Room" [...] and [...] "Miss Sarajevo". When the album was released, the US charts were dominated by movie soundtrack albums and singles. Even though films are listed for each song, all but three are bogus. Once Eno pointed {{out that it was}} not a real ploy for radio airplay, but a spoof of one, U2 agreed to the concept. Eno also produced Laid (1993), Wah Wah (1994) Millionaires (1999) and <b>Pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>You</b> (2001) for James, performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for [...] "frequent interference and occasional co-production" [...] on their 1997 album Whiplash.|$|E

"I am very <b>pleased</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> here, Tavernake," [...] Mr. Dowling went on, [...] "pleased {{both for}} {{personal}} reasons and because it shows, if I may be allowed to say so, the interest which you take in the firm's business, that you should devote your holiday to coming and--er--surveying the scene of our exploits, so to speak. Perhaps now that you are here you {{would be able to}} explain to Mr. Belton better than I should, just what it is that we propose." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{would have}} been {{manifest}} to a meaner capacity than any present that evening that Mr. Magnet regarded Marjorie with a distinguished significance. He had two eyes, but he had that mysterious quality so frequently associated with a bluish-grey iris which gives the effect of looking hard with one large orb, a sort of grey searchlight effect, and he used this eye ray now to convey a respectful but firm admiration in the most unequivocal manner. He saluted Daffy courteously, and then allowed himself to retain Marjorie's hand {{for just a second}} longer than was necessary as he said--very simply--"I am very <b>pleased</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> again--very." ...|$|R

He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as <b>to</b> be exceedingly <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>you</b> again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there. But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain. If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me. My account states, that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger." ...|$|R

The report and {{recommendations}} reflect the unanimous {{view of the}} Task Force members, and we take full responsibility for the contents. The Task Force unanimously agreed that health services research at NIDA has accomplished {{a great deal in}} understanding access, utilization, and outcomes, as well as the organizational and financial factors that influence them. Our work has taken place at a critical and opportune time of increased NIH emphasis on developing evidence-based practices. We believe we have identified the issues that will clarify the role of health services research for the Institute and best position NIDA, particularly through its Division of Epidemiology, Services and Prevention Research, to address the future needs of the field. The Task Force members want to thank the external reviewers of the Report. We acknowledge Denise Pintello, Ph. D., M. S. W., and Sarah Michaud for their great help in organizing our work and editing the Report.

6000|$|The virtuous hostess of Bryanstone Square {{was quite}} civil and good-humoured when Mr. Pendennis {{appeared}} at her house; and my surprise was not inconsiderable when I found the whole party from Saint Pancras there assembled--Mr. Binnie; the Colonel and his son; Mrs. Mackenzie, looking uncommonly handsome and perfectly well-dressed; and Miss Rosey, in pink crape, with pearly shoulders and blushing cheeks, and beautiful fair ringlets--as fresh and comely a sight {{as it was}} possible to witness. Scarcely had we made our bows, and shaken our hands, and imparted our observations about the fineness of the weather, when, behold! as we look from the drawing-room windows into the cheerful square of Bryanstone, a great family coach arrives, driven by a family coachman in a family wig, and we recognise Lady Anne Newcome's carriage, and see her ladyship, her mother, her daughter, and her husband, Sir Brian, descend from the vehicle. [...] "It is quite a family party," [...] whispers the happy Mrs. Newcome to the happy writer conversing with her in the niche of the window.
