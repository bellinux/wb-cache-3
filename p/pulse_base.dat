Series of test experiments were conducted at the Oxford Impact Engineering Laboratory on a bespoke platform for a controlled double (initial and inverse) <b>pulse</b> <b>base</b> excitation history. For the computational simulations and validation {{the base of the}} block stack was subjected to a constant acceleration of a finite duration until the desired peak base velocity, corresponding to the measured experimental values, was achieved. Different overturning modes (forward, backward, global and partial) in both simulations and experiments were characterised {{as a function of the}} peak initial base velocity and the timing of the reverse impulse, controlled by the stop gap distance between the base and the stopper. The influence of the block sample scales has also been examined. The conducted set of validation benchmarks is believed to be valuable for researchers, code developers, safety case engineers and industry regulators...|$|E
40|$|In a {{distributed}} Brillouin sensor system, it {{is crucial}} to keep the pulse energy uniform for constant signal to noise ratio. This means that the variable DC leakage (<b>pulse</b> <b>base)</b> through the electro-optic modulator must be locked. In this thesis I examine two different methods of locking the <b>pulse</b> <b>base</b> level and look at {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each locking method. It is found that the two locking methods, one based on a lock-in amplifier and the other using proportional-integral-derivative control, both have applications in which they excel at locking the <b>pulse</b> <b>base.</b> Also, a technique to simultaneously lock the <b>pulse</b> <b>base,</b> top, and width is developed and tested. In the field of structural health monitoring, it is often advantageous to monitor the dynamic behaviour of a structure in real-time. The traditional distributed Brillouin sensor does not allow for this dynamic measurement due to the need to sweep the frequency difference between the two lasers and subsequent averaging of waveforms. For the first time to our knowledge, a real-time vibration sensor based on polarization-state perturbations in stimulated Brillouin scattering instead of resonant frequency mismatching monitoring of the Brillouin spectrum has been proposed. The long measurement time of traditional distributed Brillouin sensors is avoided by eliminating the frequency sweep of the pump and Stokes lasers and instead locking them at a single beat frequency corresponding to the static strain of the structure in which the fiber is embedded. This unique sensor allows measurement of vibration frequencies along a sensing fiber as shown in laboratory experiments and also the detection of impact waves from passing vehicles in field tests in which the sensor was embedded in the concrete pavement of a highway. A 20 ns pulse width with potential spatial resolution of 2 m was used over a sensing length of 300 m. Also, studies of the Brillouin linewidth under cw pump and Stokes waves are done in order to confirm the validity of a new definition of the threshold power in Brillouin fiber amplifiers which involve both input pump and input Stokes waves - all previous threshold definitions took into account only the input pump power. Finally, some interesting lineshape characteristics such as spectral hole burning and side-lobes on the Brillouin spectrum are observed for high power 2 ns Stokes pulses and their origins explained qualitatively. The evolution of these features with increasing pump power is investigated. The effect of laser linewidth and fiber length on these features is also considered...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{dead time}} {{necessary}} to prevent the short circuit of the power supply in pulse width modulated (PWM) voltage inverters results in output voltage deviations. Although individually small, when accumulated over an operating cycle, the voltage deviations are sufficient to distort the applied PWM signal. This paper presents a new method to correct for the dead time deviations. The <b>Pulse</b> <b>Based</b> Compensator is less hardware and software intensive than other dead time compensation methods providing a low cost solution. The <b>pulse</b> <b>based</b> technique is developed by analyzing the effects of dead time on a pulse by pulse basis and correcting each pulse accordingly. The technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. Other compensation methods are evaluated and the results compared with the <b>pulse</b> <b>based</b> technique. This comparison indicates previous methods can produce magnitude and phase errors in the applied terminal voltage, whereas the proposed method compensates for the dead time without significant magnitude and phase errors in the terminal voltage of PWM voltage source inverters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Delay faults are {{frequently}} encountered in nanometer technologies. Therefore, {{it is critical}} to detect these faults during factory test. Testing for a delay fault requires the application of a pair of test vectors in an at-speed manner. To maximize the delay fault detection capability, it is desired that the vectors in this pair are independent. Independent vector pairs cannot always be applied to a circuit implemented with standardscan design approaches. However, thiscan be achieved by using enhanced scan flip-flops, which store two bits of data. This paper has two contributions. First, we develop a pulsed flip-flop(PFF) design.
