5|$|Some of the <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{affected}} the F-FDTL throughout its existence {{were caused by}} the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, {{on the basis of}} applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military. These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002.|$|E

25|$|Besides these writings, Theophrastus wrote several {{collections}} of problems, {{out of which}} some things at least have passed into the <b>Problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> come down to us {{under the name of}} Aristotle, and commentaries, partly dialogues, to which probably belonged the Erotikos (Ἐρωτικός), Megacles (Μεγακλῆς), Callisthenes (Καλλισθένης), and Megarikos (Μεγαρικός), and letters, partly books on mathematical sciences and their history.|$|E
25|$|A {{polynomial}} equation {{for which}} one is interested only in the solutions which are integers is called a Diophantine equation. Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general algorithm for solving them, and even for deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see Hilbert's tenth problem). Some {{of the most famous}} <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been solved during the fifty last years are related to Diophantine equations, such as Fermat's Last Theorem.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scientists}} have expressed concerns about growing costs and schedule delays for the Webb telescope, which competes for scant astronomy budgets and thus threatens funding for other space science programs. A review of NASA budget records and status reports {{noted that the}} JWST is plagued {{by many of the}} same <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> affected other major NASA projects. Repairs and additional testing included underestimates of the telescope's cost that failed to budget for expected technical glitches, missed budget projections, and evaluation of components to estimate extreme launch conditions, thus extending the schedule and increasing costs further.|$|E
25|$|Galápagos green turtles, grouped {{with all}} populations of Chelonia mydas, are {{listed on the}} IUCN Red List of {{threatened}} species. They {{were placed on the}} list in the mid 1980s and have remained under protection since. One of the major <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> led to their decline is the slow growth rate and long period from juvenile to sexual maturity. Chelonians average a period of 26–40 years to maturity; the Galápagos green turtle averages 33years. The green sea turtle has been shown to have the slowest growth rate of any species of sea turtle and is generally long-lived if left undisturbed. Overall, populations of C. mydas have had a decrease of about 48–67% of nesting females, but the population that nests in the Galápagos has remained quite steady with little to no change. The population of nesting females recorded in the Galápagos from 1976–1982 was roughly 1400individuals and after further evaluation in 1999–2001, around 1400nesting females were found.|$|E
25|$|Within the Métis Nation of Saskatchewan, {{there are}} {{different}} numbered locals for each area in the province. Willow Bunch is Local #17 with Randy Gaudry as the president. Gaudry has instilled pride in being a Métis within the town of Willow Bunch. Gaudry has been actively involved in fighting for Métis rights for his Local 17. His activism may have stemmed from his late grandfather, Andre Gaudry, {{one of the eight}} guiders that took Sioux Chief Sitting Bull back to America due to bad living conditions and starvation. “ were the guides, scouts, interpreters and security for these trips. ” After living away from WIllow Bunch for a time, Gaudry worked hard when he returned to reactivate the Métis Local 17. This meant working between two communities that disconnected years before his return, the Francophone and the Métis. The Local 17 president gathered the two estranged communities to create a dialogue to improve living conditions. “The Francophone community and the Métis community have butted heads {{for a number of years}} and there are still <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> to be ironed out, (noted an article in the Eagle Feather News) ” A discussion panel was organized to help build a community connection.|$|E

25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|E

500|$|Early {{researchers}} [...] {{commented that}} the pathway of propagation functions {{in the manner of}} a contagious disease; however, some sentiment existed that the disorder may involve an immunosuppressive mechanism, potentially linked to [...] "stress" [...] leading to a weakened immune system. Specifically, according to research done in 2007 at the Pennsylvania State University: [...] "The magnitude of detected infectious agents in the adult bees suggests some type of immunosuppression". These researchers initially suggested a connection between Varroa destructor mite infestation and CCD, suggesting that a combination of these bee mites, deformed wing virus (which the mites transmit) and bacteria work together to suppress immunity and may be one cause of CCD. Parasites, such as varroa mites (Varroa destructor), honey bee tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi), fungal, bacterial and viral diseases, and kleptoparasites such as small hive beetles (Aethina tumida), are all <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been introduced within the last 20 years in the continental U.S., and are faced by beekeepers.|$|E

Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone noted [...] "the album de-emphasizes the (very) guilty pop pleasures of her 2004 debut {{in favor of}} leaden I-hate-you-Daddy laments such as [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "My Innocence". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt commented that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine a}} more explicit snapshot of the highly publicized family <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> plagued the star than [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)"". PopMatters's Whitney Strub said [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] "immediately commences with a line about 'wait for the postman to bring me a letter', which suggests songwriters dipping into the well of cliché without worrying about freshness," [...] while commenting that [...] "the world might not need another version of Britney Spears' 'E-Mail My Heart', but good lord, that song came out in 1999. Perhaps a text-message might arrive faster than snail-mail in late 2005, should Lohan's song-persona deign to enter the 21st century".|$|E
500|$|Issue #1 {{received}} an average score of 7.3/10 based on 26 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR gave it four stars writing, [...] "Overall, Civil War II #1 {{is a good}} launching point for this miniseries, even as it integrates the information from Civil War II #0 and the Free Comic Book Day special. I'm curious to see if Bendis and Marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they'll add into the mix to keep the conflict burning strong. For now, though, it's {{more than enough to}} get readers coming back for more." [...] Schedeen gave it a 7.1 saying, [...] "This first issue cleanly establishes the conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork. However, it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with the basics of this crossover, and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in the way the first issue of Civil War did ten years ago." [...] Richard Gray of Newsarama gave it a 7 and said, [...] "At this early stage, Civil War II suffers some of the <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> beleaguered similar narratives in recent years, principally in seeing heroes all too quick to take sides against comrades on a possible future. Yet this is also just the beginning of something much larger, and while it may seem at times like this is an extended version of the 'zero' issue that preceded it, all the pieces are now in place for the 'war' proper to commence." ...|$|E
