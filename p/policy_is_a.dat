5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E

A mechanism is defined whereby user agents can share blacklists of domains {{that should not}} be allowed to access web storage. Content Security <b>Policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> proposed standard whereby sites may assign privileges to different domains, enforcing harsh limitations on JavaScript use to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks. HTML5 also adds HTML templating and a standard HTML parser which replaces the various parsers of web browser vendors. These new features formalize previously inconsistent implementations, reducing the number of vulnerabilities though not eliminating them entirely.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{legislation}} applying {{solely to}} Wales since the 16th century {{was passed in}} 1881. [...] Subsequently, the border between England and Wales has taken on increasing legal and political significance. In 1964 a separate department of state was established for Wales – the Welsh Office – which assumed an increasing range of administrative responsibilities from Whitehall. By 1992, the Welsh Office oversaw housing, local government, roads, historic buildings, health, education, economic development, agriculture, fisheries and urban regeneration, although {{the extent to which}} it was able to be autonomous from England in public <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> matter of debate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principle}} {{of separation of}} mechanism and policy is the substantial difference between the philosophy of micro and monolithic kernels. Here a mechanism is the support that allows the implementation of many different policies, while a <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> particular [...] "mode of operation". [...] For instance, a mechanism may provide for user log-in attempts to call an authorization server to determine whether access should be granted; a policy may be for the authorization server to request a password and check it against an encrypted password stored in a database. [...] Because the mechanism is generic, the policy could more easily be changed (e.g. by requiring {{the use of a}} security token) than if the mechanism and policy were integrated in the same module.|$|E

Even then, the always-online DRM was permanently removed from all single-player games. It does, however, require a one-time-only online activation {{the very first time}} the player plays the game, which will permanently bind the activation code to the player's account, and thus, it {{does not need to be}} activated again on the same account if the game is reinstalled for some reason. This also applies to reinstalling on another computer. Following that, the player can permanently play the game in offline mode.|$|E
