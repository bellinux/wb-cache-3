5|$|The {{names of}} most of the provinces were {{generated}} from the Mashonaland and Matabeleland divide at the time of colonisation: Mashonaland was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the First Matabele War. This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the Shona people and the Matabele people, although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces. Each province is headed by a <b>Provincial</b> <b>Governor,</b> appointed by the President.|$|E
5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{broke out}} in 1775, Lord Dunmore, the British <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> of the Colony of Virginia, with the British forces under his command, had removed Virginia's store of provincial arms and {{gunpowder}} to the island of New Providence in the Crown Colony of the Bahamas, {{in order to keep}} it from falling {{into the hands of the}} rebel militia. Montfort Browne, the Bahamian governor, was alerted by General Thomas Gage in August 1775 that the rebel colonists might make attempts to seize these supplies.|$|E

5|$|Aqil's {{closeness}} {{with the}} Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His {{relations with the}} kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.|$|E

5|$|The American Revolutionary War, {{which began}} in April 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, widened in September 1775 when the Continental Army {{embarked}} on an invasion of the British Province of Quebec. The province was viewed by the Second Continental Congress as a potential avenue for British forces to attack and divide the rebellious colonies, and {{was at the time}} lightly defended. The invasion reached a peak on December 31, 1775, when the Battle of Quebec ended in disaster for the Americans. In the spring of 1776, 10,000British and German troops arrived in Quebec, and General Guy Carleton, the <b>provincial</b> <b>governor,</b> drove the Continental Army out of Quebec and back to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E

Political scientist Caroline Hughes {{has suggested that the}} CPP's overwhelming dominance in rural areas such as Ratanakiri stems from the central government's ability to suppress collective action, which in urban areas is offset by international donors and NGOs that provide support for opposition parties. Fifty-one commune council members in Ratanakiri (20%) are women, and 98% of Ratanakiri's government staff was Khmer as of 2006. Bou Lam, a member of the CPP, represents Ratanakiri in the National Assembly of Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|While Andros was in captivity, the New York {{government}} of Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson was simultaneously deposed {{by a military}} faction led by Jacob Leisler, in an event {{that came to be}} known as Leisler's Rebellion. Leisler would govern New York until 1691, when he was captured and executed by a force led by newly appointed <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> Henry Sloughter. Andros was eventually allowed to depart for England; by that point, the Dominion of New England had effectively ceased to exist, with the colonies in the dominion having reverted to their previous forms of governance. Massachusetts and its surrounding territories were reorganized into the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, {{a public}} spate arose between Ranariddh and his {{personal}} secretary, Noranarith Anandayath. Ranariddh accused Noranarith of badmouthing him, which prompted the latter to resign from the CRPP. Two months later, in December 2014, the Phnom Penh Post reported that several high-ranking FUNCINPEC officials defected to the CRPP, which included a former secretary of state, former <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> and former deputy national police chief. On 2 January 2015, Ranariddh announced his plan to return to FUNCINPEC, after being ousted from the party in 2006. The announcement was made after a private meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen who had urged Ranariddh to rejoin his former party. The CRPP was subsequently dissolved when Ranariddh returned to FUNCINPEC later {{in the latter part}} of January 2015.|$|E

5|$|Lakkanna Dandesa, the king's prime {{minister}} and <b>provincial</b> <b>governor,</b> wrote an encyclopaedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith titled Sivatattva Chintamani. This work is {{an account of the}} life of Basavanna, the progenitor of the faith, and hundreds of his followers, making it valuable material for students of the Lingayat movement. Numerous references are made in this work to the capital city of Vijayanagara and its suburbs. Jakkanarya, a minister in the court, not only wrote Nurondusthala (one hundred and one stories) but also was patron to Kumarabanka Natha and Mahalinga Deva, poet-saints who wrote vachana poems and books on the Shaiva philosophy (called shatsthala). Other writers of the 15th century worthy of mention are Kavi Linga (1490), court poet of King Saluva NarasimhaI, Adrisappa (Praudaraya Charitra), Bommarasa (Soundara Purana), Kallarasa (Janavasya), Chaturmukha Bommarasa (Revanasiddhesvara Purana), Suranga Kavi (Trisashti Puratanara Charitre), and Nilakanthacharya (Aradhya Charitra), court poet of the Ummattur chieftain Virananjendra.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak {{remained}} {{part of the}} Empire of Japan {{for three}} years and eight months. During this time it was divided into three provinces – Kuching-shu, Sibu-shu, and Miri-shu – each under their respective <b>Provincial</b> <b>Governor.</b> The Japanese otherwise preserved the Brooke administrative structure and appointed the Japanese to important government positions. Allied forces later carried out Operation Semut to sabotage Japanese operations in Sarawak. During the battle of North Borneo, the Australian forces landed at Lutong-Miri area on 20 June 1945 and had penetrated as far as Marudi and Limbang before halting their operations in Sarawak. After the surrender of Japan, the Japanese surrendered to the Australian forces at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The following day, the Japanese forces at Kuching surrendered, and the Batu Lintang camp was liberated. Sarawak was immediately placed under British Military Administration and managed by Australian Imperial Forces (AIF) until April 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges and the Roxolani invaded Lower Pannonia and Lower Moesia, respectively, in 117. The war was {{probably}} {{brought on by}} difficulties in visiting and trading with each other due {{to the location of}} Dacia between them. The Dacian <b>provincial</b> <b>governor,</b> Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus, was killed in the invasion. The Roxolani surrendered first, so {{it is likely that the}} Romans exiled and then replaced their client king with one of their choosing. The Iazyges then concluded peace with Rome. The Iazyges and other Sarmatians invaded Roman Dacia in 123, likely for the same reason as the previous war of not being allowed to visit and trade with each other, Marcius Turbo stationed a thousand legionaries in Potaissa and Porolissum. The Romans probably used these towns as the invasion point into Rivulus Dominarum. Marcius Turbo succeeded in defeating the Iazyges; however, the terms of the peace, and the date, are not known.|$|E

5|$|The US-based United Fruit Company (UFC) {{was one of}} {{many foreign}} {{companies}} that acquired large tracts of both state land and indigenous land. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who was president of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, permitted limited unionization in rural Guatemala, but also made further concessions to the UFC. In 1922, the Communist Party of Guatemala was created, and became a significant influence among urban laborers; however, it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations. In 1929, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y Castañeda, who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a <b>provincial</b> <b>governor.</b> Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.|$|E
5|$|While Rosas {{was away}} on the Desert Campaign in October 1833, a group of Rosistas (Rosas's supporters) laid siege to Buenos Aires. Inside the city, Rosas's wife, Encarnación, {{assembled}} a contingent of associates to aid the besiegers. The Revolution of the Restorers, as the Rosista coup came to be known, forced the <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> Juan Ramón Balcarce to resign. In quick succession, Balcarce was followed by two others who presided over weak and ineffective governments. The Rosismo (Rosism) had become a powerful faction within the Federalist Party, and pressured other factions to accept a return of Rosas, endowed with dictatorial powers, {{as the only way}} to restore stability. The House of Representatives yielded, and on 7 March 1835, Rosas was reelected governor and invested with the suma del poder público (sum of public power).|$|E
5|$|After the Liberation of Bulgaria and the {{establishment}} of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in 1878, Mutkurov settled in Eastern Rumelia, where he joined the provincial police or militia. He served first with the 1st Plovdiv Battalion and thereafter with the general staff. As an eminent man of arms in Eastern Rumelia, Mutkurov {{was one of the main}} leaders of the Bulgarian unification on 6 September 1885, the bloodless revolution that united the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. Mutkurov joined the Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Central Committee which stood behind the unification. At the time a captain, along with Dimitar Rizov he was envoyed to the Bulgarian monarch Prince Alexander of Battenberg. The two were received by the prince in Shumen, where they notified him of the forthcoming events and requested his approval. The prince did not wish to be publicly involved in an anti-Ottoman revolution, and is unclear whether he at all believed a revolution was likely to break out in Eastern Rumelia so soon. During the revolution, Mutkurov commanded some of the troops that surrounded the residence of the <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> Gavril Krastevich and demanded his resignation.|$|E

5|$|Born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Kirchner studied {{law at the}} National University of La Plata. He met {{and married}} Cristina Fernández at this time, {{returned}} with her to Río Gallegos at graduation, and opened a law firm. Commentators have criticized him {{for a lack of}} legal activism during the Dirty War, an issue he would involve himself in as president. Kirchner ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987 and for governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. He was reelected governor in 1995 and 1999 due to an amendment of the provincial constitution. Kirchner sided with Buenos Aires <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> Eduardo Duhalde against President Carlos Menem. Although Duhalde lost the 1999 presidential election, he was appointed president by the Congress when previous presidents Fernando de la Rúa and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned during the December 2001 riots. Duhalde suggested that Kirchner run for president in 2003 in a bid to prevent Menem's return to the presidency. Menem won a plurality {{in the first round of}} the presidential election but, fearing that he would lose in the required runoff election, he resigned; Kirchner became president as a result.|$|E
5|$|The new {{government}} shrunk {{the number of}} cabinet portfolios to twenty-three, which were equally divided between FUNCINPEC and CPP, each getting eleven ministries under their charge while the BLDP was allocated one cabinet post. The CPP gave away half of all <b>provincial</b> <b>governor</b> posts available to FUNCINPEC, but kept most the local government posts consisting of district and commune chiefs as well as civil service positions to its party appointees. Ranariddh developed a good working relationship with Hun Sen, which was maintained until March 1996. The UN secretary-general's representative to Cambodia, Benny Widyono noted that while both of them appeared together in public functions, Hun Sen held more political sway as compared to Ranariddh in the government. In October 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen sacked Sam Rainsy as FUNCINPEC's finance minister after he repeatedly leaked confidential documents and corruption in a public manner. Rainsy's sacking upset Norodom Sirivudh, the secretary-general for FUNCINPEC and Minister of Foreign Affairs to resign from his ministerial post at the same time. Rainsy continued to criticise the government {{in his capacity as}} a Member of Parliament (MP), and Ranariddh introduced a motion to expel Rainsy from the National Assembly and FUNCINPEC.|$|E
