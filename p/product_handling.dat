"SAP EWM is firms {{the ability}} to control {{warehouse}} processes and manage movements in the warehouse, mitigate problems and issues with enhanced warehouse efficiency, and transform operations into an adaptive fulfillment supply chain that can share its resources". SAP EWM is similar to SAP WM functionality, but with more flexibility in building objects like Warehouse structure, picking, put away, HU, RF, and more. Also, Activity Areas, Work Centers, and Resources are elements incorporated into SAP EWM that are new additions since SAP WM. SAP WM was the company's first foray into a specific Warehouse Management Solution. By 2025 SAP WM will no longer be supported and completely replaced by SAP EWM. Like SAP WM, SAP EWM is a part of SAP Supply Chain Management (SAP SCM) and supports all the processes within the logistics chain. The integrated functions and business processes within this warehouse management solution provide a high level of process and inventory transparency, a precise planning of warehouse steps, as well as efficient distribution and storage. The payback associated with an EWM implementation typically ranges from 12 to 36 months from beneficial use of the system. Achieving a viable return requires leveraging the technology to improve and streamline the operation, not just automate existing, inefficient and archaic processes. Most EWM implementations result in qualitative and quantitative benefits such as fewer <b>product</b> <b>handling</b> steps, increased productivity, reduced errors, tighter inventory control, and improved inventory accuracy and order quality.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to establish a validated kinetic model for growth of spoilage bacteria on vacuum packed tuna slices in the temperature range of 0 to 15 degrees C and to evaluate the applicability of the TTI (Time Temperature Integrators) based SMAS (Safety Monitoring and Assurance System) system to improve tuna product quality at the time of consumption in comparison to the conventional First In First Out (FIFO) approach. The overall measurements of total flora and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the tuna samples used in a laboratory simulated field test were in close agreement with the predictions of the developed kinetic model. The spoilage profile of the TTI bearing <b>products,</b> <b>handled</b> with SMAS, was improved.
