5|$|Other {{issues in}} <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> {{psychology}} are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? <b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> {{perception}} {{is concerned with}} the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world. The main contemporary views within <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> perception include naive realism, enactivism and representional views.|$|E

5|$|<b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions {{relating to}} psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using {{the tools of the}} <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> mind and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. <b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> language.|$|E
5|$|There are countless {{subjects}} that {{are affected by}} the ideas developed in the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character, the nature of emotion, of perception and of memory. Questions about what a person is and what his or her identity consists of also {{have much to do with}} the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> mind. There are two {{subjects that}}, in connection with the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> the mind, have aroused special attention: free will and the self.|$|E

Kant's [...] "transcendental" [...] critique, can be contrasted to Hegel's [...] "immanent dialectics." ...|$|R
