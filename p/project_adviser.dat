His career at TPAO mostly included implementation {{and management of}} a number of national and international petroleum research projects until 1998 when he became advisor to the president of Turkey. During his industrial career, with the help of United Nations Development Programme Fellowship, he gained great experience on R&D project management during his visits to oil companies and universities in the USA.In addition to research administration and management, he is personally initiated, participated, and coordinated several research projects on petroleum exploration. From 1977 to 1998, his findings are reported in 22 company reports (TPAO Report Nos. 190, 195, 276, 279, 287, 345, 427, 1065, 1185, 1255, 1264, 1265, 1269, 1565, 1755, 1757, 1949, 1964, 2097, 2118, 2191, 2312), some of which are published in various national and international scientific and technical periodicals. Among them the most important ones are Biostratigraphic Atlas of the Autochthonous Sequences in the Southeast Anatolia and A Geological Time Table in Turkish. [...] Both of these studies were the first in Turkey. Two of these reports are published as educational series for short courses on biostratigraphy and organic geochemistry.As a result of R&D studies carried out on palynology at the TPAO Research Center until 1998, Ediger developed a new laboratory technique called MRA (Modified Reissinger Apparatus) and erected 2 new palynomorph genera, namely Transeptaesporites Ediger (1981) and Anatolinites Elsik, Ediger & Batı (1990), and 24 new palynomorph species; Inapertisporites rotundus Ediger (1981), Lacrimasporonoites oviformis Ediger (1981), Dicellaesporites nodusus Ediger (1981), Pluricellaesporites vermiculus Ediger (1981), Multicellaesporites fusus Ediger (1981), Brachysporisporites thraceous Ediger (1981), Transeptaesporites irregularis Ediger (1981), Transeptaesporites symmetricus Ediger (1981), Polyadosporonites enormis Ediger (1981), Polyadosporonites orbis Ediger (1981), Inapertisporites ibrahimii Ediger & Alişan (1989), Uncinulites artuziae Ediger & Alişan (1989), Lacrimasporonites traversii Ediger & Alişan (1989), Dicellaesporites nakomanii Ediger & Alişan (1989), Dicellaesporites akyolii Ediger & Alişan (1989) Dyadosporonites okayi Ediger & Alişan (1989), Multicellasporites elsikii Ediger & Alişan (1989), Anatolinites dongyingensis Elsik, Ediger & Batı (1990), Anatolinites alaskaensis Elsik, Ediger & Batı (1990), Anatolinites alternarioides Elsik, Ediger & Batı (1990), Anatolinites chubutensis Elsik, Ediger & Batı (1990), Anatolinites claibornensis Elsik, Ediger & Batı (1990), Anatolinites holocenicus Elsik, Ediger Batı (1990), Anatolinites reklawensis Elsik, Ediger & Batı (1990).|$|E

40|$|Aims To {{examine the}} {{barriers}} and facilitators to effective {{operation of a}} regional tobacco control coordinator working within and across criminal justice and public health, whose goal was to raise tobacco control awareness and support the development of smoking cessation treatment for offenders. Design A reflexive, mixed-methods case study approach using in-depth interviews, project reports and observation of advisory board meetings. Setting The coordinator worked with prisons, probation and police custody, where there are high levels of social disadvantage and smoking. Participants Interviews (n[*]=[*] 34) {{at different stages of}} project with the coordinator, <b>project</b> <b>advisers</b> and local stakeholders from criminal justice and public health. Measurements Analysis of facilitators and barriers and the coordinator role from different perspectives. Findings Readiness to develop cessation services was a critical predictor of different criminal justice settings' engagement with the coordinator role. The coordinator enhanced cessation service delivery in individual prisons where there was a requirement and infrastructure in place to provide such services. In police custody, where there was no central guidance or pre-existing requirements, efforts to establish smoking cessation on the local agenda proved ineffective. In probation settings, the coordinator documented examples of good practice and supported brief intervention training. Variability in willingness to engage limited the project's ability to create joined-up working across criminal justice settings. Conclusions In the English criminal justice system, the prison service appears to provide a favourable context for development of smoking cessation support and a means of accessing hard-to-reach groups. Other criminal justice settings, most specifically police custody, appear less responsive to such activity. A coordinator role can improve smoking cessation support in the prison setting, and develop local improvements in tobacco control interventions in other settings such as probation, but as configured here, does not have the capacity to effect change across the criminal justice system...|$|R

This project was implemented by CUTS in four countries: Ghana, India, Philippines and Zambia, and across two common sectors: Staple Food and Bus Transport with the support from DFID (UK) and BMZ (Germany) facilitated by GIZ (Germany). The aim of the project was to highlight the relevance of competition reforms for social and economic welfare in developing countries, and motivate other countries, governments and development partners to accord greater attention to the subject of competition reforms. In view of this overall aim of the project, with inputs from the <b>project</b> <b>advisers</b> CUTS designed the final conference of the CREW project on a broader theme to talk about ‘Relevance of Competition & Regulatory Reforms in Pursuing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Developing Countries’. The theme was thought to be both contemporary and relevant in view of the adoption of the SDGs a couple of months before this final conference. In addition to the support it received from DFID (UK), BMZ (Germany) and GIZ (Germany), the conference also received support from the World Bank, G- 77 Secretariat and the OECD. CUTS is grateful to all the above organisations for supporting the conference, and indeed also the production of this volume. We acknowledge the support from the members of the Project Advisory Committee of the CREW project, who contributed to make this conference a grand success.

It was intended that the Survey would complement the survey carried out by the Irish College of General Practice on General Practice (1997) from the General Practitioner's perspective. The Survey The Survey was undertaken as a random national postal survey.

40|$|The {{selection}} of an appropriate project delivery system (PDS) is {{of paramount importance}} to an infrastructure project, as it could affect the success of the plan in terms of time, cost, and quality. Researchers have advocated that the development and application of a systematic approach to the {{selection of}} PDS is needed. To achieve that, not only is a reliable analytical framework necessary, but a platform that would allow users to freely access and share their experience on various PDSs would also be indispensable. The World Wide Web, a powerful tool for collecting and disseminating knowledge and information, is a suitable platform for developing the PDS selection model. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to examine the suitability of applying internet technologies to selecting appropriate project delivery approaches for infrastructure projects. The paper begins by describing the conceptual framework of the virtual <b>project</b> delivery system <b>adviser</b> for infrastructure facilities (VPDSA-IF), and the design considerations and features of the VPDSA-IF are then detailed.
