This paper {{deals with}} {{application}} of CFD methods contained in professional software package Fluent on a numerical solution of engineering practice problem which consists in numerical simulations of a cool air flow inside {{the first part}} of 06 T-Cagliari tram <b>passenger</b> <b>space.</b> The air-conditioner exhausts a cool air into the internal <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> via outlet gaps of longitudinal air channels. A cool air is assumed incompressible according to the Boussinesq approximation and its flow inside the closed <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> is solved as an unsteady natural convection problem. The numerical simulations are realized for two computational models – without and with passengers aboard. Computed values of the air velocity and temperature are compared with recommended limiting values published in available relevant standards...|$|R

50|$|Savannah {{served as}} a {{passenger}}-cargo liner until 1965, when passenger service was discontinued. By this time a total of 848 passengers had been carried along with 4,800 tons of cargo. The ship was converted to all-cargo use, with the removal of 1,800 tons of ballast. <b>Passenger</b> <b>spaces</b> were closed. Savannah operated {{for three years and}} traveled 350000 mi before returning to Galveston for refueling. Four of the 32 fuel assemblies were replaced and the remaining units rearranged to even out fuel usage. She resumed service until the end of 1971, when she was deactivated.|$|E
