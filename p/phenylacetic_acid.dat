In early episodes, a once common clandestine route, the Nagai red phosphorus/iodine method, is depicted, which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to d-(+)-methamphetamine. By the season 1 finale, Walt chooses to use a different synthetic route based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required. The new method Walt chooses is a reductive amination reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine. On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P) is produced from <b>phenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide (ThO2) as a catalyst, as mentioned in episodes [...] "A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal" [...] and [...] "Más".

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{combination}} of photoredox and palla-dium catalysis has been employed {{to facilitate the}} room temperature decarboxylative allylation of recalcitrant α-amino and phenylacetic allyl esters.

In either case targetted delivery of the differentiating agent to the lymphoid cells may be envisaged.

Migration definitely appears feasible under alkaline conditions, making proton release from the OH groups.
