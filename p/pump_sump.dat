40|$|Abstract — Experiments were {{conducted}} on a physical hydraulic model of a circulating water <b>pump</b> <b>sump</b> structure. The cooling water intake structure consisted of two circulating water pumps and two auxiliary water pumps withdrawing flow {{from one end of}} a cooling tower basin. The objective of the hydraulic model study was to evaluate the performance of the initial design of the <b>pump</b> <b>sump</b> and to develop modifications to eliminate flow problems such as severe vortexing, intense swirl, or uneven flow distribution at the pump bell. The initial design of the intake structure developed high levels of pre-swirl and strong vortices were observed entering the circulating pumps. Modifications were developed in the model to reduce the level of flow pre-swirl and vortex activity and to improve the flow conditions entering the circulating water pumps. Proposed modifications to the sump included the installation of sidewall fillets, back-wall fillets and center floor splitters. Modifications also included the installation of a curtain wall set at El. 1089. 95 om and 3. 71 om from the back-wall of the sump. With these modifications installed in the model, flow pre-swirl, vortex activity and pump throat velocities were all within acceptable limits for the range of operating conditions examined in the model.

40|$|It is an {{accepted}} fact that {{quite a number}} of problems faced in a pumping station are related to the design of sump or intake rather than pump design. Head-capacity curves provided by the pump manufacturer are obtained on the condition of no vortices flowing into the pump intake. The efficiency and performance of pumping stations depend not only on the performance of the selected pumps but also on the proper design of the intake sumps. A faulty design of <b>pump</b> <b>sump</b> can lead to the occurrence of swirl and vortices, which reduce the pump performance and induce vibration and additional noise. Therefore, sump model test is necessary to check the flow condition around intake structure. Numerical simulation is a good facility for reducing the time and cost involved throughout the design process. In this study, the commercial software ANSYS CFX- 13. 0 has been used for the CFD analysis of the sump models. In a scaled sump model for air entrainment simulation, numerical analysis of single phase and two-phase with SST turbulence model was carried out to predict vortex (both free surface vortex and submerged vortex) occurrence and location. The effectiveness of curtain walls and square bars to eliminate the free surface vortex is evaluated. Meanwhile, the experiment including PIV system was performed in KMOU to investigate the flow conditions around pump intake structure. In a full size sump model, overall numerical analysis for the sump model with a mixed flow pump installed was carried out. Hydraulic performances of the mixed flow pump for head rise, shaft power, pump efficiencies versus flow rate changed from 50 % to 140 % of the design flow rate were studied by the performance curves. A trident shaped anti vortex device (AVD) composed of three wall fillets and one center splitter was installed under the pump intake. The effectiveness of the AVD for the suppression of submerged vortex was evaluated. In addition, numerical simulation of cavitation phenomenon in the mixed flow pump has been performed by calculating the full cavitation model with k-琯 turbulence model. According to the results, details of the location, size and strength of vortices were predicted in the numerical simulation. For the scaled sump model, although there is a little difference between the single phase and two-phase simulation, all the results predict the free surface vortex and submerged vortex formation and location. The CFD simulations of flow condition show good agreement with the PIV results. The effectiveness of curtain walls installed to inhibit the free surface vortex is confirmed in the CFD resultswhile the square bars installed in the channel failed to suppress the free surface vortex. For the mixed flow pump with sump, the best efficiency point (BEP) is at the design flow rate with the corresponding efficiency of 89. 6 %. The effectiveness of AVDs installed for the submerged vortex is confirmed by comparisons of the sump model with and without AVD results. Cavitation phenomenon analysis shows the pump operating at the BEP condition has a considerable extent over the requirement of cavitation performance. With numerical simulation, the inception of cavitation in the blade passage is observed on the suction surface where the leading edges meet the tips, and then as the inlet total pressure decrease, the cavitation zone is spread out over the suction surface as well as {{the leading edge of the}} impeller blade.

Greenhouses industry {{is one of the}} most important agricultural practices in remote areas. Greenhouses help in extending the gardening activities and allows us to cultivate certain plants all over the year; by controlling air temperature and relative humidity inside greenhouse. In greenhouses, cooling and pumping equipments dominate the demand for electricity. Therefore, a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system is necessary to feed that demand. Medicinal herbs, for example are the most suitable plants to be cultivated in the greenhouses. They often need a temperature range of 15 - 21 oC and about 70 % relative humidity to grow. As the climate in Egypt is not suitable all over the year to cultivate these medicinal herbs, it is preferable and necessary to use PV-based control greenhouse to cultivate these medicinal herbs in Egyptian remote areas.

40|$|Fat, oil {{and grease}} (FOG) {{deposits}} {{are one of the}} leading causes of sewer system blockages, thereby increasing the risks of undesired and polluting flooding and sewer overflows. FOG accumulates throughout the entire sewer network; e. g., in public sewer pipes and lateral house connections it reduces the available discharge capacity, and in <b>pump</b> <b>sumps</b> it increases the risk of pump failures. Previous studies primarily focused on FOG deposits occurring in parts of sewer systems downstream of Food Service Establishments (FSE). It is thought, however, that domestic FOG disposal is also an important contributor to FOG deposits, and therefore warrants further investigation. Consequently, the objective of this research was to investigate the relationship between domestic FOG disposal patterns and the occurrence of FOG deposits in sewer systems. By considering both the household scale and the scale of catchments, it was possible to study the influence of individual and population disposal patterns. The first part of this study focused on the influence of individual disposal patterns; samples of FOG deposits were collected from clogged building drainage systems and questionnaires were conducted to reveal information about the household’s cooking and disposal habits. Only three out of the eleven households showed a link between the cooking fats and oils used and the FOG deposits collected, as their fatty acid profiles displayed similarities. The second part of this study focused on the influence of population disposal patterns on the occurrence of FOG deposits, by studying the severe accumulation of FOG at pumping stations in relation to catchment demographics and sewer system characteristics. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) procedures were used to model the probability of {{the presence or absence of}} FOG in <b>pump</b> <b>sumps.</b> The model revealed that severe accumulation of FOG in <b>pump</b> <b>sumps</b> was negatively correlated to the average income of inhabitants attached to the catchment, suggesting that individuals within an income-group shared FOG disposal patterns. Furthermore, FSE density and kinetic energy of wastewater per unit of volume per day were found to be important factors correlated with the occurrence of FOG deposits. The results provide important insights into factors that may influence the accumulation of FOG. Further research is required to obtain insights in how particular diets, cleaning habits and FOG disposal patterns may influence the accumulation of FOG.

40|$|The {{presence}} of unsteady intermittent meandering wall attached and free-surface vortices {{is a common}} feature of pump intake flows. These vortices are known to induce high levels of unsteady swirl inside the pump column and negatively affect {{the performance of the}} pumps. In the present study we describe the use of a LES model to numerically study the flow and main coherent structures.

The model is first validated using the PIV data collected on a scaled model of a pressurized (no free surface) <b>pump</b> <b>sump.</b> It is found that most of the main vortical structures are changing considerably their structure and intensity in time. The flow is dominated by large scale interactions among these vortices. For the given flow conditions the main vortex in the flow originates at the floor.

The flow at the pump section sump may have large effects on the pump performances and the operating conditions. The flow patterns in the sump are mainly determined by the shape and scale of the sump. However, it's not always possible to design a sump pump to provide uniform and stable flow to pumps, due to site constraints. For example in some cases air entraining (surface and subsurface vortex) occurs. These vortices may reduce pump performances and lead to increase plant operating costs.

Previous systems required that the pumps in these plants be housed in shallow sumps that were gravity fed by the storage tanks. This new pump arrangement will eliminate the sumplevel control valves and the potential for overflowing the <b>pump</b> <b>sump</b> vessels. Until now only cantilever pumps were qualified for hot molten-salt service because no suitable bearing materials had been tested. This paper describes the successful qualification of a long-shafted pump with salt-lubricated bearings tested for over 5000 hours with nitrate salt at 565 °C. BACKGROUND In a molten salt power tower, two-axis tracking mirrors (heliostats) redirect sunlight {{to the top of a}} tower where a heat exchanger (receiver) is located. “Cold” molten salt at 290 ºC is pumped from a sump- gravity fed from a cold-salt storage tank located at the bottom of the tower- to the receiver where the salt is heated by concentrated sunlight from 290 ºC to 565 ºC. The hot salt returns to grade level and flows into a hot tank. To generate electric power, hot salt is pumped from a sump – gravity fed from the hot storage tank- through a steam generator to produce high-pressure superheated steam to power a turbine-generator set. Molten-salt power towers have cost-effective thermal storage systems that allow electricity to be produced (dispatched) when it is needed (in cloudy weather, at night, even 24 hours a day), decoupling it from solar collection.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the application of}} Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in combination with a Volume-of-Fluid method (VOF) for the simulation of water scavenge jet pumps (WSJP) of the kind used in aircraft fuel tanks. The WSJP is operated with fuel as the primary motive fluid to <b>pump</b> <b>sump</b> water and offers a very complex flow difficult to investigate experimentally due to the opaqueness of the dense two-phase mixture. In an attempt to address this issue, a computational LES- VOF approach is used to investigate in detail the working of the WSJP. As part of this investigation, the current work aims {{to contribute to the}} understanding of liquid-liquid atomisation, lesser known than more common liquid-gas atomisation. In addition to providing a more accurate physical pic- ture, this work serves as a test of the LES- VOF methodology and its limitations. The LES- VOF calculations over a range of flow ratios presented confirm that for the stan- dard operational flow ratio, a mixture of fuel droplets into water is produced at the exit, contrary to the desired result of water drops in fuel dispersion. The occurrence of the water-in-fuel dispersion is shown to be more likely to occur at lower inlet flow rate ra- tios, through phase inversion. The turbulent break-up of the central fuel jet show clearly the important overlapping effects of small and large scale instabilities in the fragmen- tation process. Additionally, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed using the same interface-capturing methodology in order to gain insight into the dynamics of a single fuel droplet decelerating through stagnant water, with a view towards better un- derstanding of the liquid-liquid dynamics involved in the jet pump computations, and especially the effect of grid resolution {{on the quality of the}} results. The computations provide valuable information on the physics of the process, but mostly help confirm the validity of the LES-VOF results.

Free air-core vortex occurring at a water-intake pipe is an important problem encountered in hydraulic engineering. These vortices reduce pump performances, may have large effects on the operating conditions and lead to increase plant operating costs. This work is an extended study starting from 2006 in LML and published by ISSA and al. in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Several cases of sump configuration have been numerically investigated using two specific commercial codes and based on the initial geometry proposed by Constantinescu and Patel. Fluent and Star CCM+ codes are used in the previous studies. The results, obtained with a structured mesh, were strongly dependant on main geometrical sump configuration such as the suction pipe position, the submergence of the suction pipe on one hand and the turbulence model on the other hand. Part of the results showed a good agreement with experimental investigations already published. Experiments, conducted in order to select best positions of the suction pipe of a water-intake sump, gave qualitative results concerning flow disturbances in the pump-intake related to sump geometries and position of the pump intake. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reproduce the flow pattern of experiments and to confirm the geometrical parameter that influences the flow structure in such a pump. The numerical model solves the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and VOF multiphase model. STAR CCM+ with an adapted mesh configuration using hexahedral mesh with prism layer near walls was used. Attempts have been made to calculate two phase unsteady flow for stronger mass flow rates and stronger submergence with low water level in order to be able to capture air entrainment. The results allow the knowledge of some limits of numerical models, of mass flow rates and of submergences for air entrainment.
