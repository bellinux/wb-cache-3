5|$|Porpoises have a two-chambered stomach that {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to those of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and <b>pyloric</b> chambers.|$|E
5|$|Whales have a two- to three-chambered stomach that {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Mysticetes contain a proventriculus {{as an extension of}} the oesophagus; this contains stones that grind up food. They also have fundic and <b>pyloric</b> chambers.|$|E
5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their <b>pyloric</b> stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} <b>pyloric</b> stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called <b>pyloric</b> caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to {{the tips of the}} papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the <b>pyloric</b> glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and <b>pyloric</b> chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the <b>pyloric</b> antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
25|$|Although UGI {{endoscopy}} {{would demonstrate}} <b>pyloric</b> obstruction, physicians {{would find it}} difficult to differentiate accurately between hypertrophic <b>pyloric</b> stenosis and pylorospasm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyloric</b> {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} a pylorus that is narrow. This is due to congenital hypertrophy of the <b>pyloric</b> sphincter. The lumen of the pylorus is narrower, and less food is able to pass through. This problem is often detected in the early weeks of life. When it is present, a newborn baby may projectile vomit after eating, but despite vomiting remain hungry. <b>Pyloric</b> stenosis may be managed by the insertion of a stent, or through surgical cutting of the <b>pyloric</b> sphincter, a pyloromyotomy.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{evidence}} both {{for and against}} the association of <b>pyloric</b> stenosis and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) {{has been linked to}} an increased probability of <b>pyloric</b> stenosis in young infants. Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic <b>pyloric</b> stenosis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pyloric</b> sphincter, or valve, is {{a strong}} ring of smooth muscle {{at the end of}} the <b>pyloric</b> canal which lets food pass from the stomach to the duodenum. It {{controls}} the outflow of gastric contents into the duodenum. It receives sympathetic innervation from the celiac ganglion.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>pyloric</b> {{stenosis}} are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus and non-passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum. Muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters (mm) or greater and <b>pyloric</b> channel length of 15mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days.|$|E
25|$|Type III: In the <b>pyloric</b> channel within 3cm of pylorus. Associated with acid oversecretion.|$|E
25|$|Toothed whales have a two-chambered stomach {{similar in}} {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and <b>pyloric</b> chambers.|$|E
25|$|Infantile <b>pyloric</b> {{stenosis}} {{is typically}} managed with surgery; very few cases are mild {{enough to be}} treated medically.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins have a two-chambered stomach that {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and <b>pyloric</b> chambers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{whether it is}} a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the <b>pyloric</b> sphincter muscle.|$|E
25|$|Gastric outlet {{obstruction}} is a {{narrowing of}} the <b>pyloric</b> canal by scarring and {{swelling of the}} gastric antrum and duodenum due to peptic ulcers. The person often presents with severe vomiting without bile.|$|E
25|$|The pylorus is one {{component}} of the gastrointestinal system. Food from the stomach, as chyme, passes through the pylorus to the duodenum. The pylorus, through the <b>pyloric</b> sphincter, regulates entry of food from the stomach into the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{exposed to}} {{erythromycin}} are {{at increased risk}} for developing hypertrophic <b>pyloric</b> stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life and possibly in late pregnancy and through breastmilk in {{the first two weeks of}} life.|$|E
25|$|The pylorus is {{the furthest}} {{part of the}} stomach that connects to the duodenum. It {{is divided into two}} parts, the antrum, which connects to the body of the stomach, and the <b>pyloric</b> canal, which connects to the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotics}} erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin {{are typically}} the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to {{lower rates of}} side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) {{may be used in}} those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of <b>pyloric</b> stenosis from macrolides.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} <b>pyloric</b> {{stenosis}} is unclear. Risk factors in babies include birth by cesarean section, preterm birth, bottle feeding, and being first born. The diagnosis {{may be made}} by feeling an olive-shaped mass in the baby's abdomen. This is often confirmed with ultrasound.|$|E
25|$|In such {{conditions}} as stomach cancer, tumours may partly block the <b>pyloric</b> canal. A special tube can be implanted surgically {{to connect the}} stomach to the duodenum so as to facilitate the passage of food {{from one to the}} other. This tube is called a gastroduodenostomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{intestinal}} phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food {{fills the}} duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the <b>pyloric</b> sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.|$|E
25|$|The middle {{circular}} layer: At this layer, the pylorus {{is surrounded}} by a thick circular muscular wall which is normally tonically constricted forming a functional (if not anatomically discrete) <b>pyloric</b> sphincter, which controls the movement of chyme into the duodenum. This layer is concentric to the longitudinal axis of the stomach.|$|E
25|$|About {{one to two}} per {{thousand}} babies are affected. Males are affected about four times more often than females. The condition is very rare in adults. The first description of <b>pyloric</b> stenosis was in 1888 with surgery management first carried out in 1912 by Conrad Ramstedt. Before surgical treatment most babies died.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyloric</b> {{stenosis}} is a {{narrowing of}} the opening from the stomach to {{the first part of}} the small intestine (the pylorus). Symptoms include projectile vomiting without the presence of bile. This most often occurs after the baby is fed. The typical age that symptoms become obvious is two to twelve weeks old.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} <b>pyloric</b> {{stenosis}} {{comes from the}} dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself. Therefore, the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and the abnormally high blood pH seen in combination with low chloride levels with IV fluids. This can usually be accomplished in about 24–48 hours.|$|E
25|$|In {{birds and}} crocodilians, the stomach {{is divided into}} two regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus, lined by fundic glands, and {{connecting}} the true stomach to the crop. Beyond lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by <b>pyloric</b> glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} many other animals, the stomach is located between the {{oesophagus}} and the small intestine. It secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. The <b>pyloric</b> sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum where peristalsis takes over to move this {{through the rest of}} the intestines.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the stomach}} can empty into the duodenum, feeding can begin again. Some {{vomiting}} {{may be expected}} during the first days after surgery as the gastrointestinal tract settles. Rarely, the myotomy procedure performed is incomplete and projectile vomiting continues, requiring repeat surgery. <b>Pyloric</b> stenosis generally has no long term side-effects or impact on the child's future.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 Fisher {{married a}} young woman while he was engaged to another. Fisher's {{previous}} fiancée sued him for a breach of promise. Meanwhile, he and his new wife Jane went {{on a business trip}} for their honeymoon. The couple had one child in 1921, that died at one month old from <b>Pyloric</b> Stenosis. The couple were divorced in 1926.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{vomiting}} {{results in}} loss of stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). The vomited material {{does not contain}} bile because the <b>pyloric</b> obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach. The chloride loss results in a low blood chloride level which impairs the kidney's ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the significant factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{and oral}} {{atropine}} {{may be used}} to treat <b>pyloric</b> stenosis. It has a success rate of 85-89% compared to nearly 100% for pyloromyotomy, however it requires prolonged hospitalization, skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment. It might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery, or in children whose parents do not want surgery.|$|E
25|$|Foreign body is {{an object}} {{foreign to the}} body that becomes lodged in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract (or {{other part of the}} dog). Dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the esophagus. Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the stomach because of the inability to pass through the <b>pyloric</b> sphincter, and in the jejunum.|$|E
