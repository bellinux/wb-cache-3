The {{liquid ring pump}} was invented in 1905 by Lewis H. Nash. Production soon began thereafter at the Nash Engineering Company. Nash filed U.S. patent #1,091,529 on February 24, 1910 and was issued to him on March 31, 1914.|$|E

50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> {{must not}} operate against a closed valve on the {{discharge}} {{side of the}} pump, because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal pumps. A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> operating against a closed discharge valve continues to produce flow and the pressure in the discharge line increases until the line bursts, the pump is severely damaged, or both.|$|E

40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high delivery pressures and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. Inspection windows were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump).</b> Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump)</b> backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|E
50|$|A {{piston pump}} {{is a type}} of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> where the {{high-pressure}} seal reciprocates with the piston. Piston pumps can be used to move liquids or compress gases.|$|E
50|$|As with <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{the base}} {{pressure}} will be reached when leakage, outgassing, and backstreaming equal the pump speed, but now minimizing leakage and outgassing {{to a level}} comparable to backstreaming becomes much more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Endless-piston {{principle}} is a dispensing variation of rotating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Their operating principle {{can be compared}} with an endless piston that conveys the product from the suction side to the discharge side, building up a differential pressure in the process.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{metering}} pumps are piston-driven. Piston <b>pumps</b> are <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{which can be}} designed to pump at practically constant flow rates (averaged over time) against {{a wide range of}} discharge pressure, including high discharge pressures of thousands of psi.|$|R
50|$|The Powerplus is {{a design}} of {{supercharger}} {{that was used}} to boost the performance of car engines in the 1930s. It is a mechanically driven <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> operating on the sliding-vane principle.|$|E
50|$|The flow is pulsed, {{particularly}} at low rotational speeds. Therefore, these pumps are less suitable where a smooth consistent flow is required. An alternative type of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> should then be considered.|$|E
5000|$|An {{axial piston}} pump is a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> {{that has a}} number of pistons in a {{circular}} array within a cylinder block. It {{can be used as a}} stand-alone pump, a hydraulic motor or an automotive air conditioning compressor.|$|E
50|$|Centrifugal pump {{impellers}} have specific speed values ranging from 500 to 10,000 (English units), with {{radial flow pumps}} at 500-4000, mixed flow at 2000-8000 and axial flow pumps at 7000-20,000. Values of specific speed less than 500 are associated with <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pumps can be {{classified}} by their method of <b>displacement</b> into <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> impulse pumps, velocity pumps, gravity pumps, steam pumps and valveless pumps. There are two basic types of pumps: <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> and centrifugal. Although axial-flow pumps are frequently classified as a separate type, they have essentially the same operating principles as centrifugal pumps.|$|R

50|$|A {{plunger pump}} {{is a type}} of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> where the {{high-pressure}} seal is stationary and a smooth cylindrical plunger slides through the seal. This makes them different from piston pumps and allows them to be used at higher pressures. This type of pump is often used to transfer municipal and industrial sewage.|$|E
50|$|A {{diaphragm}} pump (also {{known as a}} Membrane pump) is a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that uses {{a combination of the}} reciprocating action of a rubber, thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves {{on either side of the}} diaphragm(check valve, butterfly valves, flap valves, or any other form of shut-off valves) to pump a fluid.|$|E
5000|$|The bush pump, {{also known}} as the Zimbabwe bush pump, is a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> based on lever action [...] used to extract water from a bore hole well. It is the {{standard}} hand pump in Zimbabwe, and is used in Zimbabwe and Namibia. There are approximately 40 000 pumps (2009) in Zimbabwe, and annually about 3000 pumps are installed.|$|E
50|$|These <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> have an {{expanding}} cavity on the suction {{side and a}} decreasing cavity on the discharge side. Liquid flows into the pumps as the cavity on the suction side expands and the liquid flows out of the discharge as the cavity collapses. The volume is constant given each cycle of operation.|$|R
40|$|A {{transient}} multiphase CFD {{model was}} set up to investigate the main causes which lead to cavitation in <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> (PD) reciprocating <b>pumps.</b> Many authors such as Karsten Opitz [1] agree on distinguishing two different types of cavitation affecting PD pumps: flow induced cavitation and cavitation due to expansion. The flow induced cavitation affects the zones of high fluid velocity and consequent low static pressure e. g. the valve-seat volume gap while the cavitation due to expansion can be detected in zones where the decompression effects are important e. g. {{in the vicinity of the}} plunger. This second factor is a distinctive feature of PD pumps since other devices such as centrifugal pumps are only affected by the flow induced type. Unlike what has been published in the technical literature to date, where analysis of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are based exclusively on experimental or analytic methods, the work presented in this paper is based entirely on a CFD approach, it discusses the appearance and the dynamics of these two phenomena throughout an entire pumping cycle pointing out the potential of CFD techniques in studying the causes of cavitation and assessing the consequent loss of performance in <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R
50|$|This is the {{simplest}} of rotary <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> It consists of two meshed gears that rotate in a closely fitted casing. The tooth spaces trap fluid and force it around the outer periphery. The fluid does not travel back on the meshed part, because the teeth mesh closely in the center. Gear pumps see wide use in car engine oil pumps and in various hydraulic power packs.|$|R
50|$|A {{practical}} {{difference between}} dynamic and positive displacement pumps {{is how they}} operate under closed valve conditions. Positive displacement pumps physically displace fluid, so closing a valve downstream of a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump. Dynamic pumps differ in {{that they can be}} safely operated under closed valve conditions (for short periods of time).|$|E
50|$|Continued pumping {{operation}} of the heart during exsanguination increases the rate of depletion, and thus hastens death, by raising the fluid pressure of the blood. Because the heart operates like a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> reduction of blood volume will not affect efficiency of cardiac output — deprivation of blood to the heart does gradually result in diminished function, but concurrently with similar death of other parts in the body.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are the most}} effective for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive {{displacement pumps}} are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|E
50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> {{moves the}} same volume of gas with each cycle, so its pumping speed is {{constant}} {{unless it is}} overcome by backstreaming.|$|R
50|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> use a {{mechanism}} to repeatedly expand a cavity, allow gases to flow in from the chamber, seal off the cavity, and exhaust it to the atmosphere. Momentum transfer pumps, also called molecular pumps, use high speed jets of dense fluid or high speed rotating blades to knock gas molecules out of the chamber. Entrapment pumps capture gases in a solid or adsorbed state. This includes cryopumps, getters, and ion pumps.|$|R
50|$|The pumps used in VADs can {{be divided}} into two main categories—pulsatile pumps, that mimic the natural pulsing action of the heart, and {{continuous}} flow pumps. Pulsatile VADs use <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> In some pulsatile pumps (that use compressed air as the/a energy source), the volume occupied by blood varies during the pumping cycle. If the pump is contained inside the body then a vent tube to the outside air is required.|$|R
