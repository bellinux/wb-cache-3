5|$|Odin {{was also}} {{closely linked to}} ravens because in Norse myths he {{received}} the fallen warriors at Valhalla, and ravens were linked with death and war due to their <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> carrion. It is consequently likely that they were regarded as manifestations of the Valkyries, goddesses who chose the valiant dead for military service in Valhalla.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E

50|$|During his lifetime, Rutar was {{a popular}} writer. He {{was known for his}} simple, vigorous, and direct prose, as well as his <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> clear {{statements}} and stalwart judgements. He did important work in popularizing history among Slovenes.|$|R
60|$|My {{selection}} of locality was {{a compromise between}} my wife's desire {{to go into the}} country, and my own <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> civic habitation. Like most compromises, it ended in retaining the objectionable features of both propositions; I procured the inconveniences of the country without losing the discomforts of the city. I increased my distance from the butcher and green-grocer, without approximating to herds and kitchen-gardens. But I anticipate.|$|R
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> bunnies but {{simply because they are}} omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E
5|$|When Kentucky's {{neutrality}} was breached in September 1861, Hawes fled to Virginia {{to escape}} imprisonment by Federal authorities. While there, he enlisted as a brigade commissary under Confederate general Humphrey Marshall {{and was given}} the rank of major. Though his ability to obtain supplies for Marshall's brigade was commendable given the difficult conditions, his age (64) and lack of military experience lessened his value to Marshall's unit, and his <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> jumping {{the chain of command}} and communicating directly with Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin put him at odds with Marshall personally.|$|E
5|$|Amanita daucipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies may {{be found}} growing solitary or scattered {{on the ground in}} mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (especially those dominated by oak trees) in Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas; other associated tree species include hickory (genus Carya) and birch (Betula). A <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> disturbed soil, such as roadsides, has been noted. Amanita authority Cornelis Bas, writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on the genus, claimed A.daucipes to be a rare species; subsequent investigations have shown it to be common in oak forests in the eastern United States. The southern end of its distribution extends to Sonora, Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|As a mere schoolboy, Boker's {{knowledge}} of poetry was remarkable. I can {{remember that he}} even at nine years of age manifested that wonderful gift that caused him many years after to be characterized by some great actor—I think it was Forrest—as the best reader in America... While at college... Shakespeare and Byron were his favourites. He used to quiz me sometimes <b>for</b> my <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> Wordsworth and Coleridge. We both loved Shelley passionately.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} this deep veneration for Mr. Keble and for his teachings, Bishop Patteson did not embrace to the full the {{doctrine}} which had been maintained in 'Eucharistic Adoration,' and which he rightly perceived to lie {{at the root of}} the whole Ritualistic question. His conclusions had been formed upon the teachings of the elder Anglican divines, and his <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> the externals of worship upon the most reverent and beautiful forms to which he had been accustomed before he left home.|$|R
50|$|In 1848 {{he founded}} Le Journal. In 1855 {{he went to}} live at Nice, where he indulged his <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> floriculture, and gave his name {{to more than one}} new variety, notably the dahlia (New International Encyclopedia). Indeed he {{practically}} founded the trade in cut flowers on the French Riviera. He was also devoted to fishing, and in Les Soirées de Sainte-Adresse (1853) and Au bord de la mer (1860) he made use of his experiences. His reminiscences, Livre de bord, were published in 1879-1880. He died at Saint-Raphaël (Var).|$|R
5|$|Dennie had health trouble {{throughout}} his life, {{as well as}} a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> wine. His father (who had battled mental illness) died on September 28, 1811; Dennie was not able to attend his father's funeral, as he himself was gravely ill at the time, and this caused him great grief. He briefly recovered, but succumbed to cholera morbus four months after his father's death. Dennie died on January 7, 1812, and was interred two days later at St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia. His epitaph was written by John Quincy Adams. The epitaph erroneously gives Lexington, Massachusetts as his birthplace; in fact, Dennie was born in Boston, but his family moved to Lexington shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1863, Anderson {{was made a}} lieutenant, serving in a unit led by George M. Todd. In June and July, Anderson took part in several raids that killed Union soldiers, in Westport, Kansas City, and Lafayette County, Missouri. The first {{reference}} to Anderson in Official Records of the American Civil War concerns his activities at this time, describing him as the captain of a band of guerrillas. He commanded 30–40 men, {{one of whom was}} Archie Clement, an 18-year-old with a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> torture and mutilation who was loyal only to Anderson. By late July, Anderson led groups of guerrillas on raids, and was often pursued by Union volunteer cavalry. Anderson was under Quantrill's command, but independently organized some attacks.|$|E
5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood. As {{a consequence of}} its <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> dead wood, the fungus {{is often associated with}} disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, wood chips or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows in sandy soil, near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.|$|E

She enjoys her celebrity status and her time with friends John Belushi, Truman Capote, and Andy Warhol. Belushi and Dickinson enable each other's <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> abusing drugs. She regularly spends time at Studio 54 during this period. Dickinson recounts a {{darker side of}} celebrity, and writes that she trusted in Bill Cosby when he informed her he could help her career in show business, only to experience verbal anger from him when {{she said she was}} too tired to engage in sexual activity with him.|$|R
50|$|Training {{also may}} take into {{consideration}} the natural social tendencies of the animal species (or even breed), such as <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> attention span, food-motivation, dominance hierarchies, aggression, or bonding to individuals (conspecifics as well as humans). Consideration must also be given to practical aspects on the human side such as the ratio of the number of trainers to each animal. In some circumstances one animal may have multiple trainers, in others, a trainer might attend simultaneously to many animals in a training session. Sometimes training is accomplished with a single trainer working individually with a single animal.|$|R
5|$|Typically found growing solitary, {{in groups}} or in {{clusters}} under hardwood trees, the fungus produces fruit {{bodies in the}} summer and autumn. In the New England area of the United States, mycologist Howard Bigelow has noted it to grow on road shoulders in grass near oaks; it also has a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> growing on sloping creek banks. In Malaysia, it is found growing on the soil in forests, mostly under species of Shorea (rainforest trees in the family Dipterocarpaceae). C.lateritius has been reported from the Western Ghats, Kerala, India, forming ectomycorrhizal association with endemic tree species like Vateria indica, Hopea parviflora, Diospyros malabarica, Myristica malabarica in semi-evergreen to evergreen forests.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Alfonso Cuarón had a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> space {{programs}} {{and dreamed of}} becoming an astronaut and would watch live moon landings in television. He was 8 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969 and was profoundly influenced by Neil Armstrong. At that time his grandmother bought a new color TV {{in order to be}} able to see the moon landing that was in black and white. He watched space films like A Trip to the Moon (1902) and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration, and trying to honor the laws of physics such as Marooned (1969) and Woman in the Moon (1929). After Cuarón and his son, Jonás finished the screenplay, Cuarón attempted to develop his project at Universal Pictures, where it stayed in development for several years. After the rights to the project were sold, it began development at Warner Bros.|$|E
5|$|As a {{commander}} Marlborough preferred battle over slow moving siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (particularly his carefully selected aides-de-camp such as Cadogan), {{as well as}} enjoying a close personal relationship with the talented Imperial commander, Prince Eugene, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often far ahead of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy's characteristics in battle. Marlborough {{was more likely to}} manoeuvre than his opponents, and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet the Duke qualifies more as a great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> fire, movement, and co-ordinated all-arms attacks, lay at the root of his great battlefield successes.|$|E

50|$|In {{autumn of}} 1777, Harris {{travelled}} to Russia to be envoy-extraordinary to Russia, an office he held until September 1783. At St Petersburg {{he made his}} reputation, for {{he managed to get}} on with Catherine II, in spite of her <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> France, and steered adroitly through the accumulated difficulties of the first Armed Neutrality. He was made a Knight of the Bath at the end of 1778; but in 1782 he returned home owing to ill-health, and was appointed by his friend, Charles James Fox, to be minister at The Hague, an appointment confirmed after some delay by William Pitt the Younger (1784).|$|R
50|$|MacDonald {{grew up in}} {{an unusually}} literate environment: one of his {{maternal}} uncles was a notable Celtic scholar, editor of the Gaelic Highland Dictionary and collector of fairy tales and Celtic poetry. His paternal grandfather had supported the publication of an Ossian edition, the controversial Celtic text believed by some to have contributed to the starting of European Romanticism. MacDonald’s step-uncle was a Shakespeare scholar, and his paternal cousin another Celtic academic. Both his parents were readers, his father harbouring <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> Newton, Burns, Cowper, Chalmers, Coleridge and Darwin, to quote a few, while his mother had received a classical education which included multiple languages.|$|R
5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> modal music.|$|E
5|$|Promotion, and {{the extra}} income this would bring, now became a matter of {{considerable}} concern to Scott. In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, {{he had a chance}} encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery, {{under the auspices of the}} RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn {{takes place}} in the fictional world of Hydaelyn, a planet filled with {{multiple}} environments and climates covering three large continents. The region in which the game is set is called Eorzea. The four major city-states in Eorzea feature a wide variety of climates and biomes: the forest nation of Gridania is surrounded by a dense thicket called the Black Shroud; Ul'dah is a sultanate with a <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> commerce situated in the Thanalan Desert; the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa finds its home in La Noscea on the island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard is a theocracy built in the snowy mountains of Coerthas. Eorzea is connected to a larger continent to the northeast which has largely been conquered by the militaristic Garlean Empire. Other political entities include the beastmen tribes who perennially assault the civilized nations; Sharlayan, a scholarly city to the northwest; and Ala Mhigo, a city-state which was occupied during the first Garlean invasion twenty years prior to the events of the game. The four major city-states formed the Eorzean Alliance to repel this invasion but Ishgard abruptly withdrew, leaving the remaining three allies in name only. This conflict also resulted in the desolation of Mor Dhona, a once-vibrant region {{in the center of the}} continent that is now a barren wasteland.|$|E

60|$|To those musing weather-beaten West-country {{folk who}} pass {{the greater part}} of their days and nights out of doors, Nature seems to have moods in other than a poetical sense: <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> certain deeds at certain times, without any {{apparent}} law to govern or season to account for them. She is read as a person with a curious temper; as one who does not scatter kindnesses and cruelties alternately, impartially, and in order, but heartless severities or overwhelming generosities in lawless caprice. Man's case is always that of the prodigal's favourite or the miser's pensioner. In her unfriendly moments there seems a feline fun in her tricks, begotten by a foretaste of her pleasure in swallowing the victim.|$|R
5|$|Late in 1907, Rix {{moved to}} Paris. There {{she met with}} Australian artist Emanuel Phillips Fox, went on {{sketching}} expeditions to the Jardin du Luxembourg where Ethel Carrick Fox also worked, and became {{a student at the}} Académie Delécluse, operated by academic painter Auguste Delécluse. The following year she was taught by American impressionist Richard Emil Miller. From him she acquired the use of a relatively bright colour palette, not always naturalistic, as well as his dextrous technique; she did not, however, follow his <b>predilection</b> <b>for</b> pretty compositions, favouring more direct and clear images. Continuing to acquire skills {{from a wide range of}} artists, she next studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, including with Swiss-born illustrator Théophile Steinlen. In the summers, Rix, together with her sister and mother, would travel. In 1908 they journeyed through France and Italy, while in subsequent summers they spent time at the artists' colony at the fishing village of Étaples, in northern coastal France. Among the artists painting there was Frenchman Jules Adler, who took an interest in Rix's work, as well as many Australians, including Rupert Bunny, James Peter Quinn, Edward Officer and one of the colony's longest-term residents, Iso Rae.|$|E

A devoted lifelong cinephile with <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> John Ford's oeuvre and film noir, he was an early adoptee of the videocassette recorder and enjoyed taping obscure exemplars of classic Hollywood cinema.

40|$|Abstract The ‘prosumer’ {{has emerged}} {{to become a}} central figure in {{contemporary}} culture. Through the melding of production with consumption, both mainstream and progressive analysts conceptualize prosumption to be a liberating, empowering and, for some, a prospectively revolutionary institution. In this article, these fantastic associations are critically assessed using an approach that situates prosumption activities, including contemporary online applications {{often referred to as}} ‘cocreation’, in three social-historical contexts: capitalism as a political economy dominated by mediated abstractions; capitalist society as a hierarchical order; and alienation as a pervasive norm. Among other conclusions, we find that prosumption (particularly its Web 2. 0 iterations), constitutes an emerging hegemonic institution; one that effectively frames and contains truly radical imaginations while also tapping into existing <b>predilections</b> <b>for</b> commodity-focused forms of self-realization...|$|R
