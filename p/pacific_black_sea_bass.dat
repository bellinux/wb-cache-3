40|$|Summary The {{absolute}} light sensitivities, temporal properties, and spectral sensitivities of {{the visual}} systems of three mid-Atlantic temperate reef fishes (Atlantic spadefish [Ephippidae: Chaetodipterus faber], tautog [Labridae: Tautoga onitis], and <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> [Serranidae: Centropristis striata]) were studied via electroretinography (ERG). Pelagic Atlantic spadefish exhibited higher temporal resolution but a narrower dynamic range than the two more demersal foragers. The higher luminous sensitivities of tautog and <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> were similar to other benthic and demersal coastal mid-Atlantic fishes. Flicker fusion frequency experiments revealed significant interspecific differences at maximum intensities that correlated with lifestyle and habitat. Spectral responses of the three species spanned 400 – 610  nm, with high likelihood of cone dichromacy providing the basis for color and contrast discrimination. Significant day-night differences in spectral responses were evident in spadefish and <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> but not tautog, a labrid with characteristic structure-associated nocturnal torpor. Atlantic spadefish responded to {{a wider range of}} wavelengths than did deeper-dwelling tautog or <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass.</b> Collectively, these results suggest that temperate reef-associated fishes are well-adapted to their gradient of brighter to dimmer photoclimates, representative of their unique ecologies and life histories.

40|$|In fisheries, catch counts {{consist of}} non-negative values, usually with excess zeros {{and a heavy}} right tail. Several {{generalized}} linear models {{can be used in}} the analysis of such data since these methods do not rely on the assumption of normality. In our study, the question of interest is to determine the effect of vent sizes in fishing pots on the count of legal and sublegal <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass,</b> after removing important effects such as vessel, string within vessel, soaking time, and fishing pot position. In the experiments, four pots were investigated with various circular escape vent sizes (2. 382 ̆ 2, 2. 752 ̆ 2, 3. 102 ̆ 2, and 3. 402 ̆ 2 as the diameter). Our main interest is to find out the ideal vent size which gives the best legal size <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> catch count and minimizes the sublegal size catch count. ^ The Poisson regression model is the most widely used methodology to analyze count data. Different Poisson models are used in the analysis of the <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> catch count. We start with the standard Poisson model, and continue with the regression for Poisson rates. In order to account for over-dispersion, a Poisson model with scaled deviance as well as a negative binomial regression model are discussed. Since the count data contain excess zero counts, a Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model is used. From the results of the last analysis, we can conclude that over-dispersion is not only induced by excess zero counts in the data, but also contributed by the right tail. ^ Because of the hierarchical structure in parts of the data, random components are introduced in the above mentioned models by assuming random intercepts. The mixed effect models are fitted to the <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> catch count data using Poisson, negative binomial, ZIP and Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) models. All mixed effect models are fitted using both parametric and Bayesian approaches to analysis. After comparison of the performance of all models, the ZINB model is recognized as the best fitting model as indicated by smallest Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and Negative Cross-validatory Log-likelihood (NLL) values when using a Bayesian approach. ^ Ninety-five percent credible intervals are computed for both legal and sublegal size <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass,</b> and we conclude that vent sizes of 2. 382 ̆ 2 and 2. 752 ̆ 2 have larger average counts of legal size <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> than pots with vent sizes of 3. 102 ̆ 2 or 3. 402 ̆ 2, after adjusting for important covariates; vent sizes of 2. 752 ̆ 2 have significantly less sublegal catch counts than vent sizes of 2. 382 ̆ 2 and 3. 102 ̆ 2, as well as having a tendency to hold less sublegal catch than 3. 402 ̆ 2. Therefore, we can conclude that a vent size of 2. 752 ̆ 2 is the ideal choice, since it maximizes the retention of legal size <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> {{and at the same time}} minimizes the retention of sublegal size <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> in the fishing pots. ...|$|R

The group of males released earlier in the tagging period used larger home ranges than the group of males released later in our study. In addition, mean activity levels and the probability of movement among acoustic stations varied among groups of fish in a complex manner that depended on sex. These differences in movement behaviors may increase the vulnerability of male fish to passive fishing gears, further exacerbating variation in exploitation rates for this species among reefs...|$|R

This study investigated oceanographic drivers of winter habitat choice and regional differences between populations of juvenile and adult <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass.</b> Trends in cohort strength, as a result of juvenile survival, were also identified. Oceanographic and fisheries survey data were analyzed using generalized additive models. Among the oceanographic variables investigated, salinity was the main driver in habitat selection with an optimal range of 33 - 35 practical salinity units (PSU) for both juveniles and adults. Preferred temperature ranges varied between juveniles and adults, but held a similar minimum preference of > 8 °C. Salinity and temperature ranges also differed by regions north and south of Hudson Canyon. Shelf water volume had less of an effect than temperature or salinity, but showed an overall negative relationship with survey catch. The effect of winter conditions on juvenile abundance was also observed across state and federal survey index trends. A lack of correlation observed among surveys in the fall paired with a strong correlation in the spring identifies the winter period as a factor determining year-class strength of new recruits to the population. A rank order analysis of spring indices identified three of the largest year classes occurring during years with reduced shelf water volumes, warmer winter shelf waters, and a 34 PSU isohaline aligned farther inshore.
