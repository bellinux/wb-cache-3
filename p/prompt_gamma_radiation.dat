This information {{can be obtained by}} means of remote sensing gamma-ray spectroscopy, as planned for a number of future space missions, i. e., Mars, Moon, asteroids, and comets. To investigate the gamma-rays made by interactions of neutrons with matter, thin targets of different composition were placed between a neutron-source and a high-resolution germanium spectrometer. Gamma-rays in the range of 0. 1 to 8 MeV were accumulated. In one set of experiments a 14 -MeV neutron generator using the T(d,n) reaction as neutron-source was placed in a small room.

Furthermore assuming that the Boron isotopes are absorbed in cancer cells, the three alpha-particles produced in each p- 11 B aneutronic nuclear fusion reactions can potentially result in the enhancement of the biological dose absorbed in the tumor region since these multi-MeV alpha-particles are stopped inside the single cancer cell, thus allowing to spare the surrounding tissues. Although a similar approach based {{on the use of}} 11 B nuclei has been proposed in [1], our work demonstrate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the crucial importance of the use of 10 B nuclei (in a solution containing also 11 B) for the generation of prompt gamma-rays, which can be applied to medical imaging.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Protons {{entering}} matter have {{a finite}} range while photons have a gradual, exponential attenuation as they travel through material. Proton radiation therapy {{takes advantage of}} this difference, by aligning the cancerous tissue {{with the end of}} the proton range where it deposits the maximum amount of energy, resulting in significant tissue sparing compared to traditional photon therapy. These properties of protons also require a more precise delivery of the radiation since a small uncertainty in the positioning of the proton beam could result in the over- or under-dosing of critical structures. This highlights the importance of an in-vivo dose measurement technique. Due to the nature of protons, there are no primary particles exiting the patient to be used for verification purposes. One option is to use secondary radiation for dose verification purposes, like prompt gammas produced by proton-nuclei inelastic collisions. The primary aim of this work was to report on the detection of prompt gammas and their specific characteristics when produced by the important elements of tissue, like oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. A number of different targets containing these elements such as water, Perspex, graphite and liquid nitrogen were irradiated in a passive-scatter proton therapy treatment facility and the gammas were detected by a high resolution 2 ' x 2 " LaBr 3 detector. The measurements were carried out at iThernba LABS in Somerset West, South Africa using the proton therapy beamline. In order to determine the shielding required to sufficiently block the secondary neutrons and scattered gamma-rays emitted from the beam line elements, a significant problem in a passive-scatter proton beam, preliminary Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The energy spectra of the prompt gammas produced in the various targets was measured, looking specifically at the discrete elemental prompt gamma peaks at 4. 44 MeV from Â¹Â²C and 6. 13 MeV from Â¹&# 8310; 0. Measurements were also performed to investigate prompt gamma emission as a function of depth along the beam path. The depth measurements were carried out for water and Perspex phantoms at several detector positions surrounding the depth location of the Bragg peak in each material. The discrete prompt gamma-ray measurements reveal that in-vivo range verification is feasible for clinical passive-scatter proton irradiations. The secondary aspect of this work was to develop a Monte Carlo model of the entire experimental measurement set-up including the entire iThemba LABS passive-scatter proton beam line.

40|$|In cancer oncology, {{using of}} Mega {{electron}} Volt (MeV) bremsstrahlung photons has been clinically practised on cancer patients since photons can deliver a significant dose to tumour volumes when projected {{into the body}} in several beam directions as in techniques such as Intensity Modulated Radio Therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). However, photons in a single beam deposit their maximum energy just a few millimetres at the beam's body entrance and a decreasing dose deposition beyond the tumour site. Cancer research and clinical practice have resorted to use of charged particles like protons and carbon ion beams for cancer therapy since they deposit a large fraction of their energy at their extreme range in a Bragg peak with very less dose deposition after the Bragg peak targeted to the tumour. This ensures maximum dose to tumour for therapy and spares organs at risk in both forward and behind the clinical target volume. The intention {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the feasibility of prompt gamma imaging for the on- line verification of the Bragg peak position. In order to achieve this aim, interactions of 160 MeV proton and 300 MeV/u carbon ion pencil beams within a soft tissue phantom were simulated. Monte Carlo simulations based on FLUKA, have been performed to analyse <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> produced as a result of inelastic nuclear interactions during both proton and carbon ion therapy procedures. These simulations were performed with a main view of designing a prompt gamma imaging device utilizing Compton scatter events and photoelectric effect processes of gamma radiation for real time control of incident beam during hadron therapy. Such a gamma detector system is called a Compton camera which has potential to utilize high energy photons emitted out of patients during hadron therapy which has long been a constraint in Anger cameras as they are only capable to image low energy photons of about 140 keV in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). In this project, two chief objectives were to be achieved and these were: first, to present the physical and interaction characteristics of both primary beam and secondary radiation like protons, neutrons and more so prompt gammas by their angular distribution after their production and photon energy spectrum as a result of de-excitation of the different atomic nuclei of human soft tissue. The fine energy loss and inelastic nuclear interactions with tissue nuclei for both 160 MeV proton beam and 300 MeV/u carbon ion beams as they traverse through human soft tissue have also been included in these studies. The second objective which was divided into two sub-tasks was; to simulate the imaging performance of first, a High Purity Germanium (HPGE) Compton Camera and second, a single scattering Compton camera made up of a sub-detector system of silicon to act as a photon scattering detector and a germanium absorber detector. Primary beam range and photon source distribution were investigated using an iterative algorithm for reconstruction of cones using Compton scatter angle and energy deposition at Compton scattering and photoelectric effect positions in each Compton camera since reconstructed cones carried position and directional information of emitted <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation.</b> Results from the first task of this project showed that prompt gammas from soft tissue nuclei de-excitation were emitted isotropically in all directions for both proton and carbon ion simulations of 1 x 10 ^ 7 primaries with distinct peaks at 2. 3 MeV, 3. 6 MeV, 4. 4 MeV, 5. 3 MeV and 6. 2 MeV which corresponded to 14 ^N, 20 ^Ca, 12 ^C, 14 ^N and 16 ^O atomic nuclei de-excitation photon energies respectively. For a HPGE Compton camera of dimensions 32 cmx 8 cmx 32 cm placed 8 cm to the top of the soft tissue phantom at orthogonal angle to the incident primary beam, data acquisition was done using gammas first Compton scattered within the detector and secondary photo-absorbed in the same germanium crystal. Only two successive interaction events were considered with a major assumption that the scattered quantum photon was completely absorbed at its second and last interaction in the germanium crystal. The number of secondary radiation that reached the detector included neutrons, electrons, positrons, protons and photons. Photons were Compton scattered in the angular range from 0 to 180 with low energetic photons scattered in angles greater than 90. The energy spectrum of photons before Compton scattering showed an energy range from 0. 1 MeV to 1. 6 MeV with a sharp peak at 0. 2 MeV in the 160 MeV proton beam simulation. This peak was shifted to 0. 18 MeV in the 300 MeV/u carbon ion simulation and both simulations exhibited a 0. 511 MeV photon peak. The angular resolution of the detector measured by angular resolution measure showed that ARM values of less than 3 mm would give better photon source predictions with a clear distinct primary beam range at 16 cm depth into human soft tissue using the germanium block Compton camera while as when using the single scattering Compton camera, the ARM values less than 6 mm accurately predicted the prompt gamma production distribution in the soft tissue phantom. Comparing the HPGe Compton camera with single scattering Compton camera in terms of photon energy range optimization for Compton cone reconstruction, the single scattering Compton camera proved to be better than the HPGe detector since it utilized photons from 0. 03 MeV to 3 MeV for Compton cone reconstruction and yet the HPGe Compton camera only used a short energy from 0. 1 MeV to 1. 6 MeV. But single scattering Compton camera reconstruction results were affected by Doppler broadening as photons of energies less than 0. 1 MeV were inclusive in the energy spectrum. The single scattering Compton camera was further found to have a better overall efficiency of 0. 07 % over that of HPGe Compton camera which was 0. 032 %. For both Compton cameras, the reconstruction source distribution tracked the original photon production distribution at the distal fall off by a precision of 0. 1 mm...|$|E

The detection probability of the <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> is reduced {{by the fact that}} {{only a small fraction of}} the 0.777 -MeV Î³s falls into the energy window (typically, the upper threshold is between 550 and 650 Â keV) and another fraction enters the window only after scattering in the tissue. In any case, a <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> correction is absolutely necessary for 82 Rb.|$|R
30|$|A second {{approach}} {{is based on}} the observation that, for 82 Rb, the <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> background has a similar radial distribution as the randoms [41]. The authors proposed a method that uses the scaled random estimate, added to the single scatter conventional estimate, to match the tails of the prompt sinogram. The random scaling factor, obtained by fitting the tails, includes the <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> contribution. This approach to <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> correction was also used on 124 I data, where the 124 I image quality after PGC was comparable to that shown in a similar experiment with 18 F [42].|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive assay {{methods that}} rely on {{measurement}} of correlated gamma rays from fission have been proposed {{as a means to}} determine the mass of fissile materials. Sensitivity studies for such measurements will require knowledge of the multiplicity of <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> rays from fission; however, a very limited number of multiplicity distributions have been measured. A method is proposed to estimate the average number of gamma rays from any fission process by using the correlation of neutron and gamma emission in fission. Using this method, models for the total <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> ray energy from fission adequately reproduce the measured value for thermal neutron induced fission of {sup 233 }U. Likewise, the average energy of <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> rays from fission has been adequately estimated using a simple linear model. Additionally, a method to estimate the multiplicity distribution of <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> rays from fission is proposed based on a measured distribution for {sup 252 }Cf. These methods are only approximate at best and should only be used for sensitivity studies. Measurements of the multiplicity distribution of <b>prompt</b> <b>gamma</b> rays from fission should be performed to determine the adequacy of the models proposed in this article...|$|R
