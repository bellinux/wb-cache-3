We propose an {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> for our new first-order inductive theorem prover QuodLibet that is characterized by a great deal of flexibility w. r. t. the forms of <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> the prover supports. The approach is based on so-called (proof) tactics, i. e. <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> routines written in a special <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> language named QML. QuodLibet provides a set of tactics (in addition to the elementary inference rules), which range from tactics for trivial simplification steps to tactics representing comprehensive inductive proof strategies. Moreover, QuodLibet allows new tactics that are written by the user in QML to be integrated into the system to dynamically extend its functionality. 1 Introduction Because of several case studies on the practice of inductive theorem proving in the literature (see e. g. [2], [9], [14]), but also because of our own experience of (automated) inductive theorem provers, such as Nqthm, Inka, RRL, Unicom, Spike etc. 1, we have come to adopt a rather pragmatic view of inductive theorem proving: The successful use of an inductive theorem prover in "real-life " problem domains has not yet been possible without a knowledgeable human user who can interact with the system on various levels. This view has mainly determined the concept of <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> which we developed for our new first-order inductive theorem prover named QuodLibet, and which {{is the subject of this}} paper. According to our characterization, the <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> of an inductive theorem prover lays down how, speaking in general terms, the construction (or search) of proofs by the prover and/or the user is organized. We distinguish two basic forms of <b>proof</b> <b>control,</b> namely user-guided or interactive <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> on the one hand and programmed or automated <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> on the other hand. Various inductive theorem provers, however, have hybrid forms of <b>proof</b> <b>control.</b> For instance, the Boyer-Moore prover Nqthm is an inductive theorem prover with a complex and elaborate proof procedure forming its essentially automated <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> (see [2]), but there are a few parameters allowing the user to "globally " influence the way the prover searches for proofs [...] to a limited extent though. ...|$|E

40|$|Background. Reasons of {{ineffective}} {{treatment of}} obesity {{in many cases}} are found not enough out. It is known also, {{that the use of}} numerous methods for body weight reducing arrive at the satisfactory stable results of treatment less than in 20 % cases. It grounds the necessity of further researches for the study of factors that influence on forming of obesity, the correction of that would result in <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> after body weight. Objective of the study — to estimate influence of decline of body weight on metabolic parameters and secretory activity of fatty tissue in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with obesity. Materials and Methods. Under a supervision there were 57 patients. The patients of the first group (n = 38) received diet therapy and metformin. Patients of the second group (n = 19), additionally to the diet therapy and metformin, received orlistat (Xenical) in a dose on one capsule (120 mg) 2 – 3 times daily. Before and 6 months after treatment we conducted the anthropometric measuring, estimated the blood lipid spectrum, carbohydrate exchange, and also content of immunoreactive insulin, leptin, index of insulin resistance HOMA-IR. Results. In the most examined persons (84. 2 %) there was hyperinsulinemia that testifies to insulin resistance (index of ­НОМА-IR increased in all patients). Level of immunoreactive insulin is closely associated with the indexes of atherogenic profile of plasma. Hyperleptinemia was detected in 98. 2 % patients. Application of orlistat resulted in the decline of index of insulin resistance on 43 % from baseline, while in patients of the first group (diet therapy and metformin) this index on the average on a group rose on 2 %. Conclusions. On a background the additional administration of orlistat to the standard treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (diet therapy and metformin) we obtained weight loss on 4. 67 % (that averages 5. 17 ± 0. 59 kg). Administration of orlistat is accompanied by reduction of leptin level on 6. 8 %, immunoreactive insulin on 39  %, index of HOMA-IR on 43 % from initial values. On a background the improvement of diabetes mellitus compensation we observed the reduction of daily dose of metformin (in 16 % patients) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND When a {{customer}} delivers a colour proof to a printer, {{they expect the}} final print to look similar to that proof. Today {{it is impossible to}} control if a match between proof and print is technically possible to reach at all. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} no information regarding the production circumstances of the proof is provided, for instance the printer does not know which proofer, RIP or ICC-profile that was used. Situations where similarity between proof and print cannot be reached and the press has to be stopped are both costly and time consuming and are therefore wished to be avoided. PURPOSE The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the possibility to form a method with the ability control if a proof is of such good quality that it is likely to produce a print that is similar to it. METHOD The basic assumption was that the quality of a proof could be decided by spectrally measuring known colour patches and compare those values to reference values representing the same patches printed at optimal press conditions. To decide which and how many patches that are required, literature and reports were studied, then a test printing and a comparison between proofing systems were performed. To be able to analyse the measurement data in an effective way a tool that analyses the difference between reference and measurement data was developed using MATLAB. RESULT The result was a suggestion for a colour proof quality verification method that consists two parts that are supposed to complement each other. The first one was called Colour proofing system evaluation and is supposed to evaluate entire proofing systems. It consists of a test page containing colour patches, grey balance fields, gradations and photographs. The second part is called Colour <b>proof</b> <b>control</b> and consists of a smaller set of colour patches that is supposed to be attached to each proof. CONCLUSIONS The method is not complete since more research regarding the difference between measurement results and visual impression is needed. To be able to obtain realistic tolerance levels for differences between measurement- and reference data, the method must be tested in every-day production. If this is done the method is thought to provide a good way of controlling the quality of colour proofs...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{computational}} complexity of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression under sparsity constraints. We first {{show that a}} Bayesian approach can achieve variable-selection consistency under relatively mild conditions on the design matrix. We then demonstrate that the statistical criterion of posterior concentration need not imply the computational desideratum of rapid mixing of the MCMC algorithm. By introducing a truncated sparsity prior for variable selection, we provide a set of conditions that guarantee both variable-selection consistency and rapid mixing of a particular Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The mixing time is linear {{in the number of}} covariates up to a logarithmic factor. Our <b>proof</b> <b>controls</b> the spectral gap of the Markov chain by constructing a canonical path ensemble that is inspired by the steps taken by greedy algorithms for variable selection.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} driving a system from some initial configuration to a desired configuration while avoiding some unsafe configurations. The system to be controlled is a dynamical system that can operate in different modes. The goal is to synthesize the logic for switching between the modes so that the desired reachability property holds. In this paper, we first present a sound and complete inference rule for proving reachability properties of single mode continuous dynamical systems. Next, we present an inference rule for proving controlled reachability in multi-modal continuous dynamical systems. From a constructive <b>proof</b> of <b>controlled</b> reachability, we show how to synthesize the desired switching logic. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound and produces only non-zeno hybrid systems. In practice, we perform a constructive <b>proof</b> of <b>controlled</b> reachability by solving an Exists-Forall formula {{in the theory of}} reals. We present an approach for solving such formulas that combines symbolic and numeric solvers. We demonstrate our approach on some examples. All results extend naturally to the case when, instead of reachability, interest is in until properties...|$|R

40|$|Off-press {{proofing}} is {{a method}} of simulating the way a set of separation negatives or positives will look when printed {{without having to go}} to the printing press. In 1965, The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) developed a <b>proofing</b> <b>control</b> device for production Lithography. The Standard Offset Color Control Bar was also utilized for off-press proofing. In 1983, The Graphic Communications Association, in cooperation with GATF, introduced The Off-Press <b>Proof</b> Comparator. This <b>control</b> device was designed specifically for this technology and intended to be used by both technical and non-technical personnel with equal and successful results. This thesis is concerned with the accuracy of both proofing bars using the Du Pont Cromalin system of off -press proofing to determine whether one control bar is better for judging whether a proof is made correctly to SWOP standards. It is also concerned with whether one control bar is more versatile than the other for both technical or non-technical personnel to use. The experiment consisted of a total sample population of forty experts from four different fields of the graphic arts industry. These four groups represent technical and non-technical users. Each participant was asked to look at samples of each color bar and choose which sample was made to SWOP standards. The results were applied to statistical methods of evaluation to give a final result. The final results of this thesis support The Graphic Communications Association 2 ̆ 7 s claim that the Off-Press Proof Comparator in not only more accurate, but also more versatile for all members of the graphic arts community. The implications of this thesis are that a 2 ̆ 2 master 2 ̆ 2 comparative device can aid in evaluating if proofs are made correctly- A pictorial element is a helpful reference tool when used in conjunction with the 2 ̆ 2 master 2 ̆ 2 comparative device.
