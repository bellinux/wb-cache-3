40|$|A {{luminescent}} <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> is {{a relatively}} new technique to measure full-field surface strain and determine principal strain directions that has many potential applications in engineering. Generally, luminescent <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> technology uses an in situ strain gage measurement to calibrate the detected optical response to maximum shear strain. This calibration requires the determination of two coating parameters: the polarization efficiency and the coating characteristic. A better understanding and modeling of these two parameters, particularly the polarization efficiency, will enable a simpler a priori calibration and greater measurement accuracy. This paper presents a factorial design experiment that assesses the effect of four factors on the optical strain response of an luminescent <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating.</b> The factors examined were substrate reflectance, luminescent dye concentration, absorption dye concentration and cure time. Results show the polarization efficiency is strongly correlated with the emission anisotropy of the coating. When the polarization efficiency is modeled as the measured emission anisotropy, the two most significant factors are the substrate reflectance and the luminescent dye concentration. Absorption dye concentration and reflectance-luminescence interaction are minor but significant effects. The most significant tested factors in modeling the coating coefficient are absorption dye concentration and substrate reflectance. The resulting uncertainties for the polarization efficiency and coating characteristic are 1. 3 and 3. 7 %, respectively. Nomenclatur...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{measuring}} the mechanical forces exerted by cells on the substratum and through the substratum to act on other cells is described. This method depends upon the growth of cells on a <b>photoelastic</b> substratum, polydimethylsiloxane <b>coated</b> with a near monolayer of fibronectin. Changes in the forces applied by the cells to the substratum lead to changes in birefringence, which can be measured and recorded by the Polscope computer-controlled polarizing microscope. The changes in azimuth and retardance can be measured. A method for calibrating the stress is described. The method is sensitive down to forces of 1 pN per square microns. Fairly rapid changes with time can be recorded with a time resolution of ∼ 1 s. The observations show that both isolated adhering, spread cells and also cells close to contact exert stresses on the substratum and that the stresses are those that would be produced by forces of 10 – 1000 pN per cell. The forces are almost certainly exerted on nearby cells since movement of one cell causes strains to appear around other nearby cells. The method has the defect that strains under the cells, though detectable in principle, are unclear due to birefringence {{of the components of}} the cytoplasm and nucleus. It is of special interest that the strains on the substratum can change in the time course of a few seconds and appear to be concentrated near the base of the lamellopodium of the cell as though they originated there. As well as exerting forces on the substratum {{in the direction of the}} long axis of the cell, appreciable forces are exerted from the lateral sides of the cell. The observations and measurements tend to argue that microtopography and embedded beads can concentrate the forces. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic {{debonding}} {{rates were}} measured during constant-amplitude loading of specimens made of graphite/epoxy bonded to aluminum and S-glass/epoxy bonded to aluminum. Both room-temperature and elevated-temperature curing adhesives were used. Debonding was monitored with a <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> technique. The debonding rates {{were compared with}} three expressions for strain-energy release rate calculated {{in terms of the}} maximum stress, stress range, or a combination of the two. The debonding rates were influenced by both adherent thickness and the cyclic stress ratio. For a given value of maximum stress, lower stress ratios and thicker specimens produced faster debonding. Microscopic examination of the debonded surfaces showed different failure mechanisms both for identical adherends bonded with different adhesive and, indeed, even for different adherends bonded with identical adhesives. The expressions for strain-energy release rate correlated the data for different specimen thicknesses and stress ratios quite well for each material system, but the form of the best correlating expression varied among material systems. Empirical correlating expressions applicable to one material system may not be appropriate for another system...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of strain analized by <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> method in aluminum {{has been reported}} in the previous papers. On the basis of those experimental results, the authors investigate the influence of repeated cutting on strain distribution in the workpiece. Here the repeated cutting means to cut the workpiece of hardened aluminum by the process of primary machining in the same direction. In the primary machining process an annealed aluminum is machined using cutting tool or vurnishing tool. The present experiment gives the following results. (1) Repeated cutting, wihtin the cutting depth of the primary process, shows. (1 - 1) Shearing angle is particularly larger than primary cutting and the fact is available for machinablility. (1 - 2) Cutting force is apparently larger than primary cutting. (1 - 3) The difference of strain distribution between repeated cutting and primary one is very small. (2) The larger the primary cutting speed is, the smaller the value of the effective depth as above.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}}, {{also called}} “frozenin” stresses in highdensity polyethylene (HDPE) pipes, result from uneven cooling that occurs between {{the inner and}} outer surfaces during the extrusion process in manufacture. Most known methods of measurements involve intrusive testing to determine the magnitude and profile of the residual stresses in the pipe wall thickness. The <b>Photoelastic</b> <b>Coating</b> Technique (Photostress Method TM) described in this paper involves capturing the locked in stresses with minimal interference and local disturbance as the residual stress is released. The existing methods used intrusive testing to determine the residual stress profile whereas the test recommended to WIS 43203 gives a single residual stress value at the bore. The Photostress Method permits stress measurements to be made directly at different points in the pipe wall and a welldefined residual stress profile was consequently obtained. An idealised equation for the residual stress profile was found it was postulated that the residual stress profile in the pipe wall can be determined once the residual stress at the pipe bore was obtained using either the WIS method or the Photostress Method...|$|E

Advancing the understanding of the mechanical response of materials to impact loading relies heavily on having suitable high-speed diagnostics.

40|$|Strains at twenty-one {{selected}} {{points in}} the critical lower weld region of a aft skirt of a solid rocket booster of the shuttle were measured using photoelastic coatings and stress separator gages. Data were taken at loads of 5, 14, 20, 28, 42, 56, and 70 percent of the design limit load. Results indicate that general yielding occurred in the weld metal and for a short distance outside the fusion boundaries {{on either side of}} the weld metal. The fusion boundaries did not yield at the 70 percent load. Slight non-linearity in the load strain curves were observed at several points above the 20 percent load level. Maximum measured strains occurred at {{points in the}} forged metal of the holddown post along a line 0. 50 inches from the centerline of the weld. Maximum shearing strains within the area covered by the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> occurred at points approximately 0. 33 inches to the right of the weld centerline near points 6 and 7 and lying along a yellow vertical line extending from just below point 6 to point 11.

40|$|Differences in the {{cross-sectional}} {{shapes of}} intramedullary stems {{are expected to}} affect the strains in the femur, a close proximal fit being proposed as particularly advantageous. We compared uncemented femoral stems of different designs, {{as well as a}} cemented stem, using the intact femur as a control. The collarless stems were custom-made, standard asymmetric, symmetric (i. e., neutral), and cemented symmetric. These different types of stem were inserted in sequence into eight cadaver femurs. A <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> technique was used to give a measure of the shear strains over the bone surface. The mean reductions of maximum shear strains in the upper 30 mm of the proximal-medial regions for the custom, asymmetric, symmetric, and cemented stems were 11, 24, 6, and 75 %, respectively. The strains for the symmetric stem were concentrated in the proximal-medial region just below the neck resection line and then decreased rapidly below that level. For the asymmetric stems, the relative strains in the proximal-anterior and proximal-medial regions were dependent on the tightness of fit in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. The custom stems consistently produced a pattern of strain distribution that, overall, was closer to normal than that of the other stems; extremes at the anterior and medial regions were avoided. The strains down the entire medial side of the cemented stem were significantly less than for the intact femur or for the uncemented stems...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the strain}} {{distribution}} in a dent {{is crucial in}} assessing the severity of damage to pipes. Accordingly this paper {{presents the results of}} a series of tests to measure strains and displacements in previously dented aluminium pipes subject to increasing internal pressure. Indentation of unpressurized and pressurized pipes was caused by a rigid sphere and resulted in short smooth dents of depths up to 16 per cent of pipe diameter. Strain changes on the external pipe surface were monitored by strain gauges and a <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating.</b> The results identify two stationary crescent-shaped regions of high external strain at the axial extremities of the initial dent, where strain concentration factors of 10 were recorded in the early (elastic) stages of pressurization, increasing to a maximum of 28 in one particular dent. The results have immediate application to the assessment of a gouge within a dent, which has long been recognized as the most severe form of mechanical damage to pipelines and can result in failures at very low internal pressures. A parallel series of burst tests by the authors revealed that gouges located near the axial extremities of the initial dent may cause premature failure. The strain concentration results presented here help to explain this behaviour, and indicate the size, shape and location of the regions of high external strain...|$|E

The principle {{aim of the research}} was to increase the understanding of the state of stress experienced by an ice-axe in normal use. A climber's overarm swing technique, as employed in technical 'ice-climbing', was studied using a high speed video system. A typical swing was found to have an impact velocity of 90 ms- 1 at a pick impact of 20 ° to the normal. A test rig was constructed to replicate the dynamic loading of a selection of 'technical axe' heads. A 2 mm thick <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> was bonded to each of the pick faces and impact events recorded using a reflection polariscope and a high speed video running at 2000 frames per second. The observed fringe patterns were used to make a qualitative comparison between picks with different tooth designs - saw-toothed, 6 mm and 45 mm semi-circular toothed and plain picks. It was found that the loading was predominantly in-plane bending in-plane bending. Improvements in strength performance could most effectively be achieved by widening and not thickening of the pick. However, the loading is unlikely to be that in which might be a combination of out of plane bending and torsion. It was concluded, therefore, that a study needs to be carried out to look at the loading regime in realistic conditions...|$|E

The distribution of stress and strain through the depth of glass fibre reinforced composite beams were investigated using three experimental techniques, namely: interlaminar strain gauging, <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating,</b> and thermal emission (SPATE). Experimental results indicated that the beam geometry and type of flexural loading influenced the through thickness strains. Comparisons between experimental results and theoretical predictions from classical lamination theory, higher order displacement theory, and finite element analysis were conducted and discussed. The influence of the material quality (voidage) of bi-directional stitched glass fibre reinforced composite beam on beam performance was studied. It became apparent from the tests, that the void content plays a significant part in the strength and the mechanisms leading to failure, especially in shear mode. The influence played by changing the dimensions of uni-directional carbon fibre reinforced composite beams on strength and mode of failure was also investigated. It was shown that, the beam geometry (size) effects both its strength and mode of failure. The gross material failure and the onset of beam failure was predicted using approaches based on both macro mechanical and micro mechanical criteria. These criteria were developed either from experimental observation or extensions of existing failure criteria...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} {{on the development of}} an analytical framework for evaluating the effects of prior exfoliation corrosion on the residual strength and remaining life of wing skins. A number of pristine and corroded specimens are cut from naturally exfoliated wing panels fabricated from 7075 -T 6511 alloys, and an ultrasonic nondestructive inspection (NDI) is carried out on the exfoliated specimens. The maximum depth and three-dimensional (3 D) profile of the exfoliation damage are determined from the NDI data analysis. These specimens are tested using static tension and compression loading and the strain distributions on the specimens are measured using strain gauges, and <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> techniques. An analytical model is developed based on a "soft inclusion" technique, which is used to simulate the exfoliation damage. Using the PATRAN Command Language, automatic geometry and finite element (FE) model generation techniques are developed to create the "soft inclusion" for any shape and depth of exfoliation including the detailed 3 D profile determined by NDI data analysis. The 3 D FE model is first verified with the pristine specimen test results. FE analyses are then carried out on the exfoliated specimens and compared with the tests results. The good agreements between the modeling and testing results indicate that the analytical models are capable of evaluating the effects of exfoliation on the residual strength.

The remodeling {{is likely to be}} associated with stress and strain distribution. This study compared the strain patterns, particularly the maximum principal strains, between cemented and press-fit components in five cadaveric femurs by using a <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating</b> technique. The specimens were loaded with 2, 000 N in the sequences of intact femur and press-fit and cemented stems. On the medial side of the bone for proximal femoral replacements, the strain values for the press-fit stems on the proximal, middle, and distal regions were 73 +/- 11 %, 78 +/- 15 %, and 80 +/- 15 % of normal, respectively, but for the cemented stems they were 53 +/- 15 %, 57 +/- 19 %, and 60 +/- 20 %. The differences were statistically significant (p less than 0. 05). On the lateral side, the overall strain values for the press-fit stem were higher than those for the cemented stem, but the differences were not statistically significant (p greater than 0. 05). On the medial side of the distal femoral replacement, the strain values for the press-fit stems in the proximal and middle regions were significantly closer to normal than for the cemented stems. Because the press-fit femoral stems (both the proximal and distal replacement) transferred closer to normal strains than the cemented stems, less adverse bone remodeling may be expected, which could be reflected in increased longevity...|$|E

Available optical techniques are reviewed and a specific case developed {{for the use of}} Photoelastic stress analysis (PSA). As a result of this research two novel developments in PSA are presented, including an industrially robust coating material technology and methods for high-speed acquisition of transient stress fields. These developments extend the potential applications of PSA and simplify the procedures involved. A novel birefringent electrolytic coating is presented and calibrated to demonstrate its potential as a practical <b>photoelastic</b> <b>coating.</b> The 20 m thickness coating is characterised and shown to behave linearly with strain. The coating also shows potential for application in plastic and non-linear photoelastic measurements. Several types of anodising and sealing treatments are compared, focusing on their relative sensitivity. The strain-optical coefficient (K) is derived for four thicknesses of decorative sulphuric acid anodising allowing qualitative and quantitative data to be extracted. Two time-resolved photoelastic techniques capable of measuring high(kHz) and low(Hz) frequency transient stress fields are described and demonstrated. Both techniques are based on a concept of a `Multiple View Polariscope', where the phase steps are captured simultaneously from multiple views. The configurations include a planar multi-camera method and a single camera with a modified `Quadrant' lens. As part of a collaborative study, compressor blade geometries were generated based on an existing Rolls-Royce component. The potential of the high-speed Multiple View Polariscope is demonstrated by the application to the compressor blades, which are subjected to a dynamic impact load to simulate domestic object damage. The resulting quantitative time-resolved stress fields allowed the performance of each blade to be compared against the original component. This investigation has shown the potential for general robust optical tools for industrial quantitative applications of residual, static and dynamic stress measurement. ...|$|E
