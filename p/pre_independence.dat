40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{conducting}} {{this research was}} to make accessible {{a detailed analysis of}} women’s involvement, roles, contributions in the national liberation movement in Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands. Such a study was necessary because of the scanty nature of the information available on this particular subject matter. In order to adequately assess the women’s engagement in the liberation movement - the African Party for the Independence of Guinea—Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC), it was of equal significance to focus on their impact in the national culture, the economy, and the political structure. Additionally, a comparison was made between <b>pre</b> and post <b>independence</b> periods in relation to women’s specific gains in education, agriculture, employment, culture, etc. In Chapter 5 the analysis relates to women’s involvement in the transformation process, and the researcher emphasizes the consciousness-raising factors.

Having suffered much neglect and accorded low priority by governments in the <b>pre</b> and post <b>independence</b> era in Nigeria, the developmental potentials of the discipline was unexplored and it remained marginalized in the curricula of most tertiary institutions. The functional nature of Africans traditional system of education which has inbuilt adult education learning strategies equipped people with knowledge and skills that enabled them live and cope with challenges within their environment. As society became more complex with its increasing socio-economic problems that are currently ravaging most developing nations, more emphasis is still placed on formal system of education with little attention on non-formal education and particularly adult {{education as}} a discipline.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{argue for}} a move from the preoccupation with the obvious (crude and {{quantifiable}} impacts), towards critically examining the subtle (less than obvious impacts), which {{will allow us to}} deal with adversities (the likes of HIV and AIDS) in the most effective ways. The thesis adopts the summative governance framework to demonstrate how our preoccupation with the quantifiable impacts shrouds our intellectual and practical ability to deal with the subtle impacts of AIDS. Governance is hypothesised to emerge amidst turbulent, unpredictable, messy, complex and dynamic path conditions predicated upon certain orders of criticality, including but not limited to the process of knowledge formation, retention and transfer. The thesis suggests that the evolution of governance from nascent to fully institutionalised mechanisms of control is in itself a product of the evolution of knowledge. Notwithstanding, HIV and AIDS constrain the emergence of governance through impacting the process of knowledge formation, retention and transfer. Resultantly, these impacts are not merely additive and isolated to the sectoral governances, but are summative, intergenerational and structured, and potentially endanger the fundamental systems of governance. The <b>pre</b> and post <b>independence</b> induced vulnerabilities of Namibia are presented to demonstrate that the country is an engrossing, but yet a perilous mix of the past and the present. Whilst Namibia aspires for a democratic, non-racial, progressive society, the thesis demonstrates that due to constraints engendered by HIV and AIDS this proceeds on terms and conditions that by no means guarantee a happy outcome...|$|R
