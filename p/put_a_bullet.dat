500|$|In the children's {{literature}} journal The ALAN Review {{published by}} The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents, Edgar H. Thompson, Connie B. Blevins, and Allison Fitzgerald argued that protagonist Marty [...] "consistently behaves" [...] at levels 5 and 6 of Kohlberg's stages of development. For instance, on his walk to Judd's house, he wonders: [...] "Easy as pie for Judd Travers to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> {{hole in my}} head, say he didn't see me." [...] Despite his fears, Marty continues walking to Judd's house, persistent on protecting Shiloh despite potential bodily harm and even death to himself. The authors brooded over whether an 11 year old could attain such an elevated level despite most adults' never {{being able to do}} so. Ultimately noting that the Newbery Committee and thousands of readers consider Marty to be realistic, they concluded that Marty is a positive role model for children to strive to be.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that {{the strength of the}} Dubois Brothers was built from the trust that they had between them, they were said to have made a gang of perfect cohesion in their neighbourhood who few would compete against. They were built their criminal organization and power on intimidation and violence; they reigned like crime lords over illegitimate and legitimate businesses in their controlled territories. The Quebec Police Commission gave them a great compliment when they stated in 1977 in their report: [...] "Some maintain that the ruthless methods of the Dubois, the large number of toughs gravitating about each of the nine brothers, as well as the widely dreaded cruelty of their hirelings, make them the most influential criminal group at the present time on the island of Montreal." [...] The network that the Dubois Brothers organized was made up of about two hundred men loosely organized into independent gangs of several dozen members with the brothers at the centre of this organization. Even the Dubois Brother’s number one hitman, Donald Lavoie, was scared of the brothers because he claimed that they were too powerful and he believed that one day Claude Dubois would <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> through his head. The Dubois Brothers were not considered ones to hold back, they acted when to the degree they thought was necessary regardless of the cost which was reaffirmed the cruelty they demonstrated to their victims and foes that in turn shaped their reputation. Instances such as when a restaurant owner stood up to the Brothers insisting that they needed to pay for their food which resulted in him being beat up and a knife taken to his chest in order to carve a cross in it. Events such as this one left people fearful of the Dubois Brothers and reinforced their supremacy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1893, after {{receiving}} a letter from Cosima Wagner telling {{him that he had}} to read Gobineau's Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request. Chamberlain accepted Gobineau's belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau's philosophy was [...] "the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> through our heads". Chamberlain's time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909 when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best thing that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the Völkerchaos (chaos of the peoples). Vienna had a large Jewish population (until 1938, Vienna was about [...] 10% Jewish), and Chamberlain's time in Vienna marked the only time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested. In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "Unfortunately like everything else...it has fallen {{into the hands of the}} Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness". In 1895, he wrote: However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold to a Jew...it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it...Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do classes. In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was [...] "one of the most acute minds of the century" [...] and [...] "I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon." [...] At the same time, Chamberlain's marriage to Anna began to fall apart as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating. Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife's frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.|$|E
