5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, <b>power</b> <b>trowels,</b> and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|R
50|$|New floors {{require less}} work {{resulting}} in lower costs, {{but there are}} a few things to be aware of before a new concrete floor can be polished. Firstly the mix design of the concrete should be 3,500 psi or higher. The concrete should always be poured full depth to take advantage of the concretes full structural strength and to also help in preventing cracks. The concrete should always be professionally finished with <b>power</b> <b>trowels</b> and properly cured with water for 7 days. Polishing should not begin to the concrete is full cured (generally 28 days). The concrete slab can contain decorative aggregates to create many different aesthetically beautiful appearances. The concrete aggregate is typically the normal aggregates used in the region, but almost anything can be used. The finished surface of the concrete will need to be finished to a high standard to facilitate the polishing process. According to the Global Concrete Polishing Institute, a FF (floor flatness level) of 50 or greater is desired. During the finishing phase any decorative aggregates such as seashells, glass chips or even metal car parts can be dropped into the surface of the concrete. Builder needs to be aware as early as possible if the concrete is to be polished so that the final finish is of the best quality.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>power</b> <b>trowel</b> (also {{known as}} a [...] "power float", [...] "helicopter" [...] or [...] "trowel machine" [...] or [...] "whirlybird") {{is a piece of}} light {{construction}} equipment used by construction companies and contractors, to apply a smooth finish to concrete slabs.|$|E
50|$|In the US, {{screeding}} is {{the process}} a person called a concrete finisher performs by cutting off excess wet concrete to bring the top surface of a slab to the proper grade and smoothness. A power concrete screed has a gasoline motor attached which helps smooth and vibrate concrete as it is flattened. After the concrete is flattened it is smoothed with a concrete float or <b>power</b> <b>trowel.</b> A concrete floor is sometimes called a solid ground floor.|$|E
