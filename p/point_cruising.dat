5000|$|In the 2005 AFL Finals Series, Adelaide and Port Adelaide {{met in a}} semi-final, {{the first}} time, and thus far only time in their history they had played {{against each other in}} a finals game.

Tempers almost boiled over in the second quarter after Adelaide ruckman Rhett Biglands was stretchered from the ground after a Byron Pickett shirtfront. However Biglands would return in the second half. After half time, Adelaide thrashed Port Adelaide outscoring them by 76 <b>points</b> <b>cruising</b> home for an 83-point win, ending Port Adelaide's season.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a downtown parking model that integrates traffic congestion and saturated on-street parking. We {{assume that the}} stock of cars cruising for parking adds to traffic congestion. Two major results come out from the model, {{one of which is}} robust. The robust one is that, whether or not the amount of on-street parking is optimal, it is efficient to raise the on-street parking fee to the <b>point</b> where <b>cruising</b> for parking is eliminated without parking becoming unsaturated. The other is that, if the parking fee is fixed at a sub-optimal level, it is second-best optimal {{to increase the amount of}} curbside allocated to parking until cruising for parking is eliminated without parking becoming unsaturated. ...|$|R

In particular, it considers how the process-driven triangulation of thinking bodies, sexual subjectivities and emplacement within such a practice might enable us to acknowledge, consolidate and reimagine a community that had been either erased or marginalised in dominant accounts of its city. Heaven Is a Place is a short dance film, made in 2014 by the authors of this chapter in collaboration with members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) community in Plymouth in South West England. Filmed in some of Plymouth’s most visually spectacular, evocative and liminal waterside locations – its docksides, marinas, look-out <b>points,</b> <b>cruising</b> spots, clubs and bathing areas – it explores becoming, melan- choly and the erotics of place through the human geography of an ‘ocean city’. In addition to choreography arising from site-responsive physical vocabularies, the film features scenarios and movement scores that reflect personal memories and queer histories of the city, developed in the first instance through a series of movement workshops that were co-organised with the LGBT advocacy organisation, Pride in Plymouth...|$|R
