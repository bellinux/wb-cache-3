Politics is defined broadly as {{the perception of}} patterns of human relationships, incorporating socio-economic concepts. Two elements of socialisation are identified which inform both theory and research design. First, <b>political</b> <b>socialisation</b> content is explored, operationalised in terms of political attitudes. Second, <b>political</b> <b>socialisation</b> process is explored, operationalised in terms of history of political exploration {{and the making of}} political commitments (derived from concepts of adolescent identity development described by Erikson and Marcia). The role of socialising agents is discussed, the study focussing of the role of school experience in <b>political</b> <b>socialisation.</b> An empirical study is reported which explored the role of school experience in <b>political</b> <b>socialisation,</b> operationalised in a comparison of girls attending private and state sector schools. Questionnaires were completed by 181 girls aged 15 - 18 in the two types of school. Individual interviews were conducted with 127 of this group (67 private, 60 state) from comparable social backgrounds. The aim was to compare girls matched for family background but experiencing different types of educational structure. The interviews explored attitudes to a range of political and socio-economic phenomena (the content of <b>political</b> <b>socialisation),</b> and history of political exploration and commitment (the process of <b>political</b> <b>socialisation).</b> The process dimension was based on the identity categories of achievement, foreclosure, moratorium and diffusion described by Marcia.

Estimation results obtained from multivariate regressions on the 2002 German General Social Survey and replications on the 2008 / 9 European Social Survey can be condensed into three statements: (1) Regime socialisation {{is the single most}} important determinant of attitudes toward public childcare, followed by young age as an indicator of self-interest and political ideology. Family involvement does not have any sizeable impact. (2) Regime socialisation conditions the impact of some indicators of political ideology and family involvement on attitudes toward public childcare. (3) Despite a paradigmatic shift in policy, the dynamics of 2008 mirror those of 2002, highlighting the stability of inter-individual differences in support.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the micro level {{processes}} of democratisation, namely the perception of political information and the consequent perception and evaluation of the political regimes of the past and the present.

The study examines the influence of party affiliation and <b>political</b> <b>socialisation</b> on how people process political information and evaluate political regimes, both present and past. The data, collected by quasi-experimental focus groups and analysed by employing quantitative content analysis, provides evidence that people with different political affiliations and with different <b>political</b> <b>socialisation</b> vary not only in their evaluation of the political regimes, but also in the way they reach their evaluations.

40|$|Purpose. This paper {{presents}} an empirical contribution towards {{the understanding of}} the process of sharing practical knowledge (PK) in a hostile work environment. The particular focus is an instance of the process of sharing PK between experienced and non-experienced workers in a biopharmaceutical industry. Methodology. An interpretive perspective was applied in the inductive and qualitative empirical study. Case study methodology was applied in order to analyse the sharing of practical knowledge. Findings. Research findings from this study have unraveled characteristics of this process that to date have not been discussed in the literature. First, Learning-by-observing has limitations in promoting PK sharing in hostile environments. Second, because there is a wide range of alternative solutions for performing a specific task, sharing PK lends itself to <b>political</b> uses. Third, <b>socialisation</b> is important in order to facilitate the sharing of PK, but it is not enough. Political issues surrounding PK sharing shape socialisation processes and therefore provide better explanatory base for PK sharing. Fourth, the use of standard work processes to share PK is limited in complex tasks. Thus, it is argued that the main features of PK support high levels of uncertainty that in turn favours the use of political behavior in the process of sharing PK. Originality. Focusing on sharing PK in hostile environments is important since the literature has mainly focused on organisations in which consensus and participation were either implicitly or explicitly assumedGriffith Business School, Department of International Business and Asian StudiesFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|Much {{analysis}} of trends in democratisation {{in the world}} nowadays gives a rather pessimistic message, with such sweeping notions {{as the end of}} the third wave of democratisation, or of the democratic transition paradigm. A closer look at what has been happening in Europe, however, suggests that such analyses have often overlooked an important explanatory variable, captured in what we may call a ‘gravity model’, borrowing here a term from trade theory in economics. The gravity model of democratisation joins up with the mechanisms of Europeanisation, with democratisation progressing fast and deeply in 20 European states that were recently non-democratic, and which have various integrative relationships with the European Union. The trends and levels in the democracy scorecard in Europe as a whole show a clear correlation with the degrees of strength of these integrative relationships, and the results can be seen to be linked to the <b>political</b> conditionality and <b>socialisation</b> mechanisms of Europeanisation. Unfortunately for the advocates of universal democracy, other continents are presently unable to organise or access something similar, even Latin America where the US might have been expected to play more of an analogous role, and even less the Arab/Islamic world. This is not to argue that the values and mechanisms of democracy do not have universal plausibility, at least in the long run. But in the absence of the gravity variable in other continents, there should be soberly realistic expectations over the prospects for fast and deep democratisation. The EU may itself be reaching the outer limits of its gravitational power, but this is an ongoing story...|$|R
40|$|Background: Since the {{introduction}} of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003, nurses practicing in New Zealand are required by law to have evidence to support they are competent to practice. However many nurses have become distraught and / or angry at this prospect. From experience, the researcher suggests that this response appears to be more commonly related to the expectation of undertaking reflective writing, which is a key component of the competence evidence. Aim: To explore the predisposing factors relating to nursing, reflective writing and competence to determine how this may impact on a nurse’s self esteem. Method: Utilisation of Critical Social Theory informed by feminist framework allows for exploration of the historical, social, political and cultural factors that shape and form female nurses reality in practice. It is a theory that relates to oppression and power, with the primary intent being to raise consciousness in order to emancipate. Findings: Although no definitive findings were made, there are multiple factors relating to nurse’s history, <b>socialisation,</b> <b>political</b> imperatives and cultural beliefs that have the potential to impact on their self esteem. Competence, competence assessment and reflective practice are complex, therefore presenting multiple challenges. Conclusion: In order for nurses to understand their contextual reality and opportunities for change {{there is a need for}} them to engage in critical reflection. As context has the potential to have a significant impact on nurses self esteem, further research is needed to understand how it may influence nurses, their practice and the nursing profession...|$|R

Aristotle, as Plato 2 ̆ 7 s outstanding student, took it for granted that the legislator should make the political education of the young a major goal. To ensure the stability of the Constitution, which to Aristotle meant not only the framework of government but a way of life, citizens had to be educated to what he called eudaimonia. The translation of happiness is slightly misleading. Well-being and similar words are often more accurate. The aim of ethics and also politics was to show people how to achieve eudaimonia.

Using a combination of content analysis, observation, and network analysis to examine the content of messages travelling over these lists and the social community they embody, this paper concludes that these lists do fulfil important <b>political</b> <b>socialisation</b> functions, but do not provide the means by which political interlocutors can turn this social bonding and education into practical political expression. While each list had significant similarities, it appears that important "bracing" factors lead to the success or otherwise of lists as lively places for debate. In particular, the role of moderation and promotion is critical in the establishment of political discussion lists that develop enough 'critical mass' to sustain a community of interest large enough to appear self-replicating. The research points to the important relationship between online political forms of expression and extant political organisations, structures, and institutions for further research.
