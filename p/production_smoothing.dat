Franco Modigliani had worked on consumption and <b>production</b> <b>smoothing.</b> Jack Muth, with an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering and was interested in applying engineering methods in economics. Herb Simon was dedicated to determining how managers actually made decisions in organizations and in modeling their behavior. The four developed control methods and applied them to microeconomics by computing variables for production, inventories and the labor force in a firm. Their solutions were {{in the form of}} linear decision rules where production, for example, at a point in time was made a linear function of past inventory levels. The four were eager not only to develop the theory and mathematics of this subject but also to demonstrate how their ideas could be put to work in an actual enterprise. So they searched around in Pittsburgh until they found a paint factory that was willing to supply them data. The result was one of the earliest uses of control methods in economics, namely Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon (1960).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} smoothing production in a job shop in which all production is to customer order and the demand process is a stationary stochastic process. We present an approach to <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> based {{on the concept of}} a planning window. A planning window is the difference between the promised delivery time and the planned production time for a product. It represents the degree of flexibility available for planning the production of committed orders. We characterize the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> benefits for a range of planning windows by means of an approximate analytic model and a simulation study. These analyses show that substantial smoothing benefits result from small changes in the length of the planning window.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{test of the}} long-run implications of the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model of inventories, the dominant framework for inventory investment research in the past. Intertemporal models of a firm holding inventories of finished goods predict a long-run relationship between inventories, shipments, factor input prices, and the real interest rate which is tested here using cointegration test procedures. These tests provide little support for the predictions of the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model. In most of the data sets used, test statistics indicate that inventories, shipments, factor input prices, the nominal interest rate, and the inflation rate maintain a long-run equilibrium relationship but parameter estimates of cointegrating vectors are often implausible, typically rejecting hypotheses implied by structural models of the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> motive for holding inventories.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two methods}} {{to solve the}} <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> problem in mixed-model just-in-time (JIT) systems with large setup and processing time variability between different models the systems produce. The problem is motivated by production planning at a leading U. S. automotive pressure hose manufacturer. One method finds all Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize total production rate variation of models and work in process (WIP), and maximize system utilization and responsiveness. These Pareto-optimal solutions are found efficiently in polynomial time with respect to total demand by an algorithm proposed in the paper. The other method relies on Daniel Webster's method of apportionment for <b>production</b> <b>smoothing,</b> which produces periodic, uniform, and reflective production sequences that can improve operations management of the JIT systems.

The result indicates that under the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> policy, the overestimation of demand rate during the pre-decoupling stage guarantees the existence of the optimal decoupling point; meanwhile the optimal decoupling point exists under zero-inventory policy when the demand rate is underestimated.

40|$|This volume {{consists}} of six essays that develop and/or apply "rational expectations equilibrium inventory models" {{to study the}} time series behavior of production, sales, prices, and inventories at the industry level. By "rational expectations equilibrium inventory model" I mean {{the extension of the}} inventory model of Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon (1960) to account for: (i) discounting, (ii) infinite horizon planning, (iii) observed and unobserved by the "econometrician" stochastic shocks in the production, factor adjustment, storage, and backorders management processes of firms, {{as well as in the}} demand they face for their products; and (iv) rational expectations. As is well known according to the Holt et al. model firms hold inventories in order to: (a) <b>smooth</b> <b>production,</b> (b) <b>smooth</b> <b>production</b> changes, and (c) avoid stockouts. Following the work of Zabel (1972), Maccini (1976), Reagan (1982), and Reagan and Weitzman (1982), Blinder (1982) laid the foundations of the rational expectations equilibrium inventory model. To the three reasons for holding inventories in the model of Holt et al. was added (d) optimal pricing.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} on the empirical behavior of inventories examines some variant of the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model of finished goods inventories. The overall assessment of this model that exists in the literature is quite negative: {{there is little evidence that}} manufacturers hold inventories of finished goods in order to smooth production patterns. This paper examines whether this negative assessment of the model is due to one or both of two features: costs shocks and seasonal fluctuations. The reason for considering costs shocks is that if firms are buffeted more by cost shocks than demand shocks, production should optimally be more variable than sales. The reasons for considering seasonal fluctuations are that seasonal fluctuations account for a major portion of the variance in production and sales, that seasonal fluctuations are precisely the kinds of fluctuations that producers should most easily smooth, and that seasonally adjusted data is likely to produce spurious rejections of the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model even when it is correct. We integrate cost shocks and seasonal fluctuations into the analysis of the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model in three steps. First, we present a general <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model of inventory investment that is consistent with both seasonal and non-seasonal fluctuations in production, sales, and inventories. The model allows for both observable and unobservable changes in marginal costs. Second, we estimate this model using both seasonally adjusted and seasonally unadjusted data plus seasonal dummies. The goal here is to determine whether the incorrect use of seasonally adjusted data has been responsible for the rejections of the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model reported in previous studies. The third part of our approach is to explicitly examine the seasonal movements in the data. We test whether the residual from an Euler equation is uncorrelated with the seasonal component of contemporaneous sales. Even if unobservable seasonal cost shocks make the seasonal variation in output greater than that in sales, the timing of the resulting seasonal movements in output should not necessarily match that of sales. The results of our empirical work provide a strong negative report on the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model, even when it includes cost shocks and seasonal fluctuations. At both seasonal and non-seasonal frequencies, there appears to be little evidence that firms hold inventories in order to smooth production. A striking piece of evidence is that in most industries the seasonal in production closely matches the seasonal in shipments, even after accounting for the movements in interest rates, input prices, and the weather. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{literature}} {{two types}} of models exist that aim at describing the production decision(s) of entrepreneurs, taking account of production costs and costs incurred by the existence of inventory stocks of final goods. One type is called the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> models and the other type the factor demand models that include inventories. In this paper both types are discussed, compared {{with each other and}} estimated. The main results are that the factor demand model is preferred to the <b>production</b> <b>smoothing</b> model since (i) costs are more "structurally" specified by which more efficient parameter estimates are obtained and (ii) arbitrary normalisation rules are not needed. GMM estimation results obtained with data from French industrial sectors also corroborate the preference of the factor demand model. ...|$|E
40|$|Inventories {{are widely}} {{believed}} {{to serve as a}} buffer stock against unexpected fluctuations in demand, allowing firms to plan production more efficiently. If so, we would expect production to vary less than sales and inventory to move in the opposite direction to sales. However, research finds that production varies more than sales {{and that there is a}} positive correlation between changes in inventory and changes in sales. These findings imply that inventories are not being used to <b>smooth</b> <b>production</b> and do not serve as a buffer for uncertain demand. Donald S.
