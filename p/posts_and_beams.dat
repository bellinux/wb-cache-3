25|$|Determining the {{starting}} {{time of the}} construction is a crucial matter in the Acehnese culture. The house owner engages a traditional carpenter in the particular month {{thought to be the}} most auspicious to begin construction. Several rituals are carried out during the construction process: first when the <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams</b> are erected, second when the main house building is constructed, and third after the construction is completed. The first ceremony is the sprinkling of raw materials such as uncooked rice and water at the site, completed with a small meal. The second ceremony is a ceremonial meal for the assistants of the carpenter, usually fifteen in number. The third and last ceremony is a big ceremonial feast served for as many people as the owner wants to invite.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{architect of}} the Roger Mowry Tavern is not known for certain. Robert A. Geake's book Historic Taverns of Rhode Island suggests {{it may have been}} the work of William Carpenter and the mason John Smith. The original house began as a -story stone ender with a single [...] by roughly [...] fire room. Running lengthwise across the middle of the room is a large summer beam. On the right side of the fireplace was the stairs or ladder that lead to the upstairs chamber. At an unknown date, the roof of the original house was extended higher, as evidenced by the original beams ending about [...] above the floor. By 1711, the house had a two-story lean-to. By the late 19th century the house had been greatly altered, but the original structure was restored by Robert Isham. Isham found and restored the house, which still featured the original <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams.</b> The large fireplace remained intact, but was concealed behind a fireboard and closet, that was itself behind a stove. The result was that stone fireplace was completely concealed prior to restoration. Less than a decade later after Isham restored the original part of the house, the whole structure was demolished.|$|E

2500|$|The {{architecture}} of ancient Greece is of a trabeated or [...] "post and lintel" [...] form, i.e. it {{is composed of}} upright beams (posts) supporting horizontal beams (lintels). Although the existent buildings of the era are constructed in stone, {{it is clear that}} the origin of the style lies in simple wooden structures, with vertical posts supporting beams which carried a ridged roof. The <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams</b> divided the walls into regular compartments which could be left as openings, or filled with sun dried bricks, lathes or straw and covered with clay daub or plaster. Alternately, the spaces might be filled with rubble. It is likely that many early houses and temples were constructed with an open porch or [...] "pronaos" [...] above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.|$|E
60|$|Almost {{the only}} way of forcing a passage into a castle or {{fortified}} town was by climbing over the walls by means of ladders, and overpowering the garrison upon the top of them by main force, as represented in the engraving. Sometimes, it is true, the besiegers of a castle undermined the walls, so as to make them fall in and thus open a breach. At the present day, mines dug in this way are blown up by gunpowder. But people were little acquainted with the use of gunpowder then, and so they were obliged to shore up the walls while they were digging them by means of <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams,</b> and these, after the miners had withdrawn, were pulled out by ropes, and thus the walls were made to fall down.|$|E
60|$|The future fort {{was begun}} on {{the centre of}} the level patch of green-sward {{at the foot of the}} flat rock by the spring, where the party had {{originally}} encamped. A square was traced on the ground to indicate the stockade; and within this, Stanley marked off an oblong patch, close to the back stockade, for the principal dwelling-house, facing the river. Two other spaces were on either side of this--one for a store, the other for a dwelling for the men. When finished, the fort would thus have the form of three sides of a square surrounded by a stockade. In the centre of this, and the first thing that was erected, was a flag-staff, on which the H.B.C.--Hudson's Bay Company--flag was hoisted, and saluted with three cheers as its crimson folds fluttered out in the breeze for the first time. The plan on which the houses were constructed was that on which all the dwellings of the fur-traders are built--namely, a framework of timber, the interstices of which are filled up with logs sliding into grooves cut in the main <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams.</b> This manner of building is so simple that a house can be erected without any other instruments than an axe, an auger, and a large chisel; and the speed with which it is put up would surprise those whose notions of house-building are limited to stone edifices.|$|E

60|$|The {{villages of}} the Sumatran Malays are {{somewhat}} peculiar and very picturesque. A space of some acres is surrounded {{with a high}} fence, and over this area the houses are thickly strewn without the least attempt at regularity. Tall cocoa-nut trees grow abundantly between them, and the ground is bare and smooth with the trampling of many feet. The houses are raised about six feet on posts, the best being entirely built of planks, others of bamboo. The former are always more or less ornamented with carving and have high-pitched roofs and overhanging eaves. The gable ends and all the chief <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams</b> are sometimes covered with exceedingly tasteful carved work, and this is still more {{the case in the}} district of Menangkabo, further west. The floor is made of split bamboo, and is rather shaky, and {{there is no sign of}} anything we should call furniture. There are no benches or chairs or stools, but merely the level floor covered with mats, on which the inmates sit or lie. The aspect of the village itself is very neat, the ground being often swept before the chief houses; but very bad odours abound, owing to there being under every house a stinking mud-hole, formed by all waste liquids and refuse matter, poured down through the floor above. In most other things Malays are tolerably clean--in some scrupulously so; and this peculiar and nasty custom, which is almost universal, arises, I have little doubt, from their having been originally a maritime and water-loving people, who built their houses on posts in the water, and only migrated gradually inland, first up the rivers and streams, and then into the dry interior. Habits which were at once so convenient and so cleanly, and which had been so long practised as to become a portion of the domestic life of the nation, were of course continued when the first settlers built their houses inland; and without a regular system of drainage, the arrangement of the villages is such that any other system would be very inconvenient.|$|E

5000|$|The Sea Monster House {{that was}} on display at Pacific Science Center was a {{combination}} of two separate houses owned by the Scow family. The houses were originally created and constructed on Gilford Island, near Vancouver Island in the early 1900s.

The <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams</b> in the exhibit are the actual <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams</b> of the Raven House, also owned by the Scow family, which was built around 1916. The house is a traditional Kwakwaka'wakw home consisting of four large cedar posts and four large cedar crossbeams surrounded by a shell cedar planks. The front of the house is painted in traditional Kwakiutl-style formlines.

50|$|The Nuki joint is a Japanese {{style of}} {{carpentry}} connection. Nuki joints {{are common in}} Japanese and oriental carpentry, and comprise one of the simplest structural connectors. They are similar to mortise and tenon joints, and have been used traditionally in historic buildings, such as Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and also in modern domestic houses. The basic principle involves penetrating one element through another (i.e., embedment); in Japan and other Asian countries this method is used to connect wooden <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|E
