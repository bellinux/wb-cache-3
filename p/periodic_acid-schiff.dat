25|$|After {{separation}} of red cell membranes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with <b>periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff</b> staining (PAS) four glycophorins have been identified. These {{have been named}} glycophorin A, B, C and D in order of the quantity present in the membrane – glycophorin A being the most and glycophorin D the least common. A fifth (glycophorin E) has been identified within the human genome but cannot easily be detected on routine gel staining. In total the glycophorins constitute ~2% of the total erythrocyte membrane protein mass. Confusingly these proteins are also known under different nomenclatures but they are probably {{best known as the}} glycophorins.|$|E

40|$|Calcium phosphate-boric acid {{treatments}} and UDP-glucose both elicited aniline blue fluorescent, <b>periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff's</b> reagent-resistant, deposits {{in association with}} the cell walls of cowpea (Vigna sinensis [Torner] Savi cv. Early Ramshorn) tissue. Those deposits induced by calcium phosphateboric acid treatment ultrastructurally resembled the “wound callose” commonly triggered by cell damage; they were formed in seemingly intact cells of stems and leaves and their formation was associated with an increase in the surface density of rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cell cytoplasm. In contrast, UDP-glucose induced a more rapid accumulation of aniline blue fluorescent material, but only at the cut edges of stem slices. Comparative light and electron microscopy indicated that the material was incorporated into the walls of the damaged cells, even when such cells were devoid of organized cytoplasm. These results indicate a difference in the mode and site of synthesis between wound callose and that elicited by exogenous UDP-glucose. They support the hypothesis that externally supplied UDP-glucose cannot be utilized by intact cells...|$|R

Six trained cyclists each performed four trials: two experimental bouts (SS and VI) in which muscle biopsies were taken before and after 140 min of exercise for determination of glycogen and <b>periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff's</b> staining; and two similar trials without biopsies but incorporating the TT. During two of the experimental rides, subjects ingested a 5 g/ 100 ml [U-(14) C]glucose solution to determine rates of Glu(ox). Values were similar between SS and VI trials: O(2) consumption (3. 08 +/- 0. 02 vs. 3. 15 +/- 0. 03 l/min), energy expenditure (901 +/- 40 vs. 904 +/- 58 J x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)), heart rate (156 +/- 1 vs. 160 +/- 1 beats/min), and rating of perceived exertion (12. 6 +/- 0. 6 vs. 12. 7 +/- 0. 7). However, the area under the curve for plasma lactate concentration vs. time was significantly greater during VI than SS (29. 1 +/- 3. 9 vs. 24. 6 +/- 3. 7 mM/ 140 min; P = 0. 03). VI resulted in a 49 % reduction in total muscle glycogen utilization vs. 65 % for SS, while total Glu(ox) was higher (99. 2 +/- 5. 3 vs. 83. 9 +/- 5. 2 g/ 140 min; P < 0. 05).

It has been noticed that increased mucin production occurs in many cancers, including adenocarcinomas of pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, and colon. The aim {{of the present study}} was to demonstrate and identify the different types of mucins and their relationship with gastrointestinal tract carcinoma lesions in Sudanese patients. Tissue sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of gastrointestinal tract carcinoma lesions were stained by the following histological stains to demonstrate different mucins: Hematoxylin and Eosin, <b>Periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff's</b> (PAS), Alcian Blue, combined Alcian Blue-PAS, and combined Alcian Blue–Aldehyde Fuchsin. Neutral mucin was the most prominent in esophageal and gastro esophageal carcinomas while acid mucin was the most prominent in carcinomas of colon, rectum and stomach.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the putative usefulness of mucins in understanding the progression of gastric cancer and gallstone formation in a better perspective. Methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric biopsy specimens and surgically resected gallbladder tissue samples were sectioned. Alcian Blue (AB) staining was performed to identify sialomucins (staining blue at pH 2. 5) and sulfomucins (staining brown at pH 1. 0) and then <b>Periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff's</b> (PAS) staining to visualize the neutral mucins (staining magenta). Results In normal gastric and gallbladder mucosae, we found that neutral mucins were predominant, whereas in intestinal metaplasia, gastric carcinoma and stone-containing gallbladder, a significant increase of acidic mucins was found. Conclusion We suggest that the sulfomucins have a greater role in gallstone formation than the neutral mucins and also that the sialomucins and sulfomucins play an important role in cancer progression and metastasis. Our results challenge the glycobiologists to delve deeper in elucidating the role of mucins in gastric malignancy and in gallstone formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{developmental}} cytology of the elaiosome of Dicentra formosa (Andr.)

Light and transmission electron microscopy studies showed that the elaiosome becomes differentiated from epidermal tissue in the prefertilized ovule. At this time the cells are characterized by their large size, their irregularity in shape, and the presence of a large vacuole. As these cells continue to develop, they become larger, more irregular, and more vacuolate. The cells making up the elaiosome continue this pattern of growth throughout the entire period of seed growth becoming true giant cells at maturity. The accumulation of materials which might serve as a food source for ants was observed by staining with Sudan black and <b>Periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff's</b> reagent during successive stages. Starch was found to be present in the cells throughout the developmental period, but not in any great amounts. Only in the mature elaiosome was a large buildup of lipid droplets observed.

40|$|Histochemical {{examination}} of rabbit, rat, guinea pig and mouse limb skeletal muscles in our laboratory {{has revealed that}} most red muscle fibers in any given muscle stain more intensely for glycogen (<b>periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff’s</b> reaction) than white or intermediate fibers.

Eleven vastus lateralis muscles were resected from six adult male guinea pigs and cropped to yield “red, ” “moderate ” and “white ” regions. Cross-sections of each region were employed for histochemical fiber typing and the re-maining pieces for biochemical glycogen analysis. These analyses have shown the red region to have significantly more glycogen (9. 7 mg per g) and more red fibers (77 %) than the white region (7. 4 mg/g, 29 %). Having essentially eliminated intermediate fibers by cropping, these findings reflect glycogen concentration in red and white muscle fibers.

Phenylephrine and isoprenaline produced a saliva approximately 50 -fold richer in protein than that induced by methacholine. Protease activity was greatest in saliva induced by phenylephrine. Methacholine, phenylephrine and isoprenaline caused the secretion of markedly different protein populations, determined by separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. Many species in the molecular weight range 10000 - 40000 were secreted in response to phenylephrine and isoprenaline. Methacholine produced a saliva poor in protein and the resulting electrophoretic banding patterns were faint. Staining with <b>periodic</b> <b>acid-Schiff's</b> reagent showed that the largest protein species (mol. wt. 150000) secreted in response to isoprenaline was glycosylated and that small quantities of a similar protein were present in saliva produced by methacholine and phenylephrine but were not visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. Phosphorylated proteins of molecular weights 30000 - 35000 and 38000 - 45000 were detected in saliva produced by isoprenaline but not in saliva produced by methacholine or phenylephrine. Stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk at 5 Hz yielded a population of salivary proteins, many of which behaved similarly on electrophoresis to proteins secreted in response to isoprenaline. At 20 Hz a different population was secreted, resembling that present in phenylephrine-induced saliva...|$|R
