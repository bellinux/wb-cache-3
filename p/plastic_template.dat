5000|$|MultiMate was not marketed {{heavily to}} end-users, but was quickly popular with {{insurance}} companies, law firms, other business computer users and US {{government agencies and}} the military. While the Wang WP keyboard {{was different from the}} original PC keyboard, MultiMate compensated by providing a large <b>plastic</b> <b>template</b> that clipped on the PC keyboard, and stick-on labels for the fronts of the PC keys. The template and labels color-coded the combination keystrokes using the SHIFT, ALT and CTRL keys with all 10 of the PC's function keys and many of the character keys. Like Wang systems, MultiMate controlled most editing operations with function keys, assigning four functions to each of the 10 function keys, which IBM initially located at {{the left side of the}} keyboard in two vertical rows. It also included a [...] "document summary" [...] screen for each document, another Wang feature, which allowed more sophisticated document-management than the brief file names allowed by MS-DOS and PC DOS. As Drop-down lists were popularized by other programs, they became a later addition to MultiMate.|$|E

Maxillary bone solid models with the bone and teeth reconstructed using CBCT images and teeth and mucosa outer profile acquired using laser scanning were superimposed to allow miniscrew visual insertion planning and permit surgical template fabrication. The customized surgical template CAD model was fabricated offset based on the teeth/mucosa/bracket contour profiles in the superimposition model and exported to duplicate the <b>plastic</b> <b>template</b> using the 3 DP technique and polymer material. An anterior retraction and intrusion clinical test for the maxillary canines/incisors showed that two miniscrews were placed safely and did not produce inflammation or other discomfort symptoms one week after surgery. The fitness between the mucosa and template indicated that the average gap sizes were found smaller than 0. 5 [*]mm and confirmed that the surgical template presented good holding power and well-fitting adaption.

40|$|In vitro {{models of}} human small {{intestine}} {{play a critical}} role in predicting oral drug absorption efficiency as well as understanding intestinal epithelia functionality. Conventional 2 D in vitro models fail to represent small intestinal villi which are important 3 D features for the small intestinal microenvironment. Without these features, in vitro models of the small intestine lack physiological relevance. By using microfabrication techniques, we created a <b>plastic</b> <b>template</b> with accurate dimensions and densities of human small intestinal villi. Based on this template, we fabricated collagen villous scaffolds utilizing a sacrificial hydrogel technique. By integrating collagen villous scaffolds into a custom designed insert kit, we developed the first 3 D in vitro model of the human small intestine. Epithelial cells cultured on this 3 D model presented unique cell differentiation morphology similar to human small intestine epithelia. Drug permeability tests conducted on this 3 D model provided more accurate results for drugs absorbed through the paracellular pathway when compared to conventional 2 D models. In addition, alternative biomaterials were tested for their potential in making 3 D villous scaffolds. This work suggests that the 3 D in vitro model of the human small intestine is an effective tool for predicting drug permeability as well as investigating the small intestinal microenvironment. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for {{the separation of}} full-field photoelastic images for use with an automated polariscope is described. Regions of background in the image are identified thus producing the boundary of the model. The shear difference method {{is used to calculate}} the components of stress along all raster lines in the image using photoelastic parameters at the boundary points to calculate the initial values of stress. Algorithms were also used to evaluate the stress components along raster lines which did not contain boundary points. A <b>plastic</b> <b>template</b> was used to evaluate the efficiency of the boundary routine. It was found that it was able to identify edges to within approximately one pixel on screen. The complete {{procedure for}} stress separation was evaluated using a stress frozen disc in compression and a turbine slot. The values of stress found using the automated polariscope with the stress-separation procedure were found to agree well with theory and with results determined using the method of Tardy compensation and manual analysis. The automated polariscope was also used to analyze three-dimensional stress components along arbitrary lines of a 3 D model. A two-model slicing regime was used to analyze a strut subjected to a vertical load. This work was compared to results obtained by Frocht and Guernsey on an identical model machined from Fosterite and subjected to a higher load. Good agreement was found between the results for points away from the region of loading. Significant differences were found near to the load point, however.

40|$|High {{frequency}} ultrasonic transducers {{based on}} fine scale 1 - 3 piezocomposites enable high resolution in medical or material imaging. As increasing frequency requires decreasing pillar size and kerf width, the conventional dice-and-fill technique {{is limited by}} blade thickness and becomes more sophisticated with smaller dimensions. In contrast, the soft mold technique allows for fine-scale piezoceramic arrays with free design of pillar geometry and spatial distribution. Basis of the procedure are net-shaped master molds fabricated by structuring techniques known from microsystems technology, like deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) or LIGA process. From these, soft <b>plastic</b> <b>templates</b> are taken which are reusable. Therein a ceramic slurry based on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is casted and demolded after drying. After debindering, sintering and filling with an epoxy polymer resulting 1 - 3 piezocomposites are lapped to the desired thickness, electroded and poled. In this contribution, {{the development of a}} 20 MHz ultrasonic transducer based on a 1 - 3 piezocomposite with circular pillars in hexagonal arrangement and sintered dimensions of 34 μm diameter, 160 μm height and 10 μm spacing is reported. 1 - 3 piezocomposites made of these structures show coupling coefficients kt = 0. 6 at the thickness resonance of 20 MHz. First lateral resonance is measured at anuncritical frequency of 37 MHz. A single element ultrasonic probe has been manufactured by selection of appropriate backing and matching layers.

40|$|BACKGROUND Brachytherapy is an {{important}} therapeutic strategy {{for the treatment of}} locally advanced gynaecologic (GYN) cancers despite evolution of different newer radiotherapy techniques like high-dose-rate and image-guided BT. Despite being used in the management of advanced gynaecological cancer, currently there is a scarcity of studies and data on interstitial BT in Indian context. This is a retrospective analysis on 71 patients with locally advanced gynaecological malignancies treated in the period of 2010 to 2016 to assess the local tumour control, survival, and complications with the template (Syed-Neblett) guided interstitial technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS The patients with a median age of 51 years treated from July 2010 to May 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. This study included previously unirradiated 71 patients with advance stage of gynaecological malignancies, not suitable for intracavitary brachytherapy due to distorted anatomy or extensive disease stage. Histologically all patients had squamous cell carcinoma (cervix= 56, vault= 9, vagina= 6) and treated by whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) up to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. These patients were further treated by high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy using SyedNeblett dedicated vaginal <b>plastic</b> <b>template.</b> During treatment all these patients were re-optimised and a dose of 15 - 21 Gy was delivered in 3 fractions with a minimum gap of 6 hours between fractions using Varisource iX HDR unit. RESULTS Out of 71 patients 5 were lost to followup during study period and they were excluded from the final analysis. The average followup duration ranged between 6 - 71 months and median followup was 20 months. This study included parameters like local disease control, acute/late complications and distant metastasis. Out of 66 patients, local disease control was seen in 54 (81. 81...|$|E

MultiMate, for example, was written for an insurance company that had hundreds of typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used stick-on labels and a large <b>plastic</b> clip-on <b>template</b> to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and ctrl keys with the 10 IBM function keys {{and many of the}} alphabet keys.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{growth of}} hair over a 40 -week period is {{reported}} for eight women with androgenetic alopecia. Using a random, double-blind protocol, {{the women were}} given either a 2 % minoxidil solution or a placebo of vehicle only. Hair in a permanently marked site on the fronto-parietal scalp was pulled through a 1 -cm-square clear <b>plastic</b> <b>templates</b> and {{the outline of the}} template was drawn on the scalp. The hair was carefully hand clipped and collected at five eight-week intervals (one untreated and four treated), using great care to collect only hairs within the marked area. Subsequent measurements included the total weight of hair grown in the marked area, the total number of hairs, and, on a randomized 50 -hair subsample, the weight, lengths, and optical diameters. Calculated quantities included average weight per hair, average length, and average optical width. The average total hair weight of minoxidil-treated subjects increased over the 32 -week test period by 42. 5 %, compared to 1. 9 % for the placebo-treated subjects (average p = 0. 018). Changes for the average number count were 29. 9 % and - 2. 6 %, respectively (average p = 0. 022). These increases, observed using an unusually small number of subjects, clearly distinguished the treated subjects from the untreated. During the same test period, the averaged quantities of weight, diameter, and length from the 50 -hair subsample showed insignificant change (p usually> 05). In addition to showing a larger percentage increase than did the total number, the total weight is not only easier to obtain, but less prone to error during sampling and measurement. Therefore, we recommend that total weight from a defined area be considered as the primary quantitative estimator for hair growth...|$|R

In 1988-91 he created over thirty thousand completely unique objects he titled Individual Works, which were gathered and exhibited in collections of over ten thousand. The objects were made by taking many dozens of rubber molds from common household objects - like bottle caps, food containers, and kitchen tools - and combining plaster casts of these parts in thousands of possible ways, never repeating a combination. In 1989, he used a similar system to create thousands of handmade graphite pencil drawings, using hundreds of <b>plastic</b> drafting <b>templates</b> he designed for this purpose, each drawing made unique by combining the templates according to a combinatorial protocol that never repeated itself.|$|R
40|$|For high {{resolution}} imaging high frequency ultrasonic transducers are needed {{which can be}} operated well above 15 MHz. Therefore, fine scale 1 - 3 piezocomposites are required. Due to the brittleness of the ceramic, the limited blade width and the increasing effort convention aldice-and-fill technique becomes increasingly insufficient as pillar size and kerf become smaller. Micromolding techniques {{turned out to be}} suitable for the fabrication of fine scale piezoceramic arrays with free design of ceramic pillars and randomized spatial distribution. The soft mold process offers the opportunity to fabricate fine scale 1 - 3 piezocomposites with free design of the piezoceramic part. The basis of this approach are master molds, which are structured by microsystems technologies like LIGA, SU 8 and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). That allows a high variety of rod size, shape, spacing, and arrangement. The combination of silicon industry based microstructuring and ceramic molding is possible through soft <b>plastic</b> <b>templates</b> taken from the master mold, which are reusable. A ceramic slurry based on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is filled into the soft molds under vacuum and there in dried. After demolding array structures are debindered, sintered and filled with an epoxy polymer. Ceramic body and excessive epoxy are removed by grinding and the resulting 1 - 3 piezocomposite lapped to the desired thickness, electroded and poled. In this contribution, we report on the development of a 20 MHz ultrasonic transducer. Different designs of piezoceramic rods and spacings have been tested and characterized to shift spurious modes to frequencies approximately twiceas working frequency. Ceramic pillars based on triangle and half hexagon cross section with 32 μm edge length, 160 μm height and 13 μm spacing tend to topple during sintering. Best results have been obtained using round pillars in hexagonal arrangement with sintered dimensions of 34 μm diameter, 160 μm height and 10 μm spacing. 1 - 3 piezocomposites made of these structures show coupling coefficients kt = 0. 6 at the thickness resonance of 20 MHz. First lateral resonance is measured at 37 MHz far enough away from thickness mode. A single element ultrasonic probe has been manufactured by selection of appropriate backing and matching layers. The composition of the matching layers were adjusted according to match acoustical impedance of water and grinded down in order to meet quarter wavelength criteria. For characterization of sensitivity and bandwidth pulse-echo curves have been measured. Experimental results will be presented in detail and will be compared to modelled data...|$|R
40|$|The Kato thick smear {{technique}} was originally designed for mass screening of ascariasis or other helminthiases, but is satisfactory only for qualitative diagnosis (Beaver et al., 1984). For simultaneous quali-tative and quantitative examination of helminthiasis, the Kato-Katz (KK) method {{was developed by}} modifi-cation of Kato thick smear, which uses a calibrated <b>plastic</b> or cardboard <b>template</b> to contain a consistent volume of fecal sample (Beaver et al., 1984). The KK method had {{been shown to be}} better than Stoll’s dilu-tion egg counting technique for quantitative analysis of intestinal helminthiases (Hong et al., 1992). Therefore, the KK method is useful for both qualita-tive and quantitative analysis, and is preferred for counting helminth eggs in feces, especially in the field (Odongo-Aginya et al., 1995). Recently, we found that the KK method is a highly reliable diagnostic method for clonorchiasis compared to formalin-ether tech-nique (FE) and direct smear (Hong et al., 2003). The KK method showed diagnostic sensitivity of 98. 9 %, which was the highest rate ever recorded, and was sensitive even in lightly infected cases of clonorchia-sis. The KK method and direct smear are the only tech-niques {{that can be used for}} both qualitative and quan-titative diagnosis of helminthiases (Beaver et al., 1984). The combination of KK method with direct smear resulted in increase of diagnostic sensitivity, especially in the infections of Schistosoma mansoni and hookworms (Engels et al., 1996). However, the corre-lation of EPGs obtained by both methods was not described in detail. The present study analyzed the data of our previ-ous report (Hong et al., 2003) to evaluate the correla-tion of egg counts per gram of feces (EPG) determined by the KK method with those estimated by the FE method or direct smear.
