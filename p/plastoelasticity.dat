40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} concept of {{developing}} a nondeform phase-change energy storage material possessing higher thermal conductivity and energy storage density through a pressure compaction process. The theoretical and experimental investigations {{have shown that the}} technique is able to reduce porosity and increase conductivity and energy storage density of a composite material. Even though there was some measure of <b>plastoelasticity</b> due to decompression, the average porosity was reduced from 62 to 23. 8 % at a relatively low compaction pressure of 2. 8 MPa without any structural damage to the tested sample. The mean energy storage density increased by 97 %, and the effective thermal conductivity also increased by 25 times, despite a 10 % reduction in its latent heat capacity. There is, however, the need for further development toward minimizing the effect of decompression and achieving stronger energy storage tablets at a relatively low compaction force...|$|E
40|$|Soil cave {{foundation}} {{is a common}} type in the soil foundation in karst area, {{the stability of the}} foundation willbe directly affected by the soil cave collapse destruction. Currently, the stability evaluation of soil cave {{foundation is}} mostly focus on the quantitative evaluation, such as the collapse mechanism and prevention, while the qualitative assessment is rare. Based on the <b>plastoelasticity</b> theory, firstly analyze the stress state of the soil cave wallsurrounding body in the foundation, distinguish the stress concentration influence area, then improve the soil cave foundation stability computation model by using Molecoulomb strength criterion, finally, take a soil cave foundation stability evaluation as the example in Tongren area, Guizhou, confirming the feasibility and reliability of the improvement model. The influence of the foundation bed size, buried depth, soil cave shape and groundwater level depth was further studied, which reveals the mechanism of the soil cave collapse destruction. And the research indicated that the improved model is feasible, when the foundation bed size is smaller, the buried depth is shallower, the hole shape is more spiky and the groundwater level depth is shallower, the soil cave stability coefficient will be bigger, which is more advantageous to the stability, and the influence of groundwater level depth is more sensitive to the soil cave stability, once the groundwater level depth dropped a little, the stable soil cave will become into failure and instability. Therefore, the quantitative evaluation should be paid more attention in soil cave foundation stability evaluation, particularly under the ground water environment, simultaneously, the calculation results, like soil cave foundation maximum size, the critical buried depth, the maximum water level buried depth, have the strong directive function to the soil cave foundation treatment and design...|$|E
