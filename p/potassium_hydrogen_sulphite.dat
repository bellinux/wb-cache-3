The market {{offers a lot of}} variants for <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate elimination, which includes electrodialysis. The aim of this work was to process 4 types of wines with the electrodialysis technique, of which at least 2 white and 2 red wines were preferentially unstable in terms of formation of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> crystals. These wines were processed by the electrodialysis laboratory machine EDR [...] Z/ 10 which was from the MemBrain company. During the operation, the process parameters (electrical current, voltage, flow, volume, pH and conductivity of the individual hydraulic flow) were measured. The samples of wine processed by electrodialysis were analysed by the sensory technique, for the content of tartaric acid and potassium, and for the saturation temperature of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate. The work dealt with the relation between the level of demineralization of wine, by electrodialysis, and its organoleptic properties (color, smell, taste, harmony). Furthermore, the optimal level of electrodialysis demineralization of wine was determined. This was done to find a compromise between the increased stabilization of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartare in wine and thenegative impact of its prescenceon the sensorical characteristics of the wine.

40|$|S- 33 {{solid-state}} NMR {{is reported}} from some model crystalline sulphides, sulphates, sulphites and thiosulphates. This {{is the first}} report of S- 33 NMR signals of the latter two species from a solid. Good quality spectra, which have distinct, well separated shift ranges can be identified for all these groupings, except for <b>sulphites</b> and, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphites</b> whose resonances are very broad. Nonetheless the presence of <b>sulphites</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphites</b> can be confirmed from their characteristic sharp, intense time domain echoes. S- 33 MAS NMR is also applied {{to a range of}} dry and hydrous silicate glasses with similar to 1 wt% 99 at% S- 33 -enriched sulphur. It is clear that in all these glasses sulphate is present, and in mixed cation systems there is some evidence of preferential association of sulphate with a specific cation. In a dry potassium silicate glass sample two resolved S- 33 resonances are observed, a sulphate, and the second from thiosulphate. Hence solid state S- 33 NMR is shown to be a feasible probe that can be applied to this problem that can readily distinguish different sulphur species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

50|$|When {{choosing}} primary {{standards in}} analytical chemistry, compounds with higher equivalent weights {{are generally more}} desirable because weighing errors are reduced. An example is the volumetric standardisation of a solution of sodium hydroxide which has been prepared to approximately 0.1 mol&thinsp;dm&minus;3. It is necessary to calculate the mass of a solid acid which will react with about 20 cm3 of this solution (for a titration using a 25 cm3 burette): suitable solid acids include oxalic acid dihydrate, <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phthalate and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> iodate. The equivalent weights of the three acids 63.04 g, 204.23 g and 389.92 g respectively, and the masses required for the standardisation are 126.1 mg, 408.5 mg and 779.8 mg respectively. Given that the measurement uncertainty in the mass measured on a standard analytical balance is ±0.1 mg, the relative uncertainty in the mass of oxalic acid dihydrate would be about one part in a thousand, similar to the measurement uncertainty in the volume measurement in the titration. However the measurement uncertainty in the mass of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> iodate would be five times lower, because its equivalent weight is five times higher: such an uncertainty in the measured mass is negligible {{in comparison to the}} uncertainty in the volume measured during the titration (see example below).|$|R
