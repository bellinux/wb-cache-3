40|$|A {{research}} has been conducted to investigate the performance of entik as result crossbreed of muscovy and duck as a meat producer. The method using of this research was experimental method. As the base design was Randomized Completely Design with factorial design (2 x 3 x 3) that consisted of the first factor was sex (S) comprised : s 1 =male and s 2 =female. The second factor was feed from (P) comprised: p 1 =mush, p 2 =crumble and p 3 =Paste, whereas the third factor was slaughtering age (U) that comprised u 1 =six weeks and u 2 =eight weeks and u 3 =ten weeks. The investigated parameters were carcass weight, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> weight, meat weight of carcass. Result of the research obtained the lowest average of carcass weight for male entik aged 6. 8 and 10 weeks respectively was 750. 26 g, 1142. 69 g, and the highest was 1024. 93 g, 1336. 08 g, and 760. 40 g, 1098 g, 1180. 26 g and the highest was 985. 28 g, 1378. 96 g and 1390. 20 g. The lowest average parentage carcass for male entik respectively was 59. 63 %, 60. 14 % and 61. 76 %; the highest was 57. 17 %, 61. 02 % and 67. 86 %. Whereas for the female the lowest was 57. 17 %, 62. 30 %, and 61. 02 % and the highest was 68. 99 %, 67. 59 %, and 67. 45 %. The average of meat carcass weight for the whole treatment was 733. 99 ± 158. 23 g with range around 466. 15 up to 956. 42 g, and the highest average was reached by female entik aged eight weeks who was feeding by mash that was 916. 95 ± 39. 36 g. The average of meat carcass weight was 64. 57 ± 1. 35 % with the range around 56. 66 up to 73. 60 %. Result of the analysis of variances showed that the interaction factor between the sex, feed form ands slaughtering age affected no significantly (P> 0. 05) on the carcass weight, percentage of carcass weight, meat carcass weight and the percentage of carcass weight, meat carcass weight and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> carcass weight and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> carcass weight. Review for each treatment concludes that the sex factor highest effect just only for <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> carcass weight (P< 0. 01), feed form factor had a high significant effect (P< 0. 01) on the carcass weight and the meat carcass weight, whereas the slaughtering age factor has a high significant effect linearly (P< 0. 05) on the percentage of carcass weight. This may concluded that the female entik give the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> carcass weight more high then the male, feeding by mash form for entik which slaughtering eight weeks old increase the percentage of carcass weight and meat carcass weight.

40|$|Background: Obesity and {{cardiovascular}} heart diseases are growing {{problems in the}} United States. This is partially due to the consumption of the primary red meats such as pork and beef. Goat meat {{has the potential to}} replace these traditionally consumed meats. Rice bran is a rich source of antioxidants such as vitamin E and can be utilized as a binder in meat and meat products. Methods: Goat meat/beef sausages were formulated to contain either 50 / 50, 75 / 25 or 100 / 0 percent goat meat/beef, with either no added rice bran (NRB) or 3 percent stabilized rice bran (RB). Proximate analysis, fatty acids, -tocopherol and cholesterol concentrations of the six cooked formulations were determined. The six sausage formulations were compared in a consumer acceptability taste test. Results: The fat concentration of the NRB and RB formulations decreased linearly with increasing <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> goat <b>meat</b> (p < 0. 001). The sum of the saturated fatty acids decreased linearly with increasing <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> goat <b>meat</b> (p < 0. 01). Polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid concentrations increased linearly (p < 0. 05) with increasing <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> goat <b>meat</b> in both the NRB and RB sausage formulations. The α-tocopherol concentration of the NRB formulations did not change across the goat meat percentages, but in the RB formulations it increased linearly with increasing <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> goat <b>meat</b> (p < 0. 001). The cholesterol concentration decreased linearly with increasing <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> goat <b>meat</b> in both the NRB and RB formulations (p < 0. 01, < 0. 05 respectively). The tasters preferred the NRB with higher goat meat percentage to the RB formulations. Conclusions: The NRB and RB sausage formulations with higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> goat <b>meat</b> had higher concentrations of -tocopherol, CLA (18 : 2 cis 9 Trans 11), total n- 3, total PUFA, total n- 3 /total n- 6 ratio, and a lower cholesterol concentration. The RB sausage formulations with higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> goat <b>meat</b> had lower total saturated and an acceptable ratio of (C 18 : 0 + C 18 : 1) to C 16 : 0.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{assessed}} {{the use of}} conformation and fatness scores of the EUROP sheep carcass grading system to predict weight and <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> salable <b>meat</b> from Brazilian market lambs. Data were collected from in vivo, carcass, and retail production from 252 uncastrated lambs. Evaluated models included single regressions, two multivariate models, and one determined by the stepwise procedure. Conformation was moderately correlated with weight <b>of</b> salable <b>meat.</b> Fatness scores were correlated with rump perimeter, carcass width, and thoracic depth with coefficients of − 0. 33, − 0. 32, and − 0. 23, respectively.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} various selection criteria (Landrace, Yorkshire - productive dairy breed and Hampshire - terminal) on the carcasses quality, as well as differences between sex in regard to distribution of meat, fat and bones. The study included 210 randomly selected pig carcasses at commercial farms, classified by breed and sex. Carcass dissection was carried out according to the model of EU 1992. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> in fertile breeds carcasses was 2. 04 % lower (55. 02 %), compared to the terminal breed (57. 06 %). Comparing the proportion of muscle tissue in carcasses {{of male and female}} animals, there was determined a statistically significant difference (P 0. 05) in <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> between two fertile breeds (Landrace and Yorkshire). A statistically significant difference (P< 0. 05) between fertile and terminal Hampshire breeds was determined. Sex and breed had highly significant impact on the amount of meat in the carcasses.

Again, we find a significant correlation in carnivores between mating promiscuity and elevated levels of WBC counts. In addition, we find relationships with measures of sociality, substrate use and life-history parameters. These comparative results across independent taxonomic orders indicate that {{the evolution of the}} immune system, as represented by phylogenetic differences in basal levels of blood cell counts, is closely linked to disease risk involved with promiscuous mating and associated variables.

40|$|Empirical {{aspects of}} the {{movement}} of strontium through the food chain suggest {{that the level of}} bone strontium can be used as an indicator of the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> in human diet. In general, skeletal remains from agricultural peoples are expected to have high bone strontium levels relative to hunter-gatherers from the same geographical region because plants contain relatively higher amounts of strontium when compared with animal products. The results of the study described in this paper, however, indicate that the inclusion of molluscs as a component of the diet may produce the opposite of the expected strontium values. Burials from an Archaic (c. 2500 BC) hunting-gathering population excavated from Luo 25, an archaeological site in northern Alabama, USA, exhibit a mean bone strontium level (atomic absorption; neutron activation) that is higher than the mean level from an agricultural Mississippian (c. AD 1400) population (atomic absorption; neutron activation) that was buried at the same site. The samples were analysed by two techniques (atomic absorption spectrometry and neutron activation analysis) and the results compared favourably; therefore, the results can be accepted as valid rather than being due to technique error. We propose that the ingestion of molluscs, whose meat is known to contain large amounts of strontium, has produced this reversal from expected results...|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} carcass and <b>meat</b> quality <b>of</b> pigs {{from the}} same sire line and two different dam lines, one that included Chinese breeds and one that did not. Line A consisted of 1 / 4 Landrace, 1 / 2 Large White, 1 / 8 Chinese breeds (Meishan, Fengjing, Jiaxing), and 1 / 8 Large White, Duroc and Pietrain, and line B consisted of 1 / 2 Large White and 1 / 2 Pietrain. The animals (N = 144) were slaughtered at a live weight of 108 kg. Backfat thickness, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> lean <b>meat,</b> pH 24 h after slaughter, <b>meat</b> color, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> drip loss, and <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> intramuscular fat were measured and compared using analysis of variance in a completely randomized design; the BioEstat 5. 0 test was applied for the comparison of means at a significance level of 5 % for all analyses. Backfat was significantly lower for line A (12. 78 mm) than for line B (15. 90 mm). The pH measured 24 h after slaughter was significantly lower in line A (5. 68) compared to line B (5. 84). Percent lean meat was significantly higher for line A (61. 21 %) compared to line B (59. 72 %). Percentage drip loss was significantly higher in line A (2. 73 %) than in line B (2. 23 %). Percentage intramuscular fat and meat color {{were not significantly different}} between the lines. The inclusion of Chinese breeds produced a higher <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> lean <b>meat</b> and reduced fat thickness, along with increased heterosis, which are important characteristics for breeding programs.

40|$|One {{effort for}} {{improving}} the productivity of Indonesian local ducks in particular as a meat types is by crossing among the local ducks. Crossbreeding is a fast breeding program for improving some commercial traits. Crossing between two lines or different breed are often used in production systems to utilized the advantage of heterosis (hybrid vigor). Crossbreeding is expected to produce new synthetic strains of duck that perform better than their parents. This study aims to utilize the heterosis and determine best cross, and to study the performance changes due to crossbreeding. The statistical design {{used in this study}} was a randomized complete design (RCD) consisting of 4 treatments with 6 replications, each replication consisting of five ducks. The treatments used were the crossing of the pure Cihateup ♂ x Cihateup ♀ (CC), line Alabio ♂ x Alabio ♀ (AA), Alabio ♂ x Cihateup ♀ (AC) cross as well as Cihateup ♂ x Alabio ♀ (CA) cross. This study using male ducklings first hybrid (F 1). The results show that the CA is better than AC in the final live weight (7. 05 %), weight gain (7. 32 %), carcass weight (9. 24 %) and carcass yield (2. 55 %). Fleshy carcass cuts such as breast meat of AA (6. 13 %) is better when compared to the others, but the highest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> percentage of the thigh is the AC (10. 13 %). Duck crossesing CA possess superior properties more and economic value compared with the duck AC...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} free-range farming, {{compared}} to a conventional production system, on carcass and meat qualities were studied using black-feathered Taiwan native chickens. Twenty 16 -week old females were purchased separately from a free-range farm and a conventional production farm and used for this study. The results showed similarities in the live weight (roughly 2. 1 kg), dressing percentage (69 %) and meat percentage (19 %) of deboned leg quarter. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) found for the free-range chickens included: a higher <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> for the breast, an increased crude protein content and chewiness value for the breast, but decreased crude fat content and lower hardness and fracturablility values for the leg quarter. Significantly higher L* values were found for the breast and leg meat of conventionally produced chickens, whereas {{no significant differences were}} found for WHC and purge loss between the breast and the leg, and between the two production systems as well. Results of sensory evaluation showed a significant preference for leg over breast meat (p < 0. 05). The scores of all the attributes including aroma, flavor, firmness, tenderness, juiciness and overall acceptability of leg meat from free-range chickens were slightly higher than for conventional chickens, while the reverse was true for breast meat, though no significant difference could be found. Free-range Taiwan native chicken appeared to yield the best of the results, with flavorful yet tender leg meat for higher sensory satisfaction, and high-protein but low-fat breast meat for healthier diet choice...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{stressful}} hanging-cleaning husbandry practices on the growth conditions of the cultured Mediterranean mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk, cultivated in the Mar Piccolo (Ionian Sea) was investigated from November 2005 to June 2006. The experimental strings were randomly organized in four groups, with five replications, exposed to different time periods of hanging: Group A, none; Group B, once every 15 days; Group C, once every 30 days; Group D, once every 60 days. The study, carried out on a total of 2000 mussels, showed that the cleaning of the mussel strings using the hanging-cleaning practice exerted an adverse effect on mussel growth (SGR%= 46. 62 in Group A; 44. 85 in Group D; 43. 72 in Group C; 42. 12 in Group B). In particular, the highest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> yield occurred in the mussels more frequently exposed to air (Group B, 4. 2 ± 0. 43 g) {{in spite of their}} lower morphometric variable values. In order to evaluate mussel condition, three different indexes were calculated. The hanging practice in mussel cultivation, commonly used in the basin of Taranto and in many mussel farms all over the world, would provide an economic benefit to the mussel farmers allowing the greatest production and the highest specific growth rate (SGR%) of mussels, together with a more appreciable aesthetic for the consumer. Our findings suggest that the hanging practice every 60 days would provide an economic benefit allowing an increase of about 30 % of total string weight compared to the 30 -day hanging practice commonly in use...|$|E
40|$|Broiler {{production}} has increased rapidly in tropical and subtropical {{regions in the}} past and sustained growth is forecast for the future. One of the greatest challenges to efficient production in these regions is reduced performance from warm and hot weather conditions. There are many ways to decrease these detrimental effects of heat on broiler chickens. One way is to supplement broiler diet with betaine added to feed or drinking water. A review of {{the results of this study}} suggest that betaine supplement was effective to significantly improve body weight and feed conversion ratio at the initial stages of growth but not in the finisher stages (P< 0 / 05). It was also demonstrated that the use of betaine significantly reduced the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> abdominal <b>meat</b> and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> breast <b>meat</b> (P< 0 / 05), but had no effect on other carcass compositions. Betaine may improve the digestibility of specific nutrients. Betaine, as a methyl donor provides labile methyl groups for the synthesis of several metabolically active substances such as creatine and carnitine. Oil in a broiler diet is known to promote a response to dietary betaine supplements, that is, chicks have a higher demand for betaine with a high fat diet. This study implies that betaine supplement may stimulate protection of intestinal epithelium against osmotic disturbance, improve digestion and absorption conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and promote amended use of nutrients...|$|R
40|$|In this examination, Hungarian Merino (ram n = 30, ewe n = 30), Hungarian Merino × Ile de France F 1, and Hungarian Merino × Suffolk F 1 (ram n = 15, ewe n = 15) lambs {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of crossbreeding on carcass characteristics and composition. We examined fattening performances and the following carcass traits: dressing <b>percentage,</b> weight <b>of</b> valuable carcass cuts, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> valuable <b>meat,</b> bone to meat ratio, and as well as meat conformation and fat cover (S/EUROP grading). In the present investigation, the weight at slaughter was fixed between 31 – 32 kg approximately, thus ensuring, weight would not affect carcass composition. Standardizing carcass weight allowed us to spot differences due to genotype and gender. The best results of fattening performance showed the Hungarian Merino × Ile de France F 1 lambs (358 g/day). The tested crossed genotypes had not greatly influence dressing percentage and warm carcass weight, but the best percentage valuable carcass cuts had Hungarian Merino × Suffolk F 1 (83. 37 %). The best <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> valuable <b>meat</b> presented (77. 76 %) the Hungarian Merino × Ile de France F 1 lambs. The best meat conformation and fat covered showed the Hungarian Merino × Suffolk F 1 lambs. Hungarian Merinos showed less favourable results. To the summarising, the Suffolk and Ile de France improved the Hungarian Merino’s fattening performance, slaughter value and ability of market over 30 kg live weight, therefore there were both breeds suggest with crossing...|$|R
50|$|A similar {{measurement}} to biomass is meat weight. To determine meat weight, MNI is {{multiplied by}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> an individual {{is thought to have}} provided, then {{multiplied by the}} <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> that <b>meat</b> thought to be edible. This gives an estimate of “pounds of usable meat” per individual which might have been harvested by prehistoric hunters. For example, a male Wapiti has an average weight of 400 kg, and in a particular study, the MNI of Wapiti was found to be 10. This would create a biomass of 4,000 kg. If the amount <b>of</b> edible <b>meat</b> is estimated at 50 percent, this would result in a <b>meat</b> weight <b>of</b> 2,000 kg. The biggest problem with this method is the debate over “percent of usable meat.” Different views on which parts of a species are edible and which are not as well as whether or not primitive butchers {{would have been able to}} access and prepare different parts have led to controversy.|$|R
