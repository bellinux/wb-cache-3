50|$|<b>Proflavine</b> is {{also known}} to have a {{mutagenic}} effect on DNA by intercalating between nucleic acid base pairs. It differs from most other mutagenic components by causing basepair-deletions or basepair-insertions and not substitutions.|$|E
5000|$|Intercalating agents, such as {{ethidium bromide}} and <b>proflavine,</b> are {{molecules}} that may insert between bases in DNA, causing frameshift mutation during replication. Some such as daunorubicin may block transcription and replication, making them highly toxic to proliferating cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proflavine,</b> {{also called}} proflavin and diaminoacridine and bate na bina, is an acriflavine derivative, a {{disinfectant}} bacteriostatic against many gram-positive bacteria. It {{has been used}} {{in the form of the}} dihydrochloride and hemisulfate salts as a topical antiseptic, and was formerly used as a urinary antiseptic.|$|E
5000|$|Several dyes {{and drugs}} feature the {{acridine}} skeleton. [...] Many acridines, such as <b>proflavine,</b> also have antiseptic properties. Acridine and related derivatives (such as amsacrine) bind to DNA and RNA {{due to their}} abilities to intercalate. Acridine orange (3,6-dimethylaminoacridine) is a nucleic acid-selective metachromatic stain useful for cell cycle determination.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order for}} an {{intercalator}} to fit between base pairs, the DNA must dynamically open a space between its base pairs by unwinding. The degree of unwinding {{varies depending on}} the intercalator; for example, ethidium cation (the ionic form of ethidium bromide found in aqueous solution) unwinds DNA by about 26°, whereas <b>proflavine</b> unwinds it by about 17°. This unwinding causes the base pairs to separate, or [...] "rise", creating an opening of about 0.34 nm (3.4 Å). This unwinding induces local structural changes to the DNA strand, such as lengthening of the DNA strand or twisting of the base pairs. These structural modifications can lead to functional changes, often to the inhibition of transcription and replication and DNA repair processes, which makes intercalators potent mutagens. For this reason, DNA intercalators are often carcinogenic, such as the exo (but not the endo) 8,9 epoxide of aflatoxin B1, acridines such as <b>proflavine</b> or quinacrine, or ethidium bromide.|$|E
5000|$|While native pillarnarenes display no {{solubility}} in water, and {{are therefore}} unsuitable for biomedical applications, a range of water-soluble pillarnarenes have been reported. In particular, water-soluble carboxylated-pillarnarenes (where n = 6 or 7) have already shown potential in both drug delivery and bio-diagnostics because they are highly soluble, form host-guest complexes {{with a range of}} drug and medicine-based compounds, and appear to be relatively non-toxic. The cavity of carboxylated-pillar5arene is too small to include most drug molecules and therefore is not useful in drug delivery. To form a host-guest complex with the pillarnarenes, the drug must have a cationic charge; its ability to hydrogen-bond with the pillarnarenes is less important. Two planar dye molecules, like <b>proflavine,</b> can be simultaneously encapsulated within the cavity of a single caboxylated-pillar7arene. Because encapsulation within the cavity of carboxylated-pillar6arene quenches the fluorescence of <b>proflavine,</b> this gives rise to [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off' states to the dye which may have application in bio-diagnostics.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that various organic {{compounds}} have the ability to target the Rev/RRE interaction. Neomycin B, diphenylfuran cation, and <b>proflavine</b> are small molecules that can prevent Rev from binding to the RRE sequence. [...] If Rev is incapable of binding to the RRE on the pre-mRNA, the RNA will not be exported to the cytoplasm, also resulting in lack of necessary structural proteins.|$|E
50|$|Acriflavine (INN: acriflavinium chloride) is {{a topical}} antiseptic. It has {{the form of}} an orange or brown powder. It may be harmful in the eyes or if inhaled. It is a dye and it stains the skin and may irritate. The {{hydrochloride}} form is more irritating than the neutral form.It is derived from acridine. Commercial preparations are often mixtures with <b>proflavine.</b> It is known by a variety of commercial names.|$|E
50|$|The planar {{structure}} of chemicals such as ethidium bromide and <b>proflavine</b> {{allows them to}} insert between bases in DNA. This insert causes the DNA's backbone to stretch and makes slippage in DNA during replication {{more likely to occur}} since the bonding between the strands is made less stable by the stretching. Forward slippage will result in deletion mutation, while reverse slippage will result in an insertion mutation. Also, the intercalation into DNA of anthracyclines such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin interferes with the functioning of the enzyme topoisomerase II, blocking replication as well as causing mitotic homologous recombination.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways {{molecules}} (in this case, also known as ligands) can interact with DNA. Ligands may interact with DNA by covalently binding, electrostatically binding, or intercalating. Intercalation occurs when ligands of an appropriate size and chemical nature fit themselves in between base pairs of DNA. These ligands are mostly polycyclic, aromatic, and planar, and therefore often make good nucleic acid stains. Intensively studied DNA intercalators include berberine, ethidium bromide, <b>proflavine,</b> daunomycin, doxorubicin, and thalidomide. DNA intercalators are used in chemotherapeutic treatment to inhibit DNA replication in rapidly growing cancer cells. Examples include doxorubicin (adriamycin) and daunorubicin (both of which are used in treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma), and dactinomycin (used in Wilm's tumour, Ewing's Sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma).|$|E
40|$|<b>Proflavine</b> {{inhibited}} the aerobic and anaerobic {{utilization of}} glucose by sensitive {{but not by}} resistant Escherichia coli. In resistant cells that had bound <b>proflavine,</b> glucose utilization was accompanied by release of the dye. After glucose was used up, the cells could again take up <b>proflavine.</b> If the amount of <b>proflavine</b> bound to sensitive cells was too low to inhibit glucose utilization, adding glucose to these cells caused them to release the dye. With higher <b>proflavine</b> concentrations, inhibitory to glucose utilization, the dye remained cell bound. Thus, metabolic energy causes the release of <b>proflavine</b> by both sensitive and resistant cells. In the former, energy production is inhibited by <b>proflavine,</b> and thus the dye prevents its own release. Chloramphenicol did not interfere with metabolically induced release of <b>proflavine</b> from resistant cells. Cyanide inhibited the glycerol-induced loss of <b>proflavine,</b> but not the glucose-induced loss. Azide and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone could prevent <b>proflavine</b> release without inhibiting glucose utilization...|$|E
40|$|Both Escherichia coli B and a proflavine-resistant mutant, E. coli B/Pr, took up {{the same}} amounts of <b>proflavine</b> when {{suspended}} in buffer containing the dye. In growth media, however, sensitive cells took up more <b>proflavine</b> than did resistant cells. Adding growth media or any one of several constituents of these media, including amino acids, glycerol, pyruvic acid, and metabolizable sugars, to resistant cells that had taken up <b>proflavine</b> in buffer caused them to lose the dye, but had less or no effect on sensitive cells. Certian salts caused an equal release of <b>proflavine</b> from resistant and sensitive cells. <b>Proflavine</b> released from resistant cells by glucose was not changed chemically. The effects of temperature and metabolic inhibitors suggest that <b>proflavine</b> uptake is a passive process but that its release may be an active one, dependent on metabolism. Glucose had more effect on the <b>proflavine</b> binding of E. coli B grown in a minimal medium than on that of cells grown in a complex medium. E. coli B was less susceptible to <b>proflavine</b> when growing in a minimal medium. The effects of other synthetic media on <b>proflavine</b> susceptibility of E. coli B were also studied. Deoxyribonucleic acid and envelopes from sensitive and resistant cells bound the same amounts of <b>proflavine,</b> and no difference {{was seen in the}} site of dye binding when sensitive and resistant cells that had taken up <b>proflavine</b> in buffer were sonically broken and fractionated. The results suggest that sensitive and resistant cells are equally permeable to <b>proflavine</b> but differ in the ease with which metabolites cause them to release bound <b>proflavine.</b> So far, however, these differences do not account completely for the ability of resistant cells to grow in high <b>proflavine</b> concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Cells of proflavine-sensitive and -resistant Escherichia coli strains were {{altered in}} {{different}} ways, and the <b>proflavine</b> binding of the changed material was studied. Spheroplasts prepared from sensitive and resistant cells bound similar amounts of <b>proflavine</b> at saturation, {{whether or not}} they were osmotically protected by 10 % sucrose. Intact cells bound approximately the same amounts of <b>proflavine</b> as spheroplasts. On addition of glucose, osmotically protected resistant but not sensitive spheroplasts released proflavine; unprotected spheroplasts did not release bound <b>proflavine.</b> Thus, osmotically protected membranes are not required for <b>proflavine</b> binding (a passive process) but are required for <b>proflavine</b> release (an active process). The presence of sucrose reduced <b>proflavine</b> binding by resistant cells. Adding glucose to cells in 20 % sucrose did not cause a release of residual <b>proflavine,</b> though glucose caused a release of <b>proflavine</b> from cells suspended in 0 or 10 % sucrose. On treatment of heated cells or ruptured spheroplasts with nucleases and Pronase, practically all nucleic acids were removed. Proflavine-binding ability of such preparations fell by only 30 to 50 %. Washing heated cells with ethanol did not reduce their proflavine-binding ability. There appear to be important binding sites in cells aside from nucleic acids...|$|E
40|$|<b>Proflavine</b> (3, 6 -diaminoacridine) binds {{strongly}} to transfer RNA (tRNA) from Escherichia coli. Direct evidence is obtained by ultracentrifugation, gel electrophoresis and molecular filtration of the complex. Studies on {{the stability of}} the tRNA-proflavine complex as a function of temperature show that strong binding depends on the secondary structure of the nucleic acid. <b>Proflavine</b> stabilizes the macromolecule against thermal denaturation. The results are comparable to those obtained with <b>proflavine</b> and DNA. The complexes of <b>proflavine</b> with tRNA and with DNA are probably of a similar nature. © 1968.

40|$|<b>Proflavine</b> {{formed a}} complex with {{transforming}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from Haemophilus influenzae, with optimal formation at {{a ratio of}} <b>proflavine</b> to DNA of 0. 06. The rate of dissociation of the complex by dialysis increased in the order: native, denatured, renatured DNA. The transforming activity of the DNA was reduced by its interaction with <b>proflavine.</b> This inactivation was dependent on the physical state of the DNA, the <b>proflavine</b> concentration, and the temperature. DNA that had been denatured and renatured was most sensitive; native DNA was much less sensitive. The inactivation remained after dialysis and was stable to prolonged storage. It is concluded that the inactivation of transforming DNA by <b>proflavine</b> takes place by a mechanism different from that of DNA-proflavine complex formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{purified}} <b>proflavine</b> and light exposure was assessed in rabbits whose eyes had been infected {{with one of}} two strains of herpesvirus. In comparing proflavine-light and placebo-light treatment, 0. 1 % <b>proflavine</b> administered twice daily for 5 days {{had a significant effect}} in suppressing herpetic eye disease, but 0. 05 % <b>proflavine</b> was less effective. In addition to being effective in infections with either virus strain, the 0. 1 % <b>proflavine</b> also suppressed intensity of corneal epithelial ulceration and stromal opacity in animals pretreated with subconjunctival corticosteroids to produce more severe disease. <b>Proflavine</b> or idoxuridine (IDU) alone or in combination showed no differences in suppressing herpetic ocular disease, but all were significantly more effective than placebo. Virus recovery rates were approximately the same from eyes treated with <b>proflavine,</b> IDU, or placebo, indicating that viral replication in the cornea and conjunctiva was not completely suppressed by either of the antiviral drugs alone or in combination...|$|E
40|$|<b>Proflavine</b> hemisulfate, an acridine-derived {{fluorescent}} dye, {{can be used}} as a rapid stain for cytologic {{examination of}} biological specimens. <b>Proflavine</b> fluorescently stains cell nuclei and cytoplasmic structures, owing to its small amphipathic structure and ability to intercalate DNA. In this manuscript, we demonstrated the use of <b>proflavine</b> as a rapid cytologic dye on a number of specimens, including normal exfoliated oral squamous cells, cultured human oral squamous carcinoma cells, and leukocytes derived from whole blood specimens using a custom-built, portable, LED-illuminated fluorescence microscope. No incubation time was needed after suspending cells in 0. 01 % (w/v) <b>proflavine</b> diluted in saline. Images of <b>proflavine</b> stained oral cells had clearly visible nuclei as well as granular cytoplasm, while stained leukocytes exhibited bright nuclei, and highlighted the multilobar nature of nuclei in neutrophils. We also demonstrated the utility of quantitative analysis of digital images of <b>proflavine</b> stained cells, which can be used to detect significant morphological differences between different cell types. <b>Proflavine</b> stained oral cells have well-defined nuclei and cell membranes which allowed for quantitative analysis of nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, as well as image texture analysis to extract quantitative image features...|$|E
40|$|The binding of the polyaromatic guest, 3, 6 -diaminoacridine (<b>Proflavine)</b> to cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) where n = 6, 7 and 8 {{has been}} studied by {{fluorescence}} spectrophotometry and binding constants determined using a least squares fitting method. Titration of CB[8] into a solution of <b>Proflavine</b> results in a 95 % decrease in fluorescence up to a CB[8] to <b>Proflavine</b> ratio of 2 : 1. From the induced fluorescence spectra a binding constant of 1. 9 times 107 M- 1 was determined. When <b>Proflavine</b> is titrated into a solution of CB[8] a similar binding constant is calculated (1. 3 times 107 M- 1). Titration of CB[6] into a solution of <b>Proflavine</b> yields a decrease in fluorescence of 18 - 20 %, but no binding is observed beyond what is seen within experimental error. Finally, titration of CB[7] into a solution of <b>Proflavine</b> results {{in an increase in}} fluorescence (32 %) and a blue-shift of the emission wavelength from 509 nm to 485 nm. From the induced fluorescence spectra a binding constant of 1. 65 times 107 M- 1 was determined. From 1 H NMR it appears that the decrease in fluorescence for <b>Proflavine</b> with CB[6] and CB[8] is due to collisional quenching, whereas the increase in fluorescence with CB[7] may be due to rotational restriction...|$|E

40|$|The complex formed {{between the}} mutagen <b>proflavine</b> and the dC-dC-dG-dG and dG-dG-dC-dC self-complementary {{tetranucleotide}} duplexes has been monitored by proton high resolution {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy in 0. 1 M phosphate solution at high nucleotide/drug ratios. The large upfield shifts (0. 5 to 0. 85 ppm) observed at all the <b>proflavine</b> ring nonexchangeable protons on complex formation are consistent with intercalation of the mutagen between base pairs of the tetranucleotide duplex. We have proposed an approximate overlap geometry between the <b>proflavine</b> ring and nearest neighbor base pairs at the intercalation site from a comparison between experimental shifts and those calculated for various stacking orientations. We have compared the binding of actinomycin D, propidium diiodide, and <b>proflavine</b> to self-complementary tetranucleotide sequences dC-dC-dG-dG and dG-dG-dC-dC by UV absorbance changes in the drug bands between 400 and 500 nm.

Actinomycin D binds more strongly than propidium diiodide and <b>proflavine</b> to dC-dG-dC-dG (contains dC-dG and dG-dC binding sites), indicative of the additional stabilization from hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the pentapeptide lactone rings of actinomycin D and the base pair edges and sugar-phosphate backbone of the tetranucleotide duplex...|$|E

40|$|Two {{synthetic}} pigment systems {{capable of}} enzymatically photoreducing NADP+ are described. One system contains proflavine; the other, acridine. The complete system consists of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), <b>proflavine</b> (or acridine), ferredoxin-NADP reductase (EC 1. 6. 99. 4), and NADP+. The two pigments initiate the photoreduction of NADP+ in different {{portions of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. <b>Proflavine</b> photosensitizes in the visible portion; acridine, in the ultraviolet.

40|$|The {{hormonal}} induction of glutamine synthetase (EC 6. 3. 1. 2) in embryonic neural retina {{tissue in}} vitro is blocked preferentially and reversibly by <b>proflavine</b> (3, 6 -diaminoacridine) {{in the absence}} of cell or DNA replication; cell viability is not affected, and the synthesis of total cellular proteins and RNA is only slightly reduced. In the induction of this enzyme, there is a rapid increase in the synthesis and accumulation of the enzyme selectively elicited by the steroid inducer; for this effect, transcription is essential. Radioimmunochemical measurements have shown that <b>proflavine</b> inhibits induction by prevention of de novo synthesis of catalytically active and immunologically reactive glutamine synthetase protein. It does not measurably affect the uptake of the steroid inducer by the retina cells. Since the translation of this enzyme by preformed RNA templates is not stopped by <b>proflavine,</b> the inhibitory effect of <b>proflavine</b> on induction is apparently due to interference with transcriptional or pretranslational processes required for the provision of active transcripts for enzyme synthesis.

After incubation of the reaction mixtures at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, some ethidium or <b>proflavine,</b> but no acridine, molecules are tightly bound to nucleic acids. Tight binding is defined by resistance to extraction with butanol, assayed by filtration at acid pH or by thin-layer chromatography at basic pH. In the ternary complexes, there is about one tightly bound ethidium (or <b>proflavine)</b> per platinum residue. At 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, tightly bound ethidium exchanges with free ethidium, whereas platinum residues do not exchange. The binding and the release of tightly bound ethidium are very slow (several hours). It is suggested that in the ternary complexes, nucleic acid-cis-Pt(NH 3) 2 -intercalating agent, a bidentate adduct (guanine-ethidium or -proflavine) -cis-Pt(NH 3) 2, is formed. No tightly bound ethidium or <b>proflavine</b> is found when cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) is replaced by trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II).

40|$|In {{isolated}} nucleoli from Tetrahymena thermophila, low {{concentrations of}} the intercalating agent <b>proflavine</b> inhibit both transcription termination and splicing of the rRNA precursor. <b>Proflavine</b> also exerts an in vivo {{effect on the}} process of transcription termination under conditions, where the growth rate is only slightly reduced. Thus, approximately 40 % of the rRNA precursor molecules, accumulated in nucleoli during 60 min of treatment with the drug, are longer than the normal 35 S rRNA precursor. R-Loop mapping of these longer precursor molecules isolated after 30 and 60 min of incubation demonstrates that the RNA polymerases have a 50 fold lower elongation rate in the spacer region than in the coding region. <b>Proflavine</b> in the given concentration is found to have no significant effect on the splicing of properly terminated precursor molecules. In contrast, none of the longer non-terminated molecules are found to be spliced.

All methods concur in showing that two modes of interaction are operative: intercalation and surface binding. The latter mode is favored by increasing ethanol and/or the <b>proflavine</b> content. Both static and kinetic experiments show that, concerning the poly(dG-dC) poly(dG-dC) /proflavine system, intercalation largely prevails up to 20 % EtOH. For higher EtOH levels surface binding becomes dominant. Concerning the poly(dA-dT) poly(dA-dT) /proflavine system, melting experiments show that addition of <b>proflavine</b> stabilizes the double stranded structure, {{but the effect}} is reduced {{in the presence of}} EtOH. The Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees values of the melting process, measured at different concentrations of added <b>proflavine,</b> are linearly correlated, revealing the presence of the enthalpy-entropy compensation phenomenon (EEC). The nonmonotctnicity of the "entropic term" of the EEC reveals the transition between the two binding modes. T-jump experiments show two relaxation effects, but {{at the highest levels of}} Etat (> 25 %) the kinetic curves become monophasic, confirming the prevalence of the surface complex. A branched mechanism is proposed where diffusion controlled formation of a precursor complex occurs in the early stage of the binding process.
