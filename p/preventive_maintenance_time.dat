40|$|A central tenet in {{the theory}} of {{reliability}} modelling is the quantification of the probability of asset failure. In general, reliability depends on asset age and the maintenance policy applied. Usually, failure and <b>maintenance</b> <b>times</b> are the primary inputs to reliability models. However, for many organisations, different aspects of these data are often recorded in different databases (e. g. work order notifications, event logs, condition monitoring data, and process control data). These recorded data cannot be interpreted individually, since they typically do not have all the information necessary to ascertain failure and <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>times.</b> This paper presents a methodology for the extraction of failure and <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>times</b> using commonly-available, real-world data sources. A text-mining approach is employed to extract keywords indicative of the source of the maintenance event. Using these keywords, a Naïve Bayes classifier is then applied to attribute each machine stoppage to one of two classes: failure or preventive. The accuracy of the algorithm is assessed and the classified failure time data are then presented. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated on a maintenance data set from an Australian electricity company...|$|R

40|$|Recent work in {{the field}} of {{competing}} risks enables us to start an assessment of the impact of preventive maintenance on the failure characteristics of a piece of equipment. Competing risk is the term given when more than one factor conspires to take a piece of equipment out of service. A simple example of this is given by preventive maintenance and failure. Each could occur to a piece of equipment but only one actually can. The <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> may censor the unobserved latent failure time, thus ensuring that the statistical analysis of the failure times is made more difficult. Maintenance optimization models require knowledge of the underlying failure distribution. The Kaplan-Meier estimator (and other similar techniques) is commonly used to remove the effect of the censoring variable on the estimate of the distribution of the variable of interest. When the censoring variable is preventative maintenance, however, it is most unlikely that the assumptions of the Kaplan-Meier estimator (independence between the latent failure and preventive maintenance times) are valid. In this paper we give an overview of some of the different methods which have recently emerged in this area. These make different assumptions about the relation between PM and failure to allow the PM censoring to be removed. Potentially, these methods would allow us to look at changing maintenance strategies. Although they are {{in the early stages of}} development they do already allow us to quantify the effect of some changes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractServicing {{is applied}} {{periodically}} in {{practice with the}} aim of restoring the system state and prolonging the lifetime. It is generally seen as an imperfect maintenance action which has a chief influence on the maintenance strategy. In order to model the maintenance effect of servicing, this study analyzes the deterioration characteristics of system under scheduled servicing. And then the deterioration model is established from the failure mechanism by compound Poisson process. On the basis of the system damage value and failure mechanism, the failure rate refresh factor is proposed to describe the maintenance effect of servicing. A maintenance strategy is developed which combines the benefits of scheduled servicing and preventive maintenance. Then the optimization model is given to determine the optimal servicing period and <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>time,</b> with an objective to minimize the system expected life-cycle cost per unit time and a constraint on system survival probability for the duration of mission time. Subject to mission time, it can control the ability of accomplishing the mission at any time so as to ensure the high dependability. An example of water pump rotor relating to scheduled servicing is introduced to illustrate the failure rate refresh factor and the proposed maintenance strategy. Compared with traditional methods, the numerical results show that the failure rate refresh factor can describe the maintenance effect of servicing more intuitively and objectively. It also demonstrates that this maintenance strategy can prolong the lifetime, reduce the total lifetime maintenance cost and guarantee the dependability of system...|$|E

Results reveal that components from gas turbines located in a heavy industrial environment at a higher distance from sea tend to have shorter lifetime.
