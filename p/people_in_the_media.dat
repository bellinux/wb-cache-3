500|$|With {{the number}} one draft pick {{described}} as a [...] "poisoned chalice" [...] by the Herald Sun journalist, Jon Anderson, Watts has been continually compared to the players who were drafted after him and who rivalled him for {{the number one}} pick, especially the number two pick, Nic Naitanui. The choice to choose Watts over Naitanui {{has been one of}} the most talked about draft decisions, with many deeming the decision to be incorrect, especially considering Naitanui's impact for West Coast which included earning All-Australian honours in just his fourth season. Daniel Rich at the time was also considered a potential first pick; with Rich winning the AFL Rising Star in his first year, the choice by Melbourne to recruit Watts was further questioned. Despite the comparisons to other players, many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> believe the label of [...] "number one draft pick" [...] placed too much unfair expectation on Watts, which he would never be able to live up to; some of these people include former player Nathan Brown, The Age journalists, Greg Baum and Brent Diamond, and former coaches, Mark Neeld and Paul Roos, who both said being the number one draft pick set him up to fail.|$|E

Will Thailand become a land of free speech and criticism if many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> who engage in criticism of others on a daily basis can't take criticism or accusations themselves?" [...] "As people continue to fight and call for democracy, equality and free speech, it's imperative they examine such values at a personal level and not be mistaken in thinking that the only struggle is an external one. Sometimes, I fear that it might be easier {{to get rid of the}} external and visible tyranny than the tyranny that exists invisibly deeply within us. And to make it more complicated, I think both external and internal tyranny are intertwined." ...|$|E

Jane Shilling of The Daily Telegraph labelled the series [...] "a triumph against TV's ageism" [...] in {{an examination of the}} portrayal of elderly <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media.</b> Shilling singled out Jacobi and Reid's performances, stating that they provide a [...] "mixture of gravity and levity" [...] that [...] "brings a transcendent quality to their characters' resolute ordinariness". Lucy Harmer, an executive member of the charity Age UK, also praised the series for portraying two [...] "normal, healthy and sane" [...] older characters, citing the depiction of Internet use by the elderly as something ordinary. She compared the treatment of older characters in the series to Hilary Boyd's novel Thursdays in the Park and the film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012). The Huffington Posts Caroline Frost thought the series was reminiscent of the dialogue and sensibility of the playwright Alan Bennett. She wrote the story was poignant and praised a central theme underlining [...] "how many people make do with their day-to-day business and responsibilities, while still holding on to their private dreams", Andrew Anthony of The Guardian had his [...] "low expectations... squarely confounded", giving particular praise to the dialogue and the central performances.

The series was reviewed favourably by the American website AfterEllen, which reports on the depiction of gay and bisexual women in the media. Correspondent Jill Guccini stated that she [...] "started off watching this series thinking it was a cute little show about some oldies falling in love", {{but at the end of}} the series believed it was [...] "some of the finest television I've seen, anywhere, ever".|$|E
2500|$|The 2014 {{marching band}} season was {{difficult}} for band members and staff alike, with an interim directing staff and the national spotlight being turned on the program in a negative light due {{to the release of}} a report by the University claiming a [...] "sexualized" [...] culture. Many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> questioned whether the 2014 band would be able to continue to impress audiences without the leadership of Jon Waters. The band took to the field in Baltimore for the season opener against the United States Naval Academy. This condensed show featured much more traditional military-band style symmetrical drill that emphasizes precision. The band also created an image of soldiers marching with a Civil War regimental flag. The band also played the Navy service song and formed a floating anchor, a formation first performed by the OSUMB in 1934, also at a game versus the Naval Academy in Baltimore. This show ended with a double Script Ohio. The show was well received by fans from both schools and was featured in national headlines for being the first performance of the band since the termination of their director. For the first home game of 2014, the band performed a tribute to classic television shows, including Dragnet, The Simpsons, The Addams Family, M*A*S*H, I Dream of Jeannie, The Office, Game of Thrones, Hawaii Five-O, The Brady Bunch, and The Lone Ranger. Drill selections included Bart Simpson on a skateboard, Thing waving to the audience, a helicopter blowing up a Michigan Block M, a costumed Jeannie appearing from her magic bottle, a surfer riding a wave, costumed Brady Bunch characters in their trademark squares, a fire-breathing dragon, and the Lone Ranger's horse Silver galloping across the field. This show instantly became a viral hit, making news across the country. The band titled the show [...] "TV Land, Too!" [...] and had a large banner with the TV Land network logo on the field. The TV Land network responded to the band by releasing a video thanking them for celebrating classic TV. Actor Tom Hanks also gave the band substantial credit via Facebook and Twitter for this show.|$|E
