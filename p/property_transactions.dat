25|$|Queensland was {{renowned for}} being the lowest taxed state in Australia for much of Bjelke-Petersen's tenure. Over heated {{objections}} by Treasurer Gordon Chalk, Bjelke-Petersen in 1977 announced the removal of state death duties, a move that cost his state $30 million in revenue. So many New South Wales and Victorian residents sought to establish their permanent address in Queensland as a result, boosting state coffers with stamp duty from <b>property</b> <b>transactions,</b> that other states followed suit within months and also abolished the tax. To help compensate for lost revenue, the government introduced football pools; four years later the government granted a casino licence on the Gold Coast, although this too was mired in allegations of corruption and favouritism.|$|E

25|$|During the {{judicial}} era Sardinia had some 300.000 inhabitants, of which {{slightly more than}} 1/3 were free. These were subjected {{to the authority of}} local curators (administrators), in turn subjected to the judge (who also administrated justice and was the commander of the army). The church was also powerful, and at this time it had completely abandoned the Eastern Rite. The late 11th-century arrival of Benedictine, Camaldolese and other monks from the Italian Mezzogiorno, Lombardy and Provence, especially the monasteries of Montecassino, Saint-Victor de Marseille and Vallombrosa, boosted the agriculture in a land which was extremely underdeveloped. The condaghes (catalogues, cartularies) of the monasteries, which record <b>property</b> <b>transactions,</b> are an important source {{for the study of the}} island and its language in the 11th and 12th centuries. Evidence from the condaghes of San Pietro di Silki, in Sassari, and Santa Maria di Bonarcado concerning the children of slaves has been adduced to show that differences in agricultural lifestyles between regions may affect the survival rate of females, hypothetically through increased infanticide of baby girls. The abbacy of Santa Maria di Bonarcado contained more central, upland regions where a pastoral economy dominated and women were less economically useful; among children in that region, sex ratios are highly skewed in favour of men. On the other hand, in the region of San Pietro di Silki, less pastoral, child sex ratios are not skewed abnormally.|$|E
25|$|Roger Corbet had {{two older}} brothers, Thomas and John, {{as well as}} a younger brother, John, and sisters, {{including}} Joan, who was possibly the eldest of the siblings. Roger and Joan's parents, Robert and Elizabeth Corbet, had been concerned to keep the family estates together in a time of short life-spans and tortuous succession that affected many landowning families. As the eldest son, Thomas, predeceased his parents, the initial target had been to prevent the estates going to Elizabeth, his daughter, who had married Sir John Ipstones, a quarrelsome and sometimes violent man who served twice as MP for Staffordshire. In the 1360s they initiated a complex series of <b>property</b> <b>transactions,</b> using the device of fine of lands, and intended to keep the bulk of the Corbet lands effectively in tail, favouring in particular Fulk and Roger. The provisions of these fines were contested by Ipstones and Elizabeth from the outset. However, after the death of Fulk in 1382, much worse followed. Some of the provisions were revealed as mutually-contradictory. Fulk's daughter and sole heiress, also Elizabeth, contested effective ownership of property that had been assigned for life, under a fine of 1363, to Joan and her first husband, Sir Robert Harley of Willey, who died around 1370, with the remainder to Fulk and the heirs of his body. These lands at Yockleton, Shelve, Wentnor and Caus Forest, were all on the western side of Shropshire, close to the Welsh border and Joan and Harley leased them for the remainder of their lives to Sir Fulk for a rent of £60 a year. However, in 1367, they levied a fine to ensure estates passed to Roger in the event of Fulk's death. As Joan was still alive when Sir Fulk died in 1382, his daughter, Elizabeth, had a reasonable expectation of continuing to lease the lands under the fine of 1363. Joan, however, intended the lands to go immediately to her younger brother, Roger, according to the fine of 1367. She had reiterated the position after Harley's death in a new fine in 1376, and this position was assumed by the inquisition post mortem following Sir Fulk's death. There was a series of legal claims and counter-claims, with the Crown intervening to try to secure an escheat while the young Elizabeth was still a minor. However, Roger emerged victorious in 1385.|$|E

Local property taxes (rates) are managed and collected by local authorities. Some goods and services carry a specific tax, referred to as an excise or a duty such as alcohol excise or gaming duty.

2500|$|On 15 June, Henderson's {{announcement}} {{that all but}} four of the 24 properties at the development sold in October for record prices had been cancelled was met by uproar. Henderson said that [...] "there was nothing untransparent", and that failure to complete was [...] "very standard" [...] in the industry, and the buyers' initial deposits had been forfeited. The company said the properties would be remarketed. The government has pledged {{to follow up on}} the transactions. Current regulations in force are not codified, and are {{in the form of a}} voluntary code of conduct agreed with the Property Developers' Association. The revelations, as well as on-going complaints that property sales lacked transparency and allegations of the government's collusion with officials, are putting the government under increasing pressure to enact legislation governing <b>property</b> <b>transactions</b> and render property sales practices more transparent, at the risk of angering at the city's powerful developers. The only four flats to complete were on the 30th and 31st floors, and had sold for between only HK$37,800 and HK$40,900 a square foot–less than half of the 'record. Combined with the fact that the cancelled deals were all transacted through BVI shell companies, like the law firm which handled the conveyancing, cast suspicion that they were bogus; Lee maintained they were genuine and was prepared to wager 100:1 should the deals be proven false. The Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors said the sale cancellation had done [...] "serious damage to the developer's image and integrity"; legislators from across the political spectrum called for an investigation and further action to deal with market abuses.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} duress and actual undue influence, where illegitimate {{pressure}} is applied, or presumed undue influence which {{depends on a}} relationship of trust and confidence being abused, further cases allow a vulnerable person to avoid an agreement merely {{on the basis that}} they were vulnerable and exploited. In The Medina the Court of Appeal found that a group of pilgrims shipwrecked on a rock in the Red Sea did not need to pay £4000 they promised to a rescue ship, because the [...] "rescuers" [...] had exploited the pilgrims vulnerable position. To prevent unjust enrichment, the Court substituted an award of £1800. Similarly, in Cresswell v Potter, Ms Cresswell conveyed her ex-husband her share of their joint property in return for release from mortgage repayments, later making him £1400 profit. Because Potter took advantage of Ms Creswell's ignorance of <b>property</b> <b>transactions,</b> Megarry J held the agreement was voidable. One potential exception to this pattern, and now very heavily restricted, is the defence of [...] "non est factum", which originally applied in favour of illiterate people in the 19th century allowed a person to have a signed contract declared void if it is radically different from what was envisaged. In Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy, Lord Denning MR proposed it was time that all cases be placed into one unified doctrine of [...] "inequality of bargaining power". This would have allowed escape from an agreement if without independent advice one person's ability to bargain for better terms had been heavily impaired, and would have essentially given courts broader scope to change contracts to the advantage of weaker parties. The idea of a general unified doctrine was disapproved by some members of the House of Lords from 1979. However, specific legislation, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, or the Employment Rights Act 1996 creates targeted rights for contracting parties who lack bargaining power, in the same way specific legislation circumscribes a duty of [...] and good faith. Thus, just as there is no unified theory of bargaining power, a unified doctrine of freedom of contract was dismantled long ago where the parties are not making commercial deals in the course of business.|$|E
