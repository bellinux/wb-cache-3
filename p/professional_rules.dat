25|$|For many years, the Hula Bowl was {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} event, the Senior Bowl, by playing by collegiate rules rather than <b>professional</b> <b>rules,</b> and by being amateur, which at one point was very important for those wishing to remain eligible to compete in collegiate or other amateur sports. Hula Bowl was a trademarked institution of the Downtown Athletic Club, of Heisman Trophy fame.|$|E
25|$|Trained gladiators were {{expected}} to observe <b>professional</b> <b>rules</b> of combat. Most matches employed a senior referee (summa rudis) and an assistant, shown in mosaics with long staffs (rudes) to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match. Referees were usually retired gladiators whose decisions, judgement and discretion were, for the most part, respected; they could stop bouts entirely, or pause them to allow the combatants rest, refreshment and a rub-down. By common custom, the spectators decided {{whether or not a}} losing gladiator should be spared, and chose the winner in the rare event of a standing tie.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest known codified {{law is the}} Code of Hammurabi, {{dating back}} to about 1754 BC. The preface {{directly}} credits the laws to the code of hammurabi [...] of Ur. In {{different parts of the}} world, law could be established by philosophers or religion. In the modern world, laws are typically created and enforced by governments. [...] These codified laws may coexist with or contradict other forms of social control, such as religious proscriptions, <b>professional</b> <b>rules</b> and ethics, or the cultural mores and customs of a society.|$|E

2500|$|The week-long {{practice}} that precedes {{the game is}} attended by key NFL personnel (including coaches, general managers and scouts), who oversee the players as possible prospects for pro football. At one point the Senior Bowl was the first chance its participants had to openly receive pay for participation in an athletic event. This was one reason that participation was limited to seniors whose eligibility for further participation in collegiate football had expired, and the game was also their first exposure to the slightly different <b>professional</b> <b>rules.</b> Players who wished to participate in collegiate spring sports had to avoid participation in the Senior Bowl. The significance {{of all of this}} has waned in recent years as there has been some lessening of the former strict separation of professional and amateur athletes. Athletes sometimes decline invitations to participate in the Senior Bowl, opting instead to prepare for the NFL scouting combine or their colleges' pro day. In 2013, two players (D. J. Fluker and Justin Pugh) with a year of college football eligibility remaining, but who had already graduated, became the first [...] "fourth-year juniors" [...] to be granted clearance to play in the Senior Bowl.|$|E
2500|$|Slice {{made his}} MMA debut against Mercer at Cage Fury Fighting Championships 5, in Atlantic City on June 23, 2007. The match was {{scheduled}} as a three-round exhibition utilizing all <b>professional</b> <b>rules</b> of MMA combat. Slice defeated Mercer with a guillotine choke at 1:12 {{into the first}} round. CFFC V sold 20,000 ppv buys In a post-fight interview, Slice stated {{that he would like}} to fight David [...] "Tank" [...] Abbott. Abbott, who was a spectator, stood up from his seat and accepted the call out. One of the matchmakers for CFFC asked Slice for his assurance so that an October 12 bout at Cage Fury Fighting Championships 6 between Slice and [...] "Tank" [...] Abbott could be organized. This event was later canceled due to a promotion dispute. On October 11, 2007, ProElite announced that they had signed Slice to a deal and that he would make his debut on the November 10, 2007 EliteXC. He was originally set to make his professional MMA debut against Mike Bourke, a reformed street fighter, but a shoulder injury from Bourke led him to face Bo Cantrell. Slice defeated Cantrell 19 seconds into the first round by submission due to strikes.|$|E

5000|$|Legal <b>professional</b> <b>rules</b> {{have tended}} to adopt the broad view {{of the scope of}} duty {{recognised}} in contract law. The obligation to retain information in confidence, according to the <b>professional</b> <b>rules</b> in Australian jurisdictions is premised on its connection with the legal retainer rather than the source of the information. Hence, the <b>professional</b> <b>rules</b> seem to imply that information gained in connection with the legal retainer is deemed confidential. However, though the rules emphasise the importance of the duty of confidentiality, this is not a hard rule. Not all information connected with the retainer meets the legal test of confidentiality. The duty of confidence applies to [...] "any information, which is confidential to a client and acquired by a practitioner or a practitioner's firm during the client's engagement." [...] For barristers, it is [...] "confidential information obtained by a barrister concerning any person." ...|$|E
