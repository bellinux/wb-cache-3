5|$|Initially Los Alamos was to {{have been}} a {{military}} laboratory with Oppenheimer and other researchers commissioned into the Army. Oppenheimer {{went so far as to}} order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform, but two key physicists, Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California. Financial and <b>procurement</b> <b>activities</b> were the responsibility of the University of California under a 1 January 1943 letter of intent from the OSRD. This was superseded by a formal contract with the Manhattan District on 20 April 1943, which was backdated to 1 January. Financial operations were directed by the resident business officer, J. A. D. Muncy. The intent was that it would be militarized when the time came to finally assemble the bomb, but by this time the Los Alamos Laboratory had grown so large that this was considered both impractical and unnecessary, as the anticipated difficulties regarding civilians working on dangerous tasks had not occurred.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is a {{controversy}} {{on the possibility}} to increase the organ donor pool by donation-after-circulatory-death (DCD) and the possible decrease in donation-after-brain-death (DBD) by DCD programs. Our aim is to report the DCD experience at the University Hospital of Liege, Belgium, from 2002 through 2012, in a donor region of about 1 million inhabitants. Methods: The prospective organ donor and recipient databases were retrospectively reviewed. Results: 94 and 331 procurements were performed from controlled DCD and DBD donors in the time period, respectively. DCD donors contributed to 22. 1 % of the deceased donor (DD) organ <b>procurement</b> <b>activity</b> from Jan 2002 to Dec 2012, and up to one-third annually since 2009. DCD liver and kidneys contributed 23. 7 % and 24. 2 % of the DD liver and kidney transplantation activity, respectively. There was no decrease of the DBD procurement in the study period. In 2012, overall 54 DD were procured in the Liege region, reaching a high <b>procurement</b> <b>activity.</b> Conclusions: Controlled DCD donors are a valuable source of transplantable liver and kidney grafts, and in our experience do not adversely affect DBD organ <b>procurement</b> <b>activity.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the technological}} learning and innovation benefits derived from CERN's <b>procurement</b> <b>activity</b> {{during the period}} 1997 - 2001. The base population of our study, the technology-intensive suppliers to CERN, consisted of 629 companies out of 6806 companies during the same period, representing 1197 MCHF in procurement. The main findings from the study can be summarized as follows: the various learning and innovation benefits (e. g., technological learning, organizational capability development, market learning) tend to occur together. Learning and innovation benefits appear to be regulated {{by the quality of}} the supplier's relationship with CERN: the greater the amount of social capital built into the relationship, the greater the learning and innovation benefits. Regardless of relationship quality, virtually all suppliers derived significant marketing reference benefits from CERN. Many corollary benefits are associated with <b>procurement</b> <b>activity.</b> As an example, as many as 38 % of the respondents developed new products or services {{as a direct result of}} the supplier project; 13 % started new R&D units; 14 % started new business units; 17 % opened a new market; 42 % increased their international exposure; and 44 % indicated significant technological learning. The study also demonstrates the importance of technologically challenging projects for CERN itself, as technologically demanding projects were associated with a high level of knowledge acquisition and motivation among CERN staff. The study concludes by presenting tangible recommendations and suggestions on how CERN could further advance the corollary technological benefits associated with its <b>procurement</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} explore its many complexities, {{scholars}} {{have called for}} a move beyond, descriptions of sustainable procurement. This study responds by seeking insights into sustainable procurement through the lens of social capital theory. Social capital is conceptualized as comprising cognitive, social and relational elements. Sustainable procurement is seen as a means of pursuing environmental, economic and social goals through the purchasing and supply process. The study, proposes and empirically tests the operational measures of social capital and their relationship with, sustainable <b>procurement</b> <b>activity</b> on a sample of 135 procurement professionals in organizations, providing social housing. The results indicate partial support for the study proposition; structural, social capital, rather than structural, social and relational taken together, is found to be the most robust predictor of sustainable procurement. The results highlight the importance of broadening, collaboration models for sustainable procurement beyond an exclusive focus on dyadic relations. It, also demonstrates that this broader engagement with other stakeholders focused on knowledge creation, as well as knowledge sharing, is a significant contributor to sustainable <b>procurement</b> <b>activity.</b> © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzed}} truckload shipment transactions from 2006 to 2008 {{in order}} to compare planned <b>procurement</b> <b>activity</b> to actual <b>procurement</b> <b>activity.</b> The research specifically focused on three costs: Primary, Actual and Market. Primary cost is the cost agreed to pay to the primary carrier and is usually contractually fixed in advance. The actual cost is the cost paid to the carrier that hauls the load and the market cost is the average cost for the lane that a shipper should pay. This market cost is a benchmarking cost available to the shippers. The comparison of planned and actual {{is important because it}} helps to develop a strategy that decreases transportation costs by identifying overpaid lanes and carriers and it helps to monitor and make corrective decisions. The research suggests that the matching of planning and execution occurred in less than 10 % of the lanes and there are under and overpaid lanes. The execution rendered more than 50 % of overpaid lanes and the planning showed a commitment to overpay in 45 % or more of lanes. Finally this research proposes ideas to improve the truckload procurement strategy because shippers cannot afford to "plan to waste". by Carlos Gustavo Castro Izaguirre. Thesis (M.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} public <b>procurement</b> <b>activity</b> within the Cumbria County Council and its effects on the local supply chain. The paper seeks to identify the role of public procurement within the county, in relation to the propensity for income retention (or leakage) at local level. In addition, the paper seeks to consider issues related to public procurement in peripheral and rural areas, with particular reference to small and medium businesses operating in Cumbria, and to provide a spatial analysis of money flows at regional and national level. Design/methodology/approach – Quantitative data, from primary and secondary sources, were obtained from a survey questionnaire conducted among the Council's suppliers and from SpikesCavell, an agency specializing in collecting procurement data, respectively. The study focuses on public sector suppliers. It analyses suppliers' attributes and characteristics such as size, location and sector of activity are used in order to explore suppliers' patterns of spend in relation to inward and outward cash‐flows within the County. Additionally, the paper explores the effects of the local authority's procurement in terms of advantages/disadvantages for the local supply chain. Findings – The paper highlights the ability of competitive tendering systems to achieve cash saving and reduce wastage; but questions whether the adoption of such systems in the public sector produces positive economic effects on the local supply chain in peripheral and remote areas. Originality/value – There is a lack of research on the impact of public procurement at regional and sub‐regional level and its significance as a source of income and businesses operating within local supply chains.
