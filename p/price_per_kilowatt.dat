40|$|Nonutility Generators (NUGs) are {{providing}} an increasing percentage of new electric generating {{capacity in the}} United States. Some NUG generating plants are built by users primarily for their own energy needs while others are built specifically to sell power, usually to rate-regulated utilities, under long-term power sales contracts.

30|$|By {{contrast}} electric-driven {{systems are}} able to compete economically with the hydropower-driven system of Bribin. Here, investment costs distinctly lower than the ones related to the “Bribin system” are associated with costs for electric energy, which sum up to approx. 90.000 € (exemplary calculations based on the electricity rate of October 2015 and on a mean annual supply rate of 42  l/s). The profitability of this alternative, however, firstly depends on the connectability of the plant to an existing power grid, which {{would not be the}} case for the Bribin site (so actually additional costs would occur). Secondly the profitability depends on the price trend for electricity, since this source of energy is currently significantly subsidized by the Indonesian government. Indeed, referring to today’s electricity rate the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> hour is assumed to increase by approx. 25  % until 2019, since starting {{at this point in time}} the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) will define the electricity rate solely market-based (IISD 2014; PLN 2014). The O&M-related costs of the hydropower-driven “Bribin system”, however, show hardly any sensitivity to the mean supply discharge, whereby the plant’s profitability can easily and sustainably be increased.|$|E

30|$|Consumer {{demand for}} large {{capacity}} batteries is dramatically increasing given {{the expansion of}} the electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid EV industries, thereby driving development and competition in the battery industry. Battery performance, such as specific capacity, continues to improve, whereas the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> rapidly decreases. However, large-scale unplanned charging of EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs may cause a large and intermittent load on the existing power grid. This unpredictable load can seriously affect power grid stability [9, 10]. Reference [11] proposed to effectively handle the prediction of wind power error using the energy storage battery, which built a “source-grid coordination” method using energy storage devices to reduce both wind power dispatching risk and wind curtailment; these researchers also evaluated the feasibility of improving acceptable wind power system scale for the proposed scheme in different probability intervals. However, this method is only used for the wind curtailment phenomenon caused by wind speed forecast error, and is not applicable to the situation caused by insufficient capacity of the transmission line. A method, in which EV accepts global operational regulation of the power grid, is proposed to cooperate with renewable energy power generation on the basis of vehicle-to-grid. However, this method currently requires a highly intelligent power grid [12, 13, 14].|$|E
40|$|Smart Grid (SG) {{achieves}} bidirectional {{energy and}} information flow between the energy user and the utility grid, allowing energy users {{not only to}} consume energy, but also to generate the energy and share with the utility grid or with other energy consumers. This type of energy user who consumes energy and who also can generate the energy is called the “prosumer”. The sustainability of the SG energy sharing process heavily depends on its participating prosumers, making prosumer participation and management schemes crucial within the energy sharing approaches. The contribution {{of this article is}} twofold. First, this article introduces a novel concept of participating and managing the prosumers in the SG energy sharing process in the form of virtual communities, which involves with computation, software, data access, and storage services that do not need end-prosumer knowledge of the physical location and system configuration. Here, the community of prosumers can collectively increase the amount of power to be auctioned or bought offering higher bargaining power, thereby settling for a higher <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> in long-term. The initial step to build an effective prosumer-community is the identification of those prosumers who would be suitable to make efficient prosumer communities. This leads the necessity of identifying parameters that influence the energy sharing behaviours of prosumers. The second contribution of this article is that, this comprehensively analyses the different parameters influencing the prosumer’s energy sharing behaviours and thus presents multi-agent architecture for optimal prosumer-community formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{geothermal}} user's viewpoint in {{this case}} is somewhat unique. San Diego Gas & Electric Company, by virtue of its activity in geothermal exploration and development since 1972, {{is in a position to}} be considered not only a user of geothermal, but a producer as well through the activities of its wholly-owned subsidiary, New Albion Resources Co. As the Supervisor of Fuel Development of SDG&E and the General Manager of NARCO, I can speak from experience on both sides of the negotiating table. I have given advice from the user's point of view to SDG&E's fuel acquisitions people as they labored to negotiate a contract to buy from a geothermal producer of hot water. As General Manager of NARCO, I am in the position of developing geothermal resources and negotiating contracts to sell some of NARCO's heat to third parties. So much for the introduction [...] How does a utility, such as SDG&E, view risk in today's business climate? The answer to that question is very simple. SDG&E has an allowed rate of return of 10. 59 %. This is based upon 48 % debt, having an imbedded interest cost of 8. 1 %; 14 % preferred stock, at a cost of 8. 2 % and 42 % equity. Out rates are supposed to return 14 - 112 % on this equity. Let me put these numbers in perspective. In early March SDG&E sold $ 50 million of mortgage bonds which bear an interest rate of 16 %. In mid-March we sold 2 - 112 million shares of common stock for $ 11. 50 per share. The current dividend of $ 1. 52 will yield 13. 2 % and those dividends are paid after taxes. When money borrowed to build a project costs more than you can earn on the project, there is no incentive to build that project and certainly no incentive to take any risk associated with the project. How does SDG&E view risks? Simple [...] don't take any risks which can be avoided. Is this attitude likely to change? My forecast is, there is no change in sight. Does this take SDG&E out of contention as a possible market for producers of geothermal energy? Not likely. For all of its risk aversion, SDG&E still remains one of the best potential markets for any energy producer. A recent article in FORBES MAGAZINE found that SDG&E had the third highest <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> of any utility in the country [...] 5. 9 {cents} per kilowatt hour for commercial customers. That was in March, 1980. Energy cost adjustment clause increases resulted in an average commercial <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> hour of 7. 2 {cents} in May. In July it is expected to climb to 9. 2 {cents}. SDG&E's rate territory continues to expand at the rate of 5 % annually and it is located just over 100 miles from a major source of geothermal heat in the Imperial Valley. But today, SDG&E has no commercial geothermal heat or power purchase contracts with domestic producers. You may ask, ''Why not?'' With no incentive to spend its own money and with a high growth rate, what is SDG&E doing to obtain capacity for its existing and future customers? At the present time, most of SDG&E's capital expenditure for generation is going to the construction of San Onofre Units 2 and 3, a nuclear project which has been under way for ten years and which is expected to start generating commercial power in 1982 and 1983. San Onofre 2 and 3 will add 440 MW of capacity from a reliable, proven generating technology to SDG&E's system...|$|E

40|$|The cost {{of doing}} {{business}} in Nebraska influences many Nebraska proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations operating throughout the economy. Four times a year, the Bureau of Business Research surveys Nebraska businesses about factors that influence the {{cost of doing}} business in the state. This report presents the results of a survey sent to 500 Nebraska businesses during July and August of 2005. The survey presents businesses with a list of 19 cost factors ranging from market-driven matters (such as the cost of supplies and raw materials, labor costs, or utility costs) to factors more directly tied to federal, state, and local policies (such as taxes and regulation). Respondents are asked to select their five top priorities for reducing the {{cost of doing business}} in the state. Responses are aggregated to determine which business cost factors appear most frequently among the top priorities of Nebraska businesses. In this report, findings regarding business priorities are reported for the current survey. In addition, data from the current survey are combined with data from the previous survey (the first survey of this kind was conducted in February and March 2005) to generate a large enough sample to report priorities in three industry groupings: manufacturing, retail, and services. When a third and a fourth survey are conducted in the next six months, it will be possible to report priorities in additional industries and by region of the state. Survey results, as always, should be viewed in context. Policy-makers should consider many other factors along with the priorities of businesses when making decisions. Another key point is that the survey asks businesses about their top priorities for reducing costs. A finding that a cost factor is a priority for business does not necessarily mean that this cost is higher in Nebraska than in other states. For example, businesses may choose reducing energy costs as a priority for Nebraska, even though some energy costs are low in Nebraska relative to the nation. The average <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> hour for electricity was 5. 66 cents for Nebraska in March 2005 and 7. 52 cents for the nation. Policy-makers, therefore, may want to focus on business priorities whether or not Nebraska is a leader or a laggard on those priorities. There may be as much gain from further expanding the state’s advantage on certain cost factors as in addressing an area of disadvantage...|$|E
40|$|Lets say {{you knew}} {{someone who would}} buy a whole pizza when {{they were a little}} bit hungry, left their sink running when they weren’t using it, maxed out their A/C in their house when they were on vacation, and always kept their stove on just in case they wanted to cook something. You would {{probably}} see this as horribly wasteful, and a terrible drain of money. But every time we pay our power bill, our prices assume we share these wasteful habits. The rate that we pay per kilowatt hour assumes customers are eating the whole pizza, even though most of us may only eat a slice or two. But this type of pricing seems justifiable; as we are paying for a system that is always at the ready, and can provide us a “whole pizza” of electricity if needed, such as a boiling hot day in late July when we are running the A/C full blast for the whole day. But there are many other industries that have handled varying levels of customer usage stress without ramping up prices for the whole customer base. For example, we pay different prices depending on our internet speeds, how much mobile data we use, and how much water we irrigate our lawns with. And back in the day (only about a decade or two ago) when phone call minutes were scarce, many plans didn’t count it against us when we made our calls during off-peak hours. Both LES and OPPD have payment plans that charge flat rates regardless of the time that we flip our lights on, charging prices that make sure a grid is ready for peak electrical usage at all times. And the more that you use, the lower your price/kilowatt hour. So the more that you use, the lower your price/kilowatt hour goes. This philosophy may work for buying things in bulk, or buying the large popcorn instead of the medium because it’s only a $ 1 more, {{but when it comes to}} electricity, we need to reward conservative usage. However, our water bill accelerates in price the more we use, starting off at $ 1. 34 per unit (100 cubic feet, or 748 gallons) for the first 8 units, jumps up to $ 1. 91 /unit for the next 15 units, and then $ 2. 96 /unit for all units above this amount. When the price increases the more we use, it convinces us to keep our usage low. Below are a few graphs, illustrating how you get more “bang for your buck” the more electricity you use with LES, but water pricing has the opposite trend. Why can’t our electric utility pricing adopt a little bit of the same philosophy? In this age, we can easily predict when our power grid will be under the most stress, and the times of the day that people use the most power. To lower the peak usage (AKA the whole pizza price) we could vary electricity prices throughout the day, raising them during midday peak power times, and lowering them during power usage lulls overnight. We also could take a page from the water utilities book and increase prices for exorbitant usage, but lower base rates to encourage not only off-peak usage, but conservative usage. With this method, people will be rewarded for drying their clothes at night, and for keeping lights off during the day. With a consistently lowered peak power usage, our electrical grid, and our wallets, can rest a little easier knowing that it doesn’t need to keep dozens of coal fired power plants on standby just in case we decide to use power. Our energy providers can also use their profits to steadily introduce more green energy producers, and stabilize the market with low risk, low pollutant power. A consistent power usage throughout the day means we can rely on more green energy sources like nuclear, solar and wind, as they can be used in combination to provide steady energy 24 / 7. With varying usage, our grid has to rely on the use of dirtier fuel methods that can be quickly ramped up to handle peaks of power. It’s time that we pay attention to our <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> in the same way we pay attention to our gas prices, data remaining, minutes spent, messages sent and gallons drained. By rewarding customers for destressing the grid, we can efficiently shrink the size of our grid overall. Instead of buying a whole pizza, we should buy the slices we need...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{established}} to examine current viable opportunities {{for the expansion of}} the wood products industry in Clallam and Jefferson counties. The study updated existing and future harvest level projections in Clallam and Jefferson counties, highlighting the potential new supplies. It also examined precommercial thinning volumes on state and federal lands. The harvest level findings are used to complete an analysis including the flow, species and size of the raw material supply required to manufacture value-added products. Three opportunities are explored: Oriented strand board production utilizing harvest and current manufacturing waste material, biomass-based energy production, and second tier value-added products from production of random length alder. We projected harvest levels using timber harvest data by grade and species provided by the Department of Revenue Timber Tax Division and the Department of Natural Resources Marketing Division. These data provided a breakout of average volumes per acre by species and grade observed for timber sales in 2004. We applied the average volumes per acre to a projection of harvest acres constructed by Atterbury Consultants and published in their report for the council dated 2000. The analysis of the sales data indicated an average volume of nearly 40 thousand board feet (mbf) per acre. The majority of this volume is in # 2 and # 3 sawmill logs; over 15 mbf in each log class. The next highest volume is in the # 4 sawmill log with 7. 5 mbf. The greatest volume per acre is in western hemlock with over 15 mbf, followed by Douglas fir with 8. 8 mbf. An estimated 8, 070 acres are harvested annually during the projection period 2000 to 2004. Using the per acre averages calculated above we determined annual harvest levels to reach 322, 265 mbf during this period. For the period 2015 to 2020, harvest acres are projected to reach 8, 618 with an estimated annual harvest level of 344, 148 mbf. The majority of the annual harvest level during the period 2000 - 2004 is in # 2 and # 3 sawmill logs, over 300, 000 mbf equally distributed. Western hemlock annual harvest levels are 124, 236 mbf, followed by Douglas fir with 71, 293 mbf. Red alder annual harvests are estimated at 22, 849 mbf during the period 2000 to 2004. Timber consumed by local mills amounted to 122, 033 mbf for 2002, with an estimated slightly higher consumption for 2004. Total consumption of Clallam and Jefferson county timber by Washington sawmills reached nearly 230, 000 mbf in 2002. Over 90, 000 mbf of timber is exported to mills located in other Washington counties. The majority of this timber flow, about 77, 000 mbf went across the Puget Sound to Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, King and Pierce county mills. The annual volume of precommercial thinning is estimated at 125, 000 to 180, 000 green tons from federal and state lands. The majority of this thinned material is on State lands involving 4, 000 to 6, 000 acres annually for the next decade. The majority of the thinning volume is not commercial due to restrictions imposed by terrain conditions that lead to prohibitive harvesting and extraction costs. Oriented Strand Board (OSB) represents a product that utilizes low grade materials to produce a substitute for plywood. First generation OSB manufacturing plants were about 50 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis in size. Newer generation plants (continuous flow) are much larger in size; the latest plant capable of producing 800 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis. The majority of new plants have a capacity of 500 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis. Resource availability converting the volume of # 4 sawmill and utility grade logs into chip materials was estimated at 492, 000 green tons, or about enough material to produce 313 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis of OSB. At most the projections reached 335 million square feet by 2020. Since the volume of required materials is much smaller than what a competitive new facility would consume, the potential for a new OSB plant in the region was determined early on during the study to be non-existent. Other limitations were also evident including the lack of sufficient hardwood resources, and the fact that current uses of chip materials and lower-sized saw logs would decrease the availability of raw materials to the new plant. Biomass-based energy can be produced by burning wood waste. To evaluate this option we first determined the fuel value of materials in the region. If a sufficient fuel value was present, we then estimated the competitiveness of the material for use in energy production. To determine the fuel value of the materials in the region we estimated the size of a potential power plant by converting the volume of # 4 saw mill and utility logs into green tons. This conversion indicated that the power plant sizes could ranged from 37 to 45 megawatts, representing substantial amounts of energy production. We then calculated the competitiveness aspects of the material if it were used to produce energy. Plants of these sizes in Vermont purchased chips at a price that ranges from $ 12 to $ 21 per green ton, a price that is substantially lower than current chip prices paid by local pulp mills, and lower than estimated harvesting and delivery costs (about $ 35 per dry ton). In addition the low <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> hour (about $ 0. 03) acts as a disincentive to utilize woody biomass as an energy source. These calculations indicate that wood as an energy source is uncompetitive with current energy pricing. Also, harvesting and delivery costs are still too high for woody biomass to be viable, even if supply is not a constraining factor. The utilization of red alder has increased dramatically, and the projected start of a new alder mill in 2006 suggested analyzing potential value-added products such as cabinetry, furniture and door manufacturing. We conducted interviews with the new mill manager and regional end-users of alder and determined constraints associated with attracting a value-added facility to the region. The constraints identified during these interviews included the inability to diversify products should a new manufacturing plant focus exclusively on alder. Various wood species are used in cabinetry, door and furniture manufacture. Currently alder is well received, but demand is highly responsive to changes in consumer preferences. Diversification of various species is perceived to be an important aspect of a successful end-user. The success of a value-added manufacturer will depend on its ability to utilize various sources of lumber and other materials. Our study findings included the following. The two county region is a net exporter of wood fiber. The recent announcement of plans for a new sawmill in the Everett area suggests that wood fiber from the area will continue to have demand outside of the region. Less than half of the volume harvested is utilized locally by saw mills, even with the projected new mill in Port Angeles. Biomass-based energy has the potential supply, but costs for woody biomass as an energy alternative are too high and energy prices are too low for it to be competitive. Other fiber using industries, such as OSB, would require more fiber than is available. Finally, an alder value-added manufacturing plant would require diversification for it to be successful. We recommend that future work analyze the potential for expanding the existing softwood lumber sawmill capacity in the region. The volume of sawmill logs that are exported from the area is estimated at less than 100, 000 mbf and is insufficient for a modern large mill, which can be twice as big. Expanding the sawmilling capacity of the existing mills may provide benefits for the local region and enhance their competitiveness with mills outside of the region that currently successfully bid for local timber. The announced plans for a new mill in the Everett area suggests an evaluation of timber values for the region and its competitiveness. An analysis currently underway to examine these values should be consulted when completed. While woody biomass is currently too costly, options should be explored for promoting “green energy” options. Finally, since the region is an excess supplier of timber, it should promote its position in order to attract potentially new manufacturing that can consume underutilized resources and compliment the existing milling infrastructure in the area...|$|E

While nuclear power in the US costs a little over 10 cents <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> hour, Iran, with domestic uranium enrichment capabilities, high interest rates, low energy output (a single 1,000-watt reactor), low efficiency, extremely slow reactor construction, and no reprocessing pays around 68 cents <b>per</b> <b>kilowatt</b> hour (this assumes a <b>price</b> of $140 <b>per</b> separative working unit and of $40 per kilogram of uranium).|$|R
