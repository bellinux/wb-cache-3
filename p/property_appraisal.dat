50|$|Land {{flipping}} - A land flipping {{scheme is}} one where a person or company inflates {{the value of a}} piece of property to make more money. For example, the Phoenix New Times reported a case wherein an individual wanted to sell a US$1.9M (million) piece of asbestos-contaminated property to the BFA for US$1 as a tax write off. The BFA was not interested in making this purchase. Instead, they referred the individual to former BFA Director, Jalma Hunsinger, who then purchased the property for US$1. Hunsinger subsequently used the property as collateral to obtain a US$6.8M loan from the BFA. Essentially, in a transaction that favored a former director, the BFA accepted a piece of property (which the BFA itself declined to purchase) as collateral for a loan that amounted to US$4.9M more than the <b>property's</b> <b>appraisal</b> value.|$|R
50|$|The YSP {{is derived}} through the {{realization}} of a market 'price' for a loan that is above 100%. For example, a $300,000 loan with a price when sold of 101.00% would 'yield' a 1% rebate to the originator. It {{is important to understand}} that the term 'originator' refers to either a retail bank or mortgage broker. The characteristics of a loan contribute to the price offered, such as the interest rate attached, the credit score of the borrower, purchase money versus a cash-out refinance, or a streamline refinance (which lowers the price because it is typically not accompanied by a <b>property</b> <b>appraisal).</b> Higher credit scores may add 0.25% to the price, while a lower one may cost up to 3.00% - which requires the borrower to either pay a discount fee to cover the loss to the lender when the mortgage is sold, or increasing the interest rate to absorb the risk for the mortgage security investor.|$|E
5000|$|The racial {{segregation}} and disparities in wealth between {{white and black}} people are legacies of historical policies. In the Social Security Act of 1935, agricultural workers, servants, {{most of whom were}} black, were excluded because key white southerners did not want governmental assistance to change the agrarian system. In the Wagner Act of 1935, [...] "blacks were blocked by law from challenging the barriers to entry into the newly protected labor unions and securing the right to collective bargaining." [...] In the National Housing Act of 1939, the <b>property</b> <b>appraisal</b> system tied property value and eligibility for government loans to race. The 1936 Underwriting Manual used by the Federal Housing Administration to guide residential mortgages gave 20% weight to a neighborhood's protection, for example, zoning ordinances, deed restrictions, high speed traffic arteries, from adverse influences, such as infiltration of inharmonious racial groups. Thus, white-majority neighborhoods received the government's highest property value ratings, and white people were eligible for government loans. Between 1934 and 1962, less than 2 percent of government-subsidized housing went to non-white people.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the risks and}} returns {{of different types of}} real estate-related firms traded on the New York and American stock exchanges (NYSE and AMEX). We examine the relation between real estate stock portfolio returns and returns on a standard appraisal-based index, and find that lagged values of traded real estate portfolio returns can predict returns on the appraisal-based index after controlling for persistence in the appraisal series. The stock market reflects information about real estate markets that is later imbedded in infrequent <b>property</b> <b>appraisals.</b> Additional analysis suggests that the differences in the return and risk characteristics across different types of traded real estate firms can be explained in part by appealing to real estate market fundamentals relating to the degree of dependence of the real estate firm upon rental cash flows from existing buildings.

40|$|The {{first two}} papers in this {{dissertation}} discuss a fairly recently developed research field, Space Syntax, {{and how the}} findings in this field {{may be used to}} understand spatial economic patterns such as geographic distribution of market rents. Both papers use standard econometric methods to investigate the relationship between rents and the so called integration value developed within Space Syntax. The integration value may be understood as a measure of the accessibility of a certain location in a street network. The measure is constructed using tools from graph theory and uses the shape of the street network as its only input. The papers estimate hedonic models of office and retail leases from central Stockholm to test whether the integration value can help explain rents. A statistically significant effect of integration value on both office and retail rent is found. It appears as if Space Syntax adds important information to the understanding of intraurban rent patterns. Illiquidity is a main feature of most property markets and market participants are therefore directed to <b>property</b> <b>appraisals</b> to obtain information about market values. The reliability of <b>property</b> <b>appraisals</b> is therefore an important research topic. The third paper studies the “rationality” of valuations by testing if capitalisation (cap) rates from individual discounted cash-flow (DCF) valuations are consistent with economic theory. Standard econometrics is used to study the variation in cap rates. For the most part the results support the hypothesis that appraisers are “rational” in the above mentioned sense. Illiquidity of direct property also poses a problem when constructing property price indices.   Lack of price observations and heterogeneity among the few observations available is likely to introduce noise in price indices based on transactions. Valuations are therefore often used instead to construct indices. These indices however suffer from a bias due to so called “appraisal smoothing”. In the fourth paper it is shown that, given certain assumptions, one may filter out noise in a transaction-based price index by regressing it on a valuation-based index (contemporaneous and lagged one period). The procedure may in some circumstances improve pure valuation- or transaction-based indices. QC 2010120...|$|R
