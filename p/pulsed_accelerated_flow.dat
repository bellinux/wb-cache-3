40|$|In {{road traffic}} noise issues, {{experimental}} measurements are a relevant element {{in order to}} understand the problem and to adjust models. Sometimes, when measurements are not possible or in the designing phase, prediction models are used to perform an estimation of the equivalent level produced by a road infrastructure. Usually models parameters are obtained by a statistical data fit and thus they are related to the area where measurements have been performed. These models are suitable for standard conditions, but they generally fail when vehicle speed distribution influence cannot be neglected, such as non-free flow traffic, traffic jams, etc. Thus, the possibility to perform a road traffic noise prediction by means of energy based stochastic approach represents a challenge in the noise control issues. The equivalent level, in fact, depends on the acoustical energy emitted by each vehicle, which may be directly connected to its speed by some experimental relations. In this paper, the authors present a new approach in which the speed of each vehicle is randomly generated according to specific speed distributions. The different distributions are chosen according to the contextual traffic situation (free flow, <b>pulsed</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>flow,</b> intersection, mixed flow composition, etc.), resulting in a detailed microscopic description of the phenomenon, based on a stochastic core model. Once the speed is generated according to the given distribution, the global level is obtained collecting all the energies sent to the receiver by each source. The results of this procedure are compared with experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} lo examine the accuracy of proximal <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> calculations in estimating regurgitant flow rate or volume in patients with different types of mitral valve disease. Background. Flow acceleration proximal to a regurgitant orifice, observed with Doppler color flow mapping, is constituted by isovelocity surfaces centered at the orifice. By conservation of mass, the flow rate through each isovelocity surface equals the flow rate through the regurgitant orifice. Methods. Forty-six adults with mitral regurgitation of angiographic grades I to IV were studied. The proximal <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> rate (Q) was calculated by: Q = 2 πr 2 ·Vn, where πr 2 is {{the area of the}} hemisphere and Vn is the Nyquist velocity. Radius of the hemisphere (r) was measured from two-dimensional or M-mode Doppler color recording. From the M-mode color study, integration of <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> rate throughout systole yielded stroke <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> volume and mean flow rate. Mitral regurgitant flow rate and stroke regurgitant volume were measured by using a combination of pulsed wave Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of aortic forward flow and mitral inflow. Results. The proximal <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> region was observed in 42 of 46 patients. Maximal <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> measured from either two-dimensional (372 ± 389 ml/s) or M-mode (406 ± 421 ml/s) Doppler color study tended to overestimate the mean regurgitant flow rate (306 ± 253 ml/s, p < 0. 05). Mean Doppler <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> rate correlated well with mean regurgitant flow rate (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 001), although there was a tendency toward slight overestimation of mean regurgitant <b>flow</b> by mean <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> in severe mitral regurgitation. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between the mean <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> rate (318 ± 304 ml/s) and the mean regurigitant flow rate (306 ± 253 ml/s, p = NS) for all patients. A similar relation was found between <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> stroke volume (78. 27 ± 62. 72 ml) and regurgitant flow stroke volume (76. 06 ± 59. 76 ml/) (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 001). The etiology of mitral regurgitation did not appear to affect the relation between <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> and regurgitant <b>flow.</b> Conclusions. Proximal <b>accelerating.</b> <b>flow</b> rate calculated by the hemispheric model of the isovelocity surface was applicable and accurate in most patients with mitral regurgitation of a variety of causes. There was slight overestimation of regurgltant <b>flow</b> rate by <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> rate when tbe regurgitant lesion was more severe...|$|R

Central corneal thickness (CCT) measurements were taken using ultrasound pachymetry before and after epithelial removal, after riboflavin soaking, and immediately after completion of UVA treatment. Results. Twenty eyes of 11 patients (4 males, 7 females) were enrolled. Mean patient age was 26 ± 3 (range from 18 to 30 years). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed {{in any of the}} patients. Mean CCT was 507 ± 35 [*]μm (range: 559 – 459 [*]μm) before and 475 ± 40 [*]μm (range: 535 – 420 [*]μm) after epithelial removal (P< 0. 001). After 10 minutes of riboflavin instillation, there was a statistically significant decrease of CCT by 6. 2 % from 475 ± 40 [*]μm (range: 535 – 420 [*]μm) to 446 ± 31 [*]μm (range: 508 – 400) (P< 0. 005).

40|$|Accelerating and {{decelerating}} turbulent channel flows are investigated {{to study}} {{the response of the}} turbulence dynamics. The objective of these investigations is to further enhance the understanding on the behaviour of turbulence and wall friction under transient conditions. Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) are carried out for step-like <b>accelerating</b> <b>flows</b> with significantly higher ratios of Reynolds number than previously covered. An experimental investigation is carried out for ramp-like <b>accelerating</b> <b>flows</b> using Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Constant-Temperature Anemometry (CTA) techniques to reproduce and validate the findings in numerical simulations. Step- and ramp-like decelerating flows are studied using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), the results of which are compared with observations in <b>accelerating</b> <b>flows.</b> Step-like high Re-ratio and ramp-like <b>accelerating</b> <b>flows</b> are shown to exhibit essentially the same three-stage laminar-turbulent transitional response as that described in He & Seddighi (J. Fluid Mech. 715 : 60 - 102, 2013), resembling bypass transition of boundary layer flows. The first stage is characterised by elongation and enhancement of streaks. The growing instabilities of the streak structures lead to breakdown and formation of isolated turbulent patches in the second stage, which grow in time and eventually merge with each other. The third stage is marked by the entire wall surface being covered by the newly generated turbulence. It is shown in the present study that the features of transition become more striking when the Re-ratio increases ― the elongated streaks in the pre-transitional period become increasingly longer and stronger, and the turbulent spots generated at the initial stage at the onset of transition become increasingly sparse. In a slower ramp-like flow excursion, on the other hand, the onset of transition is delayed making the flow development slower. In a step-like acceleration, a new boundary layer is formed instantly over the wall which develops into the flow with time. In a ramp-like case, however, the boundary layer development is shown to be described as an integral consequence of a continuous change of the flow. During the pre-transition stage, the time-development of the boundary layer in the step- and ramp-like <b>accelerating</b> <b>flows</b> bears strong resemblance to a time-developing laminar boundary layer described by the solution to Stokes’ first problem and can be represented by its analytical solution with a small correction. The streamwise fluctuation velocity profile in a high Re-ratio <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> is shown to exhibit two peaks immediately following the onset of transition. A conditional sampling technique, based on a λ_ 2 -criterion, is used to show that the two peaks are separate contributions of the active and inactive regions of turbulence generation. The peak closer to the wall is attributed to the ‘newly’ generated turbulence in the active region; while the peak farther from the wall is attributed to the enhanced streaks in the inactive region. Decelerating flows are shown to be also characterised by a time-developing boundary layer, similar to that in <b>accelerating</b> <b>flows,</b> bearing strong resemblance to the time-developing laminar boundary layer. The mean flow and wall friction {{in the early stages of}} the transient can be represented by the laminar analytical solution of the Stokes’ first problem. The streamwise fluctuations are shown to respond immediately following the commencement of the transient, while the response of the ‘real’ turbulence is shown to respond after a delay. Although the decay of turbulence and flow structures appear to be a gradual development herein, the decelerating flows may also undergo a transition process. However, the mechanism and stages of any such process are not clear in the present investigation. In addition, a brief investigation on the performance of the low-Reynolds number Launder-Sharma k-ε model in predicting unsteady turbulent flows is undertaken using different CFD codes. It is shown that the model performance itself is robust and insensitive to the numerical/coding framework, while slight changes in the formulation of the model have significant effect on the performance of the model. ...|$|R

40|$|Magnetosheath plasma {{entering}} the earth's magnetosphere to populate the low latitude boundary layer, LLBL, is often accelerated to speeds considerably greater than are {{observed in the}} adjacent magnetosheath. Measurements made during such <b>accelerated</b> <b>flow</b> events reveal separate electron and ion edges to the LLBL, with the electron edge being found earthward of the ion edge. Plasma electron velocity distributions observed at the earthward edge of the LLBL are often highly structured, exhibiting large asymmetries parallel and antiparallel, as well as perpendicular, to the local magnetic field.

40|$|Along a {{non-uniform}} flow {{in a stream}} or river, the pressure, energy, and momentum coefficients tend to vary from section to section. These coefficients also tend to vary with the water depth and discharge. Although some researchers provided some values of these coefficients for special conditions, their spatial variability in <b>accelerated</b> <b>flow</b> has not been adequately investigated. To simplify calculations, the values of these coefficients are usually assumed to be constants. This implies that the cross-sectional velocity and pressure distributions do not change with space. Values of these constants are often regarded as unity, which implies that the velocity is uniformly distributed over the cross section while the pressure distribution is hydrostatic. However, effect of these coefficients on the solution of {{non-uniform flow}} equations is not well understood. In this study, a new simple method for computing the pressure, energy, and momentum correction coefficients from the water surface profile for <b>accelerating</b> <b>flow</b> over block stones ramp was developed. This method {{is based on the}} assumption that the water depth at the beginning of the ramp is equal to the critical depth. The study revealed that the maximum deviation in the pressure is at the ramp crest and decreases in the downstream direction until it reaches to uniform flow condition at some distance from the ramp crest. Values of energy correction coefficient and momentum correction coefficient are nearly constant at the ramp crest and increase by increasing the distance from the ramp crest. Along the ramp, the velocity correction coefficient increases by decreasing the discharge.
