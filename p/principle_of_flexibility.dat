40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> of architectonic space on the concrete example of flat composition. This example demonstrates that with a proper choice of structural spans dimensions and regular arrangement of sanitary and ventilation vertical assemblies, a structure with high flexibility in terms of flat space organization and floor space organization, can be achieved. Key words: flexibility, dwelling, flat, organization Economic necessity in housing construction always urges for the multiple rationalization. On the other hand, our numerous and varied requirements of an appropriated housing space comprise an ever increasing personalization of a flat. The concept realized by Mies van der Rohe in 1927, at his building for the Weissenhof district, is becoming a reality nowadays. The primary reason for flexibility is giving the user a choice. As opposed to designing the individual houses, the housing buildings design, with flats for the market, cannot be clearly defined, as neither the investor nor the designer know the future users' preferences. The user is a variable factor, just {{as it was in the}} period of state built flats. The question: what kind of flats should be built, is dealt by the planners and designers...|$|E

40|$|Virtual reality (VR) {{offers a}} wide range of {{applications}} in the field of cognitive neuropsychology both in diagnosing cognitive deficits and in treating them. An optimal diagnostic method is the on-field test, which provides an opportunity to apply VR-based simulations. VR is also a useful tool for skill-building and training by setting up a virtual setting, which imitates the real environment including the attributes to be trained. Moreover, it provides a graded approach to problem-solving and the feeling of safety and it excludes the negative elements which are detrimental to the learning process. To further extend the effectiveness of VR applications it is necessary to refine VR environments and adapt them according to the specific needs of selected target groups and the real-time control of virtual events. Following the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> we prepared two virtual environments: 1) an Adjustable Virtual Classroom (AVC) for the treatment of fear of public speaking in a primary school task-solving setting, and 2) a Virtual Therapy Room (VTR) designed for use with aphasic clients. Due to their flexible nature, a large number of elements can be customised in both of these settings including spatial organisation, textures, audio materials and also the tasks to be solved. The real-time control over the virtual avatars by the supervisor, i. e. therapist to guide the social interactions in the virtual world also allows him/her to follow-up on the user’s reactions and therapy performance. By focusing on the details of the therapy room, we would like to demonstrate the relevance of the flexibility of the software in the development of innovative therapy solutions for aphasic clients. 1...|$|E

40|$|Planned {{progressive}} development {{strategies and}} low-income housing {{have been out}} of the international development agenda since funding agencies cut-off support to sites and services and similar housing schemes. These projects were among the most widely used approaches to address the need for low-income housing during the 1960 s, 1970 s and 1980 s. The last fifteen years since their abandonment in the mid 1980 s have been characterized by the absence of major investments in shelter for the poor in developing countries and the lack of new paradigms in housing. This study argues that planned progressive development strategies in low-income housing were inappropriately abandoned by international sponsors. The prevalent explanation is that projects were discarded because the minimum standards established by governments and donors in these projects made them unaffordable and unsustainable. While this study finds support for this explanation, it also finds that projects became too complex because of the inclusion of many components to the single idea of experimenting with progressive development under controlled conditions of planning. In addition, implementation criteria were too rigid and contrary to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> which is central in progressive development. The criteria used to assess these projects by donors, focusing on affordability, cost recovery and replicability, were inappropriate because they assumed that the process of progressive development which had been observed in informal housing would also occur in planned progressive development projects, but failed to evaluate this directly. A central aspect of this housing strategy was thus assumed rather than evaluated directly. The thesis reviews assessments made to sites and services after international funding of planned progressive developments and shelter projects was withdrawn. In addition, the study collected, organized and analyzed evidence about recent planned progressive development strategies that have continued on a small, local scale in several developing countries around the world. The outcome of these recent experiences demonstrates that these simpler strategies were more viable in addressing low-income housing needs, and that projects can be implemented with very little initial investment and without external support. Thus, planned progressive development strategies are still a promising approach to low-income housing. by Carlos A. Reimers. Thesis (S. M.)

There is a need for an ethics of mathematics education that can inform moment to moment choices to address a wide range of ethical situations. I argue that mathematics educators make ethical choices which are necessarily ambiguous and complex. This is illustrated with examples from practice. The concept of ethical dimension is introduced as a heuristic to consider the awareness of different forms of relationship and arenas of action. A framework is proposed and discussed of four important dimensions: the relationship with others, the societal and cultural, the ecological and the relationship with self. Attending to the different ethical dimensions supports the development of a plural relational ethics. Navigating ethical complexity requires embracing diverse and changing commitments.

Instead of being tied to a particular workflow, this system provides a flexible communication infrastructure which can be easily adapted for different functions and user roles. The system has so far been configured to successfully support the standard “wet reading” workflow, to support marking and tracking of critical results, as well as multiple educational and quality improvement workflows. In the 19  months of operation, the system has gained over 1, 800 users (virtually all providers at our institution), it has been accessed by radiologists over 39, 000 times and by non-radiologists over 34, 000 times.

However, the field has seen a proliferation of noncomplementary models with little consensus on the relative adequacy of these accounts. Progress in assessing the relative adequacy of formal categorization models has, to date, been limited because (a) formal model comparisons are narrow in the number of models and phenomena considered and (b) models do not often clearly define their explanatory scope. Progress is further hampered by the practice of fitting models with arbitrarily variable parameters to each data set independently.
