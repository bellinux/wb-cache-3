50|$|Palinurus mauritanicus (common name: <b>pink</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster)</b> is {{a species}} of spiny lobster. It is found in deep waters in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the western Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pink</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{differs from}} Palinurus elephas, by its {{first pair of}} pereiopods (walking legs) that are as slender as its other pereiopods.

40|$|The Mediterranean spiny lobsters, {{the common}} spiny lobster Palinurus elephas (Fabricius, 1758) and the <b>pink</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> P. mauritanicus Gruvel, 1911, are {{important}} target species for commercial fisheries. In this study, we focus our attention on the DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxydase I gene (COI) in the two species of Palinurus. Spiny lobster DNA samples from four Mediterranean localities were analysed to examine the genetic variability at both the intra- and interspecific level. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships within the family Palinuridae (among the two species of Palinurus, most of the species of Panulirus and all the species of Jasus) are examine...|$|E
50|$|Palinurus elephas is a <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> {{which is}} {{commonly}} {{caught in the}} Mediterranean Sea. Its common names include European <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> crayfish or cray (in Ireland), common <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Mediterranean lobster and red lobster.|$|R
500|$|In {{common with}} all <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> has two large, spiny antennae, but no large claws on its legs.

5000|$|Jasus is a genus of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> which live in {{the oceans}} of the Southern Hemisphere. They have two {{distinct}} [...] "horns" [...] projecting {{from the front of}} the carapace, but lack the stridulating organs present in almost all other genera of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Like all <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> they lack claws, and have long stout antennae which are quite flexible.|$|R
25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. Sometimes, they migrate in very large groups in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. These lines {{may be more than}} 50 <b>lobsters</b> long. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> navigate using the smell and taste of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> by a loud screech made by the antennae of the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.|$|R

5|$|Natural predators of the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant {{sea bass}} and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> including the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> feed on a {{wide range}} of natural marine food. They prey nocturnally upon a diverse {{assemblage}} of epifaunal and infaunal organisms including molluscs (such as snails and clams), smaller crustaceans, echinoderms, polychaetes and algae (Lipicius and Cobb, 1994). Slow moving or sessile benthic marine invertebrates, which serve as main food of most <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> in the wild have also been found useful in culture trials of lobsters. Marine food items are preferred over terrestrial animal food by lobsters and among marine food sources, shellfish (particularly mussels) is preferred over finfish (Booth and Kittaka, 1994). Tropical <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> have several amenable characteristics which make them suitable for aquaculture. Tropical lobsters are adaptable to captive conditions, less cannibalistic and relatively fast growing than their counterparts in the sub-tropical and temperate regions (Anon., 1994). The greatest hurdle in growing <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is the difficulty in larval rearing and hence the culture of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> is still not commercially taken up in spite of significant advances made in recent years. However, since <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> mature and breed in captivity and as they can be grown communally; it seems likely that their commercial culture will be possible in the near future (Kittaka and Booth, 1994).

40|$|Abstract. A complex {{nervous system}} enables <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{to have a}} rich {{behavioural}} repertoire. The present paper discusses {{the ways in which}} the sensory systems of the Caribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus argus, particularly its chemosensory systems, are involved in feeding behaviour. It addresses the neural mechanisms of three aspects of their food-finding ability: detection, identification, and discrimination of natural food odours; the effect of learning on responses to food odours; the mechanisms by which <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> orient to odours from a distance under natural flow conditions. It demonstrates that the olfactory organ of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> might use acrossneuron response patterns in discriminating odour quality; that the hedonic value of food can be modified by experience, including associative and nonassociative conditioning; that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can readily orient to distant odour sources; and that both chemo- and mechanosensory antennular input are important in this behaviour. Either aesthetasc or nonaesthetasc chemosensory pathways can be used in identifying odour quality, mediating learned behaviours, and permitting orientation to the source of distant odours. Studying the neuroethology of feeding behaviour helps us understand how <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are adapted to living in complex and variable environments...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{occurance}} {{and distribution}} of astaxanthin in tissues of the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Jasus lalandii was investigated. The concentration of astaxanthin was quantified in the exoskeleton, haemolymph, muscles, gonads and hepatopancreas {{as well as in}} egg parcels from berried females during the moult as well as the reproductive cycles. Astaxanthin was the dominant carotenoid in all tissues, but small amounts of other carotenoids were detected. Exoskeleton, ovaries and extrude egg parcels had significantly higher astaxanthin concentration than haemolymp, muscles and hepatopancreas. This distribution of astaxanthin was found in both captive and free-living <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Free-living <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> generally had higher astaxanthin concentration than the captive <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> although the data is not statistically significant in all tissues investigated...|$|R

5000|$|The California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> or Panulirus interruptus, {{is another}} example of a {{keystone}} predator that has a distinct role in maintaining species diversity in its habitat.
