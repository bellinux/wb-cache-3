In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a <b>private</b> <b>account</b> which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E

A transmittal memorandum, written by State Dept. official Patrick F. Kennedy, said that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Mrs. Clinton’s <b>private</b> <b>account</b> by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and the NSA, and that it is illegal anyone to receive a classified document, or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email.|$|E

This article discusses what <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> can and cannot do for individuals who choose to use them and for future Social Security deficits.; Under current proposals, <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> would give account holders personal ownership rights and could be willed to heirs at death. Most proposals would limit the range of assets that can be held but would permit account owners to determine their investments based on personal risk preferences. To the extent that financial asset returns can be higher than returns on Social Security, <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> can be more worthwhile for those with a longer time until retirement because any difference in returns can compound over a longer period.; <b>Private</b> <b>accounts</b> carry the risks inherent in holding financial assets, but Social Security carries a real risk of lower benefits in the future. Holders of <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> would be trading one type of risk for another.; The creation of <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> can reduce Social Security’s future problems if the reductions in benefits in exchange for deposits in <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> reflect the initial deposit plus interest earned. >Social security...|$|R

500|$|In 1996, a {{previously}} unpublished <b>private</b> <b>account</b> written in 1972 by Aldo Lampredi for the Communist Party's archives, appeared in L'Unità. In it, Lampredi confirmed the key facts of Audisio's story {{but without the}} embellishments. Lampredi was undoubtedly an eyewitness and, because he prepared his narrative for the private records of the Communist Party – and not for publication – it was perceived {{that he had no}} motivation other than to tell the truth. Furthermore, he had had a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy; he was also known to have disliked Audisio personally. For all these reasons it was seen as significant that he largely confirmed Audisio's account. After Lampredi's account was published, most, but not all, commentators were convinced of its veracity. The historian Giorgio Bocca commented that [...] "it sweeps away all the bad novels constructed over 50 years {{on the end of the}} Duce of fascism .... There was no possibility that the many ridiculous versions put about in these years were true...The truth is now unmistakably clear".|$|E
500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta. Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson. It took Lieberstein and Celotta {{four or five days}} to write this episode. Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was {{inspired}} by the days that he was an administrative assistant for Countrywide Home Loans. Farrell recalled watching the company try new online initiatives and seeing them all be unsuccessful. The talking head interview wherein Michael compares Holly to a baker came after what the writers call [...] "blitzes", in which all the writers write a talking head on a specific topic, such as [...] "Michael's feelings to Holly". Then they all read all of them out loud and see which one gets the biggest reaction. The YouTube video of Ryan being arrested was set on a <b>private</b> <b>account.</b> After [...] "Goodbye, Toby" [...] aired, the video was released to the public. When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character. After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Proposals {{to allow}} <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> under Social Security were {{introduced}} long before George Bush was elected President, {{and support for}} privatization in some form will survive his administration and the economic downturn that followed. This paper studies the impact that <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> would have on risk/return investment tradeoffs available to Social Security participants who save and invest {{on an ongoing basis}} outside the Social Security system. For such investor/participants, we show that the reduction in total diversifiable risk afforded by traditional Social Security accounts would be more than sufficient in many cases to compensate for the opportunity cost of opting-out of a privatization program if one were enacted. The risk of financing <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> by diverting mandatory contributions away from guaranteed benefit accounts, on the other hand, would be proportionately higher for those with little or no private savings or investments outside the Social Security system. The paper concludes, therefore, that privatization would lead to imprudent risks being borne by those who can least afford to do so, and would offer no significant advantage to others.

The trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds project that Social Security will become insolvent in 2041 (Board of Trustees 2005). Because Social Security is a government program, the meaning of solvency here is tricky—after all, the federal government is not projected to be insolvent in any meaning of the word. Isn’t 2041 a long time from now? Why not wait for a while before making a change to such an important government program? The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide an introduction to Social Security private accounts—what they can and cannot do for those who choose to use them and for looming Social Security deficits. The discussion will also explore why it is expedient to introduce these accounts now to deal with a problem that will not become acute for decades. Several different precise proposals about <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> for Social Security have been put forward. These proposals vary in terms of the amounts that can be contributed, permissible investments, and the way funds can be used. The article discusses a general version of these <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> and their implications for private individuals and points out the implications for those who choose them. How Would <b>Private</b> <b>Accounts</b> Operate? Basic principles of <b>private</b> <b>accounts.</b> The common element in all proposals for <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> is that people can take part of their Social Security taxes and place them in accounts in which they have personal ownership rights. In most respects, these accounts would be no different than current individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or defined-contribution retirement plans at many places of employment. While many people in the United States have such accounts, not all do. Roughly 40 percent of all families did not have such accounts in 2001 (Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore 2003).

The people in our country who talk about killing are children. They have not seen the reality of things. We do not turn our heads when forty are killed at a breath.
