In most Arctic areas it is from a few to several hundred metres thick. Thawing of permafrost soils releases methane. Methane has 25 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide.

We used a network of bubble traps, permanently installed 20 cm and 60 cm beneath the moss surface, to examine controls on ebullition from three collapse bogs in interior Alaska. Overall, ebullition was dominated by episodic events that were associated with changes in atmospheric pressure, and ebullition was mainly a surface process regulated by both seasonal ice dynamics and plant phenology. The majority (> 90 %) of ebullition occurred in surface peat layers, with little bubble production in deeper peat. During periods of peak plant biomass, bubbles contained acetate-derived CH 4 dominated (> 90 %) by modern C fixed from the atmosphere following <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw.</b> Post-senescence, the contribution of CH 4 derived from <b>thawing</b> <b>permafrost</b> C was more variable and accounted for up to 22 % (on average 7 %), in the most recently thawed site.

40|$|The Arctic is {{experiencing}} strong increases in air temperature {{during the last}} decades. High-latitude tundra regions are very responsive to changes in temperature and may cause a shift in tundra vegetation composition towards greater dominance of deciduous shrubs. With increasing deciduous shrub cover, the surface albedo (proportion of sunlight that is reflected to the atmosphere) may be reduced and lead to air warming by trapping more solar radiation into the Arctic ecosystem. As {{a result of this}} warming, <b>thawing</b> of carbon-rich <b>permafrost</b> soils may increase and cause a large greenhouse gas flux to the atmosphere, thus contributing to global warming.

50|$|Stordalen mire (elevation 351 m) {{lies in the}} subarctic {{region in}} northernmost Sweden. It is located 10 km east {{of the town of}} Abisko close to Lake Torneträsk. It is a 25 ha palsa mire, which is common in the {{discontinuous}} permafrost zone. The mire has two major topographical features: elevated palsas and depressions. The palsas are dry, ombrotrophic plateaus (or hummocks) with permafrost cores that raise the peat surface above its surroundings that is the wet minerotrophic depressions, largely permafrostfree and water saturated. The small-scale topography is often very patchy in its structure, creating an environment where localities nearby each other have distinct differences in moisture, permafrost and nutrient status, which creates differences in vegetation types. Of these subhabitats the vegetation in the dry parts consists mainly of mosses, lichens and dwarf shrubs, whereas the wet parts are dominated by sphagnum or tall graminoids. A peat layer up to 3 m deep covers most of the area and is an indication of a net carbon accumulation over the past 5000 years. In the areas underlying by permafrost the active layer reaches a thickness of about 60 cm in the late summer. The mire experiences thermokarst erosion, with the ongoing <b>permafrost</b> <b>thawing</b> that leads to degradation and collapse of the palsa structure, converting it into the wetter surface types. To the east the mire is bordered by the shallow Lake Villasjön (max depth 1.3 m) whereas it is in general largely surrounded by mountain birch forest.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a strong}} {{interdependence}} between permafrost and vegetation in permafrost regions. The melting of permafrost has {{a significant effect on}} soils, such as the moisture content and the availability of nutrients. Permafrost functions to serve terrestrial ecosystems; when permafrost thaws it decreases the amount of species that can grow in the low temperatures and high moisture soils. The effects that thawing permafrost has on vegetation greatly depends on the depth of the regions active layer. In some regions the thawing of permafrost leads to increased soil drainage and in others it leads to increased soil moisture; both causing changes to the dominant species in an area. In areas where the thawing permafrost causes increased soil drainage, wet plant species like Kobresia tibetica and Kobresia humilis decrease and drought plants such as Poa annua and Agropyron cristatum begin to take over. [...] Unfortunately the decreased soil moisture leads to the disappearance of Alpine meadows and creates Alpine deserts. As Ice-rich permafrost regions begin to thaw the terrestrial ecosystems turn to aquatic or wetland ecosystems. Due to this process “wet sedge meadows, bogs, thermokarst ponds and lakes are replacing forests”. [...] In Alaska the permafrost degradation has caused a decrease in birch forests by 25%. [...] Permafrost degradation in the lowlands of Alaska has caused tussock-tundra communities to turn into shrub-tundra communities. Shrubs and woody plants are extending their northern ecological range and encroaching on lichen-dominated ecosystems. [...] As a result, the amount of lichens found in the affected areas decrease. This affects the entire ecosystem, as lichens are a vital food source for caribou that are commonly found in arctic regions. The degradation of permafrost and its effects on vegetation is a complex and intricate cycle; thus far the thawing permafrost has two major effects on vegetation: 1. Permafrost thaw in ice-rich soils equates to a loss of terrestrial ecosystems and an increase in aquatic or wetland ecosystems. 2. <b>Permafrost</b> <b>thawing</b> in the upland regions results in improved soil drainage leading to the alpine meadows undergoing a transformation to either shrub communities or drought communities.|$|E

40|$|Methane flux {{from high}} {{latitude}} wetlands {{is both a}} critical component of the global CH 4 budget, and highly sensitive to global climate change, with expected increases in emissions as <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaws.</b> Gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms driving changing CH 4 production and consumption dynamics under <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw,</b> however, limit our ability to predict the magnitude of this response under future climate conditions. To address these gaps, we quantified the isotopic composition of carbon gas fluxes (δ 13 C of CH 4 and CO 2) from a high latitude (68 ° N) wetland in Sweden (Stordalen Mire) to partition net CH 4 emissions into its component parts, methanogenesis (including both acetoclastic, and CO 2 -reductive pathways) and methanotrophy (which consumes CH 4 primarily via aerobic metabolism). We used newly developed quantum cascade laser technology, linked to automated chambers, to quantify isotopes at high frequency. Our measurements across a <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw</b> gradient, going from permafrost-dominated, well-drained palsas to intermediate permafrost sites dominated by Sphagnum spp. to wet sites with no underlying permafrost, dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium, show both large increases in productivity and CH 4 emissions as well as shifts in the CH 4 production pathway. Across this <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw</b> gradient the isotopic composition of CH 4 becomes 13 C enriched, due to increased acetoclastic CH 4 production. While the palsa sites have no detectable CH 4 emissions, fluxes in the Sphagnum site have an average isotopic composition of - 79 ‰, a value indicative of CH 4 production dominated by CO 2 reduction, in contrast the isotopic composition of CH 4 produced in the Eriophorum sites ranged from - 71 to - 57 ‰, showing increased CH 4 production via the acetate pathway. We also observed an increase in acetoclastic methanogenesis as the growing season progressed. Together, these initial results suggest that thaw induced changes in hydrology and plant community composition increase peat lability, stimulating acetate fermentation and yielding increased methane emissions.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 <b>Permafrost</b> <b>thaw</b> in boreal peatlands causes an {{ecosystem}} state change as black spruce forests with permafrost transition into saturated, non-forested collapse scar bogs or fens. Previous {{studies have suggested}} that <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw</b> can increase soil nitrogen (N) bioavailability. However, it is unclear whether these changes in N availability are directly related to changes in N pools or mineralization rates in surface soils (active layer dynamics), or whether increasing N can be attributed to N mobilization from <b>thawing</b> <b>permafrost</b> soil organic matter at depth. I examined plant species composition and aspects of N cycling along triplicate permafrost-thaw gradients in interior Alaskan peatlands. Each gradient comprised plots situated in a 1) forested plateau with intact permafrost (hereafter called permafrost forest) 2) forest experiencing active thaw (drunken forest), 3) moat representing initial stages of complete thaw (moat), and 4) collapse scar bog representing post-thaw succession following complete <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw</b> (collapse bog). I found that both organic and inorganic N concentrations in soil solution increased with thaw. Drunken forests with active <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw</b> had the greatest mean concentrations of total dissolved N relative to the other gradient plots. Elevated levels of dissolved N in the drunken forest plots were due primarily to high concentrations of large molecular DON. The moat and collapse scar bog plots had greater inorganic N concentrations on average than the permafrost forest or the drunken forest, suggesting that changes in plantavailable N do not occur immediately upon thaw, but are influenced by vegetation or soil succession occurring decades to centuries after thaw is initiated. However, across all of the community types, I found that deeper soil horizons corresponded to greater concentrations of DIN and DON when thaw was deepest (September), suggesting that permafrost soil horizons are playing a role in changing N availability post-thaw. Vegetation responses to <b>permafrost</b> <b>thaw</b> included changes in plant community composition, deeper rooting profiles, and changes in foliar N and δ¹⁵N values. Plant foliar and litterfall N concentrations increased with collapse bog succession and showed relationships with concentrations of DIN, suggesting that plants are utilizing additional mineralized N. Together, my results suggest that the conversion of lowland permafrost forests to collapse scar bogs increases N availability both by increasing turnover of the permafrost organic matter pool as well as through longer-term successional processes. At least some plants are able to capitalize on "new" sources of N available post-thaw, but it is unclear from my results whether plants are able to acquire N mobilized by <b>thawing</b> <b>permafrost</b> organic matter deeper in soil profiles...|$|R
