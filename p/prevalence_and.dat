40|$|Experiences with {{population-based}} {{chemotherapy and}} other methods {{for the control}} of schistosomiasis mansoni in two subsaharan foci are described. In the forest area of Maniema (Zaire), intense transmission of Schistosoma mansoni, high <b>prevalences</b> <b>and</b> intensities of infection, and important morbidity have been documental. Taking into account the limited financial means and the poor logistic conditions, the control strategy has been based mainly on targeted chemotherapy of heavily infected people (> 600 epg). After ten years of intervention, <b>prevalences</b> <b>and</b> intensities have hardly been affected, but the initial severe hepatosplenic morbidity has almost disappeared. In Burundi, a national research and control programme has been initiated in 1982. <b>Prevalences,</b> intensities <b>and</b> morbidity were moderate, transmission was focal and erratic in time and space. A more structural control strategy was developed, based on screening and selective therapy, health education, sanitation and domestic water supply. <b>Prevalences</b> <b>and</b> intensities have been considerably reduced, though the results show focal and unpredicatable variations. Transmission and reinfection were not signifcantly affected by chemotherapy alone, and eventual outcome of repeated selective treatment appears to be limited by {{the sensitivity of the}} screening method. Intestinal morbidity was strongly reduced by community-based selective treatment, but hepatosplenic enlargement was hardly affected; this is possibly due to the confounding impact of increasing malaria morbidity. The experiences show the importance of local structures and conditions for the development of an adapted control strategy. It is further concluded that population-based chemotherapy is a highly valid tool for the rapid control of morbidity, but should in most operational conditions not be considered as a tool for transmission control.

40|$|There {{is still}} {{considerable}} confusion and {{debate about the}} appropriate methods for analyzing <b>prevalence</b> studies, <b>and</b> {{a number of recent}} papers have argued that prevalence ratios are the preferred method <b>and</b> that <b>prevalence</b> odds ratios should not be used. These arguments assert that the prevalence ratio is obviously the better measure and the odds ratio is “unintelligible. ” They have often been accompanied by demonstrations that when a disease is common the <b>prevalence</b> ratio <b>and</b> the <b>prevalence</b> odds ratio may differ substantially. However, this does not tell us which measure is the more valid to use. In fact, the prevalence odds ratio a) estimates the incidence rate ratio with fewer assumptions than are required for the prevalence ratio; b) can be estimated using the same methods as for the odds ratio in case–control studies, namely, the Mantel–Haenszel method and logistic regression; and c) provides practical, analytical, and theoretical consistency between analyses of a <b>prevalence</b> study <b>and</b> <b>prevalence</b> case–control analyses based on the same study population.

Data came from three probability-based surveys in Switzerland from 2002 : 1) Geneva Gay Men's Health Survey (GGMHS) with 571 gay/bisexual men, 2) Swiss Multicenter Adolescent Survey on Health (SMASH) with 7, 428 16 - 20 year olds, and 3) Swiss Recruit Survey (ch-x) with 22, 415 new recruits. In GGMHS, suicidal ideation (12 months/lifetime) was reported by 22 %/ 55 %, suicide plans 12 %/ 38 %, and suicide attempts 4 %/ 19 %. While lifetime <b>prevalences</b> <b>and</b> ratios are similar across age groups, men under 25 years reported the highest 12 -month prevalences for suicidal ideation (35. 4 %) and suicide attempts (11. 5 %) and the lowest attempt ratios (1 : 1. 5 for attempt to plan and 1 : 3. 1 for attempt to ideation).
