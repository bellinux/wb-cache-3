5|$|A {{capacity}} for aggressive behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted. Within groups, the animals are extremely <b>peaceful</b> and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not rigid and the animals easily share roles.|$|E
5|$|Although much of {{his life}} remains obscure, Nerva was {{considered}} a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. Nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a <b>peaceful</b> transition of power after his death by selecting Trajan as his heir, thus founding the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is about}} ten minutes walk from College and more <b>peaceful</b> than {{the middle of the}} city, it has become the {{principal}} choice of accommodation for Oriel's graduates and finalists. The site has its own common rooms, squash court, gymnasium and support staff.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the <b>peaceful</b> uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the <b>Peaceful</b> Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E

5|$|Following General Grant's 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were {{firmly in}} charge in Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this {{time away from}} the {{sensitive}} assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the Department of Dakota. The Department covered Minnesota, Montana, and the Dakotas. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a <b>peaceful</b> intent. Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed a massacre against the Blackfeet. Relations with the Sioux also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the Black Hills, in violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Still, war was averted, for the time being, and most of Hancock's command was <b>peaceful.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1843, the United States Navy {{launched}} its first iron warship, USS Michigan, on the Great Lakes. This pioneering iron-hulled, steam-powered ship served for 70 {{years in the}} relatively <b>peaceful</b> region.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the {{distinguished}} Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson promoted {{the ideas that}} Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by <b>peaceful</b> astronomer-priests. These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, and Yuri Knorozov. With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and {{the view of the}} Maya as <b>peaceful</b> could no longer be supported. Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations, putting an end to the vacant ceremonial centre model.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{continued}} {{to lead the}} Colorado River band of Mohave during the 1860s. He pursued <b>peaceful</b> relations with the surrounding tribes and cooperated actively with US authorities. He also helped the Yavapai and Walapai in ongoing conflicts with Paiutes and Chemehuevi.|$|E
5|$|Nations {{considered}} more <b>peaceful</b> have lower index scores. Countries with rankings in green {{are in the}} most <b>peaceful</b> 20% for that year; those in red are in the bottom 20%. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database {{to ensure that the}} scores were comparable over time. Several countries have been removed since 2008 {{due to the fact that}} the compilers agreed that the GPI would include nations, but not micro-states. Now, countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation {{reached the}} {{archipelago}} in 1560. This was an apparently <b>peaceful</b> transition {{and there is}} little evidence of religious intolerance in Shetland's recorded history.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{historically}} low {{crime rate}} was marred {{in the early}} 1990s, when teen gang violence made headlines, with fights and murders reported. The violence subsided and the city returned to its previously <b>peaceful</b> state in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The events {{shocked the}} small town of Lolol, a <b>peaceful</b> tourist location. The local mayor said the murders would become a {{demarcation}} point {{in the history of the}} place.|$|E
5|$|The <b>peaceful</b> {{nature of}} the U2 concert was fleeting, as {{violence}} flared up in the region the following year with the Kosovo War. NATO troops remained in Sarajevo until 2004, while European Union peace-keeping troops remain in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{striking}} electoral {{victory of}} Solidarity {{candidates in the}} limited elections, and the subsequent formation of the first non-communist government in the region in decades, encouraged many similar <b>peaceful</b> transitions from communist party rule in Central and Eastern Europe {{in the second half}} of 1989.|$|E
5|$|These elections, {{in which}} anti-communist {{candidates}} won a striking victory, inaugurated {{a series of}} <b>peaceful</b> anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated {{in the fall of}} communism.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent a}} future world war, the League of Nations was created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.

5|$|Violent ways of {{punishing}} {{criminals and}} {{prisoners of war}} was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism, but <b>peaceful</b> ways of conflict resolution and punishment with {{the least amount of}} injury were encouraged. The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.|$|E
5|$|Without British supplies, {{adequate}} provisions, or Native allies, Black Hawk {{realized that}} his band was in serious trouble. By some accounts, {{he was ready to}} negotiate with Atkinson to end the crisis, but an ill-fated encounter with Illinois militiamen would end all possibility of a <b>peaceful</b> resolution.|$|E
5|$|Writing for RT, Afshin Rattansi {{speculated that}} if 14 August protests are met with state violence, then {{it could be}} one of the last times Bahraini activists use <b>peaceful</b> means to seek {{democratic}} change and that other methods could include an armed struggle in the same way the anti-apartheid movement led by Nelson Mandela deployed armed tactics after <b>peaceful</b> protests failed to bring about change. Jean Shaoul wrote in the World Socialist Web Site that the concurrent timing of crackdown in Bahrain and Egypt was not a coincidence and that evidence showed it was coordinated by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} {{scholars}} in the December 1981 American Heritage Magazine ranked Fish number 3 {{on a list of}} top ten Secretary of States noting his settling of the Alabama Claims in 1871, for his <b>peaceful</b> settlement of the Virginius Incident obtaining Spanish reparations, and for his Hawaiian treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1875, starting the annexation process leading to the eventual statehood of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in 1963, FRELIMO set up {{headquarters}} in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, {{under the leadership}} of sociologist Eduardo Mondlane, and began to call for independence from Portugal.After two years of organisation and failing political manoeuvres in an attempt to seek a <b>peaceful</b> independence, Mondlane began in 1964 a campaign of guerrilla warfare in an attempt to achieve independence for Mozambique.|$|E
