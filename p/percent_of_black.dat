5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E

30|$|Drawing {{consistent}} inferences with schooling data drawn {{these two}} ways is in principle quite simple {{if the two}} types of questions have a similar structure of measurement error. Unfortunately, for the 1990 Census, Black et al. (2003) document that the education questions exhibit significant measurement error and that the degree of measurement error is correlated with race. Moreover, there was a dramatic increase in the educational attainment of Americans over the period. For instance, in 1940 88 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> and 64 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> whites between the ages of 25 and 60 did not have a high school education, and only 2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> and 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> whites had a bachelor’s degree or better. By 2000, only 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> and 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> whites did not have a high school degree while fully 33 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> whites and over 19 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> had a bachelor’s degree or better.|$|R

40|$|Diltiazem {{hydrochloride}} was {{studied in}} 133 patients with angina {{to determine whether}} differing effects were produced in <b>black</b> patients (39 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> patients) as compared with nonblack patients. The antihypertensive effect of the drug was also assessed. No {{statistically significant differences between}} the responses <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> and nonblacks were found in the reduction of angina frequency (54 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> improved, 58 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> nonblacks), nitroglycerin consumption (60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> used less, 66 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> nonblacks), and changes in lifestyle, as measured with the New York Heart Association scale (55 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> improved, 63 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> nonblacks). The antihypertensive effects (not analyzed by race) were greatest in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Average decreases in this group were 18 mmHg in supine systolic pressures and 14 mmHg in supine diastolic pressures, as compared with decreases of only 4 and 3 mmHg in normotensives. Study results suggest that there is a difference in the type <b>of</b> angina afflicting <b>blacks</b> and nonblacks, that hypertension more often accompanies angina in blacks, and that diltiazem is equally effective in treating angina in blacks and nonblacks...|$|R
25|$|In his 1985 statewide {{study of}} black slaveholders in South Carolina, Larry Koger {{challenged}} the benevolent view. He {{found that the}} majority of black slaveholders appeared to hold at least some of their slaves for commercial reasons. For instance, he noted that in 1850 more than 80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> slaveholders were of mixed race, but nearly 90 percent of their slaves were classified as black. Koger also noted that many South Carolina free blacks operated small businesses as skilled artisans, and many owned slaves working in those businesses.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the {{continued}} {{operation of a}} seemingly unfair draft system then calling as many as 40,000 men for induction each month fueled a burgeoning draft resistance movement. The draft favored white, middle-class men, which allowed an economically and racially discriminating draft to force young African American men to serve in rates that were disproportionately higher than the general population. Although in 1967 there was a smaller field of draft eligible black men–29 percent versus 63 percent of draft eligible white men–64 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> men were chosen {{to serve in the}} war through conscription, compared to only 31 percent of eligible white men.|$|E

50|$|The racial {{wage gap}} {{for blacks and}} whites has been {{observed}} to differ in {{the public and private}} sectors. In a 2001 analysis, a $3.65 difference per hour was found between blacks and whites in the private sector, a 34 percent difference. In contrast, a smaller difference of $2.85 per hour was found in the public sector, a 21 percent difference. For the 23 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> that work in the public sector, evidence suggests that wages are based primary on individual qualifications, but for the 77 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> employed in the private sector, this assertion has not been found to be as valid.|$|R

500|$|The U.S. population's {{perception}} of Black Lives Matter varies considerably by race. According to a September 2015 poll on race relations, {{nearly two-thirds of}} African Americans mostly agree with Black Lives Matter, while 42% of white Americans are unsure or {{do not have an}} opinion about Black Lives Matter. Of white people surveyed, 41% thought that Black Lives Matter advocated violence, and 59% of whites thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the real issues of racial discrimination. By comparison, 82% of black people polled thought that Black Lives Matter was a nonviolent movement, and 26% of blacks thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the real issues of racial discrimination. On the question of whether [...] "Black Lives Matter" [...] was mostly a movement or mostly a slogan, 46% of whites and 67% of blacks thought that it is mostly a movement. A similar poll in June 2016 found that 65% of black American adults supported Black Lives Matter and 40% of white American adults support it. Fifty-nine <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> Americans thought that Black Lives Matter would [...] "be effective, in the long run, in helping blacks achieve equality" [...] and 34% of white Americans thought so.

So many slaveholders in Virginia freed slaves following the Revolution (sometimes by will and others during their lifetime) that the number <b>of</b> free <b>blacks</b> in Virginia rose from about 1800 in 1782 to 30,466, or 7.2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> population in 1810.
