5|$|After {{leaving the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong {{assisted}} retired Filipino farmworkers in Delano, {{and was a}} delegate at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Together with Vera Cruz, Itliong worked towards building a retirement facility for UFW workers, known as Agbayani Village. Although {{no longer in the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong continued to support others in the organized labor movement, such as helping others plan a strike against Safeway supermarkets in 1974. Itliong also served as President of the Filipino American <b>Political</b> <b>Association,</b> a bipartisan lobbying organization. He died in 1977 at the age of 63 in Delano of Lou Gehrig's disease.|$|E
5|$|Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, {{whom they}} wanted to marginalise; they {{accused him of being}} a {{communist}} and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the French Community or British Commonwealth of Nations, and that close economic and <b>political</b> <b>association</b> with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in a broad MNC majority.|$|E

He later {{became a member of the}} Hui Kālaiʻāina (Hawaiian <b>Political</b> <b>Association),</b> a political group founded in 1888 to oppose the Bayonet Constitution and promote Native Hawaiian leadership in the government. After the adoption of the constitution, White gave a speech in Hilo speaking out against it. He criticized the exclusion of the Chinese and Japanese from the vote, especially focusing on the latter group because of Hawaii's treaty with the Empire of Japan. By 1890, he had returned to his native island of Maui.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and <b>political</b> <b>association.</b> The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} {{the rights of}} freedom of speech and peaceable assembly, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held that the right to assembly includes the freedom of association, particularly <b>political</b> <b>association.</b> These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the Bill of Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application of the Bill of Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E
5|$|During the Provisional Government of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii that {{followed}} it, he remained {{loyal to the}} monarchy. Returning to Lahaina, he helped organize native resistance on Maui and was arrested for running out a pro-annexationist pastor at Waineʻe Church. He was elected in 1896 as honorary president of the Hui Aloha ʻĀina (Hawaiian Patriotic League), a patriotic organization established after the overthrow to oppose annexation. In 1897 he became {{an editor of the}} short-lived anti-annexationist newspaper Ke Ahailono oHawaii (translated as The Hawaiian Herald) run by members of the Hui Kālaiʻāina (Hawaiian <b>Political</b> <b>Association).</b> Following the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, he was elected as a senator of the first Hawaiian Territorial legislature of 1901 for the Home Rule Party. Afterward, his political fortune declined with the party and his many attempts to win re-elections from 1902 to 1914 ended in defeats, although he was successfully elected the first Sheriff of Maui County for a brief period before his election was declared void due to inconsistencies in the 1903 County Act.|$|E

50|$|In Bahrain, {{political}} parties are illegal and only {{allowed to be}} known as <b>political</b> <b>associations.</b> Despite this these <b>political</b> <b>associations</b> have regular powers to put forward candidates for election and act as a parliamentary bloc. The law makes clear that financial resources of <b>political</b> <b>associations</b> should come from membership fees and contributions and from revenues of their investments in the Kingdom as defined by their internal regulations. A political society is under no circumstances allowed to accept any contribution, advantage or benefit from any foreigner or any foreign entity or international organisation. Women candidates therefore relied on financial support from sources such as the women's rights body, the Supreme Council for Women, which has also provided training to candidates.|$|R

5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived <b>political</b> <b>association,</b> was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{was little}} more than a <b>political</b> <b>association</b> until the Korean War {{galvanized}} the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.|$|E
