Shooting <b>preserve</b> users were commonly employed as professionals or proprietors, while non-users were often employed as craftsmen, proprietors, or operators. Most shooting <b>preserve</b> hunters hunted after the state game bird season was closed, and were generally satisfied with Utah <b>preserves.</b> Most hunters not using shooting <b>preserves</b> were very critical of the system, and claimed they would never hunt on a <b>preserve.</b> However, most non-users knew little about shooting <b>preserves</b> and were interested in having information about <b>preserves</b> in Utah.
