The E 2 enhancer protein of the papillomaviruses is required for viral DNA replication and transcription. Viral mutants that prevent phosphorylation of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV) E 2 protein are transformation-defective, despite normal viral gene expression and replication function. Cell colonies harboring such mutants show sectoring of viral DNA and are unable to maintain the episome. We find that transforming viral DNA attaches to mitotic chromosomes, {{in contrast to the}} mutant genome encoding the E 2 phosphorylation mutant. Second-site suppressor mutations were uncovered in both E 1 and E 2 genes that allow for transformation, maintenance, and chromosomal attachment. E 2 protein was also found to colocalize to mitotic chromosomes, whereas the mutant did not, suggesting a direct role for E 2 in viral attachment to chromosomes. Such viral hitch-hiking onto cellular chromosomes is likely to provide a general mechanism for maintaining nuclear plasmids...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal plasmid {{transfer}} plays a {{key role}} in bacterial adaptation. In harsh environments, bacterial populations adapt by sampling genetic material from a horizontal gene pool through self-transmissible plasmids, and that allows persistence of these mobile genetic elements. In the absence of selection for plasmid-encoded traits it is not well understood if and how plasmids persist in bacterial communities. Here we present three models of the dynamics of plasmid persistence in the absence of selection. The models consider <b>plasmid</b> loss (<b>segregation),</b> <b>plasmid</b> cost, conjugative plasmid transfer, and observation error. Also, we present a stochastic model in which the relative fitness of the plasmid-free cells was modeled as a random variable affected by an environmental process rising a hidden Markov model (HMM). Extensive simulations showed that the estimates from the proposed model are nearly unbiased. Likelihood-ratio tests showed that the dynamics of plasmid persistence are strongly dependent on the host type. Accounting for stochasticity was necessary to explain four of seven time-series data sets, thus confirming that plasmid persistence needs to be understood as a stochastic process. This work can be viewed as a conceptual starting point under which new plasmid persistence hypotheses can be tested...|$|R

50|$|ParM is a cytoskeletal {{element that}} {{possesses}} a similar structure to actin, although it behaves functionally like tubulin. Further, it polymerizes bidirectionally and it exhibits dynamic instability, which are both behaviors characteristic of tubulin polymerization. It forms {{a system with}} ParR and parC {{that is responsible for}} R1 plasmid separation. ParM affixes to ParR, a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds to 10 direct repeats in the parC region on the R1 plasmid. This binding occurs on both ends of the ParM filament. This filament is then extended, separating the plasmids. The system is analogous to eukaryotic chromosome segregation as ParM acts like eukaryotic tubulin in the mitotic spindle, ParR acts like the kinetochore complex, and parC acts like the centromere of the chromosome. F <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation</b> occurs in a similar system where SopA acts as the cytoskeletal filament and SopB binds to the sopC sequence in the F plasmid, like the kinetochore and centromere respectively.

40|$|Low-copy number <b>plasmids</b> need a <b>segregation</b> {{mechanism}} to assort {{one half of}} the plasmid copies to each daughter cell during cell division. This can be achieved directly by partitioning plasmid copies through a mechanism reminiscent of eukaryotic mitosis. Briefly, plasmid copies are paired around a centromere-like site, and then separated toward the daughter cells at cell division. Partition mechanisms are used by a majority of well-studied plasmids. They involve two proteins, a DNA-binding protein and a motor protein, besides the centromeric site. However, some plasmids do not encode typical partition systems, so alternative segregation mechanisms must be considered. For instance, chromosome segregation could provide the driving force for plasmid movement, through a ¿pilot-fish¿-like mechanism. In support of this assumption, we recently demonstrated that <b>plasmid</b> R 388 <b>segregation,</b> which does not involve a plasmidencoded motor protein, requires a single plasmid-encoded DNA-binding protein. Besides, the new segregation system becomes essential when the plasmid encodes conjugation machinery, providing a new understanding of how plasmids integrate conjugative transfer with segregation.

40|$|We here {{identify}} a protein (AlfA; actin like filament) that defines {{a new family}} of actins that are only distantly related to MreB and ParM. AlfA is required for segregation of Bacillus subtilis plasmid pBET 131 (a mini pLS 32 -derivative) during growth and sporulation. A 3 -kb DNA fragment encoding alfA and a downstream gene (alfB) is necessary and sufficient for plasmid stability. AlfA-GFP assembles dynamic cytoskeletal filaments that rapidly turn over (t 1 / 2 <∼ 45 s) in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. A point mutation (alfA D 168 A) that completely inhibits AlfA subunit exchange in vivo is strongly defective for <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation,</b> demonstrating that dynamic polymerization of AlfA is necessary for function.

Analysis of mutations in conserved residues of the Walker A motif established a functional coupling between filament dynamics and DNA partitioning. The partner partition protein ParG plays two separable roles in the ParF polymerization process. ParF is unrelated to prokaryotic polymerizing proteins of the actin or tubulin families, but is a homologue of the MinD cell division protein, which also assembles into filaments.

We previously showed that the segregation of EBV-based plasmids can be reconstituted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is absolutely dependent on EBNA 1, the EBV FR sequence, and the human EBNA 1 -binding protein 2 (EBP 2). We have now used this yeast system to elucidate the functional contribution of human EBP 2 to EBNA 1 -mediated plasmid partitioning. Human EBP 2 was found to attach to yeast mitotic chromosomes in a cell cycle-dependent manner and cause EBNA 1 to associate with the mitotic chromosomes. The domain of human EBP 2 that binds both yeast and human chromosomes was mapped and shown to be functionally distinct from the EBNA 1 -binding domain.

The derivatives were examined for the presence of a plasmid species which encodes for SEB production. Two distinct species of covalently closed circular DNA of about 2. 8 X 10 (6) and 0. 75 X 10 (6) daltons were identified in an ethidium bromide-cured, penicillinase-negative (pens) isolate, SN 109 (mecr tetr emtB+). Further segregation of either methicillin resistance or tetracycline resistance or of both together resulted in the loss of SEB production and the disappearance of both plasmids. Transduction from strain SN 109 showed that determinants for tetracycline resistance are carried by the 2. 8 X 10 (6) dalton plasmid. Transformation with covalently closed circular DNA from strain SN 109 yielded mecs tetr entB- transformants harboring the tetracycline resistance plasmid alone and mecr tetr entB+ transformants harboring both the tetracycline resistance and the 0. 75 X 10 (6) -dalton <b>plasmid.</b> Further <b>segregation</b> of methicillin resistance in transformants was not associated with any change in plasmid DNA.

ParF is a Walker-type ATPase of the ParA superfamily. ParG is a centromere binding protein and a transcriptional repressor of the parFG genes. ParF associates with ParG bound to parH forming the segrosome complex. It has been recently observed that ParF oscillates over the nucleoid {{in the presence of}} the entire parFGH system and oscillation is responsible for <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation.</b> ParG is a dimeric protein: each monomer consists of a folded ribbon-helix-helix domain and an unstructured N-terminal tail. ParG enhances ParF ATPase activity and promotes ParF self-assembly through its flexible N-terminus. In the present study, the role of the ParG N-terminus in plasmid partition was dissected. Residues crucial for plasmid partition were identified and found to form three clusters within the tail. One cluster is located at the extreme tip of the N-terminus that is the most flexible region. The second cluster is present in a linker-type region around amino acids 11 - 12 - 13 and the third is positioned in the arginine finger loop. When ParG mutant proteins were purified and characterised, they were all found to be efficient in DNA binding, transcriptional repression and in enhancing ParF polymerization. However, all the ParG mutants were impaired in stimulating ParF ATPase activity. Alteration of the residues in the tip and linker region resulted into a weaker interaction with ParF. The mutants were further investigated by using confocal and super resolution microscopy to visualize protein and plasmid positioning in the cell. Time-lapse experiments showed plasmids were static over time and that ParF oscillation over the nucleoid was abolished in the presence of mutant proteins. All the three clusters of the N-terminal tail are responsible for stimulating ParF ATPase activity and failure to do so may lead to lack of ParF oscillation. It is possible that the residues in the ParG N-terminus are strategically placed to carry out interaction and activation functions towards the common goal of coordinated interplay with ParF for efficient <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation.</b> The data indicate that, a functional ParG N-terminal tail is a prerequisite for ParF oscillation and <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation.</b> Based on these findings, a novel plasmid partition model is proposed which may apply to ParA-mediated partition in other plasmid systems. ...|$|E

Deletion of the first 76 amino acids of Rep 1 abolished the Rep 1 -Rep 2 interaction but still allowed some self-association, suggesting that different but overlapping domains specify these interactions. Amino- or carboxy-terminally truncated Rep 1 fusion proteins were unable to complement defective segregation of a 2 μm-based stability vector with rep 1 deleted, supporting {{the idea of the}} requirement of Rep protein interaction for <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation</b> but indicating a separate required function for the carboxy-terminal portion of Rep 1.

However, as described in the present work, many genetic operations can be performed in A. vinelandii without the constraints expected in a polyploid bacterium: (i) reversion of transposon-induced mutations is usually associated with loss of the transposable element; (ii) revertants retaining the transposon always carry secondary transpositions; (iii) heterozygotic transconjugants and transformants are unstable and segregate homozygotic colonies {{even in the absence of}} selection.

40|$|Background: Low-copy-number vectors of {{potential}} wide application in biotechnology need to encode stabilization modules ensuring their stable inheritance. The efficiency of stabilization may {{vary depending on}} the plasmid host so a thorough analysis of stabilization functions is required before use. Results: To facilitate such analysis highly unstable, mobilizable, broad-host-range (BHR) vectors based on RK 2 replicon were constructed. The vectors are suitable for testing of various stabilization functions, including plasmid and chromosomal partitioning cassettes encoding ParB homologues capable of spreading on DNA. The xylE or lacZ reporter systems facilitate easy monitoring of <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation.</b> Conclusion: The range of BHR vectors with different reporter cassettes and alternative mobilization systems expands their application in diverse bacterial species...|$|E
40|$|The 2 -μm yeast plasmid, {{a benign}} high-copy nuclear parasite, propagates itself with {{nearly the same}} {{fidelity}} as the chromosomes of its host. Equal <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation</b> is absolutely dependent on the cohesin complex assembled at the plasmid partitioning locus STB. However, the mechanism of cohesin action {{in the context of}} multiple plasmid copies, resident within two separate clusters after DNA replication, is unknown. By using “single-copy” derivatives of the 2 -μm plasmid, we demonstrate that recruitment of cohesin at STB during S phase indeed translates into cohesion between plasmid molecules. Through binary fluorescence tagging, we reveal that segregation of replicated plasmids occurs in a sister-to-sister fashion. Thus, cohesin serves the same fundamental purpose in plasmid and chromosome segregation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe actin-like protein ParM {{forms the}} cytomotive {{filament}} of the ParMRC system, a type II <b>plasmid</b> <b>segregation</b> system encoded by Escherichia coli R 1 plasmid. We report an 8. 5 Å resolution {{reconstruction of the}} ParM filament, obtained using cryo-electron microscopy. Fitting of the 3 D density reconstruction with monomeric crystal structures of ParM provides insights into dynamic instability of ParM filaments. The structural analysis suggests that a ParM conformation, corresponding to a metastable state, is held within the filament by intrafilament contacts. This filament conformation of ParM can be attained only from the ATP-bound state, and induces a change in conformation of the bound nucleotide. The structural analysis also provides a rationale for the observed stimulation of hydrolysis upon polymerisation into the filament...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-sensitive (Ts) mutant {{plasmids}} {{isolated from}} tetracycline resistance R plasmid pSC 101 were investigated for their segregation kinetics and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. The results fit {{well with the}} hypothesis that multiple copies of a plasmid are distributed to daughter cells in a random fashion and are thus diluted out when {{a new round of}} plasmid DNA replication is blocked. When cells harboring type I mutant plasmids were grown at 43 degrees C in the absence of tetracycline, antibiotic-sensitive cells were segregated after a certain lag time. This lag most likely corresponds to a dilution of plasmids existing prior to the temperature shift. The synthesis of plasmid DNA in cells harboring type I mutant plasmids was almost completely blocked at 43 degrees C. It seems that these plasmids have mutations in the gene(s) necessary for plasmid DNA replication. Cells haboring a type II mutant <b>plasmid</b> exhibited neither <b>segregation</b> due to antibiotic sensitivity nor inhibition of plasmid DNA replication throughout cultivation at high temperature. It is likely that the type II mutant plasmid has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the tetracycline resistance gene. Antibiotic-sensitive cells haboring type III mutant plasmids appeared at high frequency after a certain lag time, and the plasmid DNA synthesis was partially suppressed at the nonpermissive temperature. They exhibited also a pleiotrophic phenotype, such as an increase of drug resistance level at 30 degrees C and a {{decrease in the number of}} plasmid genomes in a cell...|$|R
40|$|Forward {{metabolic}} engineering (FME) is {{a rational}} approach to cellular engineering, relying on {{an understanding of}} the entire metabolic network to direct perturbations for phenotype improvement. Conversely, inverse metabolic engineering (IME) uses a global, combinatorial approach to identify genetic loci that are important for a given phenotype. These two approaches complement each other in a strain improvement program. FME and IME approaches were applied to poly- 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production in Synechocystis PCC 6803 [IME] and recombinant E. coli [FME] in this thesis. IME was appropriate for Synechocystis, where metabolic regulation of the native PHB pathway was not well understood. A high throughput screening method was established by developing a staining protocol that quantitatively related nile red fluorescence to PHB content, while maintaining cell viability for both organisms. This was combined with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to screen for high PHB mutants. A Synechocystis insertion mutagenesis library was screened to identify gene disruptions that increased PHB. Two gene disruptions in proline biosynthesis and an unknown function were identified and characterized. An analogous IME study in E. coli did not find increased PHB mutants, but suggested an FME approach on the PHB pathway. Systematic overexpression of the pathway revealed phaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, limited PHB flux. Beyond this, whole operon overexpression led to even higher PHB fluxes. In a nitrogen-limited chemostat, PHB flux did not change with dilution rate. Unlike prior pleiotropic perturbations, these systematic experiments could clearly conclude that the flux control is in the PHB pathway. At high PHB flux, growth rate was extremely hindered and was accompanied by PHB plasmid genetic instability and rapid PHB productivity loss. (cont.) Tandem gene duplication (TGD) was developed to slow productivity loss caused by "allele segregation," a fast process that propagates a DNA mutation to all copies of a plasmid. By placing the many copies in tandem, rather than on individual <b>plasmids,</b> allele <b>segregation</b> could be avoided, increasing stability significantly. These methods and results should support PHB engineering in higher photosynthetic organisms and better E. coli PHB production in batch or continuous culture. TGD is a broadly applicable technique for high level recombinant expression. by Keith E. J. Tyo. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, 2008.

40|$|International audienceUnlike most bacteria, Vibrio cholerae harbors two distinct, nonhomologous {{circular}} chromosomes (chromosome I and II). Many {{features of}} chromosome II are plasmid-like, which raised questions concerning its chromosomal nature. <b>Plasmid</b> replication and <b>segregation</b> {{are generally not}} coordinated with the bacterial cell cycle, further calling into question the mechanisms ensuring the synchronous management of chromosome I and II. Maintenance of circular replicons requires the resolution of dimers created by homologous recombination events. In Escherichia coli, chromosome dimers are resolved {{by the addition of}} a crossover at a specific site, dif, by two tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD. The process is coordinated with cell division through the activity of a DNA translocase, FtsK. Many E. coli plasmids also use XerCD for dimer resolution. However, the process is FtsK-independent. The two chromosomes of the V. cholerae N 16961 strain carry divergent dimer resolution sites, dif 1 and dif 2. Here, we show that V. cholerae FtsK controls the addition of a crossover at dif 1 and dif 2 by a common pair of Xer recombinases. In addition, we show that specific DNA motifs dictate its orientation of translocation, the distribution of these motifs on chromosome I and chromosome II supporting the idea that FtsK translocation serves to bring together the resolution sites carried by a dimer at the time of cell division. Taken together, these results suggest that the same FtsK-dependent mechanism coordinates dimer resolution with cell division for each of the two V. cholerae chromosomes. Chromosome II dimer resolution thus stands as a bona fide chromosomal process...|$|R
