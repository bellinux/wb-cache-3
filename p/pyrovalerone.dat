500|$|In Canada, {{mephedrone}} is {{not explicitly}} listed in any schedule of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, but [...] "amphetamines, their salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues" [...] {{are included in}} Section 19 of Schedule I of the act. Cathinone and methcathinone are listed in separate sections of Schedule III, while diethylpropion and <b>pyrovalerone</b> (also cathinones), are listed in separate sections of Schedule IV, each without language to capture analogues, isomers, etc. Mephedrone is considered a controlled substance by Health Canada. According to the Canadian Medical Association, mephedrone is grouped with other amphetamines as Schedule I controlled substances. There have been several media reports of the Canadian police seizing mephedrone. Mephedrone is also currently scheduled in the United States as of 2011. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) states, as an analogue of methcathinone, possession of mephedrone can be controlled by the Federal Analog Act, {{but according to the}} Los Angeles Times, this only applies if it is sold for human consumption. Several cities and states, such as New York state, have passed legislation to specifically list mephedrone as illegal, but in most areas it remained legal, so long as it is not sold for human consumption, so retailers described it as 'bath salts'. In September 2011, The DEA began using its emergency scheduling authority to temporarily control mephedrone. Except as authorised by law, this action made possessing and selling mephedrone or the products that contain it illegal in the US for at least one year while the DEA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services conduct further study. Control of these compounds became permanent on 9 July 2012, via passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012.|$|E

40|$|This PhD work {{consists}} of an in vitro and in vivo part. In the in vivo part, we investigated the role of dopamine in the acute clinical effects of 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) in healthy human subjects. The role of dopamine in the addictive effects of drug of abuse is well established, but whether it contributes to the acute psychotropic effects of MDMA is unclear. In this pharmacological interaction study, we used the dopamine and weak norepinephrine transporter inhibitor bupropion (Stahl et al. 2004) as a pharmacological tool to block the MDMA-induced dopamine release and to study the role of dopamine in the effects of MDMA. We hypothesized that bupropion would decrease the subjective effects of MDMA {{to the extent that}} they depend on MDMA-induced release of dopamine. We included 16 healthy human subjects in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Bupropion pretreatment slightly increased MDMA plasma concentration and prolonged but not reduced the subjective effects contrary to our hypothesis. Additionally, bupropion reduced the MDMA-induced elevations in plasma norepinephrine concentrations and the heart rate response to MDMA. These findings support a role for norepinephrine in the MDMA-induced cardiostimulant effects but no role for MDMA-induced transporter-mediated dopamine release in the elevated mood effects after MDMA administration. Possibly, most of the acute psychotropic effects of MDMA are mediated via transporter-mediated release of serotonin and norepinephrine as previously shown (Hysek et al. 2011, Hysek et al. 2012). In the second and main part of this work we characterized the pharmacological profiles of novel psychoactive substances (NPS). Specifically, we studied whether and how potently NPS interacted with the human transporters for norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Additionally, we assessed binding affinity to the serotonin 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 C-receptors and the activation potency and activation efficacy at 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors. Furthermore, binding to alpha 1 A/ 2 A-adrenergic, dopamine D 1 - 3, histamine H 1 receptors, as well as trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR 1) was also assessed. The NPS studied in this project included para- 4 -halogenated amphetamine derivatives, which were shown to be relatively more serotonergic than their non- 4 -halogenated counterparts and pyrovaleronering-substituted cathinones, which were highly potent dopamine transporter inhibitors with a high risk for abuse. Para-halogenated drugs (4 -fluoroephedrine, 4 -fluoroamphetamine, 4 -fluoromethamphetamine, 4 -fluoromethcathinone, and 4 -bromomethcathinone) also released monoamines, similar to MDMA, whereas <b>pyrovalerones</b> were found to be pure uptake inhibitors. Most benzofurans were similar to MDMA but slightly more serotoninergic than MDMA and additionally activated the serotonin 5 -HT 2 B receptor. The last big group of NPS studied in this project, were novel hallucinogens, which predominantly interacted with the 5 -HT 2 A receptor. This serotonin receptor subtype mediates the hallucinogenic and hallucinogenic-like visual effects of classic serotonergic hallucinogens (Vollenweider et al. 1998, Nichols 2004, Halberstadt et al. 2013, Halberstadt et al. 2014, Halberstadt 2015). Compounds tested in this project included the benzodifuran 8 -Bromo- 2, 3, 6, 7 -benzo-dihydro-difuran-ethylamine (2 C-B-FLY), 2 C-drugs with their highly potent N-(2 -methoxy) benzyl (NBOMe) -derivatives, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Interestingly, NBOMe derivatives displayed higher affinities at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor than LSD, together with a high selectivity for 5 -HT 2 A over the 5 -HT 1 A receptor, contrary to LSD. NBOMes were partial 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonists, similar to LSD. These novel drugs likely carry a high hallucinogenic potential when used recreationally by humans and the high binding to α 1 A-receptor (Ki < 1 µM) may result in additional vasocontrictive and cardiovascular stimulant effects. Taken together, this PhD contributed to the understanding of the role of dopamine in the effects of MDMA, an important recreational substances. Additionally, we characterized the in vitro pharmacology of many novel designer drugs, which will be helpful in the prediction of the clinical toxicological effects of these newly used recreational drugs. ...|$|R

Anyway, a short time after mephedrone and methylone were banned (which had become quite popular {{by the time they were}} illegalized), naphyrone appeared under the trade name NRG-1.

50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and <b>pyrovalerone.</b> The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacology}} {{of novel}} psychoactive substances is mostly unknown. We evaluated the transporter and receptor interaction profiles {{of a series}} of para-(4) -substituted amphetamines and <b>pyrovalerone</b> cathinones. We tested the potency of these compounds to inhibit the norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5 -HT) transporters (NET, DAT, and SERT, respectively) using human embryonic kidney 293 cells that express the respective human transporters. We also tested the substance-induced efflux of NE, DA, and 5 -HT from monoamine-loaded cells, binding affinities to monoamine receptors, and 5 -HT 2 B receptor activation. Para-(4) -substituted amphetamines, including 4 -methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), 4 -ethylmethcathinone, 4 -fluoroamphetamine, 4 -fluoromethamphetamine, 4 -fluoromethcatinone (flephedrone), and 4 -bromomethcathinone, were relatively more serotonergic (lower DAT:SERT ratio) compared with their analogs amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methcathinone. The 4 -methyl, 4 -ethyl, and 4 -bromo groups resulted in enhanced serotonergic properties compared with the 4 -fluoro group. The para-substituted amphetamines released NE and DA. 4 -Fluoramphetamine, 4 -flouromethamphetamine, 4 -methylmethcathinone, and 4 -ethylmethcathinone also released 5 -HT similarly to 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The <b>pyrovalerone</b> cathinones 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone, <b>pyrovalerone,</b> α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone, and 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinobutiophenone potently inhibited the NET and DAT but not the SERT. Naphyrone was the only <b>pyrovalerone</b> that also inhibited the SERT. The <b>pyrovalerone</b> cathinones did not release monoamines. Most of the para-substituted amphetamines exhibited affinity for the 5 -HT 2 A receptor but no relevant activation of the 5 -HT 2 B receptor. All the cathinones exhibited reduced trace amine-associated receptor 1 binding compared with the non-β-keto-amphetamines. In conclusion, para-substituted amphetamines exhibited enhanced direct and indirect serotonergic agonist properties and are likely associated with more MDMA-like effects.
