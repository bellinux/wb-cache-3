Stroke Play allows up to 4 {{players to}} compete on a round of 9 or 18 holes on any chosen course with {{variable}} difficulty settings (tee color, <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> etc.). All golfers use their own ball. The player numbers determine who tees off first on the first hole, but after the first hole, the player with the lowest score tees off first, then the second lowest score and so on. After the initial tee shot, the player furthest from the hole takes their shot next. However many shots or [...] "strokes" [...] the player takes is recorded on the scorecard after each hole.|$|E

50|$|The 7th hole {{is a short}} par 4, with {{a slight}} dogleg right and out of bounds along the entire right side, as well as very small lateral hazard short {{and to the right}} of the green. The <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> is visible on the walk to the tee, but the view of the green is blocked from the tee by large pine trees. The ground between the tee box and {{approximately}} 70 yards short of the green includes a significant elevation drop into a ravine-like stream bed. Thus, any tee shot which doesn't carry to the other side of the valley can roll back down the fairway, leaving a blind second shot. However, a well struck tee shot can make this hole drivable, and one of the better birdie opportunities, particularly since shots which are just left of the green tend to bounce right.|$|E

30|$|Most {{unilateral}} systems {{exist as}} one of two types: a construct that is preassembled or comes ready assembled before application (and often incorporates design features that facilitate fracture reduction and dynamisation); {{and one that is}} assembled from components after pin insertion. The latter type has gained popularity for it provides the surgeon freedom of choosing <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> and configuring the fixator assembly according to the clinical problem, but this utility of using ‘snap-on’ components and ‘free-style’ assembly has disadvantages — the inexperienced user who is enamoured by this freedom risks applying a fixator that can be inherently unstable.|$|E

Furthermore, both the lateral entry and the medial–lateral entry techniques were standardized in terms of pin size, <b>pin</b> <b>location,</b> and the position of the elbow for medial pin placement. Full clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed at regular intervals. The major limitation of the study was the small number of cases in each group. A randomized controlled trial (possibly triple blind) involving a large number of patients with long-term follow-up is clearly needed to clarify {{the differences between the two}} techniques.|$|E

For unidirectional radiation, a slot requires a back reflector {{close to the}} aperture. Unfortunately, the resulting parallel plate structure enables parasitic parallel plate mode propagation resulting in a low radiation efficiency. In this contribution we investigate unidirectional, low profile slot configurations with parallel plate mode suppression by shorting pins. Starting with a parametric study {{on the effects of}} shorting <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> and back reflector distance, we present a bow tie slot element with 85 % efficiency.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} {{of how a}} single vortex line in superfluid helium interacts with a macroscopic bump on the chamber wall. At a general level our measurements confirm computational work on vortex pinning by a hemispherical bump, {{but not all the}} details agree. Rather than observing a unique <b>pin</b> <b>location,</b> we find that a given applied velocity field can support pinning at multiple sites along the bump, both near its apex and near its edge. We also find that pinning is less favorable than expected. A vortex can pass near or even traverse the bump itself with or without pinning, depending on its path of approach to the bump.

There exist multiple floorplan, routing, and pin distribution layers in SOP. The purpose of SOP channel assignment is to finish the connection between a pair of floorplan and pin distribution layers.

Depending on the <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> {{with respect}} {{to the center of the}} disk, the {{reciprocation}} frequency, and the rotational speed of the disk, a wide range of complex motions are possible. Tribological testing can be performed at contact loads up to 400 N, at speeds up to 80 m/s, and temperatures of 600 oC in superheated steam. Due to complex motions, the measurement of friction force becomes challenging. To properly monitor the normal force and the friction force along two orthogonal axes, three force transducers are used. This unique design allows for the determination of tribological performance of advanced materials and coatings under conditions that simulate those encountered in small steam engines currently under development...|$|E

40|$|A block-level {{placement}} and routing scheme called Fishbone is presented. The routing uses a two-layer spine topology. The <b>pin</b> <b>locations</b> are configurable and restricted to certain routing grids {{in order to}} ensure full routability and precise predictability. With this scheme, exact net topologies are determined by pin positions only; hence during block placement, net parameters such as wire length (and delay) can be derived directly.

40|$|Slots in {{metallic}} ground {{planes are}} very promising candidates for conformal antenna applications. However, a low-profile unidirectional antenna requires a back reflector {{close to the}} slot and the resulting stripline feed causes strong excitation of parallel-plate modes. In this contribution, we consider unidirectional reflector-backed slot configurations with parallel-plate mode suppression by shorting pins. Starting from a parametric study with respect to shorting <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> and back reflector distance, we present a stripline-fed rectangular slot element with radiation efficiency of more than 80 % and a bandwidth of about 5 % at centre frequency 10 GHz. A careful optimisation of shorting pin locations guarantees reliable parallel-plate mode suppression without deteriorating the slot radiation behaviour. Coupling coefficients between parallel and aligned rectangular slot elements are presented. For increased bandwidth applications, a bow-tie slot element with about 8 % bandwidth and radiation efficiency of close to 80 % is proposed...|$|E

Dorsiflexion-plantar flexion and supination-pronation were simulated and the reference <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> in three dimen-sional space was determined. Comparing the location of the reference pins at each simulated position, motion was determined. Motion occurring through each articulation (dorsiflexion-plantar flexion/supination-pronation) in de-grees was: talonavicular (7. 0 / 17. 7), calcaneocuboid (2. 3 / 7. 3), naviculo-medial cuneiform (5. 0 / 7. 3), naviculo-middle cuneiform (5. 2 / 3. 5), naviculo-lateral cuneiform (2. 6 / 2. 1), medial cuneiform-first metatarsal (3. 5 / 1. 5), middle cunei-form-second metatarsal (0. 6 / 1. 2), lateral cuneiform-third metatarsal (1. 6 / 2. 6), cuboid-fourth metatarsal (9. 6 / 11. 1), and cuboid-fifth metatarsal (10. 2 / 9. 0) ...|$|E
40|$|As a {{solid-state}} welding technology, {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) {{can join}} dissimilar materials with good mechanical properties. In this paper, friction stir welding between 304 L stainless steel and commercially pure copper plates with thicknesses of 3 mm was performed.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} an alignment jig/saw guide to reproduce appropriate osteotomy positions in the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) in the dog. Lateral radiographs of 65 clinical TPLO procedures using an alignment jig and freehand osteotomy performed by experienced TPLO surgeons using a 24 mm radial saw blade between Dec 2005 -Dec 2007 and Nov 2013 -Nov 2015 were reviewed. The freehand osteotomy position was compared to potential osteotomy positions using the alignment jig/saw guide. The proximal and distal jig pin holes on postoperative radiographs were used to align the jig to the bone; saw guide position was selected to most closely match the osteotomy performed. The guide-to-osteotomy fit was categorized by {{the distance between the}} actual osteotomy and proposed saw guide osteotomy at its greatest offset (≤ 1 mm = excellent; ≤ 2 mm = good; ≤ 3 mm = satisfactory; > 3 mm = poor). Sixty-four of 65 TPLO osteotomies could be matched satisfactorily by the saw guide. Proximal jig pin placement 3 - 4 mm from the joint surface and <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> in a craniocaudal plane on the proximal tibia were significantly associated with the guide-to-osteotomy fit (P = 0. 021 and P = 0. 047, respectively). The alignment jig/saw guide can be used to reproduce appropriate freehand osteotomy position for TPLO. Furthermore, an ideal osteotomy position centered on the tibial intercondylar tubercles also is possible. Accurate placement of the proximal jig pin is a crucial step for correct positioning of the saw guide in either instance...|$|E
40|$|To {{introduce}} a technique for {{the diagnosis of}} interosseous ligament (IOL) disruption based on lateral displacement of the radius after radial head resection and to determine the cutoff value of the lateral displacement for the diagnosis of disruption, the best elbow position for testing, and the diagnostic performance of the technique in different positions. We used 10 fresh-frozen cadavers. After resection of the radial head, a Steinman pin was placed into the radius medullary canal and used to mark the <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> on the capitellum. We applied 1 kg force to pull the proximal radius laterally and measured the displacement in full supination, neutral, and full pronation of the forearm with the elbow in extension and then in 90 ° flexion. All measurements were performed once with the IOL intact and again with it cut. To assess diagnostic efficacy, receiver operating characteristics curves were constructed. To determine {{the quality of the}} technique, we measured the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for each position. We also determined the cutoff value to obtain the highest sensitivity and specificity. The area under the curve of the test in extension-supination and flexion-supination showed that these positions were excellent for the diagnosis of IOL disruption. The cutoff value of 5. 5 mm lateral displacement in extension-supination had 100 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity. In flexion-supination, the cutoff value of 9 mm had 100 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity for the diagnosis of IOL disruption. This maneuver was reliable and accurate in cadavers with complete IOL disruption. It is likely that in an intraoperative setting, these results will be reproducible. Diagnostic I...|$|E
