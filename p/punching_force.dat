40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental research}} results and their analysis {{in respect of}} flat reinforced concrete slabs resting on point supports or soil in case of concentrated <b>punching</b> <b>force.</b> However the conducted researches have shown a number of incompatibilities accepted in computational model standards that appear {{in the form of}} critical parameters in the punching zone and configuration of computational (critical) sections in comparison with an actual pattern of slab crack formation and their collapse in the places of concentrated force application. Moreover, the computational methods do not take into account at all an influence of longitudinal reinforcement on both principal axis of the building frame or take it into account this phenomenon by empirical dependence indirectly. In view of the above-mentioned facts an accumulation of new experimental data is considered as an expedient process with the purpose to identify a physical pattern of flat reinforced concrete slabs operation under concentrated <b>punching</b> <b>force.</b> The paper makes it possible to revise a calculative methodology and, preserving a high reliability, it also permits to improve efficiency of a floor construction of the whole framework. It has been determined that longitudinal reinforcement of reinforced concrete slabs is actively involved in their work under concentrated <b>punching</b> <b>force</b> and exerts a prominent influence on their resistance to <b>punching</b> <b>force.</b> The paper presents a possible approach pertaining to evaluation of a longitudinal reinforcement influence on resistance of reinforced concrete slabs to <b>punching</b> <b>force</b> with due account of regulations of the appropriate standardized documents.  </p...|$|E

Measurements were made using a proprietary system that records the <b>force</b> associated with <b>punch</b> impact. Twelve boxers wore boxing gloves incorporating the bestshot System TM in six professional boxing matches across five different weight classes.

40|$|Abstract — Deep Drawing is {{a widely}} used sheet metal shape {{transformation}} process with material retention. From Automobile components to plumbing and sanitary ware, this process is used for mass production of industrial and domestic artifacts with the depth greater than corresponding diameter. Deep drawing process using a die-punch pair on a press induces radial stresses on flange region and compressive stresses {{on the center of}} a blank to provide a permanent shape change. The production quality and cost associated depend upon obtained thickness distribution and an accurate prediction of formability. This demands a coherent set of correlations between various parameters associated with deep drawing. This study reviews various theoretical and experimental attempts made to connect <b>punching</b> <b>force,</b> blank holding force, dome height, thickness of blank etc. with thickness distribution on final products. The focus is also drawn onto various modes of failures for different shapes of products and associated problems including creasing and wrinkling, crushing and cracking of sheet metal parts.

40|$|Aim: Experimental {{determination}} of the shear stress for punching meniscal tissue. Methods: Meniscectomy (surgical treatment of a lesion {{of one of the}} menisci) is the most frequently performed arthroscopic procedure. The performance of a meniscectomy is not optimal with the currently available instruments. To design new instruments, the <b>punching</b> <b>force</b> of meniscal tissue is an important parameter. Quantitative data are unavailable. The meniscal punching process was simulated by pushing a rod through meniscal tissue at constant speed. Three punching rods were tested: a solid rod of Oslash; 3. 00 mm, and two hollow tubes (Oslash; 3. 00 - 2. 60 mm) with sharpened cutting edges of 0. 15 mm and 0. 125 mm thick, respectively. Nineteen menisci acquired from 10 human cadaveric knee joints were punched (30 tests). The force and displacement were recorded from which the maximum shear stress was determined (average added with three times the standard deviation). Results: The maximum shear stress for the solid rod was determined at 10. 2 N/mm 2. This rod required a significantly lower punch force in comparison with the hollow tube having a 0. 15 mm cutting edge (plt; 0. 01).

Copper clad laminate is a main raw material for consumer electronics, information and telecommunications devices.

The proposed system consists of small-scale force transducer, displacement transducer and data acquisition system, with which the punching forces can be measured in each punch steps. A small punch with outer diameter 2 mm is directly connected to the force transducer to measure the pushing and pulling forces during the hole-punching process. Bushings and guide pins are used inside the die configuration in order to ensure path straightness when the punch moves into the die cavity. The experimental results show that the increase of punch and die clearances decreases the punching forces. The same result is obtained with increase of blank temperatures.

The studies involved three boxers: age 18. 1 ± 0. 4 years, body height 186. 7 ± 6. 1 cm, weight 81. 3 ± 0. 6 kg (Measurement I), 80. 9 ± 3. 3 kg (Measurement II), 80. 7 ± 5. 6 kg (Measurement III), training experience 3. 5 ± 1. 8 years. Body weight did not change significantly during training season. Measurements of maximal <b>punching</b> <b>force</b> and reaction time was carried out on a boxing dynamometer. Each participants performed five punches of rear and lead hand (hook and straight punches) from a typical for himself boxing position and test of simulated boxing fight lasts 60 seconds. Three measurements were carried out: Measurement I – before first starting period, Measurement II – after first starting period, Measurement III – before second preparation period. The maximal straight punching forces were 1634. 7 ± 674. 0 N for lead hand, and 2899. 7 ± 457. 9 N for rear hand. The maximal hook punching forces were 2645. 0 ± 1122. 4 N for lead hand, and 2820. 7 ± 766. 5 N for rear hand. Significant differences were observed between lead and rear hands for straight (all measurements) and hook (Measurement III during the simulated boxing fight) punches. Force of the blow inflicted on the rear limb changed significantly between the first and third and the second and third measurement in the training season. In conclusion, in the analyzed training period occurred insignificant prolongation of reaction time, accompanied by a significant increase in force of the blow hit the rear limb during the test of simulated 60 -seconds of the fight...|$|E
40|$|Varying {{the blank}} holder force during forming {{can lead to}} higher {{formability}} and accuracy, and better part consistency. Process control, using on-line adjustment of the blank holder force to follow a reference process variable (e. g., the <b>punch</b> <b>force,</b> the draw-in, etc.) trajectory {{has been applied to}} sheet metal forming. However, process controller design has not been thoroughly addressed. In this paper, the essential part for systematic process controller design, i. e., modeling a sheet metal forming process, will be addressed in terms of control terminology (e. g., the process model, the model uncertainty and the disturbance). A process model for u-channel forming, i. e., a mathematical relationship between the blank holder <b>force</b> and the <b>punch</b> <b>force,</b> is presented and experimentally validated. Characterization of the model uncertainty mainly due to small variations in blank size, sheet thickness, material properties and tooling shape due to die wear and the disturbance which is mainly due to friction is developed. �S 1087 - 1357 � 00 � 01304 - 6 �...|$|R
50|$|In {{the deep}} drawing process, a blank of sheet metal (usually circular) {{is placed on}} the die. The die is fixed to the base. The metal blank is held in {{position}} on the die using blank holder. Mechanical force is applied {{on the part of the}} metal blank above the die cavity through a punch. As the <b>punch</b> <b>force</b> increases the metal flows from the flange region in to the die cavity.|$|R
50|$|After two {{comeback}} knockout wins, Williams boxed {{former world}} champion Mike Tyson in Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville, Kentucky in July 2004. After staggering Williams numerous {{times in the}} first round, Tyson began to tire in the fourth round, when Williams threw a torrent of <b>punches,</b> <b>forcing</b> Tyson to go down. Tyson was counted out sitting {{with his back to}} the ropes and made no attempt to get to his feet while looking up at the referee.|$|R
