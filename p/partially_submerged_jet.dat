40|$|Three {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments were run, varying the flume water discharge and the downstream water depth, to investigate local scouring downstream of a trapezoidal drop {{followed by a}} rigid apron. Three different kinds of jets, developing downstream of the drop, were observed: a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet,</b> a surface wave jet, and an oscillating jet. The oscillating jet {{is defined as a}} jet which changes intermittently between a surface wave <b>jet</b> and a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet.</b> A different development of the scouring process due to the different kinds of jet was observed: a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> produced a local scouring with a downstream dune, while a surface wave jet produced a local scouring with both an upstream and a downstream dune; the scouring process due to the oscillating jet {{was the result of the}} interaction of the scouring processes due to a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> and a surface wave jet. A stability analysis of the surface wave jet was performed, with both a flat and a scoured bed, by means of the modified De Saint - Venant equations, that is, with correction terms accounting for the curvature of the streamlines. The stability of the surface wave jet is affected by the presence of the scoured bed, which weakens its stability properties...|$|R

40|$|A <b>partially</b> <b>submerged</b> {{propeller}} {{theory was}} developed by employing a singularity distribution method. Unsteady pressure doublets and pressure sources represented the blade camber and blade-and-cavity thickness respectively. The induced velocities were derived by reducing the formula to a lifting-line configuration. The free-surface effect was considered by use of the image method. The induced velocities contained the singular integrals of 5 th order, which are usually numerical unstable. An {{effort was made to}} derive numerically stable formulae from these singular equations by applying a method similar to the induction-factor method of Morgan & Wrench (1965) and Lerbs (1952) used for steady-state fully wetted propeller problems. These new formulae are not only applicable to the present <b>partially</b> <b>submerged</b> ventilated propeller problem, but also to general unsteady subcavitating and cavitating propeller problems such as propeller starting-up and non-periodic loading problems. By combining the two-dimensional water entry-and-exit theory of Wang (1979), the thrust and torque coefficients were calculated for representative <b>partially</b> <b>submerged</b> propellers and favourably compared with the experimental data...|$|R
