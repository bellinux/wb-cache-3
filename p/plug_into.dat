5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane <b>plug</b> <b>into</b> the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Dugan {{demonstrated}} an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to <b>plug</b> <b>into</b> the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer {{such as the}} O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D. This card, the Dugan-MY16, could mix up to 16 channels of microphone inputs, assigned to selected inserts in the mixer's graphic user interface. Like the Model E-1, the automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface, allowing remote control with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network. The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-eeries of mixers in March 2014, as an option on the graphic equalizer processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones.|$|E

25|$|The first {{electric}} instrument amplifiers {{were not}} intended for electric guitars, but were portable PA systems. These {{appeared in the}} early 1930s when the introduction of electrolytic capacitors and rectifier tubes enabled economical built-in power supplies that could <b>plug</b> <b>into</b> wall sockets. Previously, amplifiers required heavy multiple battery packs. People used these amplifiers to amplify acoustic guitar, but electronic amplification of guitar first became widely poplular in the 1930s and 1940s craze for Hawaiian music, which extensively used amplified lap steel guitars.|$|E

By default, Chromecasts connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection to the user's local network; a standalone USB power supply with an Ethernet port, introduced in July 2015 for US$15, allows for a wired connection.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which <b>plug</b> <b>into</b> a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to <b>plug</b> <b>into</b> the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into the converter box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any need to use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E
25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on kovar sealable borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which <b>plug</b> <b>into</b> a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.|$|E

500|$|Internally, the Odyssey {{architecture}} {{is composed of}} digital computing parts.

These cards modify the internal circuitry like a set of switches or jumpers, causing the Odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently.

His departure affected the sound of Rather Ripped, with singer and guitarist Thurston Moore stating that the new record [...] "is just a far more straight up rock and roll album", in contrast to the [...] "darker, twisted, complex quality" [...] of O'Rourke's contributions. Moore also explained that he decided to write simpler songs [...] "for everybody to <b>plug</b> <b>into</b> immediately". The album's working titles were Sonic Life and Do You Believe in Rapture?
