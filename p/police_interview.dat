5|$|Much of Alvarado's trial {{focused on}} whether Alvarado was in custody or not during his <b>police</b> <b>interview.</b> According to Thompson v.

Farrar had taken Tim and Kelly to the hockey game, while Green took Kate to ballet lessons. The family regrouped around 9 p.m. when Tim and Kelly were dropped back at the Prairie Village house for dinner.|$|E

40|$|Familiarising {{researchers}} and practitioners with different countries' policies for <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> with children contributes to {{an exchange of}} knowledge and strengthens global approaches against child abuse. We start by describing the system of videotaped testimonies in Cyprus during the first 10 [*]years of this system's implementation. We then continue on {{to the effects of}} tourism on <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> with children. <b>Police</b> forces in destinations with high tourist numbers need to comprehend how tourist seasons could influence <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> with children. No studies investigated whether children of tourists testified in police departments during their holidays. We explored how tourist seasons affected the number of testimonies obtained by Cyprus police forces, taking into account the presence of non-Cypriot and non-native speaking children, the number of testimonies taken in languages other than Greek, and the presence of translators during the interviews. We analysed the national sample of <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> with children for a period of a decade using official police records and copies of transcripts of children's testimonies. As expected, the results revealed no significant differences in <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> with children during tourist seasons but show a slight {{increase in the number of}} interviews with non-Cypriot children during tourist season...|$|R

5|$|At {{the age of}} 15 he was an {{offered a}} trial at Leeds United, where his uncle Jim was left back, but turned it down and instead joined his father in the mines. He worked in the mines {{for a short time}} but handed in his notice after finding out just how {{difficult}} and unpleasant it was to work deep underground. He applied to join the police and reconsidered the offer from Leeds United. His trial game for Leeds clashed with his <b>police</b> <b>interview,</b> and Charlton chose to play in the game; the trial was a success and he joined the ground staff at Elland Road.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) hesitates {{to take a}} new {{murder case}} because he fears it will be too {{difficult}} to solve, so it is taken on by his partner Howard (Melissa Leo), who has recently experienced a perfect streak of solving 11 consecutive cases. They investigate the body of a man dead in a basement, and much to Felton's bewilderment, Howard solves the case easily. The owner of the house, Jerry Jempson (Jim Grollman), literally calls her at the house while she is investigating and agrees to a <b>police</b> <b>interview,</b> during which he acts extremely nervous and is eventually charged with the murder.|$|E

Police had put the name on their wanted list on 14 March after they determined that Lowe had checked into River View Hotel with someone by that name. In a <b>police</b> <b>interview</b> room in the airport, Martin smashed a glass panel and cut his wrist with a shard of glass in a suicide attempt, fearing that he would be hanged like Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino who had been hanged two days before for a double murder.

5|$|When backup {{arrives on}} the scene, an injured Wetzel {{claims that he}} {{encountered}} gang members. The police soon discover and surround Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), believing them to be criminals, before they realize that the pair are FBI agents. Mulder and Scully claim that they are investigating an alleged werewolf that killed {{a man in the}} area during the last full moon. According to Mulder, the entity that they are tracking only comes out at night. Scully is irritated by the constant presence of the Cops crew, but Mulder is enthused at the prospect of paranormal proof being presented to a national television audience. The agents and the <b>police</b> <b>interview</b> Mrs. Guerrero, who describes the monster to Ricky (Solomon Eversol), a sketch artist. To Mulder's surprise, Mrs. Guerrero describes not a werewolf, but the horror movie villain Freddy Krueger. Ricky expresses a fear of being alone in the dangerous neighborhood, and is found a short time later with serious slashes in his chest. Mulder and Scully find a pink fingernail at the scene. The group also meets Steve and Edy (J. W. Smith and Curtis C.), a couple who witnessed the incident but did not see Ricky's attacker, saying that it appeared he was being attacked by nothing. Scully shows the couple the fingernail, which they identify as belonging to Chantara Gomez (Maria Celedonio), a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{declined}} to overturn a state court's conclusion that a minor was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his <b>police</b> <b>interview.</b> Michael Alvarado helped his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in Santa Fe Springs, California. The truck owner was killed by Soto during the robbery and Alvarado was convicted of second-degree murder {{for his role in the}} crime. The evidence for Alvarado's conviction was primarily based on statements given by Alvarado during a two-hour police interrogation that occurred when Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station. Alvarado was 17 years old and was not read his Miranda rights before questioning. During Alvarado's murder trial in a state court, motions to suppress the statements given by Alvarado were denied on the ground that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time of the interrogation and thus did not have to be read his Miranda rights. Alvarado appealed his conviction, claiming that the determination that he was not in custody was incorrect because the courts did not take his age into account.|$|E

25|$|In his <b>police</b> <b>interview,</b> Bryant {{admitted}} to having carjacked the BMW, but claimed it only had three occupants and denied shooting any person. He also claimed {{he did not take}} the BMW from the vicinity of the toll booth and that his hostage was taken from the BMW. He said that he thought the man he took hostage must have died in the boot when the car exploded. He did not distinguish between the car fire and the later house fire. He also denied visiting Port Arthur on that day, despite vague identification by several people, including the toll attendant, of a man matching a similar description being at the diner. Such discrepancies indicate that Bryant was either lying during the <b>police</b> <b>interview</b> or was mentally incapable of recalling events accurately. Bryant also claimed that the guns found by police were not his, but {{admitted to}} owning the shotgun that was found with his passport back in his own car near the toll booth.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Professor Frank Perri {{has argued}} that police {{interviews}} with Christopher Porco were seriously flawed because police questioning procedures seemingly failed to account for Porco's probable psychopathy. Psychopaths have unusual emotional responses and feel no remorse for their misdeeds, so standard <b>police</b> <b>interview</b> tactics are useless, as in the Porco case, where police failed to obtain any valuable information during questioning. According to Perri, police should study the Porco case to more productively interview potentially psychopathic suspects by using a non-confrontational approach rather than appealing to emotions.|$|E

40|$|The verb say, {{it can be}} argued, plays a role {{in formulating}} legal {{narratives}} and, consequently, in constructing evidence in legal-lay communication. In light of the above, the current study examines the patterns of use involving say in <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> carried out in a homicide investigation. The aim of the analysis is threefold: (1) to determine the frequencies of selected say forms; (2) to explore the speaker-form correlation, i. e. to establish how legal professionals and laypersons deploy say in interaction and (3) to compare selected “saying” routines in <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> and in trial data...|$|R
25|$|Justin Christian Bourque (born November 12, 1989), a {{resident}} of Moncton, was named by authorities as {{a suspect in the}} shootings. He was 24 years old at the time.

25|$|Haneef's legal {{advisers}} {{have challenged}} the Government {{to release the}} full record of the second <b>police</b> <b>interview</b> since they believe the public is entitled to judge for themselves whether the explanations given by Haneef in relation to these conversations are worthy of suspicion. His legal advisers have {{also pointed out that}} the material referred to by the Minister was available to the magistrate when she made her bail decision on 16 July and to the Director of Public Prosecutions when he decided to drop charges on 27 July. The Minister claims that these prior tests of the material are not relevant to his decision since, by the terms of the Act, he is not required to prove his suspicions beyond reasonable doubt. The Act also specifically exempts the Minister from the requirement to ensure his decisions comply with the principles of natural justice.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of an information sheet designed to aid interpreters in <b>police</b> <b>interviews</b> in recognizing, conveying and inadvertently obstructing rapport-building efforts by police interviewers. The contents of this sheet were informed by past research defining rapport, and rapport uses in <b>police</b> <b>interviews.</b> We used a mixed experimental design to test the information sheet. One group (Intervention, n = 35) was randomly assigned to read an information sheet before responding to short vignettes of <b>police</b> <b>interviewing</b> foreign non-English speaking suspects about international crimes, while another (Control) group (n = 37) simply responded to the vignettes. Perceptions of rapport cues by the intervention group exceeded that of the control group. However, the groups performed equally well at identifying appropriate methods to convey/avoid obstructing rapport. Feedback from the intervention group on the helpfulness of the information sheet was largely positive. The findings were used to improve the information sheet which can be used to alert interpreters to the importance of rapport in suspect interviews...|$|R

25|$|During {{his first}} <b>police</b> <b>interview,</b> Hodgson denied {{having an affair}} with Nicholl and also denied {{anything}} to do with her disappearance. The next day, Nicholl's mobile phone was switched on and messages were sent which led her family and the police to believe that she was alive and well. The text messages were later revealed to have been sent from locations as far afield as Carlisle in Cumbria and Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. Later, the authenticity of these messages were put into doubt by the police when they stated in November 2005 that the inquiry had turned from a disappearance into a murder investigation. At the end of July 2005, police found David Hodgson in a hut near to Hudswell. He had taken an overdose of pills and wine. In later police interviews, Hodgson admitted that he and Nicholl were lovers, but that their affair had ended 12 months earlier.|$|E
25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of <b>police</b> <b>interview</b> techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E
