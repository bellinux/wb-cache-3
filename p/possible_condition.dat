The first said I was dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die." [...] He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him. It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: [...] "I am sending you my Preludes [...] I finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best <b>possible</b> <b>condition</b> {{in spite of the}} sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs." [...] Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.|$|E
2500|$|Hypothetical speculations, {{with which}} the coroner's jury did not agree or disagree, were {{presented}} to the inquiry on the <b>possible</b> <b>condition</b> of the vessel prior to its foundering. The life-jacketed corpses that washed ashore south of Grand Haven were seen {{by some as a}} sign that the doomed vessel had fallen into what is called the [...] "trough" [...] of the gale waves. [...] This is a condition when a boat, often a boat with impaired metacentric functions, cannot recover after being hit broadside by a breaking wave. [...] Partly swamped, the rolling boat falls down in the wave troughs and does not rise with the wave crests. [...] Questions were raised, at the inquiry and later, about the metacentric stability of the Andaste with its topside self-unloading machinery. [...] Great Lakes seamen were aware that a structurally similar (although not identical) aggregate freighter, the SS Clifton, had been refitted with similar topside self-unloading machinery and had disappeared with all hands on Lake Huron in September 1924. [...] A similar retrofit and sinking involved the Hennepin ...|$|E

No matter how ugly it is,--has it anything about it like Maiden Lane, or like Thames' shore? If so, it shall be painted for their sake. Hence, to the very close of life, Turner could endure ugliness which no one else, of the same sensibility, would have borne with for an instant. Dead brick walls, blank square windows, old clothes, market-womanly types of humanity--anything fishy and muddy, like Billingsgate or Hungerford Market, had great attraction for him; black barges, patched sails, and every <b>possible</b> <b>condition</b> of fog.|$|E
60|$|We {{should have}} a good navy, and our sea-coast defences should {{be put in the}} finest <b>possible</b> <b>condition.</b> Neither of these cost much when it is {{considered}} where the money goes, and what we get in return. Money expended in a fine navy, not only adds to our security and tends to prevent war in the future, but is very material aid to our commerce with foreign nations in the meantime. Money spent upon sea-coast defences is spent among our own people, and all goes back again among the people. The work accomplished, too, like that of the navy, gives us a feeling of security.|$|E
60|$|The two lateral columns form a {{consecutive}} series: {{the central}} column {{is a group}} of exceptional character, running parallel with both. We will take the lateral ones first. 1. Capital of pulpit of St. Mark's (representative of the simplest concave forms of the Byzantine period). Look back to Plate VIII. Vol. II., and observe that while all the forms in that plate are contemporaneous, we are now going to follow a series consecutive in time, which begins from fig. 1, either in that plate or in this; that is to say, with the simplest <b>possible</b> <b>condition</b> to be found at the time; and which proceeds to develope itself into gradually increasing richness, while the already rich capitals of the old school die at its side. In the forms 14 and 15 (Plate VIII.) the Byzantine school expired; but from the Byzantine simple capital (1, Plate II. above) which was coexistent with them, sprang another hardy race of capitals, whose succession we have now to trace.|$|E

60|$|Romulus paid great attention, in {{the mean}} time, to every thing {{pertaining}} to the internal organization of the state, so as to bring {{every part of the}} national administration into the best <b>possible</b> <b>condition.</b> The municipal police, the tribunals of justice, the social institutions and laws of the industrial classes, the discipline of the troops, the enlargement and increase of the fortifications of the city, and the supply of arms, and stores, and munitions of war,--and every other subject, in fact, connected with the welfare and prosperity of the city,--occupied his thoughts in every interval of peace and tranquillity. In consequence of the exertions which he made, and the measures which he adopted, order and system prevailed more and more in every department, and the community became every year better organized, and more and more consolidated; so that the capacity of the city to receive accessions to the population increased even faster than accessions were made. In a word, the solid foundations were laid of that vast superstructure, which, in subsequent ages, became the wonder of the world.|$|E
6000|$|... § 16. I {{will not}} {{entangle}} the reader {{in the very}} subtle and curious variations of the laws in this matter. The simple fact which is necessary for him to observe is, that the paler and purer the color, the more the great Venetian colorists will reinforce it in the shadow, {{and allow it to}} fall or rise in sympathy with the light; and those especially whose object it is to represent sunshine, nearly always reinforce their local colors somewhat in the shadows, and keep them both fainter and feebler in the light, so that they thus approach a condition of universal glow, the full color being used for the shadow, and a delicate and somewhat subdued hue of it for the light. And this to the eye is the loveliest <b>possible</b> <b>condition</b> of color. Perhaps few people have ever asked themselves why they admire a rose so much more than all other flowers. If they consider, they will find, first, that red is, in a delicately gradated state, the loveliest of all pure colors; and secondly, that in the rose there is no shadow, except what is composed of color. All its shadows are fuller in color than its lights, owing to the translucency and reflective power of its leaves.|$|E
60|$|From {{the time}} Sir Wycherly was laid on his bed, Mr. Rotherham had been {{seated at the}} sick man's side, {{watching}} {{the course of his}} attack, and ready to interpret any of the patient's feebly and indistinctly expressed wishes. We say indistinctly, because the baronet's speech was slightly affected with that species of paralysis which reduces the faculty to the state that is vulgarly called thick-tongued. Although a three-bottle man, Mr. Rotherham was far from being without his devout feelings, on occasions, discharging all the clerical functions with as much unction as the habits of the country, and the opinions of the day, ordinarily exacted of divines. He had even volunteered to read the prayers for the sick, as soon as he perceived that the patient's recollection had returned; but this kind offer had been declined by Sir Wycherly, under the clearer views of fitness, that the near approach of death is apt to give, and which views left a certain consciousness that the party assembled was not in the best <b>possible</b> <b>condition</b> for that sacred office. Sir Wycherly revived so much, at last, as to look about him with increasing consciousness; and, at length, his eyes passed slowly over the room, scanning each person singly, and with marked deliberation.|$|E
