25|$|William Grove {{produced}} the first fuel cell in 1839. He based his experiment {{on the fact}} that sending an electric current through water splits the water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen. So, Grove tried reversing the reaction—combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. Eventually the term fuel cell was coined in 1889 by Ludwig Mond and Charles Langer, who attempted to build the first practical device using air and industrial coal gas. He also introduced a powerful battery {{at the annual meeting of}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839. Grove's first cell consisted of zinc in diluted sulfuric acid and platinum in concentrated nitric acid, separated by a <b>porous</b> <b>pot.</b> The cell was able to generate about 12 amperes of current at about 1.8 volts. This cell had nearly double the voltage of the first Daniell cell. Grove's nitric acid cell was the favourite battery of the early American telegraph (1840–1860), because it offered strong current output.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of an MBR under chemical shock loading conditions was investigated, {{to ascertain the}} robustness of the treatment system for urban water reuse. 32 household products and industrial substances, {{likely to be found}} in urban wastewater were assessed for toxicity, using Microtox and respirometry to obtain EC 50 values. Six of these toxins were dosed into bench scale <b>porous</b> <b>pots</b> to observe any detrimental effects on the treatment system, in terms of effluent quality and potential foulant release. Four toxins were dosed into a pilot scale MBR to observe the effects of scale and enhanced biomass retention on the perturbations seen at bench scale. Mitigation of the foulants observed was investigated by the addition of ancillary chemicals. 10 household products and 6 industrial products were identified as being of risk to a biological treatment system with EC 50 concentrations of the order that could be present in urban wastewater. 2 of the 6 toxins dosed into the <b>porous</b> <b>pots</b> caused a serious impact on the system reducing COD removal rates to 45 %, compared with 92 % average for the control pots, and increasing SMP turbidity to 11 NTU. 1 of the 4 toxins dosed into the MBR caused an impact, although less than observed in the <b>porous</b> <b>pots,</b> with the COD removal rate reducing to 77 % and SMP turbidity increasing to a maximum of 9 NTU. Jar tests carried out to investigate mitigation potential of SMP turbidity found the cationic polymers MPE 50 and high molecular weight polyDADMAC most efficient with reductions of SMP turbidity to < 1 NTU possible although the toxins increased the dose necessary to achieve this.

In this study, we assess {{the effectiveness of}} a three-stage on-farm biobed for treating pesticide contaminated waste water from a large (20 km 2) commercial arable estate. The facility consisted of an enclosed machinery wash-down unit (stage 1), a 49 m 2 lined compost-straw-topsoil biobed (stage 2), and a 200 m 2 drainage field with a trickle irrigation system (stage 3). Pesticide concentrations were analysed in water samples collected fortnightly between November 2013 and November 2015 from the biobed input and output sumps and from 20 <b>porous</b> <b>pots</b> buried at 45 cm and 90 cm depth within the drainage field. The results revealed that the biobed removed 68 – 98 % of individual pesticides within the contaminated washings, with mean total pesticide concentrations reducing by 91. 6 % between the biobed input and output sumps. Drainage field irrigation removed a further 68 – 99 % of individual pesticides, with total mean pesticide concentrations reducing by 98. 4 % and 97. 2 % in the 45 cm and 90 cm depth <b>porous</b> <b>pots,</b> respectively. The average total pesticide concentration at 45 cm depth in the drainage field (57 µg L- 1) was 760 times lower than the mean concentration recorded in the input sump (43, 334 µg L- 1). There was no evidence of seasonality in the efficiency of biobed pesticide removal, nor was there evidence of a decline in removal efficiency over the two-year monitoring period. However, higher mean total pesticide concentrations at 90 cm (102 µg L- 1) relative to 45 cm (57 µg L- 1) depth indicated an accumulation of pesticide residues deeper within the soil profile.

40|$|Soil {{in a cold}} {{region is}} subject to {{frequent}} freezing and thawing cycles. Soil frozen for a prolonged period may cause adverse freeze damage to the plants due to cell dehydration or root cell rupture. It {{is important to understand}} the detailed heat transfer behaviors of the freezing and thawing processes to prevent freeze damage, and to devise proper mitigation measures for effective pot planting in cold regions. A theoretical model was developed to analyze the transient moving phase-change interface heat transfer in the freezing and thawing of <b>porous</b> <b>potting</b> soil. The theoretical derivation {{is based on the assumption}} that the soil freezes completely at a single temperature. Microscopic poromechanic effects on heat transfer behavior were ignored. The spatial domain of the problem was simplified to a 1 D spherical coordinate system with variation in the radial direction. Green's function was applied to solve for the time-dependent body temperature. Experiments were conducted for validation of the theoretical model. Reasonable agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements was obtained.

50|$|Proper pot size is an {{important}} factor to consider. A pot that is too large will cause root disease because of the excess moisture retained in the soil, while a pot that is too small will restrict a plant's growth. Generally, a plant can stay in the same pot for two or so years. Pots {{come in a variety of}} types as well, but usually can be broken down into two groups: porous and non-porous. <b>Porous</b> <b>pots</b> are usually clay and are highly recommended because they provide better aeration as air passes laterally through the sides of the pot. Non-porous pots such as glazed or plastic pots tend to hold moisture longer and restrict airflow. Another needed feature is drainage holes. Usually pots come with holes in the bottom to allow excess water to flow out of the soil which helps to prevent root rot. If a pot does not have drainage holes, it is best to double pot that plant so the inner pot can be lifted out and the excess water accumulated in the bottom of the outer pot can be removed. Soak old pots thoroughly in a solution of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water to kill any bacteria that may remain.|$|R

Pots are being used in this way on farms in north-east Brazil. The porosity of the pots can be varied during manufacture, {{to take into account}} the permeability of the soil and the speed with which water seeps out of the pot to irrigate nearby plants. In the simplest systems, pots are used individually to water trees for reforestation or windbreaks by burying one pot close to each tree. For larger areas, methods of linking the pots into a single system have been developed. In north-east Brazil, large pots have been linked with PVC pipe, but researchers are now developing smaller pots, or capsules. These should give better control of the amount of water used. The capsules developed so far have been created in a mould and vary in size with an average diameter of 400 mm. Capsules have a narrow neck with an inlet and an outlet pipe so that they can be linked together by PVC tubing and plastic connectors glued into the apertures. Once the pipes are sealed into the capsules, water can flow along the system, topping up the capsules as it flows. Up to 2600 capsules have been used per hectare. Trials have shown water consumption can be kept down to 10 litres per capsule per day. Crops irrigated in this way have yielded well. In systems over small areas of up to 500 sq. metres, it has been established that the amount of water passing out of the last capsule is virtually the same as that leaving the first pot.
