5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. <b>Probenecid</b> appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. <b>Probenecid</b> may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|Treatment with nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once {{the acute}} attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes {{and in those}} with frequent attacks, allopurinol or <b>probenecid</b> provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C and eating a diet high in low fat dairy products may be preventive.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and <b>probenecid.</b> Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, <b>probenecid,</b> valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and <b>probenecid.</b> Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
25|$|Both Tamiflu and Relenza are {{in short}} supply, and {{production}} capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of Tamiflu with <b>probenecid</b> could double supplies.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, <b>probenecid,</b> propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|Probenecid: Reports of {{increased}} half life of aciclovir, {{as well as}} decreased urinary excretion and renal clearance have been shown in studies where <b>probenecid</b> is given simultaneously with aciclovir.|$|E
25|$|His career {{suffered}} a major setback in 2002 when he {{tested positive for}} the banned masking agent <b>probenecid.</b> For his offence he received a one-month ban from all cricket and a A$2000 fine.|$|E
25|$|Like other Î²-lactam antibiotics, renal {{excretion}} of cefalexin is {{delayed by}} <b>probenecid.</b> Alcohol consumption reduces {{the rate at}} which it is absorbed. Cefalexin also interacts with metformin, an antidiabetic drug, and this can lead to higher concentrations of metformin in the body.|$|E
25|$|Products {{containing}} multivalent cations, such as aluminium- or magnesium-containing antacids, {{and products}} containing calcium, iron or zinc invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Other drugs that interact with fluoroquinolones include sucralfate, <b>probenecid,</b> cimetidine, theophylline, warfarin, antiviral agents, phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and cycloserine.|$|E
25|$|Rifampin {{increases}} the clearance of nitrazepam significantly and <b>probenecid</b> decreases its clearance significantly. Cimetidine slows down the elimination rate of nitrazepam, leading to more prolonged effects and {{increased risk of}} accumulation. Alcohol in combination with nitrazepam may cause a synergistic enhancement of the hypotensive properties of both benzodiazepines and alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. <b>Probenecid</b> inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>probenecid</b> reduces renal {{excretion}} {{and increases}} the blood levels of amoxicillin.|$|E
2500|$|Ketorolac can {{interact}} with other medications. <b>Probenecid</b> can increase the probability of having an adverse reaction or experiencing a side effect when taken with ketorolac. Pentoxifylline can {{increase the risk of}} bleeding. When aspirin is taken {{at the same time as}} ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, corticosteroids, or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. [...] The use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications clopidogrel, cefoperazone, valproic acid, cefotetan, eptifibatide, tirofiban, and copidine. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer {{can interact}} with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with cyclosporine.|$|E
50|$|Hypersensitivity to {{cidofovir}} or <b>probenecid</b> (as <b>probenecid</b> {{needs to}} be given concurrently to avoid nephrotoxicity).|$|E
50|$|<b>Probenecid,</b> a {{well-established}} drug {{for the treatment}} of gout, allows for discrimination between channels formed by connexins and pannexins. <b>Probenecid</b> did not affect channels formed by connexins.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} to {{interact}} with nephrotoxic agents (e.g. amphotericin B, foscarnet, IV aminoglycosides, IV pentamide, vancomycin, tacrolimus, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, etc.) to increase their nephrotoxic potential. As it must be given concurrently with <b>probenecid</b> it is advised that drugs that are known to interact with <b>probenecid</b> (e.g. drugs that <b>probenecid</b> interferes with the renal tubular secretion of, such as paracetamol, aciclovir, aminosalicylic acid, etc.) are also withheld.|$|E
50|$|<b>Probenecid</b> is {{sometimes}} used {{to increase the}} concentration of some antibiotics. Specifically, {{a small amount of}} evidence supports the use of intravenous cefazolin once rather than three times a day when it is combined with <b>probenecid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{important}} clinical interactions of <b>probenecid</b> include those with captopril, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, naproxen, cephalosporins, quinolones, penicillins, methotrexate, zidovudine, ganciclovir, lorazepam, and acyclovir. In all these interactions, the excretion of these drugs is reduced due to <b>probenecid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Penicillin is {{actively}} excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared {{from the body}} within {{three to four hours}} of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused. This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The uricosuric agent <b>probenecid</b> proved to be suitable. When <b>probenecid</b> and penicillin are administered together, <b>probenecid</b> competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin's concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins resolved the supply issues, so this use of <b>probenecid</b> declined. <b>Probenecid</b> is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Probenecid</b> is {{primarily}} {{used to treat}} gout and hyperuricemia.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{uricosuric}} drugs include <b>probenecid,</b> benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone.|$|E
50|$|Probenecid: Prulifloxacin urinary {{excretion}} decreases when concomitantly administered with <b>probenecid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... <b>probenecid</b> reduces renal {{excretion}} {{and increases}} the blood levels of amoxicillin.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, <b>probenecid</b> {{was used}} to extend limited {{supplies}} of penicillin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Probenecid</b> {{probably}} has several pharmacological targets, including blocking pannexins.Probenecid is also {{useful in the}} treatment of gout where the mechanism of action is believed to be focused on the kidney. <b>Probenecid</b> interferes with the kidneys' organic anion transporter (OAT), which reclaims uric acid from the urine and returns it to the plasma. If <b>probenecid</b> (an organic acid) is present, the OAT binds preferentially to it (instead of to uric acid), preventing reabsorption of the uric acid. Hence, the urine retains more uric acid, lowering uric acid concentration in the plasma. (This {{is a good example of}} a medical usage for competition between substrates transported across cell membranes).|$|E
50|$|Cidofovir is only {{available}} as an intravenous formulation. Cidofovir {{is to be}} administered with <b>probenecid</b> which decreases side effects to the kidney. <b>Probenecid</b> mitigate nephrotoxicity by inhibiting organic anion transport of the proximal tubule epithelial cells of the kidney. In addition, hydration must be administered to patients receiving cidofovir. 1 liter of normal saline is recommended in conjunction with each dose of cidofovir.|$|E
50|$|One daily {{intramuscular}} injection and oral <b>probenecid</b> four times daily, both for 10 to 14 days.|$|E
50|$|Excretion of {{cephalosporins}} {{is reduced}} by <b>probenecid</b> (resulting in increased concentrations of drug in the blood plasma).|$|E
50|$|In 2011 Lombaard was {{suspended}} for 1 year after he failed a drug test for <b>probenecid</b> doping.|$|E
50|$|<b>Probenecid</b> with {{colchicine}} is {{a combination}} medication used to treat gout. Brand names include ColBenemid, Col-Probenecid, and Proben-C.|$|E
50|$|Slowdown of {{excretion}} (e.g. <b>Probenecid</b> delays the nephron|tubular secretion of Penicillin in {{the kidney}} and thus prolongs its effect).|$|E
50|$|In the kidneys, <b>probenecid</b> is {{filtered}} at the glomerulus, secreted in {{the proximal}} tubule and reabsorbed in the distal tubule.|$|E
50|$|In Delgado's case, it was <b>probenecid.</b> Promenicid was a doping product {{according}} to the International Olympic Committee not yet on the doping list of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), so Delgado was not sanctioned, and he remained {{the winner of the}} Tour. Tour director Louy tried to convince Delgado to leave the race voluntarily, but Delgado refused. Delgado admits that he took <b>probenecid,</b> but with the intention to assist the kidneys, not to mask anabolic steroids.|$|E
