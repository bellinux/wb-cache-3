The model also explains the Wiedemann-Franz law of 1853. However, it greatly overestimates the electronic heat capacities of metals. In reality, metals and insulators have roughly the same heat capacity at room temperature.

50|$|The {{action of}} {{the light on the}} silver halide grains within the {{emulsion}} forms sites of metallic silver in the grains. The basic mechanism by which this happens was first proposed by R W Gurney and N F Mott in 1938. The incoming photon liberates an electron, called a photoelectron, from a silver halide crystal. Photoelectrons migrate to a shallow electron trap site (a sensitivity site), where the electrons reduce silver ions to form a metallic silver speck. A <b>positive</b> <b>hole</b> must also be generated but it is largely ignored. Subsequent work has slightly modified this picture, so that 'hole' trapping is also considered (Mitchell, 1957). Since then, understanding of the mechanism of sensitivity and latent image formation has been greatly improved.|$|E
50|$|Most common {{heterogeneous}} photocatalysts are {{transition metal}} oxides and semiconductors, which have unique characteristics. Unlike the metals {{which have a}} continuum of electronic states, semiconductors possess a void energy region where no energy levels are available to promote recombination of an electron and hole produced by photoactivation in the solid. The void region, which extends {{from the top of}} the filled valence band to the bottom of the vacant conduction band, is called the band gap. When a photon with energy equal to or greater than the materials band gap is absorbed by the semiconductor, an electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band, generating a <b>positive</b> <b>hole</b> in the valence band. Such a photogenerated electron-hole pair is termed an exciton. The excited electron and hole can recombine and release the energy gained from the excitation of the electron as heat. Exciton recombination is undesirable and higher levels lead to an inefficient photocatalyst. For this reason efforts to develop functional photocatalysts often emphasize extending exciton lifetime, improving electron-hole separation using diverse approaches that often rely on structural features such as phase hetero-junctions (e.g. anatase-rutile interfaces), noble-metal nanoparticles, silicon nanowires and substitutional cation doping. The ultimate goal of photocatalyst design is to facilitate reactions between the excited electrons with oxidants to produce reduced products, and/or reactions between the generated holes with reductants to produce oxidized products. Due to the generation of positive holes and electrons, oxidation-reduction reactions take place at the surface of semiconductors. In the oxidative reaction, the positive holes react with the moisture present on the surface and produce a hydroxyl radical.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{effort is}} part of an ongoing investigation into stress-activated <b>positive</b> <b>hole</b> charge carriers in common igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. The findings have already revealed potential early earthquake detection mechanisms and caused a re-think on the processes that could conceivably contribute to the formation of and evolution of life. Positive holes are defect electrons in the oxygen anion sub-lattice of silicate minerals that have demonstrated some intriguing capabilities: flowing out of a stressed rock volume; causing oxidation reactions at the rock-water interface and ionization at the rock-air interface; and traveling great distances. This research seeks to determine if obsidian (volcanic glass) is also capable of yielding stress- or temperature-activated charge carriers. In this study, a measurable change in current and voltage when obsidian samples are put under mechanical stress would suggest that charge carriers are available.

An all-optical method for generating singly charged radical ions of a hydrophilic carotenoid (Car) is described.

Point defects in kaolinite are hole-centers associated to oxygen atoms linked to Si- and Al-sites.

40|$|The work {{performed}} under this proposal {{is based on}} the experimentally supported observation - or inference - that {{a small fraction of the}} oxygen anions in silicate minerals in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks on Earth may not be in the usual 2 - oxidation state, O(sup 2 -), but in a higher oxidation state, as O(sup -). If this is true, the same would likely apply to the fine dust that fills the diffuse interstellar medium. An (sup -) in a matrix of O(sup 2 -) represents a defect electron in the valence band, also known as <b>positive</b> <b>hole</b> or p-hole for short. When two O(sup -) combine, they undergo spin-pairing and form a <b>positive</b> <b>hole</b> pair, PHP. Chemically speaking a PHP is a peroxy bond. In an oxide matrix a peroxy bond takes the form of a peroxy anion, O 2 (sup 2 -). In a silicate matrix it probably exists in the form of peroxy links between adjacent [SiO 4] tetrahedral, O 3 Si 003. From a physics perspective a PHP is an electrically inactive point defect, which contains dormant electronic charge carriers. When the peroxy bond breaks, p-hole charge carriers are released.

Since 3 -PMA does not adsorb onto the TiO 2 surface, it cannot react directly with the photogenerated <b>positive</b> <b>holes.</b> The selective oxidation of 3 -PMA proceeds through a reaction with the surface radicals (≡TiIVOH·+≡TiIVOH·+) generated from the migration of the <b>positive</b> <b>holes</b> on the TiO 2 surface, where they are trapped by surface titanol groups (≡TiIVOH≡TiIVOH).

40|$|Resistivity changes, ground potentials, {{electromagnetic}} (EM) and luminous signals {{prior to}} or during earthquakes have been reported, {{in addition to}} ground uplift and tilt, and {{to changes in the}} seismic wave propagation parameters. However, no physical model exists that ties these diverse phenomena together. Through time-resolved impacts experiments it has been observed that, when igneous rocks (gabbro, diorite, granite) are impacted at low velocities (approx. 100 m/sec), highly mobile electronic charge carriers are generated, spreading from a small volume near the impact point, causing electric potentials, EM and light emission. The rock becomes momentarily conductive. When impacted at higher velocities (approx. 1. 5 km/sec), the propagation of the P and S waves is registered through the transient piezoelectric response of quartz. At the same time, the rock volume is filled with mobile charge carriers, and a positive surface potential is registered. During the next 1 - 2 msec the surface potential oscillates, due to electron injection from ground. These observations are consistent with positive holes, e. g. defect electrons in the O(2 -) sublattice, that can travel via the O 2 p-dominated valence band of the silicate minerals at the speed of a phonon-mediated charge transfer. Before activation, the <b>positive</b> <b>hole</b> charge carriers lay dormant in form of <b>positive</b> <b>hole</b> pairs, PHP, electrically inactive, chemically equivalent to peroxy links in the structures of constituent minerals. PHPs are introduced by way of hydroxyl (O 3 Si-OH) incorporated into nominally anhydrous minerals when they crystallize in water-laden environments.
