5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms <b>per</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meter.</b> By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules <b>per</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meter.</b> The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E

5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons <b>per</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons <b>per</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meter,</b> including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

40|$|We use {{satellite}} data from Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) to investigate distributions of {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) concentration in surface waters of the north polar Atlantic Ocean during the spring summer season (April through August) over a 6 -year period from 1998 through 2003. By use of field data collected at sea, we developed regional relationships {{for the purpose of}} estimating POC from remote-sensing observations of ocean color. Analysis of several approaches used in the POC algorithm development and match-up analysis of coincident in situ derived and satellite-derived estimates of POC resulted in selection of an algorithm that is based on the blue-to-green ratio of remote-sensing reflectance R(sub rs) (or normalized water-leaving radiance L(sub wn)). The application of the selected algorithm to a 6 -year record of SeaWiFS monthly composite data of L(sub wn) revealed patterns of seasonal and interannual variability of POC in the study region. For example, the results show a clear increase of POC throughout the season. The lowest values, generally less than 200 mg <b>per</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meters,</b> and at some locations often less than 50 mg <b>per</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meters,</b> were observed in April. In May and June, POC can exceed 300 or even 400 mg <b>per</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> {{in some parts of the}} study region. Patterns of interannual variability are intricate, as they depend on the geographic location within the study region and particular time of year (month) considered. By comparing the results averaged over the entire study region and the entire season (April through August) for each year separately, we found that the lowest POC occurred in 2001 and the highest POC occurred in 2002 and 1999...|$|R

50|$|During the Russian - Ukrainian crisis, {{starting}} in February 2014 with the Russian {{military intervention in}} Crimea, severe tensions extended to the gas sector. Eventually, the EU commissioner for energy Günther Oettinger {{was called in to}} broker a deal securing supplies to Ukraine and transit to the EU. The package signed on 30. October included Russian supplies of gas to Ukraine in the period November 2014 through March 2015, conditioned on the payment of undisputed Ukrainian gas debt ($3 billion). The price for November and December 2014 was set at $378 <b>per</b> thousand <b>cubic</b> <b>meters,</b> to be adjusted in January. Deliveries were to be prepaid. During that winter Ukrainian monopoly Naftogaz was able to import limited quantities of gas from the EU (reverse flow from Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) at Central European hub prices, around $250 <b>per</b> thousand <b>cubic</b> <b>meters.</b> Due to severe drop of oil market price (the price halved from mid-2014 to end of the year) Gazprom had to reduce the oil-linked gas price.

Belarus was able to compensate by purchasing gas from non-Gazprom exporters such as Itera and TransNafta on short-term contracts. This continued until 18 February, when the companies refused to sign further short-term supply contracts. Since Belarus was dependent on gas {{for most of its}} heat and electricity production, the situation in the country during cold winter started to become critical. After deliveries stopped, Belarus started to siphon gas meant for transit to Europe from the Yamal-Europe pipeline, without Gazprom's approval. As a result, at 18:00 Moscow time on 18 February, Gazprom completely cut off supplies to the Belarusian network. Germany experienced only minor shortfalls in deliveries because of extensive storages of gas and due to most of imports coming through Ukraine; however, Poland reported more severe disruption. Supplies to Kaliningrad Oblast were also affected. Belarus managed to sign a new short-term contract with TransNafta at the price of $46.68 <b>per</b> 1,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters,</b> which resulted in Gazprom resuming supplies before midnight of 19 February.
