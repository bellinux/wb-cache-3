25|$|During the Renaissance, two European {{schools of}} {{pyrotechnic}} thought emerged, one in Italy {{and the other}} at Nuremberg, Germany. The German <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher</b> Christiaan Egenolff adapted an earlier work on pyrotechnics from manuscript to print form, publishing his Büchsenmeysterei in 1529 and reprinting it in 1531. Now extremely rare, the book discusses the manufacturing of gunpowder, the operation of artillery and the rules of conduct for the gunsmith.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} April 1921, Member of Parliament J. H. Thomas {{successfully}} sued The Communist for libel, naming its editors, <b>printer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher</b> in the action.

25|$|Well {{known as}} a <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher,</b> Franklin was {{appointed}} postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher William Hunter were named deputy postmasters–general of British North America, the first to hold the office.

Franklin {{was responsible for the}} British colonies as far as the island of Newfoundland, opening Canada's first post office at Halifax, Nova Scotia, while Hunter became postal administrator in Williamsburg, Virginia and oversaw areas south of Annapolis, Maryland. Franklin reorganized the service's accounting system, then improved speed of delivery between Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

He {{attended}} Lewes Old Grammar School, and was educated privately by the Rev. Frost in Brighton. He studied Law and was admitted as a solicitor in 1867.

He was appointed Junior Headborough for Lewes in 1868, Under-Sherriff of London and Middlesex from 1876 to 1879 and 1885 to 1886, Junior High Constable in 1878, and the last Senior High Constable in 1880.

25|$|Adams' {{share of}} the vote, at 37%, was short of a {{majority}} and he achieved victory only due to Fitt and the SDLP candidate splitting the non-Sinn Féin vote. In 1987 Adams narrowly held his seat, but lost it in the 1992 general election amidst a strong tactical voting campaign in favour of Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party by unionists in the Shankill Road area of the constituency. After the election a constituent, Maura McCrory, lodged an election petition challenging the result. The election court reported Hendron personally guilty of the illegal practice of failing to deliver a declaration verifying the return of his election expenses, and guilty through his election agent of failing to deliver a verified return of election expenses within 35 days, exceeding the maximum spending by £782.02, and failing to pay all the expenses within 28 days. Hendron's agent was also reported personally guilty of distributing election material without {{the name and address}} of the <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher.</b> The Judges granted both Hendron and his agent relief from their findings, {{on the grounds that the}} law had been broken through inadvertence; they therefore certified that Hendron had been duly elected.|$|E
