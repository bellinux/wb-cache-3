5|$|Fifteen {{weeks of}} {{principal}} photography commenced on 1 July 1968 at <b>Pinewood</b> Studios, Buckinghamshire; shooting wrapped on 16 October having run alongside that for Joe 90. In September, location shooting in Albufeira, Portugal was accelerated for completion {{in two weeks}} {{as opposed to a}} month after politician Marcello Caetano deposed incapacitated Prime Minister Antonio Salazar, Parrish fearing that the coup d'état would cause the production of Doppelgänger to fall behind schedule. Filming in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire used the exterior of Neptune House (now part of the BBC's Elstree Studios) as a double for EUROSEC Headquarters in Portugal.

5|$|Production {{began on}} 14 August 1978. The main {{shooting}} was switched {{from the usual}} 007 Stage at the <b>Pinewood</b> Studios to France, due to high taxation in England at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at <b>Pinewood.</b> The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in Épinay and Boulogne-Billancourt.|$|E
5|$|Production {{returned}} in late April to Hong Kong, {{and also to}} Macau, for that island {{is famous for its}} casinos, which Hong Kong lacks. Some scenes in Thailand had to be finished, and production had to move to studio work in <b>Pinewood</b> Studios; this included sets such as Scaramanga's solar energy plant and island interior. Academy Award winner Oswald Morris was hired to finish the job after cinematographer Ted Moore became ill. Morris was initially reluctant, as he did not like his previous experiences taking over other cinematographers' work, but accepted after dining with Broccoli. Production wrapped in <b>Pinewood</b> in August 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} chase, when Bond's Aston Martin {{crashes into}} a wall because of the mirror and the chase {{immediately}} preceding it, were filmed on the road {{at the rear of}} <b>Pinewood</b> Studios Sound Stages A and E and the Prop Store.

Ian Fleming visited the set of Goldfinger in April 1964; he died a few months later in August 1964, shortly before the film's release. The second unit filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at <b>Pinewood.</b>|$|E

5|$|Filming {{locations}} included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey and the UK, with interiors shot at <b>Pinewood</b> Studios. Despite mixed critical reception, The World Is Not Enough earned $361,832,400 worldwide. It {{was also}} the first Eon-produced Bond film to be officially released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer instead of United Artists, the original distributor.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Dr. No, United Artists greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget {{available}} for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at <b>Pinewood</b> Studios, Buckinghamshire and in Scotland.

50|$|Like many {{amphibian}} species' tadpoles, {{those of}} the <b>pinewoods</b> tree frog are susceptible to parasitic infection by trematode flatworms. Interestingly, <b>pinewoods</b> tree frog tadpoles swim {{in a manner that}} does not necessarily reduce the intensity of infection, but reduces the likelihood of these parasites infecting in the head and body region; instead, their swimming behavior shunts parasites to the tail area, where infection by parasites causes fewer harmful effects.|$|R
50|$|The oblast's extrazonal flora is {{represented}} by pine and small-leaved forests, swamps and meadows. The common pine forms forests on sandbanks of ancient alluvial flats, sand terraces of river valleys, stagnant peaty soil. There are also white and green moss <b>pinewoods,</b> sphagnous and complex <b>pinewoods.</b> The tree layer in small-leaved and derivative mixed forests is formed by weeping and white birch, aspen, goat willow, spruce, pine and oak trees.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at the <b>Pinewood</b> Studios in London, Porto Cervo in Sardinia (Hotel Cala di Volpe), Egypt (Karnak, Mosque of Ibn Tulun, Gayer-Anderson Museum, Abu Simbel temples), Malta, Scotland, Hayling Island UK, Okinawa, Switzerland and Mount Asgard on Baffin Island in the then {{northern}} Canadian territory of Northwest Territories (now located in Nunavut).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} Bond films, {{the production}} of Moonraker was not based at <b>Pinewood,</b> as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons, although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at <b>Pinewood,</b> with the special effects team of Derek Meddings active in the UK throughout production. Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris. The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (approximately 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average). Much of the film {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida and Rio de Janeiro. Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979, a 28-week schedule that had allowed Roger Moore only three days off. John Barry was again asked to score an Eon film.|$|E
5|$|With the Leavesden studios unavailable, and <b>Pinewood</b> {{not having}} {{sufficient}} capacity, Eon converted an abandoned grocery warehouse in Hertfordshire into a filming location. With the principal crew about {{to fly to}} location in Vietnam, the Vietnamese authorities revoked permission to film at the last minute, and alternative locations were quickly found in Thailand.|$|E
40|$|Italian {{stone pine}} is a {{landmark}} of Mediterranean coastal areas. Today, <b>pinewoods</b> represent environmental amenity areas at risk, being under siege from intensive urbanisation. We present an emblematic {{case study in}} Rome’s coastal strip where urban encroachment around <b>pinewoods</b> is somewhat overlooked by urban planning, which may be threatening for their conservation. We studied: (i) changes in land use intensification in the pinewoods’ surroundings over the past 60 years (1949 – 2008), {{by means of a}} synthetic index of landscape conservation (ILC) ranging from 0 (maximum level of anthropogenic landscape alteration) to 1 (maximum level of landscape naturalness); (ii) influence of different landscape protection level on land use intensification. Findings show that in areas with low levels of landscape protection, the ILC had been decreasing in the first 100 -m surrounding <b>pinewoods,</b> and within the 1 -km buffer. The ILC had been rather stable within areas with high levels of landscape protection. Lessons learnt have implications for spatial development strategies to protect coastal <b>pinewoods</b> from external pressures due to future (planned) urban densification in their surroundings...|$|R
