5|$|Back at Berkeley from Johns Hopkins, Stratton {{stayed in}} the {{philosophy}} department as its second faculty member and first <b>psychology</b> specialist until the <b>psychology</b> department broke off in 1922. The new department started with four people: Stratton as chair; Edward Chace Tolman, with a Harvard degree, and an initiator of rodent experiments soiling the rooms of the philosophy department and hastening the split of the <b>psychology</b> division; Brown, Stratton's earlier student and Berkeley faculty member from 1908 onward; and Olga Bridgman, the first Berkeley <b>psychology</b> PhD awardee, albeit from the philosophy department. Before the split Stratton had set up Berkeley's first <b>psychology</b> lab in the philosophy department and taught <b>psychology</b> courses with Brown. The courses included sensation, perception, emotion, memory, and applications of <b>psychology</b> to professions such as law, medicine, schooling and clerical work by priests.|$|E

5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of <b>psychology</b> are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of <b>psychology</b> also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary <b>psychology,</b> and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in <b>psychology.</b>|$|E

5|$|The book {{contains}} {{content from}} twenty-nine contributors, including psychologists, counselors, {{teachers and school}} therapists. It also includes content from Brown and Logan. General topics discussed in the work include family, alcohol abuse, relationships, self-esteem, sex and gender, and personality. Specific topics {{in the field of}} <b>psychology</b> include clinical <b>psychology,</b> cognition, abnormal <b>psychology,</b> evolutionary <b>psychology,</b> gambling addiction, Pavlovian conditioning and family therapy. Contributor Denis M. McCarthy, assistant professor of <b>psychology</b> at the University of Missouri, analyzes risk factors for alcoholism presented in The Simpsons. McCarthy cites Bart's passive-avoidance learning as a risk factor, and notes that Maggie is at a high risk for substance abuse due to violent tendencies.|$|E

40|$|This article {{outlines}} the indigenous <b>psychologies</b> approach {{within the context}} of three research traditions in cross-cultural psychology: the universalist, contextualist, and inte-grationist approaches. The first section {{outlines the}} limitations of the universalist and contextualist approaches. The second section overviews the two integrationist approaches: the derived etics approach and the indigenous <b>psychologies</b> approach. In comparison to the former approach, the indigenous <b>psychologies</b> approach advocates a bottom-up, model-building paradigm that examines generative capabilities of human beings. It investigates human actions that occur in meaningful context. In this transac-tional approach, human consciousness, intentions, and goals are central aspects of the research design...|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} this is the <b>psychology</b> of perception. Scientists working in this field have {{discovered}} general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the <b>psychology</b> of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by <b>psychology</b> are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in <b>psychology</b> {{emerged as}} a {{critique}} of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects.

Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E

5|$|George Malcolm Stratton (September 26, 1865– October 8, 1957) was a {{psychologist}} who pioneered the study of perception in vision by wearing special glasses which inverted images {{up and down and}} left and right. He studied under {{one of the founders of}} modern <b>psychology,</b> Wilhelm Wundt, and started one of the first experimental <b>psychology</b> labs in America, at the University of California, Berkeley. Stratton's studies on binocular vision inspired many later studies on the subject. He was one of the initial members of the philosophy department at Berkeley, and the first chair of its <b>psychology</b> department. He also worked on sociology, focusing on international relations and peace. Stratton presided over the American Psychological Association in 1908, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He wrote a book on experimental <b>psychology</b> and its methods and scope; published articles on the studies at his labs on perception, and on reviews of studies in the field; served on several psychological committees during and after World War I; and served as advisor to doctoral students who would go on to head <b>psychology</b> departments.|$|E

40|$|Countdown signal {{control is}} a {{relatively}} new control mode that can inform a driver in advance about the remaining time to pass through intersections or the time needed to wait for other drivers and pedestrians. At present, few countries apply vehicular countdown signals. However, in China, some cities have applied vehicular countdown signals for years, though it is unclear how and how much such signals influence driving <b>psychologies</b> and behaviors compared with non-countdown signal controls. The present work aims to clarify the impact of vehicular countdown signals on driving <b>psychologies</b> and behaviors on the cognitive level. A questionnaire survey with 32 questions about driving <b>psychologies</b> and behaviors was designed, and an online survey was conducted. A total of 1051 valid questionnaires were received. The survey data were analyzed, and the main results indicate that most of the surveyed drivers prefer countdown signal controls and think that such controls can improve not only traffic safety but also traffic operational efficiency. The surveyed drivers also think that countdown signal controls have an impact on driving <b>psychologies</b> and behaviors and the survey results have demonstrated that the driving behaviors of female drivers surveyed are not conservative under the clear conditions of green countdown signal control. Further studies and methods concerning the effects of countdown signals on driving <b>psychologies</b> and behaviors are discussed...|$|R
