5|$|In the laboratory, {{platinum}} wire {{is used for}} electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental <b>prostheses,</b> electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E

5|$|The {{improvement}} in running {{time and the}} wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management {{issued a statement saying}} that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what <b>prostheses</b> he wears, and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the <b>prostheses,</b> and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished <b>prostheses.</b> Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} predictors of Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch, an independent predictor of mortality, {{in patients with}} aortic stenosis using bioprosthetic valves. METHOD: We analyzed 2, 107 sequential surgeries. Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch was calculated using the effective orifice area of the <b>prosthesis</b> divided by the patient’s body surface area. We defined nonsignificant, moderate, and severe Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch as effective orifice area indexes of. 0. 85 cm 2 /m, 0. 85 - 0. 66 cm 2 /m 2, and # 0. 65 cm 2 /m 2, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 311 bioprosthetic patients were identified. The incidence of nonsignificant, moderate, and severe Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch was 41 %, 42, and 16 %, respectively. Severe Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch was significantly more prevalent in females (82 %). In severe Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch, the perfusion and the crossclamp times were considerably lower when compared with nonsignificant Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch and moderate Patient <b>Prosthesis</b> Mismatch.
