5|$|The K'iche' conquest {{appears to}} have taken place around AD1000, some four centuries earlier than had been {{supposed}} using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without <b>pause,</b> <b>and</b> the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.|$|E

For this reason, it is usual {{to distinguish between}} speech tempo including <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> hesitations and speech tempo excluding them. The former is called speaking rate and the latter articulation rate.|$|R

40|$|During {{cellular}} differentiation, genes {{important for}} differentiation {{are expected to}} be silent in stem/progenitor cells yet can be readily activated. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> bivalent chromatin marks are two paradigms suited for establishing such a poised state of gene expression; however, their specific contributions in development are not well understood. Here we characterized Pol II <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> H 3 K 4 me 3 /H 3 K 27 me 3 marks in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and their daughter neurons purified from the developing mouse cortex. We show that genes paused in NPCs or neurons are characteristic of respective cellular functions important for each cell type, although <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> <b>pause</b> release were not correlated with gene activation. Bivalent chromatin marks poised the marked genes in NPCs for activation in neurons. Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between H 3 K 27 me 3 <b>and</b> <b>paused</b> Pol II. This study thus reveals cell type-specific Pol II <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> gene activation-associated bivalency during mammalian neuronal differentiation...|$|R

25|$|The DM also {{includes}} the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will <b>pause</b> <b>and</b> ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which questions to ask. All of this {{is included in the}} driver and the DSNs.|$|E
25|$|Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) {{are both}} used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is {{characterized}} by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward {{the end of the}} sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and there is a <b>pause</b> <b>and</b> often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.|$|E

500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take <b>pause,</b> <b>and</b> you can't take <b>pause.</b> <b>And</b> that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E

The brand is in a strong position and the player experience is better than it's ever been.” Pollock did not elaborate on any subsequent career opportunities, but said, [...] "I'm {{going to take a}} moment to <b>pause</b> <b>and</b> reflect, then will think things through and make some decisions," ...|$|E

The Gouldens deliberated carefully about future plans for their sons' education, but they expected their daughters to marry young and avoid paid work. Although they supported women's suffrage and the general advancement of women in society, the Gouldens believed their daughters incapable {{of the goals of}} their male peers.

I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to <b>pause,</b> <b>and</b> for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it?

500|$|Shakespeare's {{standard}} poetic {{form was}} blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, {{this meant that}} his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays {{is quite different from}} that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, <b>pause,</b> <b>and</b> finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony. Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind: ...|$|E

He also contributed to the White Album out-take, [...] "What's the New Mary Jane", and hit an anvil on [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", because Starr could not lift the hammer high enough to get the right sound and keep in time with the song.|$|E
500|$|Sonnets are, canonically, {{poems of}} 14 lines with {{assorted}} rhyming schemes. Originating in the 14th century works of Petrarch, {{the most common}} form of the sonnet is known as the Italian Sonnet: a stanza of eight lines in which the writer lays out a complex thought, followed by a <b>pause</b> <b>and</b> a six-line conclusion [...] "which is characteristically both unpredictable and intense". This was interlinked with the idea of courtly love, in which the goal of a romance is not simply passion, but a more significant moral perfection. [...] "The Good-Morrow", although identified by Donne as a sonnet, does not follow this structural layout, although it does follow the thematic one; Donne used [...] "sonnet" [...] simply to refer to any piece of love poetry, ignoring the fact that [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] was a 21-line work divided into three stanzas.|$|E
