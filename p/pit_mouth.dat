60|$|It was {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} the pit was on fire, for a light smoke curled up from the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth,</b> and some already began to whisper {{that it would have}} to be closed up.

60|$|This {{was a sad}} business. A {{number of}} coffins, {{equal to that of}} the men known to be below {{at the time of the}} explosion, were in {{readiness}} in a shed near the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth.</b> These were sent down, and the bodies as they were found were placed in them to be carried above. In scarcely any instances could the dead be identified by the relatives, six weeks in the water having changed them beyond all recognition; only by the clothes could a clue be obtained. Then the funerals began. A great grave a hundred feet long by twelve wide had been dug in the churchyard, and in this the coffins were laid two deep.|$|E
60|$|Three days later, when Jack came up {{from his}} rounds at ten o'clock, to eat his breakfast and write up his journal {{of the state of}} the mine, he saw Mr. Brook and the manager draw up to the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth.</b> Jack shrank back from the little window of the office where he was writing, and did not look out again until he knew that they had descended the mine, as he did not wish to have any {{appearance}} of thrusting himself forward. For another hour he wrote; and then the window of the office flew in pieces, the chairs danced, and the walls rocked, while a dull heavy roar, like distant thunder, burst upon his ears.|$|E
60|$|He just {{caught the}} train and in the {{afternoon}} found himself {{at the mouth of}} the pit. There was a little crowd around it of weeping women. All efforts to save the wretched men appeared to be useless. Many had been injured, and the manager's house had been converted into a hospital. Alec found everyone stunned by the disaster, and the attempts at rescue had been carried on feebly. He set himself to work at once. He put heart into the despairing women. He brought up everyone who could be of the least use and inspired them with his own resourceful courage. The day was drawing to a close, but no time could be lost; and all night they toiled. Alec, in his shirt sleeves, laboured as heartily as the strongest miner; he seemed to want neither rest nor food. With clenched teeth, silently, he fought a battle with death, and the prize was thirty living men. In the morning he refreshed himself with a bath, paid a hurried visit to the injured, and returned to the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E

50|$|John Dixon {{came from}} Sunderland to Glasgow and {{established}} coal pits at Knightswood and Gartnavel, in what {{are now the}} western suburbs of Glasgow. About 1750 he purchases a glassworks at Dumbarton, and to transport his coal to the works, he built a wooden waggonway from the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth</b> to Yoker. The coal was loaded into barges, which went down with the ebb tide to Leven. By 1785 the glassworks was {{the largest in the}} United Kingdom, consuming 1,500 tons of coal per annum.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} SSNTDs is that charged {{particles}} damage the detector within nanometers along the track {{in such a}} way that the track can be etched many times faster than the undamaged material. Etching, typically for several hours, enlarges the damage to conical pits of micrometer dimensions, that can be observed with a microscope. For a given type of particle, the length of the track gives the energy of the particle. The charge can be determined from the etch rate of the track compared to that of the bulk. If the particles enter the surface at normal incidence, the pits are circular; otherwise the ellipticity and orientation of the elliptical <b>pit</b> <b>mouth</b> indicate the direction of incidence.|$|E
50|$|To ensure {{adequate}} ventilation two shafts were dug, John Pit and William Pit. John Pit was {{the main}} access shaft and was the down-cast shaft where fresh air was drawn into the pit. A steam engine was provided for winding gear, and in 1812 there was a standby horse-whim for when the steam engine was out of use. William Pit was the up-cast or furnace pit and had a fire burning at its base. The rising hot air drew air though the mine from the down-cast pit. Above {{each of the two}} pits were pulleys, those over John Pit were 6 ft in diameter. The pulleys for the horse-whim were mounted on a crane and kept out of the way, being swung over the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth</b> when required. This arrangement proved fortuitous {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster.|$|E
60|$|He {{leaped to}} his feet and rushed to the door. Black smoke was pouring up from the <b>pit's</b> <b>mouth,</b> sticks and pieces of wood and coal were falling in a shower in the yard; and Jack saw that his worst {{anticipation}} had been realized, and that a terrible explosion had taken place in the Vaughan pit.|$|R
60|$|The boots {{stuck to}} him like a man.

5000|$|Mavis Enderby had a peal {{of bells}} named after it, called The Brides of Enderby, which is {{mentioned}} in Jean Ingelow's poem The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire 1571: {{in the poem}} the ringing of the Enderby bells is the generally recognised signal of approaching danger to the neighbouring countryside: [...] "Came down that kindly message free, the Brides of Mavis Enderby".

40|$|The {{chloride}} ion (Cl-) {{is known as}} an aggressive species in the aqueous solutions that adsorbs to the imperfect sites on the metal surfaces, such as defects, impurities and second-phase particles. This adsorption process could change the chemical composition and properties, such as ion conductivity, of the passive film. As a result, the passive film becomes less protective and breaks down at some places where the underlying metals {{are exposed to the}} electrolyte and dissolved through anodic reaction forming a pit. In the meantime, the hydrolysis (cathodic reaction) occurs inside the pit giving rise to a lower pH and leading to an increased dissolution rate of the metals. Subsequently, more {{chloride ion}}s migrate into the pit in order to maintain electrical neutrality and adsorb onto the pit surface. The repeating of such process causes the pitting propagation. However, anodic polarization allows the chloride ions to migrate into the passive film more easily. With growth of the pit, more corrosion products make both in plane diffusion across the sample surface and out-of-plane diffusion to bulk solution from the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth</b> [M. G. Fontana, N.

40|$|X-ray {{absorption}} {{near edge}} structure (XANES) experiments on artificial pits of 316 L stainless steel {{were carried out}} to study the oxidation state and speciation of alloying elements in the pit solution. It was confirmed that the oxidation states of Fe, Cr and Ni are 2 +, 3 + and 2 +, respectively. Ni(H_ 2 O) _ 6 ^ 2 + {{was found to be}} the main solution species through the pit with no evidence of any Ni-Cl complexes. However, for iron and chromium, hexa-aquo ions (Fe(H_ 2 O) _ 6 ^ 2 + and Cr(H_ 2 O) _ 6 ^ 3 +) were found near the <b>pit</b> <b>mouth</b> with chloro complexes close to the dissolving metal surface. The chemistry of molybdenum species in artificial pits of 316 L stainless was investigated and the molybdenum oxidation state was found to be 3 +. There was no evidence of any Mo(VI) polymolybdates, which have previously been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of Mo on the corrosion resistance of 316 L stainless steel. High resolutions measurements did not detect any different molybdenum species adjacent to the salt film. XANES measurements on titanium artificial pits showed a presence of TiCl_ 4, titanium oxides (rutile and anatse) and metal fragments that were generated during the electrochemical dissolution process. X-ray fluorescence and XANES were also carried out to study the titanium distribution and species in human tissues extracted from the vicinity of failed knee, BAHA (bone-anchored hearing aid) and dental implants. Metal fragments and titanium oxides (rutile and anatase) were found in the tissues. In addition, XANES was carried out on neutrophil cells that had been cultured in the presence of anatase. In one case, a spectrum of rutile was found, suggesting the cells may be able to convert anatase to rutile. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

60|$|In {{the morning}} the smoke still curled up, and the <b>pit's</b> <b>mouth</b> was closed. Boards were placed over both the shafts, and earth was heaped upon them, so as to cut off {{altogether}} the supply of air, and so stifle the fire. This was on Thursday morning. Nothing was done on Friday; and on Saturday afternoon the mining authorities met again in council. There were experts there now {{from all parts of}} the kingdom--for the extent of the catastrophe had sent a thrill of horror through the land. It was agreed that the earth and staging should be removed next morning early, and that if smoke still came up, water should be turned in from the canal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mine was}} sunk to the [...] "Lancashire Black mine", a thick seam of coal.

In 1865 a report listing the price of coal for 1860 where the highest prices for House and Best coal were from Derbyshire and Newcastle, at 9 shillings a ton, the average for small coals (other coals seams) was around 4 shillings. The report also goes on to say"The Dukinfield Deep Pit was undertaken to follow the celebrated Lancashire [...] "Black Mine," [...] a four feet seam of the finest coal, selling for 10s. per ton at the <b>pit's</b> <b>mouth,</b> the small coal returning 5s. 6d. per ton." ...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium alloys have {{excellent}} corrosion resistance {{to a wide}} variety of exposure conditions. Usually they corrode by pitting rather than by uniform corrosion. For infrastructure applications long-term corrosion behaviour is of interest. The relatively limited long-term pitting data that is available shows that maximum and average pit depths do not follow the power law function as conventionally assumed but tend to follow a bimodal trend with exposure time. This is consistent with the bimodal trends observed previously for corrosion mass loss of aluminium alloys. Most likely it is the result of the accumulation of corrosion products over the <b>pit</b> <b>mouths,</b> leading to the gradual development of localised anoxic conditions within pits. In turn this permits the development within the pits of anoxic autocatalytic conditions, consistent with established theory for pitting corrosion of aluminium. It also is consistent with observations of hydrogen evolution from pits. The implications of this for practical applications are discussed...|$|R
60|$|George Stephenson's {{connection}} with the locomotive, however, was even now beginning. Already, in 1816, he and his boy had tried a somewhat higher flight of mechanical and scientific skill than usual, {{in the construction of}} a sun-dial, which involves a considerable amount of careful mathematical work; and now George found that the subject of locomotive engines was being forced by circumstances upon his attention. From the moment he was appointed engine-wright of the Killingworth collieries, he began to think about all possible means of hauling coal at cheaper rates from the <b>pit's</b> <b>mouth</b> to the shipping place on the river. For that humble object alone--an object that lay wholly within the line of his own special business--did the great railway projector set out upon his investigations into the possibilities of the locomotive. Indeed, in its earliest origin, the locomotive was almost entirely connected with coals and mining; its application to passenger traffic on the large scale was quite a later and secondary consideration. It was only by accident, so to speak, that the true capabilities of railways were finally discovered in the actual course of their practical employment.|$|R

Think of the poor consumer! Think of the importance to our industries of cheapness of production! We on this side are great admirers of cheapness of production. We have reminded the hon. gentleman of it often; but why should cheapness of production always be achieved {{at the expense of the}} human factor? The hon. gentleman spoke with anxiety of the possibility of a rise in miners' wages as a consequence of this Bill. Has he considered the relation of miners' wages to the selling prices of coal? At the <b>pit's</b> <b>mouth</b> the underground-workers' wages are only 60 per cent. of the selling price of coal. Free on board on the Tyne, the proportion is only 38 per cent. As coal is sold here in the south of England the proportion of wages is less than one-fifth of the whole price. Is it not clear that there are other factors at least which require consideration before you decide to deal with the human factor, which first attracts the attention of the hon. gentleman? ...|$|R
