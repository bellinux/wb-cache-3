2500|$|Mastiglanis asopos is {{a species}} of three-barbeled catfish. [...] It is a {{strictly}} sand-dwelling species which spends the daytime buried in {{the top layer of}} sand. It forages mostly at night and sometimes in the morning. As an ambush predator, it <b>poises</b> in the streamlet channels where water is flowing, supported by a tripod formed by its pelvic and anal fins, spreading both its very long barbels and the filamentous dorsal and pectoral-fin rays, thus forming a kind of [...] "drift-trap". When the fish intercepts food, it will lunge at these food particles; after lunging for a short distance, it will return to its previous hunting spot. This behaviour is similar to that seen in the tripod fish.|$|E
40|$|The {{developmental}} transitions occurring during embryogenesis involve {{spatial and}} temporal changes in gene expression patterns, which are largely dependent {{on a group of}} regulatory elements known as enhancers. Enhancers are short DNA sequences able to positively control the expression of their target genes in a distance and orientation independent manner. Previous studies uncovered a unique set of enhancers in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), named “Poised Enhancers”. <b>Poised</b> enhancers are marked by repressive histone marks, like the trimethylation of histone three lysine 27, which is deposited by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2), and also are bound by co-activators like P 300. The fact that <b>poised</b> enhancers display both activating and repressing features as well as evidences indicating that they are associated with genes involved in early organogenesis led us to suggest that these regulatory elements are already bookmarked in ESCs and thus primed for their future activation once the differentiation process starts. However, the functional relevance of <b>poised</b> enhancers and the role of their unique chromatin features remain unknown. To gain insights into these major questions, first, <b>poised</b> enhancers were identified in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and their activation was evaluated during the establishment of anterior neural identity. Second, using CRISPR/Cas 9 technology, <b>poised</b> enhancer candidates were deleted in mESCs, which were then differentiated into anterior neural progenitors. In general, the <b>poised</b> enhancer deletions resulted in severely reduced induction of the <b>poised</b> enhancer’s target genes. Furthermore, circularized chromosome conformation capture coupled to sequencing experiments revealed that <b>poised</b> enhancers and their target genes physically interacted already in ESCs, thus preceding the activation of <b>poised</b> enhancers and their target genes. Interestingly, these <b>poised</b> enhancer-target gene interactions observed in mESCs were found to be PRC 2 dependent. Additionally, it was demonstrated that while PRC 2 was not necessary to maintain <b>poised</b> enhancers in an inactive state in mESCs, was required for the induction of the <b>poised</b> enhancers’ target genes upon anterior neural differentiation. Finally, <b>poised</b> enhancers were found to frequently reside within a high CpG-dinucleotide genomic context that can directly mediate the recruitment of PRC 2. Overall, these findings demonstrate that <b>poised</b> enhancers are essential for the proper expression of the anterior neural developmental program. Importantly, our work illuminates an unexpected function for PRC 2 in promoting neural induction. Our data demonstrates that both <b>poised</b> enhancers and their target genes display intrinsic sequence features that can directly mediate PRC 2 recruitment. Consequently, PRC 2 can bring <b>poised</b> enhancers and their targets into physical proximity already in mESCs, thus providing a permissive regulatory topology that we propose can facilitate the future induction of mayor anterior neural genes. ...|$|R

40|$|Polycomb {{repression}} in mouse {{embryonic stem}} cells (ESCs) is tightly associated with promoter co-occupancy of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) which is thought to prime genes for activation during early development. However, it is unknown whether RNAPII <b>poising</b> is a general feature of Polycomb repression, or is lost during differentiation. Here, we map the genome-wide occupancy of RNAPII and Polycomb from pluripotent ESCs to non-dividing functional dopaminergic neurons. We find that <b>poised</b> RNAPII complexes are ubiquitously present at Polycomb-repressed genes at all stages of neuronal differentiation. We observe both loss and acquisition of RNAPII and Polycomb at specific groups of genes reflecting their silencing or activation. Strikingly, RNAPII remains <b>poised</b> at transcription factor genes which are silenced in neurons through Polycomb repression, and have major roles in specifying other, non-neuronal lineages. We conclude that RNAPII <b>poising</b> is intrinsically associated with Polycomb repression throughout differentiation. Our work suggests that the tight interplay between RNAPII <b>poising</b> and Polycomb repression not only instructs promoter state transitions, but also may enable promoter plasticity in differentiated cells...|$|R
