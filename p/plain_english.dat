The group made their first awards the next year, rewarding those organisations that used <b>plain</b> <b>English,</b> and highlighting those that did not. Although the Foot in Mouth award was first made in 1993, a specific acknowledgment was made to a comment by Dan Quayle, Vice President of the United States in 1991.|$|E
5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the <b>plain</b> <b>English</b> of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E

Others had apparently succeeded in reading the diary earlier, perhaps knowing about the key, because a work of 1812 quotes from a passage of it. Smith's transcription, which is also kept in the Pepys Library, was the basis for the first published edition of the diary, edited by Lord Braybrooke, released in two volumes in 1825.|$|E

500|$|Isabella and {{her main}} work have been {{subjected}} to criticism {{over the course of the}} twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are [...] "sometimes slapdash and misleading", although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagné's Larousse Gastronomique also contains errors. The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled [...] "how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse... superior work", while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that [...] "It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for." [...] In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Isabella's work was only a [...] "fashionable" [...] stance to take and that the cook's writing [...] "simply makes you want to cook". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the [...] "relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930" [...] may instead be explained by the [...] "progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers". David comments that [...] "when <b>plain</b> <b>English</b> cooks" [...] were active in their kitchens, [...] "they followed <b>plain</b> <b>English</b> recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a [...] "fascinating source of information" [...] from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be [...] "the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era".|$|E

500|$|Garran and {{his fellow}} staff aimed for a simple style of {{legislative}} drafting, a goal enabled {{by the fact that}} there was no pre-existing federal legislation on which their work would have to be based. In Garran's opinion the approach, which was put into practice many years before the similarly principled <b>plain</b> <b>English</b> movement became popular in government in the 1970s, was intended [...] "to set an example of clear, straightforward language, free from technical jargon." [...] Subsequent parliamentary drafters have noted that Garran was unusual in this respect for deliberately setting out to achieve and improve a particular drafting style, and that it was not until the early 1980s that such discipline among drafters re-emerged.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} Richard Carlile's 1818 trial for {{publishing}} The Age of Reason that Paine's text became [...] "the anti-Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century infidel agitators". Although the book had been selling well before the trial, once Carlile was arrested and charged, 4,000 copies were sold {{in just a few}} months. At the trial itself, which created a media frenzy, Carlile read the entirety of The Age of Reason into the court record, ensuring it an even wider publication. Between 1818 and 1822, Carlile claimed to have [...] "sent into circulation near 20,000 copies of the Age of Reason". Just as in the 1790s, it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her study of blasphemy in the nineteenth century, points out, [...] "at these trials <b>plain</b> <b>English</b> was reconfigured as itself 'abusive' and 'outrageous.' The Age of Reason struggle almost tolled the hour when the words 'plain,' 'coarse,' 'common,' and 'vulgar' took on a pejorative meaning." [...] Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison, but spent six years instead because he refused any [...] "legal conditions" [...] on his release.|$|E
500|$|During 1897, Dunne {{sometimes}} set {{his sights}} overseas, discussing Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Dooley noted that while the sun never set on her domains, the original owners did not get to [...] "set" [...] there either, [...] "bein' kept movin' be the polis [...] ". Late that year, Dunne moved to the Chicago Journal as managing editor and Mr. Dooley began to comment at his new venue in early 1898. Dunne had been limited at his old position by Kohlsaat's insistence that his papers support President McKinley's efforts to settle differences with Spain over Cuba short of war. [...] At the Journal, where the journalism was yellow and shrill appeals for war the norm, Dunne labored under no such inhibitions. He had always turned away praise of the Dooley pieces from those aware of his authorship, wishing {{to be known as}} a serious writer. Because of the dialect, the Dooley columns were more difficult for him than writing editorials and columns in <b>plain</b> <b>English.</b> He had ended his last Dooley piece at the Post with the barkeeper bidding farewell, locking the saloon door (as Dunne put it) [...] "perhaps for the last time", possibly meaning that Dooley was done. Dooley had been depicted as in favor of war against Spain in the Post, and Dunne favored military intervention to free Cuba. [...] On February 19, 1898, four days after the USS Maine sank in Havana harbor, Dunne restored Dooley to his arsenal against the Spanish. [...] Fanning wrote of Mr. Dooley's subsequent howls for war: [...] "bandoning his usual stance as a cool and neutral ironist, Mr. Dooley becomes one more loud, irrational voice expressing cruelly simplified hatred of Spain and anger at President McKinley. These new pieces mark the low point in the Dooley canon, for in them Dunne shatters the persona that he has built up s had moderated his position, even if the Journal had not. [...] On April 16, Dunne had Dooley paint a mocking portrait of Fitzhugh Lee, the U.S. consul in Havana whose belligerent reports were fueling the drive to war, in a column printed while the Journal editorial page was praising Lee. But the real breakthrough was after the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1. That a battle had taken place was known, but as the American commander, Admiral George Dewey, was believed to have severed the cable lines, no word came to the United States, and the nation waited in suspense, fearing defeat. [...] Then, news that Dewey had destroyed the dilapidated Spanish fleet arrived, but the details, and the fate of Dewey and his ships and men, were unknown. Before word came from Dewey that he had not lost a ship or man appeared the May 7 Mr. Dooley piece, [...] "On His Cousin George", that is the admiral, for [...] "Dewey or Dooley, 'tis all th' same". Dooley predicted that [...] "he'll write home and say he's got the islands; and he'll turn them over to the government and go back to his ship, and Mark Hanna'll organize the Philippine Islands Jute and Cider Company, and the revolutionists'll wish they hadn't. That's what'll happen. Mark my word." ...|$|E
