40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the design, construction {{and implementation of}} a microcontroller-based long range wireless <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>system,</b> suitable for both domestic and industrial use. At its core, the system {{is based on a}} number of PICAXE 20 X 2 microcontrollers and a pair of XBee Pro wireless modules, which are capable of wireless communication to distances exceeding 1. 5 km. The Long Range Wireless <b>Power</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>system</b> is capable of galvanically isolated single and three-phase current and voltage measurements and is able to calculate real power, apparent power and power factor. The results can be displayed numerically or graphically on a Graphical Liquid Crystal Display. In addition to this, the system has the ability to log usage to an external USB Flash device, allowing for later analysis and for the building of a usage history library. The Long Range Wireless Power Monitor is equally proficient at measuring power consumption of devices, or power generation from sources such as photovoltaic cells or wind turbines. In the example of power consumption, usage costs are calculated from user-defined tariffs. Conversely, for generation, the income from power generated is calculated. At the completion of this project, the Wireless Power Monitor is capable of being deployed for use as a fully working prototype.

40|$|Electricity {{is vital}} for our daily life in modern cites. In order to ensure its {{reliability}} and supply, an electric <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>system</b> is indispensable in an electric power system. Currently, most electric power monitoring systems are designed for steady-state monitoring only. They {{may not be able}} to monitor instantaneous power disturbances, such as voltage surge, happened in electric power systems. In fact, instantaneous power disturbances are frequently found in electric power systems, which result in equipment failures and cause financial losses. Therefore, a novel electric <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>system</b> is proposed in this thesis. Besides traditional functions, the proposed system is capable of monitoring and analyzing instantaneous power disturbances in electric power systems. Novelties of the proposed monitoring system are in the following three major aspects. Firstly, the proposed system is capable of monitoring instantaneous power disturbances. Unlike traditional monitoring systems, the proposed system captures not only statistical power quantities (e. g. kW, kWh), but also voltage and current waveforms. Since a considerable communication network bandwidth is required to transmit electric waveforms in a remote monitoring system, a novel waveform compression algorithm is proposed to realize real-time electric power waveform monitoring on low-speed communication networks (e. g. Zigbee). Secondly, the proposed system is capable of identifying various kinds of power disturbances automatically. It relieves electrical engineers from manned disturbance identification on preserved waveforms. Unlike traditional disturbance identification algorithms, the proposed system can identify not only voltage disturbances, but also current disturbances. Hence, it can provide a better chance in identifying more problems and disturbances in electric power systems. Thirdly, a novel time-frequency analysis method is proposed to analyze preserved waveforms. The proposed method is an improvement to the well-known Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT). DWPT has been used by researchers and engineers to analyze disturbances and harmonics in electric power systems. However, DWPT is subjected to a non-uniform leakage problem, which has been discussed intensively in many studies. In order to tackle this issue, a frequency shifting scheme is introduced in the proposed method. A prototype has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed electric <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>system.</b> There are two major components ‚Äì a prototype meter and a central monitoring system. The performance of the prototype has been evaluated by conducting experiments and field tests. The capability of the proposed system for realtime remote monitoring has been verified on Zigbee network, which is a low-power, low speed wireless communication network...|$|E
