Although the positions of Train Controller and Signalman were always distinct from the inception of the former in 1907, Train Controllers perform work previously executed by Signalmen in some cases. In many railways, modern technology has seen the positions of Signalman and Train Controller united (or reunited, in the sense that traffic regulation and train <b>path</b> <b>allocation</b> were originally duties of the Signalman anyway). Irrespective, the classic Telephone Train Control system has been generally abolished, with a few exceptions.|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} the path {{computation}} algorithm is a key factor to design efficient traffic engineering strategies in multi-protocol label switching networks and different approaches have been proposed in the literature. The effectiveness of a path computation algorithm should be evaluated against its ability to optimise the utilisation of network resources {{as well as to}} satisfy both current and future label switched <b>paths</b> <b>allocation</b> requests. Although powerful and flexible simulation tools might be useful to assist a network manager in the selection of proper algorithms, state-of-the-art simulators and network planning tools do not currently offer a suitable support. This study deals with the design and performance evaluation of multi-constraints path computation algorithms. To this aim, ad hoc software modules have been developed and integrated within the MTENS simulator.

40|$|We {{consider}} two elementary (max-flow and uniform-flow) and two realistic (max-min {{fairness and}} proportional fairness) congestion control schemes, and analyse how the algorithms and network structure affect throughput, {{the fairness of}} flow allocation, {{and the location of}} bottleneck edges. The more realistic proportional fairness and max-min fairness algorithms have similar throughput, but <b>path</b> flow <b>allocations</b> are more unequal in scale-free than in random regular networks. Scale-free networks have lower throughput than their random regular counterparts in the uniform-flow algorithm, which is favoured in the complex networks literature. We show, however, that this relation is reversed on all other congestion control algorithms for a region of the parameter space given by the degree exponent γ and average degree 〈k〉. Moreover, the uniform-flow algorithm severely underestimates the network throughput of congested networks, and a rich phenomenology of <b>path</b> flow <b>allocations</b> is only present in the more realistic α-fair family of algorithms. Finally, we show that the number of paths passing through an edge characterises the location {{of a wide range of}} bottleneck edges in these algorithms. Such identification of bottlenecks could provide a bridge between the two fields of complex networks and congestion control...|$|R

These challenges can be addressed through a flexible and agile control of DC networks, which is also coordinated, i. e., orchestrated, with the management of computing resources to improve the usage of DC resources while effectively meeting user demands. In this regard, the Software-Defined Network (SDN) paradigm can {{play a key role}} thanks to automated and multi-granular network control operations and to a more effective interworking with applications (e. g., cloud management platforms).
