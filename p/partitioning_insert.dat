40|$|Boundary {{effects in}} quantum {{mechanics}} are examined by considering a <b>partition</b> wall <b>inserted</b> at {{the centre of}} a harmonic oscillator system. We put {{an equal number of}} particles {{on both sides of the}} impenetrable wall keeping the system under finite temperatures. When the wall admits distinct boundary conditions on the two sides, then a net force is induced on the wall. We study the temperature behaviour of the induced force both analytically and numerically under the combination of the Dirichlet and the Neumann conditions, and determine its scaling property for two statistical cases of the particles: fermions and bosons. We find that the force has a nonvanishing limit at zero temperature T = 0 and exhibits scalings characteristic to the statistics of the particles. We also see that for higher temperatures the force decreases according to 1 /sqrt{T}, in sharp contrast to the case of the infinite potential well where it diverges according to sqrt{T}. The results suggest that, if such a nontrivial partition wall can be realized, it may be used as a probe to examine the profile of the potentials and the statistics of the particles involved.

40|$|Szilard engine(SZE) {{is one of}} {{the best}} example of how {{information}} can be used to extract work from a system. Initially, the working substance of SZE was considered to be a single particle. Later on, researchers has extended the studies of SZE to multi-particle systems and even to quantum regime. Here we present a detailed study of classical SZE consisting of $N$ particles with inter-particle interactions, i. e., the working substance is a low density non-ideal gas and compare the work extraction with respect to SZE with non-interacting multi particle system as working substance. We have considered two cases of interactions namely: (i) hard core interactions and (ii) square well interaction. Our study reveals that work extraction is less when more particles are interacting through hard core interactions. More work is extracted when the particles are interacting via square well interaction. Another important result for the second case is that as we increase the particle number the work extraction becomes independent of the initial position of the partition, as opposed to the first case. Work extraction depends crucially on the initial position of the partition. More work can be extracted with larger number of particles when <b>partition</b> is <b>inserted</b> at positions near the boundary walls. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

Starting with a given hardware/software <b>partition,</b> interfaces are <b>inserted</b> into the specification to account for communication, in particular across hardware/software boundaries.

The object-orientation enables an easy migration (retargeting) of typical communication primitives to other target architectures. 1.

50|$|For example, in {{the case}} of a simple gas of N {{particles}} with total energy U contained in a cube of volume V, in which a sample of the gas cannot be distinguished from any other sample by experimental means, a microstate will consist of the above-mentioned N! points in phase space, and the set of microstates will be constrained to have all position coordinates to lie inside the box, and the momenta to lie on a hyperspherical surface in momentum coordinates of radius U. If on the other hand, the system consists of a mixture of two different gases, samples of which can be distinguished from each other, say A and B, then the number of microstates is increased, since two points in which an A and B particle are exchanged in phase space are no longer part of the same microstate. Two particles that are identical may nevertheless be distinguishable based on, for example, their location. (See configurational entropy.) If the box contains identical particles, and is at equilibrium, and a <b>partition</b> is <b>inserted,</b> dividing the volume in half, particles in one box are now distinguishable from those in the second box.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the mechanism of insertion of transmembrane (TM) helixes through the translocon presents a major open challenge. Although the experimental information about the <b>partition</b> of the <b>inserted</b> helices between the membrane and the solution contains crucial information about this process, {{it is not clear}} how to extract this information. In particular, {{it is not clear how}} to rationalize the small apparent insertion energy, ΔGapp, of an ionized residue in the center of a TM helix. Here we explore the nature of the insertion energies, asking what should be the value of these parameters if their measurements represent equilibrium conditions. This is done using a coarse-grained model with advanced electrostatic treatment. Estimating the energetics of ionized arginine of a TM helix in the presence of neighboring helixes or the translocon provides a rationale for the observed ΔGapp of ionized residues. It is concluded that the apparent insertion free energy of TM with charged residues reflects probably more than just the free energy of moving the isolate single helix from water into the membrane. The present approach should be effective not only in exploring the mechanism of the operation of the translocon but also for studies of other membrane proteins...|$|R

We consider the problem of partitioning online sequences, where p- 1 separators need to be inserted into a sequence of integers that arrives online so as to create p contiguous partitions of similar weight. While without preemption no algorithm with non-trivial competitive ratio is possible, if preemption is allowed, i. e., <b>inserted</b> <b>partition</b> separators may be removed but not reinserted again, then we show that constant competitive algorithms can be obtained.
