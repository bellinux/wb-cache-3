For an open soap film, the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E

5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a <b>pressure</b> <b>difference.</b> Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

25|$|When an {{aircraft}} exceeds Mach 1 (i.e. the sound barrier), a large <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> is created {{just in front}} of the aircraft.

It is this shock wave that causes the sonic boom heard as a fast moving aircraft travels overhead. A person inside the aircraft will not hear this.

25|$|A {{demand valve}} detects when the diver starts inhaling and {{supplies}} the diver with {{a breath of}} gas at ambient pressure. This is done by a mechanical system linking a pressure differential sensor (diaphragm) to a valve which is opened to an extent proportional to the displacement of the diaphragm difference. The <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> between {{the inside of the}} mouthpiece and the ambient pressure outside the diaphragm required to open the valve is known as the cracking pressure. This cracking <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> is usually negative but may be slightly positive on a positive pressure regulator (a regulator that maintains a pressure inside the mouthpiece, mask or helmet, which is slightly greater than the ambient pressure). Once the valve has opened, gas flow should continue at the smallest stable <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> reasonably practicable while the diver inhales, and should stop as soon as gas flow stops. Several mechanisms have been devised to provide this function, some of them extremely simple and robust, and others somewhat more complex, but more sensitive to small pressure changes.|$|E

25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. If the air supply hose is ruptured near or above the surface, the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The non-return valve at the connection to the helmet will prevent backflow if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or if it fails, the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> will tend to squeeze the diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in severe trauma.

40|$|The present {{series of}} {{investigations}} {{was designed to}} supply information on in vivo pressureflow relationships and to analyse the incidence of regurgitation in different heart valve prostheses in the aortic position. Patients and methods: The study population comprised 185 patients with mechanical Björk-Shiley Monostrut prostheses, 54 patients with Biocor stented porcine bioprostheses, 50 patients with extended Biocor stentless bioprostheses and 59 patients with cryopreserved aortic homografts. Transvalvular <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> and volume flow estimates were derived noninvasively from Doppler measurement of blood velocity across the prosthesis and in the left ventricular outflow tract. Measurements were performed at rest and during supine symptom-limited bicycle exercise. Aortic regurgitation was evaluated semi-quantitatively using colour flow Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler. Patients were investigated after surgery, prior to hospital discharge (baseline) and approximately every year postoperatively. Results: Reference values for baseline Doppler echocardiographic variables for normally functioning prostheses in the aortic position were established. The newly-developed extended Biocor stentless bioprosthesis showed low <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> associated with a significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy {{during the first six}} months after aortic valve replacement, and low incidence of aortic regurgitation. A decrease of 40 % in <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> from baseline to six-month examination was observed in patients with stentless prostheses, partly depending on different haemodynamic states of patients early after the operation. Subcoronarily implanted cryopreserved aortic homografts. demonstrated excellent haemodynamic performance with low <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> and large effective orifice areas. Timerelated increasing risk of progression of aortic regurgitation observed during follow-up justifies more frequent echocardiographic monitoring in patients with homograft valves, especially when aortic regurgitation is detected on baseline examination. Different types of prosthesis of similar size were compared at rest and during exercise. The lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> and the largest effective orifice areas were demonstrated in homograft valves, followed by extended Biocor stentless bioprostheses. With a 65 - 70 % increase in cardiac output induced by exercise, <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> and valve resistance increased significantly while effective orifice area remained unchanged in all four prosthesis types studied. Doppler-derived haemodynamic variables can be obtained at rest and during supine symptom- limited exercise with low variability. The exercise performed in this study was interrupted at a high level of subjective exertion; thus the exercise <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> obtained are likely to represent maximal values for <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> occurring in the patients' daily activities. Conclusions: In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, Doppler echocardiography at rest provides basic information on prosthetic valve function. In addition, exercise Doppler echocardiography provides further valuable insight into valve haemodynamics during physiologically increased volume flow. These results can be obtained with low variability. The stentless porcine bioprostheses and cryopreserved aortic homograft valves exhibit low valve resistance to flow at rest and exercise, reflecting the low haemodynamic load imposed by these valves on the left ventricle...|$|R
