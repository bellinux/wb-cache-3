25|$|Scientists {{recognize}} {{the value of}} wetlands {{on the basis of a}} range of physical functions that they perform. One group of functions relates to water quality. Wetlands are good water filters: they remove and retain nutrients, they <b>process</b> <b>chemical</b> and organic wastes, and they reduce sediment loads to receiving waters. Wetlands also provide flood damage protection to urban and agricultural lands by storing flood waters that overflow river banks or surface waters and by collecting waters in isolated depressions. Wetlands recharge groundwater reserves that are hydrological: connected to surface waters. According to a 1995 National Research Council report, many of these functions occur irrespective of whether the wetlands are isolated or contiguous to navigable waters because of groundwater connections between isolate) wetlands and surface waters. Small, shallow wetlands that are isolated from rivers are frequently important to waterfowl, the NRC said, for food and forage. Also, sites that are intermittently flooded, even those that may be completely dry for several years, can be important for storing flood waters and can have distinctive water-dependent biota (plants and animals) that persist over dry intervals but return when water return to the site.|$|E

40|$|The acute {{toxicity}} of <b>process</b> <b>chemicals</b> applied to mine tailings at Nordic Mining ASA have been determined. The concentrations of the <b>process</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{applied to the}} sediment ranged from {{an order of magnitude}} lower than the Environmentally Relevant Concentration (ERC) to an order of magnitude higher with 2 intermediate concentrations and appropriate controls. There were no effects on any of the organisms at the ERC of <b>process</b> <b>chemicals.</b> There was a statistically significant effect at the 3. 2 times ERC on the growth of the algae but not in the copepod or polychaete worm tests. The 10 times concentration also had an effect on growth of the algae and caused a complete kill in the polychaete worms and crustacean (LC 100). Therefore the Low Observed Effect Concentration (LOEC) is 3. 2 times the environmentally relevant concentration of <b>process</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the mine tailings. The No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) for this study was at the ERC of <b>process</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the mine tailings.
