40|$|A long-standing open {{question}} {{raised in the}} seminal paper of Kalai and Lehrer (1993) {{is whether or not}} the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> a repeated game, in the rational learning model introduced there, must eventually resemble the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> exact equilibria, and not just the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> approximate equilibria as demonstrated there. This paper shows that play may remain distant – in fact, mutually singular – from the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> any equilibrium of the repeated game. We further show that the same inaccessibility holds in Bayesian games, where the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> a Bayesian equilibrium may continue to remain distant from the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> any equilibrium of the true game...|$|R

5|$|As in the {{previous}} two drives, Virginia Tech relied upon its rushing offense: The first five <b>plays</b> <b>of</b> the drive were runs by David Wilson, who gained 26 yards. The Hokies then switched gears, surprising Tennessee, whose defense allowed a 30-yard pass completion from Taylor to Boykin. Tech reverted to running plays, but Tennessee again allowed a long gain, as Roberts advanced 21 yards on a run, then Wilson ran three yards into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 34-14 lead with 5:14 remaining in the game.|$|E

After play resumed, Taylor gained 10 yards on a rushing play and completed a 23-yard pass before Oglesby carried the ball again. When the third quarter ended, Virginia Tech faced second down at the Tennessee 30-yard line, still leading 24-14.|$|E

5|$|Sestero further postulates that Wiseau based Lisa's {{explicit}} conniving on {{the character}} Tom Ripley, after Wiseau had a profound emotional reaction to the film The Talented Mr. Ripley, and matches elements of its three main characters to those in The Room; Sestero has likewise indicated that the character Mark was named for the Ripley actor Matt Damon, whose first name Wiseau had misheard. Wiseau also drew on the chamber <b>plays</b> <b>of</b> Tennessee Williams, whose highly emotional scenes he enjoyed acting out in drama school – many advertising materials for The Room make explicit parallels to Williams's work.|$|E
