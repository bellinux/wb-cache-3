60|$|These examples, I think, {{demonstrate}} that we cannot settle {{the rank of}} a group by {{a consideration of the}} degree in which certain characters resemble or differ from those in what is admitted to be a lower group; and they also show that the highest group of a class may be more closely connected to one of the lowest, than some other groups which have developed laterally and diverged farther from the <b>parent</b> <b>type,</b> but which yet, owing to want of balance or too great specialization in their structure, have never reached a high grade of organization. The Quadrumana afford a very valuable illustration, because, owing to their undoubted affinity with man, we feel certain that they are really higher than any other order of Mammalia, {{while at the same time}} they are more distinctly allied to the lowest groups than many others. The case of the Papilionidæ seems to me so exactly parallel to this, that, while I admit all the proofs of affinity with the undoubtedly lower groups of Hesperidæ and moths, I yet maintain that, owing to the complete and even development of every part of their organization, these insects best represent the highest perfection to which the butterfly type has attained, and deserve to be placed at its head in every system of classification.|$|E
60|$|But Darwin is {{remarkable}} among all broachers of new theories for the extraordinary candour and openness of his method. He acknowledged beforehand all {{the difficulties in}} the way of his theory, and though he himself confessed that some of them were serious (a statement which subsequent research has often rendered unnecessary), he met many of them with cogent arguments by anticipation, and demolished objections before they could even be raised against him by hostile critics. Of these objections, only two need here be mentioned. The first is the question, why is not all nature even now a confused mass of transitional forms? Why do genera and species exist as we see them at present in broad distinction one from the other? To this Darwin answers rightly that, where the process of species-making is still going on, we do actually find fine gradations and transitional forms existing between genera, varieties, and species.[3] But, furthermore, as natural selection acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications, each better-adapted new form will always tend in a fully stocked country to oust and exterminate its own unimproved <b>parent</b> <b>type,</b> as well as all other competing but less perfect varieties. Thus natural selection and extinction of intermediates go for ever hand in hand. The more perfect the new variety, the more absolutely will it kill off the intermediate forms. The second great difficulty lies in the question of the origin of instinct, which, as Darwin shows, by careful inductive instances, may have arisen by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous slight yet profitable variations.|$|E

50|$|Hybrid swarms {{occur when}} the hybrid is viable and at least as {{vigorous}} as its parent types; {{and there are no}} barriers to crossbreeding between the hybrid and <b>parent</b> <b>types.</b> Swarms cannot occur if one of these conditions is not met: if the hybrid type has low viability, the hybrid population cannot maintain itself except by further hybridisation of the <b>parent</b> <b>types,</b> resulting in a hybrid population of low variability. On the other hand, if hybrids are vigorous but cannot backcross with parent populations, the result is hybrid speciation, which, aside from the contribution of new hybrids, evolves independently of its <b>parent</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R

5000|$|From the 1960s {{through the}} early 1980s, a typical {{maneuver}} (infantry or tank) battalion had five companies: headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) and A, B, and C Companies, plus a combat support company (CSC), with a scout platoon, 4.2 inch heavy mortar platoon, along with other elements that varied between organizations. These included heavy anti-tank TOW missile platoons, ground surveillance radar sections and man-portable anti-aircraft missile sections.

50|$|Female potato aphids overwinter as eggs on weeds, the sprouts of {{potatoes}} in storage and on lettuce under glass. They usually emerge in April and begin feeding on perennial weeds, preferring {{plants in the}} family Chenopodiaceae. In May or early June, they migrate to potato, cabbage, tomato and others crops where they feed on shoots, the lower side of leaves, buds and flowers, often on the lower parts of the plant. They are highly polyphagous, feeding on over two hundred species in more than twenty plant families, but their preference is for plants in the family Solanaceae. The female produces up to seventy young by parthenogenesis {{over the course of}} three to six weeks and there may be ten generations over the summer. The optimum temperature for population increase is 68 °F. When populations build up, winged individuals are produced and fly off to infest new host plants. The production of winged individuals is also dependent on the day length, the temperature, the <b>parent</b> <b>type</b> (winged or wingless) and the generation.|$|E

Parenting behavior indicators were examined using latent class analysis as a grouping strategy across three time points to characterize this sample of 2631 Early Head Start mothers.

40|$|A mucoid {{variant of}} Lactobacillus bifidus was first {{described}} byIMalyoth and Bauer (1950, 1951). Colonies of this variant incubated anaero-bically on solid media {{were said to}} be hygroscopic and to become watery on exposure to atmospheric conditions at room temperature. In the first paper, attempts to demonstrate capsules by staining and by suspension in India ink were re-ported as unsuccessful. If the organisms were stained following suspension in freshly ground Chinese ink, however, capsules were seen. In the second paper, it was reported that capsules may be demonstrated also by means of a phase-contrast microscope when suspensions of or-ganisms are exposed to specific immune serum. In our laboratory the occurrence of mucoid variants or mutants of L. bifidus often has been observed. Occasionally a rare mucoid colony may be found in growth from the original inocu-lum. When strains of L. bifidus isolated from the stools of breast-fed infants are carried in the chemically defined medium of Norris et al. (1950) by periodic transfers, mucoid colonies may ap-pear among the smooth parent colonies. Growth in broth is likewise more viscid than that of the <b>parent</b> <b>type.</b> So far as is now known, the cultural requirements of the organisms appear to be the same as those of the <b>parent</b> <b>type,</b> and differences in agglutination reactions between them have not been detected by Williams et al.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a type declaration construct which provides either a type synonym, a datatype, an abstract type, an abstract type with views, a subtype {{of an existing}} type, or a module (collection of declarations).

The combination of separate constructs into a single one has lead to an exploration of subtyping, with the distinction between concrete subtyping and abstract subtyping. Concrete subtyping can be based on an explicit rule for each type constructor, as usual, or on overloading of type constructors.

The two <b>parent</b> <b>types</b> are H 4 and M 4, and the hybrids may be referred to as H 3 M, H 2 M 2, and HM 3 which corresponds to the random association of subunits in tetramer. Using pig LDH preparations, in vitro molecular hybridization was performed. Quantitation of the resulting isozyme distributions and a comparison with that expected from the binomial distribution demonstrated that random association of subunits occurred as proposed by Markert. Based on this concept, the LDH isozyme patterns and LDH pI isozyme patterns of normal adult livers, fetal livers and hepatoma tissues were studied. The isozyme patterns in hepatoma were of an intermediate type between normal adults and fetal livers. The LDH subunit compositions of normal human livers were similar to a 1 : 9 mixture of pig LDH-H 4 and LDH-M 4, however, those of hepatoma tissues were similar to the mixture with a broad range of 1 : 2 ? 1 : 5. The results observed above suggest that the LDH isozyme patterns of hepatoma tissues show “fetalism”, which is based on the proportional increase of H subunit. It appears that the wide fluctuation of LDH isozyme patterns observed in the hepatoma tissues are due to the varieties of relative amounts of the LDH-H and LDH-M subunits...|$|R
