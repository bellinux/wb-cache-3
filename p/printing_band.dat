5000|$|In 1979, Sluggo! {{departed}} from the typical music fanzine {{with the introduction of}} its thematic issues. Topics were Violence, Unco, and culminated with its [...] "Industrial Collapse" [...] issue. The magazine also created the Instant Review, publishing critiques of local performances overnight with free distribution on the streets the very next day. The Sluggo! press was used not only for printing the fanzine but was also made available to local bands for <b>printing</b> <b>band</b> posters and record covers, and to other raconteurs for printing various handbills and broadsides. Sluggo! House became one of the centers of the exploding Austin scene and drew considerable local and national attention as a hotbed of musical and artistic action.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s Tom Clark {{recruited}} experienced staff from England and Europe {{to work in}} the newly formed Crown Lynn Specials Department. New equipment was purchased which enabled a more extensive range to be developed. This new range included tea sets, art pottery and salad ware, and utilised a variety of decorative techniques such as monogram <b>printing,</b> <b>band</b> brushing and lining. At the same time the factory laboratory discovered that the use of a halloysitic clay from Matauri Bay helped increased the fired whiteness of the body. This enabled Crown Lynn to mass-produce tableware decorated with transfers, and coloured tableware. This discovery virtually saved the firm, as the recent revaluation of the pound had made it very difficult for companies to export overseas. The intent of the [...] "Specials Department" [...] was to produce more upmarket works from Crown Lynns existing commercial production-line wares in order to compete with the Royal Doulton works that were being imported into New Zealand. Tom Clark, hired among others, Frank Carpay, Mirek Smisek and Ernest Shufflebotham.|$|E

40|$|Banding {{can be a}} {{major defect}} in inkjet printing. Knowing the visual {{sensitivity}} threshold of inkjet banding is therefore useful for understanding and pushing the technological limit of inkjet printing. There are many reports on the measurement of the human contrast sensitivity using self-luminous sinusoidal contrast targets. There are also reports on measuring the contrast sensitivity of sinusoidal banding on hardcopy targets. However, {{there has been no}} report on measuring visual threshold of banding defects that are characteristic of inkjet printing, which is usually not sinusoidal, despite the evidence that the visual threshold of a complex pattern {{may not be able to}} be predicted based on each of its harmonic components. In this paper, we report a study on measuring the human visual threshold of real-life inkjet banding defects. Inkjet banding samples were produced by simulating a type of actual inkjet <b>print</b> <b>banding</b> with a high quality proofing system. We simulated bandings at five different frequencies and various contrast levels and at a gray level corresponding to 25 % pixel coverage. Fifty observers participated in a visibility and objectionability test with no restriction to view distances under normal office lighting condition and under special lighting for critical proofing viewing. The results obtained show lower threshold values in comparison to reported results on sinusoidal bandings...|$|R
