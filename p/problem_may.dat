5|$|In the maximal clique listing problem, {{the input}} is an undirected graph, and the output {{is a list}} of all its maximal cliques. The maximum clique <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be solved using as a {{subroutine}} an algorithm for the maximal clique listing problem, because the maximum clique must be included among all the maximal cliques.|$|E
5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E
5|$|Density {{criteria}} {{range from}} above 3.5g/cm3 to above 7g/cm3. Atomic weight definitions {{can range from}} greater than sodium (atomic weight 22.98); greater than 40 (excluding s- and f-block metals, hence starting with scandium); or more than 200, i.e. from mercury onwards. Atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). Definitions based on atomic number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. The same <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> occur with atomic weight based definitions.|$|E

5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of the disease was unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E

25|$|In Newtonian mechanics, two {{extreme cases}} of this <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be {{distinguished}} yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: (1) The two bodies rebound {{from each other}} in a completely elastic collision. (2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision. For both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.|$|E
25|$|In part this {{is because}} the {{underlying}} hip <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be mild or severe, may be worsening or stable, and the body may be more or less able to keep the joint in repair well enough to cope. Also, different animals have different pain tolerances and different weights, and use their bodies differently, so a light dog who only walks, will have a different joint use than a more heavy or very active dog. Some dogs will have a problem early on, others may never have a real problem at all.|$|E

25|$|At each node or edge, {{there are}} at most 2k sets S for which we need to {{calculate}} these values, so if k is a constant then the whole calculation takes constant time per edge or node. The size of the maximum independent set is the largest value stored at the root node, and the maximum independent set itself can be found (as is standard in dynamic programming algorithms) by backtracking through these stored values starting from this largest value. Thus, in graphs of bounded treewidth, the maximum independent set <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be solved in linear time. Similar algorithms apply to many other graph problems.|$|E
25|$|At {{right is}} pictured the {{national}} flower of Bhutan (Meconopsis gakyidiana), commonly called the blue poppy (though taxonomically {{it is not}} of the poppy Genus or species, but only poppy-like; thus it cannot produce opiom or its derivatives). The blue poppy (national flower of Bhutan) was the source of an ecological mystery for nearly a century, due to its misclassification as Meconopsis grandis. In 2017, after three years of field work and taxonomic studies, its classification was corrected by Bhutanese and Japanese researchers. The <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> have originally arisen due to the now understood finding that some Himalayan flora readily hybridize with each other and produce viable seeds, causing wider (and unknown) morphological diversity.|$|E

A number of such observational scales have been published and verified Even with noticeable responses from an infant, the underlying <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be hidden.
