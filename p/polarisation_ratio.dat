Its dependence with incidence angle is found to be significantly different from empirical models previously proposed in the literature. It also exhibits some correlation with surface conditions (wind and wave) with a more important correlation with significant wave steepness. Two new analytical formulations are proposed to model the <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio,</b> one as a function of incidence angle only, the second one with additional dependence with azimuth angle.

I further compare detections and limits of circular polarisation and circular-to-linear <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratios</b> in other X-ray binaries. Since {{in at least two}} cases the dominance of linear over circular polarisation or vice versa is a function of frequency, this seems to indicate that this is a strong function of depolarisation in the source.

40|$|Hoar {{crystals}} episodically {{cover the}} snow surface in Antarctica and affect the roughness and reflective {{properties of the}} air–snow interface. However, {{little is known about}} their evolution and the processes responsible for their development and disappearance despite a probable influence on the surface mass balance and energy budget. To investigate hoar evolution, we use continuous observations of the surface by in situ near-infrared photography and by passive microwave remote sensing at Dome C in Antarctica. From the photography data, we retrieved a daily indicator of the presence/absence of hoar crystals using a texture analysis algorithm. The analysis of this 2 yr long time series shows that Dome C surface is covered almost half of the time by hoar. The development of hoar crystals takes a few days and seems to occur whatever the meteorological conditions. In contrast, the disappearance of hoar is rapid (a few hours) and coincident with either strong winds or with moderate winds associated with a change in wind direction from southwest (the prevailing direction) to southeast. From the microwave satellite data, we computed the <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (i. e. horizontal over vertical polarised brightness temperatures), an indicator known to be sensitive to hoar in Greenland. Photography data and microwave <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> are correlated, i. e. high values of <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> which theoretically correspond to low snow density values near the surface are associated with the presence of hoar crystals in the photography data. Satellite data over nearly ten years (2002 – 2011) confirm that a strong decrease of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (i. e. signature of hoar disappearance) is associated with an increase of wind speed or a change in wind direction from the prevailing direction.

40|$|We compare {{different}} methods {{to reconstruct the}} three-dimensional (3 D) CME morphology. The explored methods include geometric localisation, mask fitting, forward modeling, <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> and local correlation tracking plus triangulation. The five methods are applied to the same CME event, which occurred on August 7 2010. Their corresponding results are presented and compared, especially in their propagation direction and spatial extent in 3 D. We find that mask fitting and geometric localisation method produce consistent results. Reconstructions including three-view observations are more precise than reconstructions done with only two views. Compared to the forward modeling method, in which a-priori shape of the CME geometry is assumed, mask fitting has more flexibility. <b>Polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> method makes use of the Thomson scattering geometry. We find spatially the 3 D CME derived from mask fitting lies mostly in the overlap region obtained with the polarisation method from COR 2 A and B. In addition, mask fitting can help resolve the front/back ambiguity inherent in the <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> method. However, local correlation tracking plus triangulation did not show a consistent result with the other four methods. For reconstructions of a diffuse CME, when the separation angle between STEREO A and B is large, finding two corresponding points in a STEREO image pair becomes very difficult. Excluding the local correlation tracking method, the latitude of the CME's centre of gravity derived from the other methods deviates within one degree and longitude differs within 19 degrees.

40|$|Abstract]: Rice {{cultivation}} {{systems in}} various {{countries of the}} world have been changing in recent years. These changes have been observed in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam, specifically in An Giang province. The changes in rice cultural practices have impacts on remote sensing methods developed for rice monitoring, in particular, methods using new generation radar data. The objectives of the study were a) to understand the relationship between radar backscatter coefficients and selected parameters (e. g. plant age and biomass) of rice crops over an entire growth cycle, b) to develop algorithms for mapping rice cropping systems, and c) to develop a rice yield prediction model using time-series Envisat (Environmental Satellite) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) imagery. Ground data collection and in situ measurement of rice crop parameters were conducted at 35 sampling fields in An Giang province, Mekong River Delta, Vietnam. The average values of the radar backscattering coefficients that corresponded to the sampling fields were extracted from the ASAR Alternative Polarisation Precision (APP) images (C band, spatial resolution of 30 m, and swath width of 100 km). The temporal rice backscatter behaviour during the cropping seasons, including Winter Spring (WS), Summer Autumn (SA), and Autumn Winter (AW), were analysed for HH (Horizontal transmit and Horizontal receive), VV (Vertical transmit and Vertical receive), and <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> data. In addition, the relationships between rice biomass and backscattering coefficient of HH, VV, and <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> were established. The methods were examined for rice identification and mapping in the study area by using ASAR APP and Wide Swath (WS) imagery. ASAR APP data were firstly used to determine the best method with high accuracy for rice delineation. Then, the proposed method was applied for ASAR WS data (C band, 150 m spatial resolution, and 450 km swath width), covering the entire agricultural region of the An Giang province. Based on the discovered relationships between rice parameters and radar backscattering, a thresholding method applied for <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> and VV polarisation values of single-date ASAR APP data acquired in the middle of crop season was found to be the best method among various classification methods. Another threshold, i. e. the “normalised difference <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (NDRa) index”, was formulated in this study for mapping the rice crops using ASAR APP image. The classification accuracy was assessed {{on the basis of the}} existing land use data and the published statistical data. By using multiple regression analysis (rather than using an agrometeorological model found unsuitable for modern rice cultural practices), the correlation between backscattering coefficients of multi-date ASAR APP images acquired during the crop season and the in situ measured yield was derived. The distribution maps of estimated rice yield were then produced based on that relationship. Consequently, rice production was finally estimated from these maps. This study showed that the radar backscattering behaviour was much different from that of the traditional rice reported in previous studies, due to changes brought by modern cultural practices. HH, VV and HH/VV radar values were not significantly related to biomass (maximum r 2 = 0. 494) due to the effect of water management, plant density and structure. Using the <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> and VV data of rice fields during a long period of the rice season, the thresholding method based on empirical relationships demonstrated a relatively simple but effective tool to accurately derive the rice/non-rice classes.

The simultaneous detection of aerosol particles, liquid droplets, and ice crystals, especially in the small cloud-particle size range below 50 µm, remains challenging in mixed phase, often unstable ice-water phase environments. The Cloud Aerosol Spectrometer with Polarisation (CASPOL) is an airborne instrument that {{has the ability to}} detect such small cloud particles and measure their effects on the backscatter polarisation state. Here we operate the versatile Cosmics-Leaving- OUtdoor-Droplets (CLOUD) chamber facility at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) to produce controlled mixed phase and other clouds by adiabatic expansions in an ultraclean environment, and use the CASPOL to discriminate between different aerosols, water and ice particles.

As such, nanostructures have a high potential for use in future applications. The relation between the internal structure and those optical properties is not completely understood. We employ high magnetic fields and use fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy to investigate this relation. We present {{the results of a}} study on the internal order of single molecular fibres. Self-assembled stacks of tetra(p-phenylenevinylene) -based molecules (OPV) form micrometre long fibres on graphite by end-to-end alignment of the stacks upon transfer to the solid support. We employ polarised fluorescence microscopy to determine the level of internal order of single OPV fibres. A dipole model is used to explain the observed <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (R ∼ 2). We find that the dielectric properties of the solid support have a strong depolarising influence on the fluorescence of the fibres. This effect, combined with the depolarising effects of the experimental setup, accounts for the rather low <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio.</b> Therefore, our results suggest that the OPV fibres have a high degree of internal order. Low temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to investigate the exciton levels in cadmium-selenide/cadmium-sulfide core/shell nanocrystals. We employ both resonant and non-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy on nanocrystal quantum dots and nanocrystal quantum rods to study the optical properties of the different exciton levels. The existing model was extended to include the effects of a magnetic field on the excitonic levels. We find that the photoluminescence properties of the lowest energy exciton level in both type of nanocrystals is determined by an intricate interplay of phonon-assisted and zero-phonon transitions. This competition can be influenced by a magnetic field or by the composition of the nanocrystal shell. This provides a basis for a new model...|$|E

The study is based on radiometric, meteorological, and biophysical measurements obtained during the SMOSREX Experiment (Toulouse, France).

Secondly, the use of microwave indices to detect the presence/absence of interception was examined. In particular, a modified <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> at 50 ° {{was found to be}} well related to the interception status of the standing vegetation.

40|$|Single-mode fibre lasers are a {{new class}} of active fibre device, which play a {{remarkable}} role in optical fibre communications and sensors. They also exhibit a number of new phenomena, {{one of the most important}} being polarisation effects. In this thesis, new unexpected fundamental polarisation effects in fibre lasers have been discovered. The phenomena are fluorescence depolarisation, the existence of orthogonal polarisation eigenmodes, and the dependence of the output polarisation on the pump polarisation state. A unified theoretical model, incorporating the electric dipole model for rare-earth ions in a glass matrix, is formulated. The concept of effective pump power is introduced and can be applied to existing laser theory; thus laser performance characteristics such as thresholds, slope efficiencies and the polarisation state of the output can be predicted accurately. The good agreement between theory and experiment enables the derivation of the polarised cross-section ratio. This has been done for Nd 3 + and Er 3 + ions in silica fibres. From the theoretical analysis the optimum condition for single polarisation operation is deduced. An effective technique for making single-polarisation single-mode (SPSM) fibre lasers has been developed using an integral fibre polariser.

The GO solution was prepared using improved Hummer’s method. The optical conductivity of GO film for TE-polarised light (perpendicular to the stacking axis of GO layers) {{is in the}} magnitude of 103 Sm- 1, which results in very high optical absorption. On the other hand, TM-polarised light will encounter relatively smaller absorption due to a much lower optical conductivity. It was also observed that the conductivity of the GO film {{is affected by the}} amount of water molecule present in the film. Water molecules are able to permeate {{in and out of the}} GO film freely due to the film natural properties. The permeated water molecules readily interact with the functional groups of each individual GO layer and this interaction reduces the film conductivity by further widening its bandgap. This process was reversible when the water content in the film was reduced. In addition, photothermal reduction through optical phonon relaxation of GO film using near infrared light source was studied. A numerical model of wave propagation in GO film was then developed followed by experimental verification of the model. The GO film was then coated onto a planar optical waveguide.

40|$|This thesis explores {{approaches}} for scaling the output power of rare-earth ion doped fibre lasers and amplifiers, fibre {{amplified spontaneous emission}} sources, and solid state laser oscillators. Scaling output power from laser sources has been a topic of interest ever since the first laser was demonstrated. The development of new geometries and novel techniques for reducing effects that limit the maximum output power are particularly important. Three {{approaches for}} power scaling are demonstrated here. The first is an all fibre geometry for producing predominately single-ended operation. By exploiting the high available gain in rare-earth-ion doped fibres, predominately single-ended laser output can be achieved in a high loss cavity with feedback at one end considerably lower than the other. This was demonstrated with an Yb doped fibre laser using a low loss end termination scheme to produce 29 W and 2 W in the forward and backward directions, respectively, for launched pump power of 48 W. This corresponds to a slope efficiency for the forward direction of 77 %. The single-ended scheme was also applied to a Tm-doped fibre ASE system, producing a maximum output of 11 W for 43 W of launched pump, with an emission bandwidth of 36 nm centred at 1958 nm. Secondly, a Tm-doped fibre distributed feedback laser with 875 mW of single frequency utput at 1943 nm was used in a master oscillator power amplifier configuration. Using three amplifier stages, the output was scaled to 100 W of output with a final <b>polarisation</b> extinction <b>ratio</b> of > 94 % and a beam propagation factor ofM 2 < 1. 25. The last laser architecture was a cryogenically cooled Ho:YAGlaser in-band pumped by a diode pumped Tm-doped fibre laser. After determining the absorption bandwidth {{as a function of}} temperature at the desired pump wavelength of 1932 nm in Ho:YAG, the fibre laser was constructed to have an emission line-width of < 0. 2 nm to achieve efficient overlap with the absorption peak. This fibre laser was used to pump two different Ho:YAG laser configurations. The first was a free-running laser based on a simple two-mirror cavity design, which showed a factor of 1. 7 increase in the laser slope efficiency and a factor of 10 decrease in threshold pump power when the crystal temperature was reduced from 300 K to 77 K. The second cavity condition discussed was for low quantum defect operation, which was demonstrated at 1970 nm corresponding to a quantum defect of just 2 %.

Directional resonance is then revealed by the presence of a preferential <b>polarisation</b> of H/V <b>ratio</b> peaks, whose frequencies correspond to resonance frequencies and whose amplitudes depend on the impedance contrast between surface material and bedrock. H/V ratio amplitudes can potentially provide information also on amplification factors. However, the relation is not straightforward depending on the nature of the waves contributing to the ambient noise. Thus, it is desirable to distinguish different kinds of noise wave packets, possibly isolating the contribution of Rayleigh waves, which appear to better reflect site response properties. To identify Rayleigh wave packets in noise recording a new approach was tested, based on a technique of analysis of instantaneous polarisation. The results are promising for the investigation of site response directional properties, particularly in the case of complex site conditions, where resonance can be characterised by multiple anisotropic peaks. In our preliminary tests of noise recordings carried out at a site located on a slope affected by landslides, only a small fraction of data samples (in the order of 1 %) were identified as Rayleigh type waves: this was likely due the fact that the noise recording was dominated by an overlapping of signals with different kinds of polarisation. Thus, it was possible to recognise Rayleigh polarisation only when the energy of this kind of wave was prevalent. However, from a relatively short noise recording (in the order of 30 - 45 minutes) one can obtain a high number (in the order of thousands) of estimates of H/V amplitude and azimuth, providing a robust statistics to recognise ground vibration properties reflecting site response. The tests on sites where directional resonance properties had been verified through the analysis of seismic event recordings, showed that more coherent observations can be obtained for H/V ratios and directivity estimates by selecting Rayleigh type data samples, rather than analysing the entire data set or SH-type wave packets. This offers the possibility of reducing the uncertainties in data interpretation related to the influence of the nature of the noise wavefield...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to demonstrate the potential of using passive microwave data to monitor flood and discharge conditions and to infer watershed hydraulic and hydrologic parameters. The case study is the major flood in Iowa in summer 2008. A new <b>Polarisation</b> <b>Ratio</b> Variation Index (PRVI) was developed based on a multi-temporal analysis of 37 GHz satellite imagery from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) to calculate and detect anomalies in soil moisture and/or inundated areas. The Robust Satellite Technique (RST) which is a change detection approach based on the analysis of historical satellite records was adopted. A rating curve has been developed to assess the relationship between PRVI values and discharge observations downstream. A time-lag term has been introduced and adjusted {{to account for the}} changing delay between PRVI and streamflow. Moreover, the Kalman filter has been used to update the rating curve parameters in near real time. The temporal variability of the b exponent in the rating curve formula shows that it converges toward a constant value. A consistent 21 -day time lag, very close to an estimate of the time of concentration, was obtained. The agreement between observed discharge downstream and estimated discharge with and without parameters adjustment was 65 and 95 %, respectively. This demonstrates the interesting role that passive microwave can play in monitoring flooding and wetness conditions and estimating key hydrologic parameters...|$|E
40|$|Radar {{sensors can be}} {{used for}} {{large-scale}} vegetation mapping and monitoring using backscatter coefficients in different polarisations and wavelength bands. Due to cloud and haze interference, optical images are not always available at all phonological stages important for crop discrimination. Moreover, in cloud prone areas, exclusively SAR approach would provide operational solution. This paper presents the results of classifying the cropped and non cropped areas using multi-temporal SAR images. Dual polarised C- band RISAT MRS (Medium Resolution ScanSAR mode) data were acquired on 9 th Dec. 2012, 28 th Jan. 2013 and 22 nd Feb. 2013 at 18 m spatial resolution. Intensity images of two polarisations (HH, HV) were extracted and converted into backscattering coefficient images. Cross <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (CPR) images and Radar fractional vegetation density index (RFDI) were created from the temporal data and integrated with the multi-temporal images. Signatures of cropped and un-cropped areas were used for maximum likelihood supervised classification. Separability in cropped and umcropped classes using different polarisation combinations and classification accuracy analysis was carried out. FCC (False Color Composite) prepared using best three SAR polarisations in the data set was compared with LISS-III (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning System-III) image. The acreage under rabi crops was estimated. The methodology developed was for rabi cropped area, due to availability of SAR data of rabi season. Though, the approach is more relevant for acreage estimation of kharif crops when frequent cloud cover condition prevails during monsoon season and optical sensors fail to deliver good quality images...|$|E
40|$|Circular <b>Polarisation</b> <b>Ratio</b> (CPR) mosaics from Mini-SAR on Chandrayaan- 1 and Mini-RF on LRO {{are used}} to study craters near to the lunar north pole. The look {{direction}} of the detectors strongly affects {{the appearance of the}} crater CPR maps. Rectifying the mosaics to account for parallax also significantly changes the CPR maps of the crater interiors. It is shown that the CPRs of crater interiors in unrectified maps are biased to larger values than crater exteriors, because of a combination of the effects of parallax and incidence angle. Using the LOLA Digital Elevation Map (DEM), the variation of CPR with angle of incidence has been studied. For fresh craters, CPR ∼ 0. 7 ∼ 0. 7 with only a weak dependence on angle of incidence or position interior or just exterior to the crater, consistent with dihedral scattering from blocky surface roughness. For anomalous craters, the CPR interior to the crater increases with both incidence angle and distance from the crater centre. Central crater CPRs are similar to those in the crater exteriors. CPR does not appear to correlate with temperature within craters. Furthermore, the anomalous polar craters have diameter-to-depth ratios that are lower than those of typical polar craters. These results strongly suggest that the high CPR values in anomalous polar craters are not providing evidence of significant volumes of water ice. Rather, anomalous craters are of intermediate age, and maintain sufficiently steep sides that sufficient regolith does not cover all rough surfaces...|$|E
40|$|A sea ice thermal {{microwave}} emission {{model for}} 50 GHz was developed under EUMETSAT&#x 0027;s Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) programme. The model {{is based on}} correlations between the surface brightness temperature at 18, 36 and 50 GHz. The model coefficients are estimated using simulated data from a combined thermodynamic and emission model. The intention with the model {{is to provide a}} first guess sea ice surface emissivity estimate for atmospheric temperature sounding applications in the troposphere in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models assimilating Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) data. The spectral gradient ratio is defined as the difference over the sum of the SSMIS brightness temperatures at 18 and 36 GHz vertical linear polarisation (GR 1836). The GR 1836 is related to the emissivity at the atmospheric temperature sounding channels at around 50 GHz. Furthermore, the brightness temperatures and the <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (PR) at the neighbouring 18, 36 and 50 GHz channels are highly correlated. Both the gradient ratio at 18 and 36 GHz and the PR at 36 GHz measured by SSMIS are input into the model predicting the 50 GHz emissivity for horizontal and vertical linear polarisations and incidence angles between 0 &#x 00 B 0; and 60 &#x 00 B 0; The simulated emissivity is compared to the emissivity derived with alternative methods. The fit to real AMSU observations is investigated using the different emissivity estimates for simulating the observations with atmospheric data from a regional weather prediction model...|$|E
40|$|Food {{security}} {{has become a}} key global issue due to rapid population growth {{in many parts of}} Asia, as well as the effect of climate change. For this reason, {{there is a need to}} develop spatio-temporal monitoring system that can accurately assess rice area planted. In the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, the changes in cultural practices have been gradually adopted in the last ten years. These changes have impacts on remote sensing methods developed for rice monitoring, particularly on the accuracy of the resulting classified image. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the accuracy obtained by different Envisat ASAR modes (APP and WS) and the classifiers used. Using Envisat ASAR APP data, the study showed that the radar backscattering behaviour is much different from that of the traditional rice previously reported in the literature, due to changes brought by modern cultural practices. The <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (HH, VV) of rice fields at a single date during a long period of the rice season could be used to derive the rice/non-rice mapping algorithm. The results of this thresholding algorithm achieved higher and consistent accuracies between seasons and districts (i. e. maximum accuracy of 99 % and 98 %, respectively) across the study site when compared to other classifiers, such as the minimum-distance-to-means, maximum likelihood, spectral angle mapper (SAM), ISODATA and K-Means. Regarding the ASAR modes of data acquisition, the ASAR APP data yielded higher and consistent classification accuracy. However, the ASAR WS product proved to be a potential data for rice mapping at regional scale...|$|E
40|$|Sea {{ice melt}} pond {{fraction}} (f p), linked with lower sea ice surface albedo and increased light transmittance to the ocean, is inadequately parameterised in sea ice models {{due to a}} lack of observations. In this paper, results from a multi-scale remote-sensing program dedicated to the retrieval of level first-year sea ice (FYI) f p from dual co- and cross-polarisation C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter are detailed. Models which utilise the dominant effect of free-water melt ponds on the VV / HH (vertical transmit and vertical receive / horizontal transmit and horizontal receive) <b>polarisation</b> <b>ratio</b> at high incidence angles are tested for their ability to provide estimates of the subscale f p. Retrieved f p from noise-corrected Radarsat- 2 quad-polarisation scenes are in good agreement with observations from coincident aerial survey data, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0. 05 – 0. 07 obtained during intermediate and late stages of ponding. Weak model performance is attributed to the presence of wet snow and slush during initial ponding, and a synoptically driven freezing event causing ice lids to form on ponds. The HV / HH (horizontal transmit and vertical receive / horizontal transmit and horizontal receive) ratio explains a greater portion of variability in f p, compared to VV / HH, when ice lids are present. Generally low HV channel intensity suggests limited applications using dual cross-polarisation data, except with systems that have exceptionally low noise floors. Results demonstrate the overall potential of dual-polarisation SAR for standalone or complementary observations of f p for process-scale studies and improvements to model parameterisations...|$|E
3000|$|The Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) {{working at}} 2.2  GHz could {{penetrate}} subsurface regions, {{of up to}} about a meter [38]. Working in active mode, {{it was designed to}} transmit circularly polarised signal and receive the scattered signal back. The sense of reflected polarised signal and its ratio to the incident signal (Circular <b>Polarisation</b> <b>Ratio,</b> CPR) depends on the dielectric constant of the scattering material and therefore its values can distinguish water from soil and can be used as an indicator of presence of water-ice. But multiple surface scattering or volume scattering due to roughness of moon’s surface also influence CPR and can mimic water-ice [38]-[40]. To distinguish craters with water ice at their base and freshly formed craters with rough terrain, a procedure was developed, using the criteria that freshly formed craters should show high CPR only in their rough ejecta material consisting of fresh fragments lying outside the crater, and not inside [...].i.e. crater floor, which is relatively smooth. Therefore, the CPR was compared at the rim, ejecta material outside the rim and crater floors, identifying them with the help of TMC images. Thus freshly formed craters could be identified and distinguished. Water-ice is normally expected to reside at the crater base inside the permanently shadowed craters. In this way, several craters in both, the north and south polar regions, were examined in detail. Even after excluding fresh craters, some craters with anomalous CPR remained which were attributed to presence of water/ice. Such craters exist at both the poles although some water-ice bearing craters were also found at lower latitudes. Their number, however, increased pole wards.|$|E
