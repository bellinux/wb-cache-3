In August 2016, {{it was reported that}} Turturro is reprising his role as Jesus Quintana in Going Places, a spin-off of The Big Lebowski, based on the 1974 French film Going Places, with Turturro starring, writing, and directing; it is currently filming. The Coen brothers, although having granted Turturro the right to use the character, will not be involved, and no other character from The Big Lebowski will be featured.|$|E
5|$|Duxford {{was officially}} {{returned}} to the RAF on 1 December 1945. It remained a fighter station but by 1958 changing defence priorities saw the RAF's fighter force move to more northerly bases. Duxford's last operational flight was made in July 1961. No longer operational, the site gradually became increasingly derelict and overgrown. In 1968 the American film studio United Artists obtained <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> site for the filming of Battle of Britain. During the shoot a single bay hangar, which had been built during the First World War, was demolished to simulate an air raid. After the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to dispose of Duxford plans were drawn up for various developments including two Young Offenders Institutes but were not implemented.|$|E

5|$|Hammer quickly {{sought to}} {{capitalise}} on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched {{a story about}} a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (all 1956).|$|E
5|$|In 1904 the Wrights {{built the}} Flyer II. They decided {{to avoid the}} expense of travel and {{bringing}} supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles (13km) northeast of Dayton. They received <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, {{on the condition that}} no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. Whether that is true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half.|$|E
5|$|On 19March 1995, a Mass {{was celebrated}} in the {{reclaimed}} part of the church {{under the direction of}} Papal Nuncio John Bukowski, who delivered Pope John PaulII's blessing to the parish. In a new decision dated 2November 1995, Luzhkov ordered Mosspetspromproyekt to leave the building {{by the end of the}} year at the latest. When the order was still not implemented, parish members entered the institute on 2January 1996 and began the removal. Institute director Evgeny Afanasyev called the police once again, but on this occasion, they declined to intervene. Subsequently, the institute director asked the parish priest for a final extension of the removal date by two weeks—Mosspetspromproyekt vacated the building on 13January 1996. On 2February 1996, the Archdiocese of Mother of God at Moscow obtained official <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> church indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|In the {{corporate}} setting, security risks are apparent from the outset. What stops a disgruntled employee from messaging some sensitive company data {{to a colleague}} outside the enterprise? The reverse of {{that would be the}} example disgruntled employee downloading some virus or spyware onto his machine inside {{the corporate}} firewall to release as desired. Accordingly, organizational offerings have become very sophisticated in their security and logging measures. Typically, an employee or organization member must be granted a login and suitable <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> messaging system. This creating of a specific account for each user allows the organization to identify, track and record all use of their messenger system on their servers.|$|R

5|$|The {{formally}} registered {{association was}} dissolved {{some time after}} October 1956 but intermittently revived for different reasons by Plantard between 1961 and 1993, though in name and on paper only. The Priory of Sion is considered dormant by the subprefecture because it has indicated no activities since 1956. According to French law, subsequent references to the Priory bear no legal relation to that of 1956 and no one, other than the original signatories, is entitled to use its name in an official capacity. André Bonhomme played no part in the association after 1956. He officially resigned in 1973 when he heard that Plantard was linking his name with the association. In light of Plantard's death in 2000, {{there is no one}} who is currently alive who has official <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> name.|$|E
5|$|The {{workforce}} at Y-12 {{dropped from}} a wartime peak of 22,482 on 21 August 1945 to less than 1,700 in 1949. All the calutrons were removed and dismantled, except for the XAX and XBX training tracks in Building 9731, and the Beta 3 racetracks in Building 9204–3. In 1947, Eugene Wigner, {{the director of the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), asked the Atomic Energy Commission for <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Beta calutrons to produce isotopes for physics experiments. Permission was granted, and a wide range of isotopes was produced. Lithium-6 from the Beta calutrons was used for research into thermonuclear weapons. Many other isotopes were used for peaceful scientific and medical purposes. The Beta 3 racetracks were transferred to the ORNL in March 1950. By the mid-1950s, the Beta calutrons had produced quantities of all the naturally occurring stable isotopes except those of osmium, which had to wait until April 1960. The calutrons continued to produce isotopes until 1998. , they are still on standby.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> trains had still not been {{granted by the}} Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate {{had a series of}} safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E

Lynch disliked the course and considered dropping out, but after being offered the chance to produce a script of his own devising, he changed his mind. He was given <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> school's entire campus for film sets; he converted the school's disused stables into a series of sets and lived there.
