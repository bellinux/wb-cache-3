40|$|A staphylococcal {{pyrogenic}} exotoxin was purified and characterized biochemically and biologically. The organism {{producing the}} toxin {{was a group}} I Staphylococcus aureus strain which was isolated from a vaginal infection of a patient with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (Kawasaki's disease). The possible association of the toxin with the disease syndrome is discussed. The toxin was purified from cell-free culture supernatant fluids by means of differential precipitation with ethanol and resolubilization in <b>pyrogen-free</b> <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> followed by preparative thin-layer isoelectric focusing. The pyrogenic exotoxin produced fevers in both rabbits and mice and enhanced host susceptibility to lethal shock and myocardial and liver damage by endotoxin. Also, the toxin was a potent nonspecific lymphocyte mitogen, stimulating rabbit spleen cells and human cord blood lymphocytes to proliferate. The toxin migrated as a homogeneous protein when tested with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (molecular weight, 12, 000) and reisoelectric focusing (pI 5. 3). Hyperimmune antisera raised against the purified toxin reacted with ethanol-precipitated toxin, using immunodiffusion to form a single precipitin arc. The toxin was distinguished from other staphylococcal toxins {{by a variety of}} methods. The amino acid composition was determined...|$|E
40|$|Background: Antimicrobial {{agents have}} been used as a {{chemotherapeutic}} agent to improve oral health. This in vitro study was carried out to determine the antimicrobial activity of ten Iranian-made toothpastes against commonly found bacteria in the oral cavity. Methods: The microorganisms used in this study were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Candida albicans. Sterile discs impregnated with 10 Iranian-made tooth-pastes; Paveh, Saviz, Latifeh II, Bath, Darugar II, Darugar I, Close up, Tage, Pooneh III and Nasim, which were separately used on agar plates. Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste and Sterile <b>pyrogen-free</b> <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The samples were tested in triplicate, at full strength, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 dilutions. Inhibition zones were measured in millimeter after 48 hr. The data were analyzed by the ANOVA and t-test. Results: All tested toothpastes demonstrated an antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of Bath on S. mutans, Paveh on S. sanguis, Paveh, Saviz, Latifeh III and Darugar II on C. albicans were similar to the activity of Crest Cavity Protection. The antimicrobial activity of Pooneh III and Nasim on S. mutans, Bath on S. sanguis and A. viscosus, and Bath and Pooneh III on C. albicans were significantly higher and the others were significantly lower than the positive control. While, the activity of Crest Cavity Protection was the same as Pooneh III, it showed a weaker activity compared with Bath. Conclusion: Apart from Bath and Pooneh III, the other Iranian-made toothpastes tested in this study showed a lower antimicrobial activity compared to Crest Cavity Protection...|$|E
40|$|Tachypleus tridentatus {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} phylogenetically intact marine {{invertebrates}} known. Its blood cell contains a kind of protein which is clotted by bacterial endotoxin. The cell lysate was extracted by <b>pyrogen-free</b> <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> from the cells according to the method of Reinhold and his co-workers. The cell lysate was gelated by a minute amount of endotoxin. This gelation reaction proved to be a useful method for detection of endotoxin. The studies of Tachypleus tridentatus blood cell lysate were as follows : 1) The lysates were assayed with E. coli 0127 : B 8 & Serratia marcescens lipopolysaccharide B from Difco Laboratories. The lysates showed a high sensitivity a clearly detected 0. 0005 to 0. 008 μg/m? of endotoxin. 2) The gelation reaction was dependent on the endotoxin concentration and incubation time. The difference was demonstrated in the gelation activity for the lysate between E. coli and Serratia marcescens endotoxin. 3) The sensitivity of the lysate decreased in storage of over a year at ? 20 ℃. Minimal detectable endotoxin by the aging lysates was from four to twelve times lesser than that of fresh lysate. 4) An inhibitor in human or rabbit plasma which inhibited the reaction of the lysate and endotoxin was noted. To eliminate the inhibitor, the plasma was treated by various methods, such as chloroform extraction, heating at 60 ーC for 30 minutes, ether treatment or pH adjustment. However none of the methods could eliminate the inhibitor completely. In these methods, relatively better gelation was demonstrated by the heating method. 5) The clottable protein in the lysate was 30 percent of total protein. An increase in optical density of the lysate was dependent on the endotoxin concentration and was clearly related to the grade of gelation. 6) Actinomycin D was capable of enhancing the lethality of endotoxin in ICR mice by 100, 000 fold. This procedure appeared to detect as little as 0. 01 to 0. 001 ug endotoxin in saline. But it was difficult to detect plasma endotoxin by this procedure. In plasma endotoxin, gelation activity for the lysate and the lethal effect of actinomycin D sensitized mice was not always in parallel...|$|E

30|$|To further {{explore the}} {{appearance}} of a traceable blood stream when using <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> lavage, we performed an in vitro experiment. Ten microlitres of human erythrocytes was injected in tubes containing 990  µl NaCl 0.9 % or <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> (concentration 1 : 100). A traceable stream dropping to the bottom was visible in both tubes. After stirring the tubes both solutions got turbid, but for the <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> solution this only lasted a moment. Approximately 5  s after the stirring, the <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> solution turned bright red-pink, clearly transparent. The NaCl solution stayed opaque red-pink. After 30  s, a drop of fluid of both solutions was examined under the microscope. In the NaCl solution, normal erythrocytes were visible, whereas no normal erythrocytes were visible in the <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> solution. Subsequently, another 10  µl of erythrocytes was added to both solutions.
