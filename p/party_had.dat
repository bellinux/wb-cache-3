25|$|LGBT {{rights are}} rarely {{discussed}} or debated publicly, and most political parties {{do not make}} any formal position, in favor of or in opposition, to LGBT rights in their party's platform or manifesto. However, some <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> responded to enquiries concerning same-sex marriage policy: the Liberal Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> indicated opposition to legalizing it, and the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>have</b> indicated support for legalization, while the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> indicated support for legalizing same-sex civil unions.|$|R

5|$|In August 1944 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{met with}} senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss {{formation}} of a pro-independence political party that {{was not associated with}} Mahdism. The first step taken was to launch a new daily newspaper, al-Umma (The Community). In February 1945 the Umma <b>party</b> <b>had</b> been organized and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar; the only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding. However, there were rumors that the Umma <b>party</b> <b>had</b> been created by the colonial government and aimed to place Sayyid Abd al-Rahman on the throne. These rumors persisted until June 1945, when the government publicly said it would not support a Mahdist monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the young}} would-be {{candidate}} {{was offered the}} opportunity of succeeding the party leader, Clement Davies, in the Welsh seat of Montgomeryshire, when Davies decided to retire. There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where the <b>party</b> <b>had</b> long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951. In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for North Cornwall, Dingle Foot, whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring North Devon constituency. The Torrington local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot saw him as a possible successor in North Cornwall. Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, the <b>party</b> <b>had</b> finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|On 12 September various {{opinion polls}} showed that Folkvords {{popularity}} had increased again in Oslo which {{gave rise to}} speculation that Folkvord would win Inger Lise Husøy's seat in parliament because of this sudden rise in popularity.

5|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Vlaams Blok was the People's Union, {{which was}} founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People's Union electoral alliance, that had successfully run for election earlier the same year. The <b>party</b> <b>had</b> been careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. While Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People's Union since its outset, it became clear by the 1970s that the <b>party</b> <b>had</b> moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection of its more radical members. The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party's participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the Egmont pact, believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.|$|E
5|$|The <b>party</b> <b>had</b> {{no strong}} {{economic}} preferences, and generally supported a mixed economy.

5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist <b>Party</b> <b>had</b> organised the uprising.|$|E
