5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local <b>peasantry</b> against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The <b>peasantry</b> was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the <b>peasantry</b> appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E

40|$|This {{tentative}} essay {{tries to}} understand today's {{concerns about the}} decay of the <b>peasantries</b> {{and the loss of}} food security on a massive scale within a long-term and global perspective. Guiding questions are: How to handle the local scale of the peasant with the global scale of societal transformations? How to define <b>peasantries?</b> How is the fate of <b>peasantries</b> linked to economic development and social inequality? What can new research on the success and decline of <b>peasantries</b> learn us? Understanding the old and new 'agrarian questions' calls for new historical knowledge of the role of <b>peasantries</b> within capitalist transformations. The existing knowledge is all to often deformed by a twofold myopia, the English Road to capitalist agriculture, and the European Experience of the dissolution of the <b>peasantries</b> within the industrial and post-industrial economies. Laying down the old premisses of westernized development reveals a different picture of a highly productive family based agriculture, promoting local and regional income and survival systems, and internalizing costs of production and reproduction, contrary to the dominant and ultimatelly dead end tendency within historical capitalism. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reveals the}} opening of {{political}} and legal opportunities for the landless peasants of Central Java {{at the end of}} the 1990 s to reclaim their lands that were confiscated during the end of the 1950 s through a nationalization program to take over Dutch-controlled lands. Taking two sites of plantations that have been targeted as the <b>peasantries</b> 2 ̆ 7 land reclaiming campaign, this article shows the processes of the reclaiming, the responses of both plantation companies and state, and the respect of the state over rights to access to lands or property rights of the peasants as citizens. Using some legal and anthropological approaches, this article finds that the state—through its apparatuses in business units, legal enforcement agencies, government units, courts, etc—is trapped in a Stocksian Paradox that is worse than its original Latin American version because the state has a deep conflict of interest as one of the “counter-claimants” of the indigenous or <b>peasantries</b> 2 ̆ 7 claim to rights to property/land. The authors recommend that although a robust civil society representing the <b>peasantries</b> is one of important parts in rights-reclaiming campaigns, the deeper Stocksian Paradox remains the biggest stumbling block in fulfilling state 2 ̆ 7 s roles as rights-givers to its citizens...|$|R

5|$|In {{retaliation}} for his dismissal and his son's virtual demotion, Qasim al-Ahmad organized the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and Jerusalem against Ibrahim Pasha. On 19 May 1834, the notables gathered and notified Egyptian officials {{that they were}} not able to conscript the Palestinian Arab <b>peasantry</b> into the army or collect taxes from them, claiming that the <b>peasantry</b> had taken up arms and fled to the mountains which were difficult to access. At the time of the notables' stated failure to conscript local peasants, Ibrahim Pasha had been in need of new troops to replenish his army in preparation for further advances against the Ottomans. He considered the notables' position to be treasonous and amounting to an insurrection.|$|E

5|$|With half {{a million}} burghers in the Commonwealth now {{substantially}} enfranchised, political power became more equally distributed, but little was done about the less politically conscious and active classes, such as the Jews and peasants. Although ArticleIV placed the Commonwealth's <b>peasantry</b> {{under the protection of}} the national lawa first step toward enfranchising the country's largest and most oppressed social classthe low status of the <b>peasantry</b> as compared to other classes was not eliminated, as the constitution did not abolish serfdom. Not until the Second Partition and Kościuszko's Proclamation of Połaniec in 1794 would the Polish government begin to abolish serfdom.|$|E
40|$|Scholars tend to {{interpret}} the European <b>peasantry's</b> incorporation into mass politics {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century in terms of two equally extreme situations, citing either the <b>peasantry's</b> support for traditional oligarchies, or its anti-capitalist radicalism. By contrast, this article explores how the confluence between a broad network of peasant families and leased agricultural properties in the Valencian region of Spain helped generate mass support for an anti-liberal (and eventually Francoist) legal system. The authors highlight the uniqueness of the social and productive context of Valencian agriculture during the late 1800 s and early 1900 s, as well as the tensions that existed between landowners and tenants. Such tensions, they argue, did not stop these two groups from efficiently collaborating in favour of an economic orientation that was both developmentalist and politically anti-liberal...|$|R

5|$|Around 1570, of the {{at least}} 700 Protestant congregations in Poland-Lithuania, over 420 were Calvinist and over 140 Lutheran, {{with the latter}} {{including}} 30-40 ethnically Polish.

5|$|In Syria, ethnic {{minorities}} were often underprivileged, and a specific ethnicity often {{belonged to a}} specific social class. The Alawites, the Druzes and the Isma'ilis for instance, were ethnic groups with low social class who began to embrace a radical form of Arab nationalism, e.g. Ba'athism. Without the <b>peasantry</b> there {{could not have been}} a Ba'athist revolution in Syria. The new middle class alone could only produce instability, but together with the <b>peasantry,</b> the revolution became possible. The inequality between urban and rural dwellers, together with capitalist penetration of the agrarian sector and the traditional elites' monopolisation of most large revenue sources, led to the establishment of peasant movements who fought for change, or opposed the system. The Syrian branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was able to recruit young peasants from radical peasant movements, and because of it, was able to mobilise large sectors of the population.|$|E

5|$|The Peasants' Revolt was a {{rebellion}} against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies in Palestine. It was a collective {{reaction to the}} gradual elimination of the unofficial rights and privileges previously enjoyed by the various societal groups in the region under Ottoman rule.

Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local <b>peasantry.</b> Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} written on African <b>peasantries</b> in general and on 'peasant wars' in Africa in particular, {{and yet there is}} a {{remarkable}} gap in the existing literature. On the one hand, literature on peasant wars in general tends to ignore Africa South of the Sahara; on the other hand, none of the studies of specific African <b>peasantries</b> have probed their material {{in the light of the}} more general debates. The present paper tries to remedy this anomalous situation. It first discusses two general theories on the revolutionary potential of different categories of peasants, viz. the theory developed by H. Alavi (1965) and E. R. Wolf (1973) and that proposed by J. M. Paige (1975). It then examines these theories in light of some examples of peasant unrest from Africa, notably Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Chad, Madagascar, Angola, and Kenya. The analysis suggests that neither theory is able to account for all the cases examine...|$|R

5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began {{to adapt to the}} changed economic situation. The death rate among the <b>peasantry</b> meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E

On 8 July Vendôme led his troops before Castellfollit. Having expelled its population and eaten horses and mules, the French garrison, diminished by desertions, was in an unsustainable position, and Vendôme came to evacuate and demolish the fortress. After that, the French army took the way to Hostalric and demolished its defenses, returning to Girona on 28 July.|$|E

To avoid another sacking of the capital by the Latins, he forced the Church to submit to Rome, again a temporary solution for which the <b>peasantry</b> hated Michael and Constantinople. The efforts of Andronikos II and later his grandson Andronikos III marked Byzantium's last genuine attempts in restoring {{the glory of the}} Empire. However, the use of mercenaries by Andronikos II would often backfire, with the Catalan Company ravaging the countryside and increasing resentment towards Constantinople.|$|E

Areas close to the sea featuring cereal crops, vines, and olive groves (the interior of the Balkans, and Asia Minor concentrated on stock raising) were relatively well-favored, and appear to have played an important role in the development of the Byzantine economy. The <b>peasantry's</b> tools changed little through the ages, and remained rudimentary, which resulted in a low ratio of productivity to labor. Nevertheless, according to certain scholars, the permanence of techniques, and tools are evidence of their successful adaptation to the environment.|$|R
