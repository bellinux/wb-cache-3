40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the lateral variations of the crustal structure in Southern California from the waveform data recorded by the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) stations, the LARSE I and II surveys. The Receiver Function method is used to process the teleseismic waveform data to map the lateral variations of the crustal structure. A first arrival analysis of the LARSE II refraction data is used to determine the upper crustal velocity structure (less than 4 km). A 2 -D upper crustal structure with seven steeply dipping faults was constructed from the LARSE II seismic refraction survey. The regional upper plate complexes of the granitic and gneissic crystalline rocks are observed to yield consistently anomalous low velocities of 3. 7 - 4. 3 km/s as compared with the expected velocities for the constituent rock types, which is inferred to result from the extreme shearing, brittle fracturing and related retrogressive hydration reactions. The faults are identified from the distinctive features in the first arrivals and they correlate very well with the geologically mapped faults. Lateral variations of the crustal structure in Southern California are imaged from the back-azimuthal-grouped receiver functions (RFs) of the SCSN stations and the LARSE I, II <b>passive</b> <b>stations.</b> Large variations in the crustal structure are commonly observed beneath the San Gabriel Mountains (SGM), the western Peninsula Ranges, and the eastern Mojave Desert, such as the transition from 2 -layered crustal structure to 3 -layered from the eastern to the western SGM and the large offsets on the Moho among the different RF station groups. Deep Moho of 34 - 39 km is observed beneath the western Peninsula Ranges (WPR), Sierra Nevada and the San Bernardino Mountains and no regional root is observed beneath the San Gabriel Mountains. Synthetic waveform modeling of the anomalous features in the RFs for two stations in the eastern San Gabriel Mountains indicates the existence of a flat-topped notch structure on the Moho.

The passive seismic experiment was designed to give an independent confirmation of this interpretation, as basal sliding {{is believed to be}} associated with the release of more acoustic energy than a deforming bed. The results show that this is the case, basal sliding producing six times more events.

During post processing, the received transmissions are characterized {{in order to}} verify proper instrument operation and to eliminate error in satellite telemetry and in data products generated from processing SeaWinds data. Sources of instrument error include uncertainties in transmitted power, pulse timing, and carrier frequency drift. Identifying these errors prevents their propagation to data products. A key aspect of this analysis involves accurately estimating {{the parameters of the}} SeaWinds transmissions. As better parameter estimates are researched and developed, the scatterometer can be more finely calibrated and better characterized, allowing improved accuracy of environmental measurements. This work explores several methods to estimate SeaWinds frequency parameters by parametrically modeling the signal as a series of linear FM pulses. Improved frequency estimates are obtained by transforming the signal into appropriate signal spaces. These methods are compared and their tradeoffs revealed. SNR regions are assigned to each method to mark appropriate performance bounds, and improvements over previous SeaWinds data analysis methods are shown. Finally, recent estimates of SeaWinds parameters are disclosed. This analysis helps to advance the level to which future scatterometer instruments may be calibrated, providing the potential for more accurate scatterometer data products.

40|$|Abstract—We study {{broadcasting}} {{on multiple}} access channels by deterministic distributed protocols. Data arrivals {{are governed by}} an adversary. The power of the adversary is constrained by the average rate of data injection and a bound {{on the number of}} different packets that can be injected in one round. The injection rate is at most 1, which forbids the adversary from overloading the channel. We consider a number of deterministic protocols. For each of them we give an upper bound on the worst-case packet latency, {{as a function of the}} constraints imposed on the adversary. We present results of experiments by simulations to compare packet latency of the deterministic protocols and of backoff-type randomized protocols.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study between passive and active surveillance based on herd visits (villages) was conducted {{over a period}} of 24 months. It included 106 surveillance stations of the animal disease epidemiological surveillance network in Chad distributed randomly into 52 stations of active surveillance and 54 <b>stations</b> of <b>passive</b> surveillance. Nine diseases of various vaccination and expected prevalence status were monitored. The active surveillance stations carried out four herd visits monthly to look for the diseases under surveillance and organised four farmers awareness-raising meetings to stimulate them to make disease notifications. The <b>passive</b> surveillance <b>stations</b> held each month four farmer awareness-raising meetings. The suspicions recorded by the stations were consigned to a suspicion form specific to each disease, indicating whether a call from the farmer, a visit to the herd or a awareness-raising meeting was the source. The results showed that, irrespective of surveillance type, all diseases under surveillance, except the rare diseases (Rinderpest and Rift Valley fever) were reported by the surveillance agents. However, suspicions recorded following farmer calls are significantly more important than suspicions carried out during herd visits or meetings. Nevertheless, a considerable number of suspicions is recorded during awareness-raising meetings. Finally approximately 83 % of the herd visits realised by the active surveillance stations showed negative results (no suspicion identified). Passive surveillance stimulated by awareness-raising meetings appears to be better adapted to Chads conditions and less expensive for the surveillance of existing diseases. However, for the rare diseases, other methods of specific active surveillance (such as for example sentinel herds) remain important to complete passive surveillance...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedIn the {{mammalian}} visual system, {{sensory information}} {{captured by the}} retina is routed through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus before reaching the cerebral cortex. The lateral geniculate circuits thus operate as a gateway for visual information flowing from the sensory periphery to the central nervous system. Traditionally, the LGN has been regarded as a <b>passive</b> relay <b>station</b> rather than an active processing center because the receptive fields of geniculate neurons closely resemble those of retinal ganglion cells. This simplistic view, however, {{is at odds with}} the complexity of the thalamic neural circuits - the LGN houses a substantial population of inhibitory neurons that can modulate the activity of the thalamocortical projecting neurons. How do the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the LGN form circuits to process visual information from the retina to the cortex? In this dissertation, three studies that address this question will be presented. Using in vivo patch recordings, these studies directly probe the functional components of the thalamic neural circuit in the whole animal; automated visual stimulation, quantitative analysis and computer simulation are then used to reveal the principles underlying the spatio-temporal operation of retinothalamic transmission. Specifically, it will be demonstrated that inhibitory neurons of the LGN process retinal inputs in a distinct manner and actively transform the temporal patterns of neural activities from the retina to the cortex. Moreover, it will be shown that the biophysics of the retinothalamic synapse accounts for a recoding of the visual information represented in the thalamus. Taken together, this body of work creates a better understanding of neural mechanisms of the visual thalamus and their functional consequences for sensory information processing...|$|R

The site test is located in the N-E part of Italy (Caldiero, Verona Province) where more than 100 <b>passive</b> single <b>station</b> seismic noise measurements were conducted. The final aim was the characterization of an important hydrothermal basin, which is exploited since the Roman Period. The huge amount of measurements offers high density cover, since the measurements point has average spacing of 100 m for a total area investigated of ca 100 ha. The HVSR (Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio) is a geophysical passive technique used to retrieve fundamental resonance frequency of the subsoil. The measurement consists in passive recording of seismic noise with 3 components broadband receivers. From the spectral analysis of the recorded data, we can retrieve the resonance frequency of soil and hence information about depth and mechanical properties of soil covers. Since HVSR is a punctual measurement, 2 d map of the results are usually extracted with interpolation procedure, as common kriging or natural neighbor techniques. Despite this accurate statistical procedure are rarely adopted for HVSR analysis, limiting the real significance of the dataset. As a matter of fact, rigorous statistical approach of the spatial distribution is neglected in common HVSR geophysical prospecting. Here we present the use of advanced spatial-statistic technique (e. g. cross-validation, residual distribution etc.) applied to HVSR data. Our results show as critic data scrubbing, joined to rigorous statistical approach for data interpolation, are mandatory to assure meaningful structural interpretation of microtremor HVSR survey.

Seventy-five seismic stations were deployed across the southern Puna Plateau in 2007 – 2009 by scientists fromthe U. S., Germany, Chile, and Argentina to test the delamination model for the region. The Puna <b>passive</b> seismic <b>stations</b> were located between 25 and 28 °S. Using the seismic waveform data collected from the PUNA experiment,we employ attenuation tomography methods to resolve both compressional and shear quality factors (Qp and Qs, respectively) in the crust and uppermost mantle. The images clearly show a high-Q Nazca slab subducting eastward beneath the Puna plateau and another high-Q block with a westward dip beneath the Eastern Cordillera. We suggest that {{the latter is a}} piece of delaminated South American lithosphere. A significant low-Q zone lies between the Nazca slab and the South American lithosphere and extends southward from the northernmargin of the seismic array at 25 °S before vanishing around 27. 5 °S. This low-Q zone extends farther west in the crust and uppermost mantle {{at the southern end of}} the seismic array. The low-Q zone reaches ~ 100 km depth beneath the northern part of the array but only ~ 50 km depth in the south. Lateral variations of the low-Q zone reflect the possible mechanism conversion between mantle upwelling related to delamination and dehydration. The depth of the Nazca slab as defined by Q images decreases from north to south beneath the plateau, which is consistentwith the steep-flat transition of the angle of the subducting slab as defined by previous earthquake studies.

This selection has 272 time series of which there were statistically significant trends in 50 cases: 34 (12. 5 %) were downwards and 16 (5. 9 %) upwards. The dominance of downward trends indicates that contamination is decreasing. Of the 272 cases, 156 could be classified by the environmental classification system used by the Norwegian Environment Agency, 81. 4 % were classified as insignificantly polluted, 13. 5 % as moderately polluted, 4. 5 % as markedly polluted, 0 % as severely polluted and 0. 6 % as extremely polluted. Analyses of HBCD, SCCP, MCCP, PFRs, BPA, and TBBPA and the use of passive samplers were included in this programme for the first time. Some cases warrant special concern. These were for example upward trend for mercury in cod fillet from the inner Oslofjord, high concentrations of hexabromocyclododecane (a-HBCD) in cod liver from the same area, and high concentrations of medium chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCP) in cod liver from SørfjordMiljødirektorate...|$|R
40|$|The HVSR (Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio) {{technique}} {{is very popular}} {{in the context of}} seismic microzonation and for the mapping of shallow seismic reflectors, such as the sediment/bedrock transition surface. This easy-to-deploy single <b>station</b> <b>passive</b> seismic technique permits the collection of a considerable amount of HVSR data in a cost-effective way. It is not surprising that some recent studies have adopted single station micro-tremor analyses in order to retrieve information on geological structures in 1 D, 2 D or even 3 D reconstructions. However, the interpolation approaches followed in these studies for extending the punctual HVSR data spatially are not supported by a detailed spatial statistical analysis. Conversely, in order to exploit the informative content and quantify the related uncertainty of HVSR data it is necessary to utilize a deep spatial statistical analysis and objective interpolation approaches. Moreover, the interpolation approach should make it possible to use expert knowledge and auxiliary information. Accordingly, we present an integrated geostatistical approach applied to HVSR data, collected for retrieving information on the morphology of a buried bedrock surface. The geostatistical study is conducted on an experimental dataset of 116 HVSR data collected in a small thermal basin located in the Venetian Plain (Caldiero Basin, N-E Italy). The explorative geostatistical analysis of the data coupled with the use of interpolation kriging techniques permit the extraction of relevant information on the resonance properties of the subsoil. The utilized approach, based on kriging with external drift (or its extension, i. e. regression kriging), permits the researcher to take into account auxiliary information, evaluate the related prediction uncertainty, and highlight abrupt variations in subsoil resonance frequencies. The results of the analysis are discussed, also with reflections pertaining to the geo-engineering and geo-environmental context...|$|R
40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} from {{commercial}} power reactors is reprocessed at the COGEMA plant in La Hague. After shearing and {{dissolution of the}} fuel assemblies, the hulls and nozzles are sent to COGEMA's new compaction facility (ACC) to reduce the final volume of waste. Technological waste generated in the reprocessing plant is also sent to the ACC facility. Compacted waste is characterized by two measurement stations: a gamma spectrometry station and an active and <b>passive</b> neutron measurement <b>station.</b> The main purpose of these measurement stations {{is to determine the}} guaranteed nuclear parameters of the compacted waste and their associated uncertainties: (1) total U and Pu masses, (2) Pu, Cm, and total alpha activities, (3) 137 Cs, 90 Sr- 90 Y, 241 Pu beta activities, (4) decay heat. After giving a description of the measurement stations, this paper will describe the qualification tests performed {{in the context of the}} ACC project. The extensive calibration tests performed on site with different sources and different waste matrices will be described (approximately 500 neutron and gamma experiments). Hot tests that were conducted after hot start-up at the end of 2001 and prior to the start of commercial operation will be also presented. A number of drums produced by the upstream facilities were introduced one by one into the ACC facility in order to avoid mixing of different fuel assemblies. This procedure allows comparison between characterization performed in the upstream facilities on the basis of fuel data available before processing and the measurements performed on the new ACC stations. These comparisons showed good agreement between the different methods of characterization and thus validated the innovative technologies and methods used by COGEMA for compacted waste generated by the ACC facility...|$|R
