40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the excitation of the Earth’s polar instability {{in the absence of}} external torques is explored. The conventional perturbation scheme used to simplify the Liouville equation has oversimplified the excitation physics. The Earth becomes axially near-symmetrical and slightly triaxial during polar excitation, which induces additional change in the moment <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> Polar excitation is due to mass redistribution {{in a part of the}} Earth to appear as a relative angular momentum involving both motion and rotation, while the rest of the Earth is only in rotation. Relative angular momentum arising due to mass redistribution consists of two terms; one is due to motion, and the other involves the <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> induced by the motion. Motion excites a wobble of the rotation axis around the principal axis. The <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> force the “instantaneous figure axis ” to shift away from the principal axis to initiate secular polar shift, while the rotation axis continues to wobble around the “instantaneous figure axis ” at its new position. Wobble can thus be excited alone by motion, but secular polar shift comes always along with a wobble and can only be excited by the <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> The “residual ” <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> induced by motion and the <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> arising due to axial near-symmetry constitute continued polar excitation. During continued polar excitation, the “instantaneous figure axis” around which the rotation axis wobbles will no longer be the principal axis. The principal axis will no longer be symmetrical, with its new location to be determined. New definition of relativ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{moments and}} <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> of the Fairey Delta 2 {{aircraft}} have been measured {{using the method}} of spring restrained oscillations. The moment of inertia results were satisfactory, but difficulty was found in determining the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> due to unsatisfactory design of the single point suspension rig. A dependence of roll period on roll amplitude was discovered {{and this may be}} due to some form of ground effect. The damping in roll was found to vary with fuel state. The agreement between the manufacturer's estimates and the measured moments and <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> was poor, and there is clearly a continuing need for inertia measurements. Simple estimates of the fuel inertias compared well with the measured values, agreement being within the expected accuracy of the measurements. The fuel load of the Fairey Delta 2 is relatively small, and simple estimates for greater loads might be less satisfactory. *Replaces R. A. E. Tech. Report No. 68 160 [...] -A. R. C. 30 973.

Measurements were made with the landing gear retracted for full and empty fuel conditions. The equipment, which consisted primarily of knife—edge supports and restraining springs for the pitch and roll axes and a single—shaft torsional pendulum for the yaw axis, was designed for increased accuracy as well as for simplicity of operation and ease of handling as compared with previous methods. At no time was it necessary to hoist or jack the airplane in an abnormal fashion. Analysis showed the maximum possible error of the inertia measure-ments to be ± 1. 7, ± 1. 2, and ± 0. 6 percent of the true moments of inertia about the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. For each suspension system, measured moments of inertia of known masses of simple form agreed within 0. 5 percent with the calculated values. The results of brief tests have indicated that suitable application of the torsional pendulum would permit evaluation of the inclination of the principal axes to within less than ± 0. 1 °, which corresponds to an error of less than ± 35 slug-feet squared in the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> of the test airplane...|$|E
