500|$|The Fisher {{government}} {{carried out}} many reforms in defence, constitutional matters, finance, transport and communications, and social security, achieving {{the vast majority}} of their aims in just three years of government. These included establishment of old-age and disability pensions, a maternity allowance and workers compensation, issuing Australia's first paper currency, forming the Royal Australian Navy, the start of construction of the Trans-Australian Railway, expanding the bench of the High Court of Australia, the founding of Canberra, and the establishment of the state-owned Commonwealth Bank. Fisher's second government also introduced uniform <b>postal</b> <b>charges</b> throughout Australia, carried out measures to break up land monopolies, put forward proposals for closer regulation of working hours, wages and employment conditions, [...] and amended the 1904 Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide greater authority for the court president, and to allow for Commonwealth employees' industrial unions, registered with the Arbitration Court.|$|E

5000|$|Dennett {{was born}} in Bangor, Maine and {{attended}} Bangor High School and then Wheaton College in Illinois. Winning an essay contest at Wheaton, he transferred to the journalism school of Columbia University, where he was awarded a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship for travel in Europe. [...] In 1939 he was a publicist in Washington, D.C. when he was paid by German agent George Sylvester Viereck to front (as Treasurer) the [...] "Make Europe Pay its War Debt Committee" [...] and later the [...] "Islands for War Debt Committee", {{both of which were}} aimed to prevent the American government from extending aid to war-time Britain and France. Dennett {{was at the center of}} an elaborate scheme by which isolationist Congressmen such as Hamilton Fish III and Robert Rice Reynolds would make pro-German statements in the Congressional Record, which would then be printed by Viereck and mailed around the country without <b>postal</b> <b>charge</b> using the Congressional franking privilege. [...] Just before Federal agents raided Dennett's offices, he transferred a number of bags of illegally franked mail to Representative Fish's office, where they were subsequently discovered. Fish's chief aid George Hill was convicted of perjury in connection with the case.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} trade unions and {{employee}} representatives have protested at {{the treatment and}} employment terms of PIN staff claiming that the company can only undercut Deutsche Post <b>postal</b> <b>charges</b> by hiring cheap workers on salaries just above the minimum wage. The PIN Group has argued that, unlike arch-rival Deutsche Post, it is obliged to pay value-added tax.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1901, New Zealand {{introduced}} one penny universal postage from New Zealand to {{any country}} in the world willing to deliver them. Australia, the United States, France and Germany would not accept such letters, fearful of having to reduce their own <b>postal</b> <b>charges</b> to match. This also halved the cost of mailing letters within New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|On 11 July 1562 {{the king}} {{concluded}} a New agreement with Krzysztof Taxis, {{the executive director}} of the imperial post in Vienna, on the basis of which, he acquired all posts in Poland, establishing the institution under the name of Poczta Polska (Polish Post), i.e. Royal post. It was composed of the Italian post (Cracow-Vienna-Venice) and Lithuanian Post (Cracow-Warsaw-Vilnius). The postal messenger left Cracow each Sunday morning, arrived in Vienna on Wednesday and then left for Venice, where he arrived after seven days journey. The courier set off to Lithuania each week on Wednesday, in order to arrive in Vilnius after a week's journey. Therefore, the letter from Cracow to Venice took 10 days and from Cracow to Vilnius 7 days. The <b>postal</b> <b>charge</b> amounted to 3 grosz from 1 lot of weight of private parcel. The king's and court's parcels were free of charge, but the monarch paid yearly subsidy for the benefit of the post in the amount of 1500 thalers (1200 for the Italian post, 300 for the Lithuanian post). This amount was collected in instalments from the Cracow duty. The director, who received the total income from the post, in return had to take care of the maintenance and its supplies. Although the Polish post under the management of a new director created new extensive and proper international connection, the contract with Taxis was terminated after two years due to various intrigues.|$|R

50|$|Saxon postal mileposts {{were set}} up {{during the reign of}} August the Strong and his {{successor}} along all important postal and trading routes and in almost all towns in the Electorate of Saxony to indicate the official distances. This was intended to be the basis {{for the creation of a}} unified calculation of <b>postal</b> <b>charges.</b> Because the territory of the Electorate of Saxony was larger than that of the present-day German state of Saxony, these mileposts are nowadays also found in the states of Thuringia, Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, as well as in Poland.|$|E
50|$|Although {{numerous}} {{benefits such as}} pensions, sickness benefits, {{and unemployment}} benefits were increased Third Labour Government’s time in office, it failed to increase the family benefit, which continued at a nominal rate set in 1972 by the previous National government at $3 a week per child, {{which led to the}} real value of the family benefit being reduced to the extent of $1 a week for each child. In defending the Third Labour Government’s family policy record, however, Labour MPs pointed to subsidies on a variety of consumer products including gas, electricity, <b>postal</b> <b>charges,</b> wool, milk, meat, eggs, bread, and some transport items.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless I {{thought much}} about it, and on the 29th of July, 1853,--having been then two years without having made any {{literary}} effort,--I began The Warden, at Tenbury in Worcestershire. It was then more than twelve months since I had stood for {{an hour on the}} little bridge in Salisbury, and had made out to my own satisfaction the spot on which Hiram's hospital should stand. Certainly no work that I ever did took up so much of my thoughts. On this occasion I did no more than write the first chapter, even if so much. I had determined that my official work should be moderated, so as to allow me some time for writing; but then, just at this time, I was sent to take the <b>postal</b> <b>charge</b> of the northern counties in Ireland,--of Ulster, and the counties Meath and Louth. Hitherto in official language I had been a surveyor's clerk,--now I was to be a surveyor. The difference consisted mainly in an increase of income from about 450 to about 800;--for at that time the sum netted still depended on the number of miles travelled. Of course that English work to which I had become so warmly wedded had to be abandoned. Other parts of England were being done by other men, and I had nearly finished the area which had been entrusted to me. I should have liked to ride over the whole country, and to have sent a rural post letter-carrier to every parish, every village, every hamlet, and every grange in England.|$|R
25|$|The first {{pictorial}} postal {{cards were}} released on 10 August 1967. Featuring 4 designs showing Buddha, a small industry, a boat scene from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and a dam in West Pakistan. These 30 paisa cards had a flying dove silhouette. About 8months later in May 1967, {{a second set}} of 4 cards was released. In 2001, the Post Office teamed up with the organisers of the SAF Games, which were scheduled for that year in Islamabad, to produce Rs.10 postcards. Besides being valid for postage, these cards entitled the buyer to be entered into a lucky draw. In 2009, the government reissued the current Re 1 Lahore Fort postcard with a Re. 1 <b>postal</b> stationery <b>charge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} secular or {{religious}} designs is frequently a bone of contention in some countries; church leaders often see secular designs as diluting {{the meaning of}} the holiday, while postal officials fear that overly religious designs could lead their secular or minority-religious customers to avoid the stamps, leaving millions unsold, and even expose the <b>postal</b> administration to <b>charges</b> that they are violating laws prohibiting the promotion of a particular religion.|$|R
50|$|Part of Palmer's {{argument}} for the changes had been that such an improvement in the service would justify an increase in <b>postal</b> <b>charges,</b> {{and he had been}} promised two-and-a-half percent of any increase in the revenue as well as control of the new service. He was appointed Comptroller General of the Post Office on 11 October 1786, but there was some delay in paying him his share of the very substantial increase in revenue (which had risen from £51,000 in 1784 to £73,000 in 1787). He was eventually granted a payment of arrears after a commission of inquiry investigated in 1789, but not the full sum that he claimed.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "philately" [...] is the English {{version of}} the French word [...] "philatélie", coined by Georges Herpin in 1864. [...] Herpin stated that stamps had been {{collected}} and studied for the previous {{six or seven years}} and a better name was required for the new hobby than timbromanie, which was disliked. He took the Greek root word φιλ(ο)- phil(o)-, meaning [...] "an attraction or affinity for something", and ἀτέλεια ateleia, meaning [...] "exempt from duties and taxes" [...] to form [...] "philatelie". The introduction of postage stamps meant that the receipt of letters was now free of charge, whereas before stamps it was normal for <b>postal</b> <b>charges</b> to be paid by the recipient of a letter.|$|E
50|$|July 1859 is {{an example}} of an early issue; a time when Melbourne's {{railways}} were at an embryonic stage. The privately-owned Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company, the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, and the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company were all operating, and the government-owned Victorian Railways had just built their first lines to Williamstown and Sunbury. Railway information only occupied eight of the 124 pages. The remainder of the Guide provided comprehensive detail of all manner of institutions in what was a very fast-growing colony, mainly because of the Victorian gold rush. Information is given about the Parliament, Government, courts, municipal councils, the electric telegraph, banks, insurance companies, churches, Masonic lodges, <b>postal</b> <b>charges</b> and arrangements, and country localities. There were also a number of advertisements. The printing is of a high standard for the times.|$|E
5000|$|On August 2013 Russian Post began {{accepting}} loan {{payments on}} behalf of any Russian bank. Repayment of loan is made by postal transfer to {{a subsidiary of the}} Post, ООО [...] "Rapid", then the money is sent by bank transfer to the appropriate bank. Postal employees themselves complete a payment form for the customer, then the postal order form is printed and signed by the customer. For the usage of <b>postal</b> services, operators <b>charge</b> a fee of 1.9 percent, with a minimum of 50 rubles.|$|R
50|$|During 1937-39, the German Wehrmacht had a {{military}} mailing service that provided free postal services within Germany. On September 3, 1939, the first {{changes to the}} service occurred. Postcards and letters up to 250 g including newspapers could be mail free of charge by the German para-military and military organizations. Later in 1939, packages weighing up to 1000 g were included at the nominal rate of 20 Reichspfennig fee. All German military branches had its own organic <b>postal</b> administration in <b>charge</b> of receiving and delivering mail. For Feldpost offices closest to the combat zone a mobile facility usually processed mail for all military branches.|$|R
50|$|Since the program's inception, {{critics have}} pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design. Some claim {{that the amount of}} RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished {{families}} above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month. Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality. Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment. These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers. Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments. There have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism. By some estimates, only 50-60 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed. Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments. It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates. For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold. Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families—1,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold. Beneficiaries have also complained that the <b>postal</b> service <b>charges</b> an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a serious {{challenge}} of today. In order to reach the ambiguous mitigation scenarios for greenhouse gases, strong efforts are to be undertaken. Electric vehicles {{are seen as a}} potential mean to reduce emissions and energy import dependencies of most western societies. So far, the progress toward more electric vehicles in individual passenger transport is still slow. The objective to increase the share of electric vehicles of many national governments seems to be rather ambitious. In commercial transport, mileage is usually higher, trips are planned more precisely, and driving patterns are more regular than those of private vehicles. With these and other promising factors, we assume a high potential of electric vehicles in commercial transport. Therefore, we analyze in this paper the commercial transport in Germany and especially the large share of light commercial vehicles in order to make these potentials explicit. Based on German survey data, we analyze the heterogeneous German economic sectors with top-down statistical values like daily distance categories and bottom-up values like driving and parking behaviors. By way of example, German postal services are evaluated in detail, which leads to an electrification potential of between 60, 750 and 105, 550 vehicles. In case of “green” electricity for <b>charging,</b> <b>postal</b> services can avoid up to 882, 000 tCO 2 /a, which is about 40 – 70 %...|$|R
40|$|Postal {{services}} have emerged and existed {{because of the}} need for communication and their millenary existence was achieved due to three elements: the only channel of communication, the state of monopoly conferred by the status of the state institution and therefore no competition. The most important known moments in the history of postal services, which led to reforms are: unification of postage <b>charges,</b> <b>postal</b> stamp appearance and now, liberalization of postal services. The slow development of the postal sector varies from country to country, depending on the state of development of the country and within countries depending on the gap between urban and rural areas. The operation of postal services throughout their existence was and is provided by specific legislation and it should be aligned with international postal legislation, to ensure continuity of information. There can be no country to formulate its own laws or its own organization, without regard to organization and international regulations. Both the specificity and diversity of postal services causes a special approach {{in the context of their}} market and also in the services market context. Postal services are services of general interest, which emerged from communication need, from personal or official needs, not from economic needs. As an alternative to postal {{services have}} emerged and developed rapidly the courier services that come to complete and even compete to this category of services. We proposed in this paper to analyze and compare these two categories of services to determine the advantages and disadvantages but also the degree of which grow together or develop in a continuous competition...|$|R
