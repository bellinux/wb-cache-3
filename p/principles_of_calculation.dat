40|$|Abstract Background Brown algae are plant multi-cellular organisms occupying most of {{the world}} coasts and are {{essential}} actors in the constitution of ecological niches at the shoreline. Ectocarpus siliculosus is an emerging model for brown algal research. Its genome has been sequenced, and several tools are being developed to perform analyses at different levels of cell organization, including transcriptomic expression analyses. Several topics, including physiological responses to osmotic stress and to exposure to contaminants and solvents are being studied in order to better understand the adaptive capacity of brown algae to pollution and environmental changes. A series of genes {{that can be used to}} normalise expression analyses is required for these studies. Results We monitored the expression of 13 genes under 21 different culture conditions. These included genes encoding proteins and factors involved in protein translation (ribosomal protein 26 S, EF 1 alpha, IF 2 A, IF 4 E) and protein degradation (ubiquitin, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme) or folding (cyclophilin), and proteins involved in both the structure of the cytoskeleton (tubulin alpha, actin, actin-related proteins) and its trafficking function (dynein), as well as a protein implicated in carbon metabolism (glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase). The stability of their expression level was assessed using the Ct range, and by applying both the geNorm and the Normfinder <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation.</b> Conclusion Comparisons of the data obtained with the three methods of calculation indicated that EF 1 alpha (EF 1 a) was the best reference gene for normalisation. The normalisation factor should be calculated with at least two genes, alpha tubulin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme or actin-related proteins being good partners of EF 1 a. Our results exclude actin as a good normalisation gene, and, in this, are in agreement with previous studies in other organisms. </p...|$|E

At {{the same time}} the implementation of methodology for assessing the level of atrophy of the alveolar part of the mandible with the ability to register specific numerical indicators for dynamic monitoring of destruction of bone tissue is still an open question. Objective. To create the way of testing the effectiveness of methods of dental identification using constant anthropometric indexes and methods of assessing the level of atrophy of the alveolar part of the mandible based on proportional anthropometric indices. Methods. The primary stage of the methods of identification and assessment of the level of atrophy of the alveolar part of the mandible is a digital analysis of digital orthopantomograms of 138 patients who had baseline and repeated X-ray images with a time interval of one to five years. In the work author’s algorithm of calculation was used. Reduction of the level of errors is ensured using the root-mean-square and arithmetic average interim results, which approach the final results to their actual value. Results. Levels of absolute and relative errors decreased with approaching to the calculation of final complex constant and proportional anthropometric indices. This is due to the use in a system the calculation of the root-mean-square values and the proposed principle of the mathematical matrix relations that involves finding of the arithmetic average of the columns and lines of the matrix.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common types of {{structures}} made of glulam beams is curved frames. A lot of industrial plants and public buildings are built using curved frames. The using of such frames in buildings with an aggressive environment showed their great reliability. However, with all the advantages of curved frames with glulam beams their using is constrained by imperfect methods of stress analysis based on the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> of structures with solid wood. The need for careful study and improvement of methods of calculation of Curved frames determines the relevance of researched topic. Aim: The aim of this research is to study the numerous researches of pilot frame for further improving of methods of stress analysis in the cornice nodes of curved frames. Materials and Methods: In order to achieve this goal the theoretical displacements and component stress state were determined using experimental elastic characteristics of the frames material. Glulam beams compared to a solid closer to trans tropic design scheme of symmetry, according to which the mechanical and elastic properties of building materials in planes perpendicular direction along the wood fibers are equivalent. For reliable determination of the parameters of the stress-strain state in the elements of any shape, getting of quality pictures of stress distribution {{along the length of the}} frame and establishing patterns of changes in stress in the composition of the assembly, the software system LIRA-CAD has been used, where a model of orthogonal anisotropy (orthotropy) in the plate finite elements has been realized. Results: Analyzing the results, we can conclude that the overall coincidence between theoretical and experimental data is satisfactory. Arguably, the strained state of frames obtained by theoretical calculation with taking into account the real physical and mechanical characteristics of the experimental designs material is significant. Given that in the compressed-bending elements the additional bending moment on the normal force is a function of movement, we can assume that this calculation method of finite elements in LIRA-CAD allows satisfactorily determine the tension in view of the deformed circuit frames and anisotropy of physical and mechanical properties of glulam beams...|$|E
