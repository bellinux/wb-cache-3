At 5 °C (body temperature of a hibernating mammal) uptake is appreciable in kidney cortex of both species. In the kidney cortex of hamsters, for example, the tissue K of slices incubated at 5 °C reaches the same steady-state concentration after 2 hours that is observed in slices at 38 °C after 20 minutes.

40|$|An {{intestinal}} perfusion {{technique was}} used to measure the effects of supplementary feeding (experiment 1) and temporary weaning (experiment 2) during the sucking period on the net absorption of fluid, sodium, chloride and potassium from the small intestine of pigs after weaning. The technique was also applied to control pigs which did not receive supplementary feed and were not temporarily weaned during the sucking period. Paired intestinal segments were prepared at five sites along the small intestine in each of 80 pigs in experiment 1 and 36 pigs in experiment 2. The cranial segment of each pair was infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). In both experiments, four days after weaning, the net absorption of fluid, sodium and chloride in the uninfected segments was in general significantly less in all the pigs than at weaning or seven, 11 and 14 days after weaning and it was significantly greater in the pigs given supplementary feed than in the other <b>pigs.</b> <b>Net</b> absorption values in the infected segments of the control pigs were less four days after weaning than on the day of weaning.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to estimate economic effects of 19 generations of selection for increased litter size in the NE Index line. Using realized biological data, 1, 250 -sow enterprises based on Index line and Control line females were simulated. Each system was closed to introduction of females and included pureline females mated to produce replacement pureline and F 1 gilts, and F 1 females mated to terminal cross boars to produce market progeny. Costs of production and income statements were produced using the reproductive, growth and carcass data from the NE Index (I) and Control (C) lines reported in the two preceding papers. Gross revenues were estimated using the SiouxPreme Packing Co. grid payment matrix. The production system based on Index sows produced 24, 417 pigs per year with net income of $ 23. 76 per pig. The output for the system based on Control sows was 20, 166 <b>pigs</b> with <b>net</b> income of $ 16. 73 per pig.

The study was based on primary data ob-tained in a cross-section survey of 120 pig farmers, 60 each drawn purposively from among the gov-ernment-assisted (GAPF) and unassisted pig farmers (UAPF) in the state. The data were analysed by descriptive, budgetary and econometric (Stochastic Production Frontier) methods. The study revealed that, most of the pig farmers (67. 7 % of GAPF and 95. 0 % of UAPF) are men. Majority of the pig farm-ers (65. 0 % of GAPF and 55. 0 % of UAPF) are within 30 - 50 years age bracket; with as much as 83. 3 % of GAPF and 60. 0 % of UAPF, having {{no more than six}} years of experience in pig farming. However, most (95. 0 % of GAPF and 75. 0 % of UAPF) of the pig farmers had some tertiary education.

The main net energy systems used are the French INRA, the Dutch CVB and the Danish PPE. These energy systems are not widely accepted in the U. S. due to potential over estimation of the energy content of fat and fiber components of feedstuffs and differences in feeding practices, pig environment, and genetics. Therefore, our objective was to determine the operational net energy for maintenance requirement and the net energy content of soybean meal and glycerol in conditions that as closely as possible mimicked U. S. production systems. The average operational net energy for maintenance for three separate locations and two stages of growth was determined to be 156 kcal/kg BW[superscript- 0. 60]. The net energy content of commercial and low-oligosaccharide soybean meal was determined to be 1, 634 and 1, 990 kcal/kg, respectively, for growing pigs and 2, 150 and 2, 554 kcal/kg, respectively, for finishing <b>pigs.</b> The <b>net</b> energy for glycerol was determined to be 2, 740 kcal/kg for growing pigs and 3, 461 kcal/kg for finishing pigs...|$|R
40|$|Metabolism of {{galactose}} is {{a specialized}} liver function. The {{purpose of this}} PET study was to use the galactose analog 2 -[18 F]fluoro- 2 -deoxygalactose (FDGal) to investigate hepatic uptake and metabolism of galactose in vivo. FDGal kinetics was studied in 10 anesthetized pigs at blood concentrations of nonradioactive galactose yielding approximately first-order kinetics (tracer only; n = 4), intermediate kinetics (0. 5 – 0. 6 mmol galactose/l blood; n = 2), and near-saturation kinetics (> 3 mmol galactose/l blood; n = 4). All animals underwent liver C 15 O PET (blood volume) and FDGal PET (galactose kinetics) with arterial and portal venous blood sampling. Flow rates in the hepatic artery and the portal vein were measured by ultrasound transit-time flowmeters. The hepatic uptake and net metabolic clearance of FDGal were quantified by nonlinear and linear regression analyses. The initial extraction fraction of FDGal from blood-to-hepatocyte was unity in all <b>pigs.</b> Hepatic <b>net</b> metabolic clearance of FDGal, KFDGal, was 332 – 481 ml blood·min− 1 ·l− 1 tissue in experiments with approximately first-order kinetics and 15. 2 – 21. 8 ml blood·min− 1 ·l− 1 tissue in experiments with near-saturation kinetics. Maximal hepatic removal rates of galactose were on average 600 μmol·min− 1 ·l− 1 tissue (range 412 – 702), which was in agreement with other studies. There {{was no significant difference}} between KFDGal calculated with use of the dual tracer input (KdualFDGal) or the single arterial input (KarterialFDGal). In conclusion, hepatic galactose kinetics can be quantified with the galactose analog FDGal. At near-saturated kinetics, the maximal hepatic removal rate of galactose can be calculated from the net metabolic clearance of FDGal and the blood concentration of galactose...|$|R
40|$|New-born pig {{proximal}} colon, incubated in vitro, transports methionine with a Km of 0 - 33 mM and a Vmax of 0 - 62 mumole cm- 2 h- 1. There {{is still}} a net transport of methionine on day 4, but the Km now increases to 10 mM and the Vmax falls to 0 - 15 mumole cm- 2 h- 1. There is no net transport of methionine across proximal colons taken from 10 -day-old pigs. 2. The mean intramucosal concentration of methionine, following incubation in medium containing 1 mM methionine, is 7 - 18 +/- 0 - 8 mM for the new-born, 0 - 55 +/- 0 - 05 mM for the 4 -day-old and 0 - 31 +/- 0 - 06 mM for the 10 -day-old pig. 3. Both methionine and glucose cause an immediate increase in the short-circuit current of new-born and 1 -day-old pig colons. The kinetics for this interaction with methionine gives a Km for methionine of 0 - 24 mM and a maximum effect of 27 muA cm- 2. This effect is not seen in 4 - or 10 -day-old <b>pigs.</b> 4. <b>Net</b> Na+ transport across the new-born pig proximal colon, measured {{in the absence of}} methionine, is about three times that calculated from the measured short-circuit current. Methionine increases the mucosal to serosal flux of Na+ by an amount roughly equal to that predicted from the increase in short-circuit current. The ability of glucose and methionine to affect short-circuit current is lost by day 4. 5. Short-circuit current, measured in the absence of methionine or glucose, increases between day 1 and 2 of post-natal life. This increased electrogenicity is maintained for up to at least 10 days after birth. 6. The pig proximal colon has many of the properties of a small intestine at birth. It actively transports methionine and the presence of methionine stimulates the absorption of Na+. These effects could be physiologically important in the pig, where the normal absorptive function of the intestine is temporarily inhibited at birth by the intestinal transmission of immune globulins...|$|R

In order to examine these relationships in the <b>pig,</b> patterns of <b>net</b> depletion and appearance of amino acids by in vitro produced porcine preimplantation embryos were examined. Cumulus oocyte complexes derived from slaughterhouse pre-pubertal pig ovaries were matured for 40 h in defined TCM- 199 medium (containing PVA) before being fertilised (Day 0) with frozen-thawed semen in Tris–based medium. After 6 h, presumptive zygotes were denuded and cultured in groups of 20, in NCSU- 23 medium modified to contain 0. 1 mM glutamine plus a mixture of 19 amino acids (aa) at low concentrations (0. 02 – 0. 11 mM) (NCSU- 23 aa). Groups of 2 – 20 embryos were removed (dependent on stage) on Day 0 (1 cell), Day 1 (two- and four-cells), Day 4 (compact morulae) and Day 6 (blastocysts) and placed in 4 ml NCSU- 23 aa for 24 h.

Glycine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, asparagine, lysine, glutamate and aspar-tate consistently appeared, whereas threonine, glutamine and arginine were consistently depleted.

40|$|Agricultural soils in {{semiarid}} Mediterranean {{areas are}} characterized by low organic matter contents and low fertility levels. Application of crop residues and/or manures as amendments is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to overcome this problem. However, these management practices may induce important changes in the nitrogen oxide emissions from these agroecosystems, with additional impacts on carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crop under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of combining maize (Zea mays L.) residues and N fertilizer inputs (organic and/or mineral) on these emissions. Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification capacity, N 2 O, NO and CO 2 fluxes were measured during the growing season. The incorporation of maize stover increased N 2 O emissions during the experimental period by c. 105 %. Conversely, NO emissions were significantly reduced in the plots amended with crop residues. The partial substitution of urea by <b>pig</b> slurry reduced <b>net</b> N 2 O emissions by 46 and 39 %, with and without the incorporation of crop residues respectively. Net emissions of NO were reduced 38 and 17 % for the same treatments. Molar DOC:NO (3) (-) ratio {{was found to be}} a robust predictor of N 2 O and NO fluxes. The main effect of the interaction between crop residue and N fertilizer application occurred in the medium term (4 - 6 month after application), enhancing N 2 O emissions and decreasing NO emissions as consequence of residue incorporation. The substitution of urea by pig slurry can be considered a good management strategy since N 2 O and NO emissions were reduced by the use of the organic residue...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were i) to compare lifetime sow performance {{and number of}} piglets born alive (NBA) across parities, according to 3 NBA classifications in first and second parity and ii) {{to determine the number}} of parities a sow should be retained in a breeding to wean system to maximize returns over total costs per weaned <b>pig</b> and <b>net</b> return on investment. Sensitivity of returns over total costs per weaned pig to feed price and number born alive (NBA) was also analyzed. For both objectives the production data used were collected between the years 2001 to 2014 at 17 farms owned by the same Mid-West U. S. company. A total of 502, 491 records accounting for the lifetime performance of 105, 719 sows were used in this analysis. Data included both purebred and crossbred sow information. For the first objective sows were classified into 3 NBA categories (i. e., low, medium, and high) according to the 25 th percentiles of NBA in parity 1 and parity 2. Mixed model analyses were applied to the data. Sows in low first and second parity NBA classification had an average of 1 to 1. 8 NBA less per parity in parities 3 through 7 when compared with sows in the medium and high NBA classification, respectively (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Conversely, sows classified as high NBA in parity 1 and parity 2 had greater NBA in all subsequent parities as well as total lifetime NBA when compared with sows classified as low or medium NBA (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The results indicated that with the inclusion of second parity classification, sows classified as low NBA in parity 1 had a greater level of variation between later parity estimates than sows that were classified as high NBA in parity 1 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Thus, the effect that parity 2 classification had on estimated later parity performance was found to be dependent on parity 1 classification (P-interaction 3 ̆c 0. 05). The interaction between classes was seen when predicting total lifetime performance on a number born alive basis as well. As parity 1 classification increased, the difference between estimates by high and low NBA parity 2 classification became smaller. It was shown that parity 1 and 2 classification only had a small effect on the parity of removal. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the use of first and second parity performance (based on number born alive) can be used effectively to predict subsequent parity and lifetime performance which can be used to aid in selection and culling decision early in the sows’ life. For the second objective, projected budgets were used to compare returns for various parity distributions. A “steady-state” model was used to demonstrate returns based on an existing farm versus a system that is just entering production. The returns over total cost per weaned pig were calculated using both variable and fixed costs associated with a 5, 000 head sow farm based on the proportion of sows by parity in the distribution. Estimates for NBA and pre-wean mortality were shown to be statistically different between parities (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The parity distribution where sows are culled after parity 6 produced weaned pigs at lowest costs with the highest returns. Keeping sows until later parities, such as parity 7 through 9, had greater returns over total costs versus culling sows after parities 1 through 4. Net return on investment was maximized in the parity distribution that culled after parity 6, and parity distributions culling after parities 5 through 8 all showed approximately a 15...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the ISU Rhodes Research and Demonstration farm. The two types of pork grow-finish production facilities compared {{in this study are}} hoop and total confinement. This is the eighth group of finishing pigs that has been evaluated in these facilities and the forth summer group. This {{study was conducted}} from April 2001 to September 2001. Past reports examined {{the differences between the two}} facility types to evaluate facility performance under summer and winter seasons. This report similarly examines the difference between the two facility types. An additional focus of this group is pig stocking density rates. Stocking rates of 9, 10. 5, and 12 square feet per pig are evaluated for the hoop system. <b>Net</b> revenue per <b>pig</b> for the hoop systems were $ 19. 79 (12 square feet), $ 22. 41 (10. 5 square feet), and $ 17. 74 (9 square feet), respectively. The <b>net</b> revenue per <b>pig</b> for the confinement system was $ 16. 25 per pig. The hoop facilities showed a dramatic drop in production efficiency when the facilities were stocked at a rate of 9 square feet per pig. The feed conversion increased nearly a tenth of a pound of feed per pound of gain and the average daily gain decreased by. 6 pounds per day compared with the other stocking densities. However, feed efficiency and average daily gain only improved slightly when the space allowed per pig was 12 square feet compared with 10. 5 square feet. Moreover, the reduction in space per pig from 12 to 10. 5 square feet allowed a more efficient use of both facilities and bedding per pig. This allowed the group stocked at 10. 5 square feet per <b>pig</b> to increase <b>net</b> revenue by $ 2. 62 per pig over the hoop stocked at 12 square feet per pig. This difference is impacted somewhat by a difference in the weight of the pigs that were marketed (Table 1). They were on feed for a slightly longer time period. Despite this difference in sale weight the study suggests that a decrease in space utilized from 12 to 10. 5 square feet per pig would increase the profit level for hoop facilities during the summer. Net revenue for the hogs from the hoop facility with 12 square feet of space was $ 3. 54 per pig over the confinement system. This difference was greater than the average of the three previous summer groups, which favored the hoops by $ 1. 43 and saw a difference in hoop net revenue vs. confinement net revenue that ranged from $. 20 to $ 3. 05 per pig. The range of differences can be explained by a number of reasons. Some can be attributed to on farm research variables such as weather and disease exposure. Another key issue is the distribution of marketing. This changes the performance of the remaining hogs as well as the average sale weigh...|$|R
40|$|Tsetse-transmitted African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT) {{constitutes}} a main constraint to livestock industries in sub-Saharan Africa, causing reduced productivity and fertility {{as well as}} death without treatment. Control strategies comprise trypanocidal drug use and reduction of vector populations (Glossina spp) by various methods. Vector control methods are successful but unsustainable resulting in rapid reversal of achievements after external support termination. This study evaluates an innovative approach to control Glossina palpalis palpalis using deltamethrin-treated mosquito fences protecting pig pens, finally reducing trypanosome prevalence in Ghana. Two villages comparable in pig numbers, husbandry practices, vegetation, surface water and climate (tropical rain forest zone) were selected. While one village (Zorh) served as unprotected control, the pig pens of the other village (Kwesi Konfo) were protected with 100 cm high insecticide-treated mosquito fences (polyester, 150 denier, 100 - 120 mg/m 2 deltamethrin) which were attached to the timber poles and planks surrounding each pig pen in May 2007. Apparent tsetse densities were monitored for six months by using geo-referenced biconical traps. The reduction of fly numbers in Kwesi Konfo (<b>netted</b> <b>pig</b> pens) exceeded 90 % within two months. A further decline of the population during the following months led to reductions of more than 95 % until termination. This contrasted clearly with the tsetse numbers in the control village, which remained stable apart from their usual seasonal variations. Captured tsetse flies were identified and separated according to sex and age. Non teneral and parous female flies were dissected for ovarian age grading. Net samples were taken at monthly intervals and stored for further evaluation of their bio-cidal activity through bioassays. To monitor {{the persistence of the}} insecticide treated netting material it was tested in the laboratory before and throughout the installation using house flies (Musca domestica). The rates of paralysis five, ten and fifteen minutes after exposure decreased markedly in the six months trial corresponding with the time passing. The rates of paralysis 30 minutes, six hours and 24 hours after exposure remained at comparable levels until termination of the project. Blood samples were collected three times from about 50 % of the respective pig populations during the trial: at the onset, after three months, {{and at the end of}} experiment (six month after intervention). After the first sampling all pigs were treated with a trypanocidal drug (diminazene aceturate, Berenil®, Intervet) at a dose of 3. 5 mg/kg. Initially, thin blood smears revealed a trypanosome (Nannomonas) prevalence of 76 % and 72 %, respectively, in pigs from Kwesi Konfo and Zorh. The examination of the second blood samples showed a prevalence reduction to 16 % in Kwesi Konfo whereas the infection rate in pigs of the control village had increased to 84 %; this effect was well confirmed by the results of the third examination with 8 % trypanosome prevalence in protected pigs as opposed to 60 % in the control pigs. The study confirmed that insecticide treated netting material leads into a significant reduction of tsetse flies even in dense vegetation of tropical rain forest zone and therefore considerably improves livestock industries in sub-Saharan Africa. A successful local vector control method has proven its feasibility. High practicability, easy handling and low cost of material as well as a confirmed persistence of more than six months allows independent and individual use of insecticide treated nets by farmers themselves. Future improvement of quality characteristics, concerning persistence, heat and UV-resistance of the net material is recommended...|$|R
