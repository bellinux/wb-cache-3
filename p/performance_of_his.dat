5|$|Although Mullum Malarum {{opened to}} a tepid box office {{reception}} at its 15 August 1978 (Independence Day) release, positive reviews from critics and favourable {{word of mouth}} helped make it a success. Rajinikanth's performance as Kali received unanimous praise, and it is widely considered the best <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Film– Tamil and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize (for Rajinikanth).|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16 Harrison was {{appointed}} organist and choirmaster at Areley Kings Church, and at Hartlebury Church {{at the age of}} 21. When he was 17 he directed the Worcester Musical Society in a <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own Ballade for Strings. He gained two Firsts in music in Cambridge local examinations, and studied under Granville Bantock at the Birmingham and Midland Institute of Music where he specialised in conducting.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Shostakovich {{appeared}} {{on stage in}} Moscow {{at the end of}} a concert <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Fifth Symphony, congratulating Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for their performance (part of a concert tour of the Soviet Union). Later that year, Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic recorded the symphony in Boston for Columbia Records.|$|E

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts. One of these concerts {{included}} the first complete <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> First Symphony, subtitled Winter Daydreams, in its final version. Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony in its revised version. Before this trip, Tchaikovsky had spent considerable time corresponding with Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov and Lyadov, and during his visit, he spent {{much time in the}} company of these men.|$|E
5|$|Parrish demanded high {{standards}} of <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men and did not view race as an issue. Parrish felt that what mattered was professionalism and an individual's capacities, techniques, and judgement. Parrish held his black trainees to the same {{high standards}} of performance as whites; {{and those who did}} not meet those standards were failed out of the program.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had {{established}} a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers—although usually {{at the cost of}} high casualties to his army—during the Seven Days, the Northern Virginia Campaign (including the Second Battle of Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Only the Maryland Campaign, with its tactically inconclusive Battle of Antietam, had been less than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health, and (4) the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.|$|E

5|$|When Vargas Llosa was fourteen, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima. At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur {{journalist}} for local newspapers. He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, La Industria, and witnessed the theatrical <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first dramatic work, La huida del Inca.|$|E
5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, {{the regulars}} and militia {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search for}} Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at {{not being able to}} find the British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families. As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.|$|E
5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} {{that he was to}} answer to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} when he was prizefighting Perrins worked for Boulton and Watt, {{manufacturers}} of steam engines, based at their Soho Foundry, Birmingham, but also travelled {{around the country and}} at times acted as an informant on people who were thought to have breached his employer's patents. In the later years of his life he also ran a public house in Manchester and undertook engineering work on his own account. He was appointed to lead the Manchester fire brigade in 1799, and died a little over 12months later in the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> duties.|$|E
5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> final years.|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his.</b> He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5000|$|Pockrich {{eventually}} found success with <b>his</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> musical glasses and {{is credited with}} their invention in 1741; he named the instrument an [...] "angelic organ". His decrepit rooms were given over to development <b>of</b> <b>his</b> design and <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>His</b> early method <b>of</b> playing, using wooden sticks, is comparable to a similar instrument, the 'glassspiel' or 'verrillon', designed {{a few years earlier}} on known principles.|$|R

5|$|In 1931, he {{was chosen}} to play for England {{for the first time}} and rose to {{prominence}} during a tour to Australia in 1932–33. Afterwards, he played regularly for England and achieved the best <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career when he took 15wickets against Australia in a Test match at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1934. However, critics claimed he was ineffective on good batting pitches, and he was occasionally left out of the England team over the following years. Even so, he had one of the best records of any bowler against Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket. Verity continued to play for Yorkshire and England until 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War ended his career.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt {{that the quality of}} <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Tippett {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. The {{following}} few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where he was much attracted by the sounds of gamelan ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with funds available {{from the sale of}} some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.|$|E
