5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} <b>psoriasis</b> or plaque-like <b>psoriasis)</b> {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with <b>psoriasis.</b> Plaque <b>psoriasis</b> typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic <b>psoriasis)</b> involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque <b>psoriasis,</b> particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of <b>psoriasis</b> can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of <b>psoriasis</b> includes dermatological conditions similar in appearance such as discoid eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, pityriasis rosea (may {{be confused with}} guttate <b>psoriasis),</b> nail fungus (may be confused with nail <b>psoriasis)</b> or cutaneous T cell lymphoma (50% of individuals with this cancer are initially misdiagnosed with <b>psoriasis).</b> Dermatologic manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of secondary syphilis may also be confused with <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with <b>psoriasis.</b> They are called <b>psoriasis</b> susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in <b>psoriasis.</b> Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in <b>psoriasis.</b> Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in <b>psoriasis.</b> Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
5|$|Guttate <b>psoriasis</b> is {{characterized}} by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules). These numerous spots of <b>psoriasis</b> appear over {{large areas of the}} body, primarily the trunk, but also the limbs and scalp. Guttate <b>psoriasis</b> is often triggered by a streptococcal infection, typically streptococcal pharyngitis. The reverse is not true.|$|E
5|$|Napkin <b>psoriasis</b> is a subtype of <b>psoriasis</b> {{common in}} infants {{characterized}} by red papules with silver {{scale in the}} diaper area that may extend to the torso or limbs. Napkin <b>psoriasis</b> is often misdiagnosed as napkin dermatitis (diaper rash).|$|E
5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When <b>psoriasis</b> involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured tongue {{is the most common}} finding in those with oral <b>psoriasis</b> and has been reported to occur in 6.5–20% of people with <b>psoriasis</b> affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of <b>psoriasis.</b> However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> is {{classified}} as a papulosquamous disorder and is most commonly subdivided into different categories based on histological characteristics. Variants include plaque, pustular, guttate, and flexural <b>psoriasis.</b> Each form has a dedicated ICD-10 code. <b>Psoriasis</b> can also be classified into nonpustular and pustular types.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic-like <b>psoriasis</b> is {{a common}} form of <b>psoriasis</b> with {{clinical}} aspects of <b>psoriasis</b> and seborrheic dermatitis, {{and it may be}} difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of <b>psoriasis</b> typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|The rate of <b>psoriasis</b> in HIV-positive {{individuals}} {{is comparable to}} that of HIV-negative individuals, however, <b>psoriasis</b> tends to be more severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with <b>psoriasis</b> than in those without the infection. The immune response in those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in <b>psoriasis</b> vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of <b>psoriasis</b> in HIV-positive people. <b>Psoriasis</b> in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main types of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. Plaque <b>psoriasis,</b> {{also known as}} <b>psoriasis</b> vulgaris, makes up about 90 percent of cases. It {{typically}} presents as red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are {{the back of the}} forearms, shins, navel area, and scalp. Guttate <b>psoriasis</b> has drop-shaped lesions. Pustular <b>psoriasis</b> presents as small non-infectious pus-filled blisters. Inverse <b>psoriasis</b> forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic <b>psoriasis</b> occurs when the rash becomes very widespread, and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people with <b>psoriasis</b> at some point in time. This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of <b>psoriasis</b> is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for <b>psoriasis</b> are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with <b>psoriasis</b> report {{a family history of}} the disease, and {{researchers}} have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing <b>psoriasis</b> if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Drug-induced <b>psoriasis</b> {{may occur}} with beta blockers, lithium, {{antimalarial}} medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate <b>psoriasis</b> {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|IC747 and IC776, two LFA-1 antagonists, {{designed}} to treat <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|ICM3, an {{antibody}} blocking ICAM-3, {{designed to}} treat <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inverse <b>psoriasis</b> (also {{known as}} {{flexural}} <b>psoriasis)</b> appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail <b>psoriasis</b> occurs in 40–45% of people with <b>psoriasis</b> affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail <b>psoriasis),</b> whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. <b>Psoriasis</b> varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury {{to the skin}} can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which {{is known as the}} Koebner phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to <b>psoriasis.</b> Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. <b>Psoriasis</b> is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} <b>psoriasis</b> {{is not fully}} understood, {{but a number of}} {{theories}} exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of <b>psoriasis</b> as an autoimmune disease has sparked considerable debate. Researchers have proposed differing descriptions of <b>psoriasis</b> and psoriatic arthritis; some authors have classified them as autoimmune diseases {{while others have}} classified them as distinct from autoimmune diseases and referred to them as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.|$|E
5|$|The major {{determinant}} is PSORS1, {{which probably}} accounts for 35%–50% of <b>psoriasis</b> heritability. It controls genes {{that affect the}} immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with <b>psoriasis.</b> PSORS1 is located on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the PSORS1 locus have a strong association with <b>psoriasis</b> vulgaris: HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6, which encodes a MHC class I protein; CCHCR1, variant WWC, which encodes a coiled protein that is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and CDSN, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, a protein which is expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis and upregulated in <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of <b>psoriasis.</b> Mild <b>psoriasis</b> {{has been defined as}} a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a <b>Psoriasis</b> Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe <b>psoriasis</b> was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{types of}} <b>psoriasis</b> {{comprise}} approximately 10% of cases. They include pustular, inverse, napkin, guttate, oral, and seborrheic-like forms.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{mutations}} {{of proteins}} {{involved in the}} skin's ability {{to function as a}} barrier have been identified as markers of susceptibility for the development of <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as occurring after strep throat, and may be worsened by skin or gut colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, Malassezia, and Candida albicans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psoriasis</b> is a common, chronic, and {{recurrent}} {{inflammatory disease}} of the skin characterized by circumscribed, erythematous, dry, scaling plaques.|$|E
5|$|Pustular <b>psoriasis</b> {{appears as}} raised bumps filled with noninfectious pus (pustules). The skin under and {{surrounding}} the pustules is red and tender.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. <b>Psoriasis</b> is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{reported}} as worsening the disease include chronic infections, stress, {{and changes in}} season and climate. Others that might worsen the condition include hot water, scratching <b>psoriasis</b> skin lesions, skin dryness, excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and obesity.|$|E
5|$|Proteasome inhibitors {{have also}} shown promise in {{treating}} autoimmune diseases in animal models. For example, studies in mice bearing human skin grafts found {{a reduction in}} the size of lesions from <b>psoriasis</b> after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Inhibitors also show positive effects in rodent models of asthma.|$|E
5|$|Targeted {{monoclonal}} antibody therapy is employed to treat {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, <b>psoriasis,</b> and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{classification}} scheme considers genetic and demographic factors. Type 1 {{has a positive}} family history, starts {{before the age of}} 40, and is associated with the human leukocyte antigen, HLA-Cw6. Conversely, type 2 does not show a family history, presents after age 40, and is not associated with HLA-Cw6. Type 1 accounts for about 75% of persons with <b>psoriasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, <b>psoriasis,</b> hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of <b>psoriasis</b> lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by <b>psoriasis.</b> Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|In late April 1917, Whittle {{spent three}} days in a field {{hospital}} receiving treatment for <b>psoriasis,</b> before embarking for England on attachment to a training battalion. Joining the unit on 6 May, he once again underwent an eight-day furlough in a military hospital later in the month. During this time, Whittle attended an investiture ceremony in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace on 21 July, where he was decorated by King GeorgeV with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E
