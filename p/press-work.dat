6000|$|... 'You would perhaps feel {{interested}} in knowing that the Gospel of St. Luke has been printed in the Mota language, {{to a great extent}} by our scholars, and that George Sarawia is printing now the Acts, composing it, and doing <b>press-work</b> and all. Young Wogale (about thirteen) prints very fairly, and sent off 250 copies of a prayer, which the Bishop of Nelson wanted for distribution, of which everything was done by him entirely. They both began to learn about last November.|$|E
6000|$|My {{first real}} venture was the [...] "Long Islander," [...] {{in my own}} {{beautiful}} town of Huntington, in 1839. I was about twenty years old. I had been teaching country school {{for two or three}} years in various parts of Suffolk and Queens counties, but liked printing; had been at it while a lad, learn'd the trade of compositor, and was encouraged to start a paper in the region where I was born. I went to New York, bought a press and types, hired some little help, but did most of the work myself, including the <b>press-work.</b> Everything seem'd turning out well; (only my own restlessness prevented me gradually establishing a permanent property there.) I bought a good horse, and every week went all round the country serving my papers, devoting one day and night to it. I never had happier jaunts--going over to south side, to Babylon, down the south road, across to Smithtown and Comac, and back home. The experiences of those jaunts, the dear old-fashion'd farmers and their wives, the stops by the hay-fields, the hospitality, nice dinners, occasional evenings, the girls, the rides through the brush, come up in my memory to this day.|$|E
6000|$|No! I {{will not}} attempt an apology. Amid all my hurry of business, {{grinding}} {{the faces of}} the publican and the sinner on the merciless wheels of the Excise; making ballads, and then drinking, and singing them; and, over and above all, the correcting the <b>press-work</b> of two different publications; still, still I might have stolen five minutes to dedicate to one of the first of my friends and fellow-creatures. I might have done, as I do at present-snatched an hour near [...] "witching time of night," [...] and scrawled a page or two; I might have congratulated my friend on his marriage; or I might have thanked the Caledonian archers for the honour they have done me (though, to do myself justice, I intended to have done both in rhyme, else I had done both long ere now). Well, then, here is to your good health! for you must know, I have set a nipperkin of toddy by me, just by way of spell, to keep away the meikle horned deil, or any of his subaltern imps who may be on their nightly rounds.|$|E

50|$|Skiff {{traveled}} widely {{throughout the}} United States during his adult life, but is most associated with Connecticut and Portland, Oregon.

50|$|It started life as {{a private}} press in 1924, when Will was still a schoolboy. After the war, his {{interest}} in printing was such {{that he decided to}} try to establish the Press on a commercial footing, and did so in Cambridge in 1949. From that date until the formal closure of the Press at the end of 2008, Rampant Lions has been among the most highly regarded letterpress printing-offices in Britain. The skills of Will and Sebastian Carter in design and <b>press-work</b> have been recognized by publishers, who commissioned work from them, and by collectors, who have sought out their publications since the 1950s. Sebastian Carter also has an international reputation as a writer on type and typography.|$|E
50|$|In January 1662, he was {{appointed}} hydrographer to the King, despite his Puritan background. His shop at this time was on Ludgate Hill; afterwards, in 1683, it was 'on {{the west side of}} Fleet Ditch,' but always 'at the sign of Atlas.'. Moxon's Mechanick exercises was published in parts between 1677 and 1684; it was completed in two volumes, the first giving instructions on metalworking, woodworking, brick-laying and sundial-construction and the second (issued 1683-1684) providing a detailed sries of instructions for printers, including typefounding, composition, <b>press-work</b> etc., which have given printing historians much (probably idealised) information on the working practices of hand-press period printing-houses. An annotated edition, edited by Harry Carter and Herbert Davis, was published in 1958 and reprinted with corrections in 1962.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1886, Ames' family moved from Chicago, her brother, Elmer, having {{finished}} law school, and gone west, and then Ames came to live at Rest Cottage. The first of the Chicago daily newspapers to publish a WCTU department was the Chicago Inter Ocean. In her first interviews with the editors, Ames' work was often cut. At first {{only a few inches}} of space were given to her. This was gradually increased as the editors learned they could trust her, till, eventually, she usually occupied nearly a column, and editors ceased to cut her manuscript. Other and more important work soon came to her. When the national superintendent of <b>press-work,</b> Esther Housh, needed an assistant, Ames received the appointment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{executive}} {{committee of the}} Canadian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists voted to turn over to {{the management of the}} Lornedale Academy the printing, editing and mailing of The Canadian Union Messenger. Thus began a unique and practical educational venture. In September, the academy installed a printing plant on campus and the schools work of publishing the Messenger began under the supervision of principal Leland. For the December 8 issue of the Messenger, Eugene Leland reported that the type-setting, the <b>press-work,</b> and the editorial work was done almost entirely by students who, three weeks ago, had never been in a printing office before. All the students helped with preparing the Messenger for mailing. The principal then took the papers to the post office. Mr. Leland observed, ...|$|E
