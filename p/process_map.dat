40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two different}} yet successful approaches {{that have been}} taken for integrating <b>process</b> <b>mapping</b> technology and simulation technology. The discussion is based on two actual implementations in which two different <b>process</b> <b>mapping</b> tools were separately integrated with ProModel simulation software. The <b>process</b> <b>mapping</b> tools used in the integration were Design/IDEF from Meta Software Corporation and ABC FlowCharter from Micrografx, Incorporated. Both of these tools have been widely adopted in government and private industries for process reengineering. Also, both tools are based on different paradigms which present unique challenges for use with simulation. Design/IDEF is based on the IDEF-o modeling paradigm which is highly structured with limited adaptability. ABC FlowCharter is an unstructured process diagramming tool which is adaptable for doing all types of diagramming. In effect, they both plug into ProModel as a front-end interface. The implementation of the bridge is different in both instances, however. One approach uses {{a modified version of the}} <b>process</b> <b>mapping</b> tool while the other utilizes OLE automation without having to modify either the <b>process</b> <b>mapping</b> software or the simulation software. This presentation deals with the issues and challenges encountered in each integration effort. We will also discuss how these challenges were addressed and how a successful solution was implemented.

50|$|Process FMEA can be {{challenging}} for participants who have not completed many PFMEAS, often confusing FAILURE MODES with EFFECTS and CAUSES. To clarify, a Process FMEA shows how the process can go wrong. Using a detailed <b>Process</b> <b>Map</b> will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list {{the steps of the}} process being reviewed. The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step can go wrong. Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right handed part. Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.) FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and scrapped part, or hole drilled in wrong location. The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job. Why is it important to do a PFMEA with regard to the process? When a process is examined or if we ask what can go wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y. Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left handed part in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time. If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained. Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained. New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it can go wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.|$|E

5000|$|Given {{the genetic}} makeup of an organism, the {{complete}} set of possible reactions constitutes its reactome. Reactome, located at http://www.reactome.org is a curated, peer-reviewed resource of human biological processes/pathway data. The basic unit of the Reactome database is a reaction; reactions are then grouped into causal chains to form pathways [...] The Reactome data model allows us to represent many diverse processes in the human system, including the pathways of intermediary metabolism, regulatory pathways, and signal transduction, and high-level processes, such as the cell cycle. Reactome provides a qualitative framework, on which quantitative data can be superimposed. Tools {{have been developed to}} facilitate custom data entry and annotation by expert biologists, and to allow visualization and exploration of the finished dataset as an interactive <b>process</b> <b>map.</b> Although the primary curational domain is pathways from Homo sapiens, electronic projections of human pathways onto other organisms are regularly created via putative orthologs, thus making Reactome relevant to model organism research communities. The database is publicly available under open source terms, which allows both its content and its software infrastructure to be freely used and redistributed. Studying whole transcriptional proﬁles and cataloging protein-protein interactions has yielded much valuable biological information, from the genome or proteome to the physiology of an organism, an organ, a tissue or even a single cell. The Reactome database containing a framework of possible reactions which, when combined with expression and enzyme kinetic data, provides the infrastructure for quantitative models, therefore, an integrated view of biological processes, which links such gene products and can be systematically mined by using bioinformatics applications. Reactome data available in a variety of standard formats, including BioPAX, SBML and PSI-MI, and also enable data exchange with other pathway databases, such as the Cycs, KEGG and amaze, and molecular interaction databases, such as BIND and HPRD. The next data release will cover apoptosis, including the death receptor signaling pathways, and the Bcl2 pathways, as well as pathways involved in hemostasis. Other topics currently under development include several signaling pathways, mitosis, visual phototransduction and hematopoeisis. In summary, Reactome provides high-quality curated summaries of fundamental biological processes in humans in a form of biologist-friendly visualization of pathways data, and is an open-source project.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The Scottish Patient Safety Programme – Pharmacy in Primary Care {{collaborative}} is {{a quality}} improvement initiative adopting the Institute of Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series collaborative approach. The programme developed and piloted High Risk Medicine (HRM) Care Bundles (CB), focused on warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), within 27 community pharmacies over 4 NHS Regions. Each CB involves clinical assessment and patient education, although the CB content varies between regions. To support national implementation, {{this study aims}} {{to understand how the}} pilot pharmacies integrated the HRM CBs into routine practice to inform the development of a generic HRM CB <b>process</b> <b>map.</b> Methods: Regional process maps were developed in 4 pharmacies through simulation of the CB process, staff interviews and documentation of resources. Commonalities were collated to develop a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> for each HRM, which were used to explore variation at a national event. A single, generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> was developed which underwent validation by case study testing. Results: The findings allowed development of a generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> applicable to warfarin and NSAID CB implementation. Five steps were identified as required for successful CB delivery: patient identification; clinical assessment; pharmacy CB prompt; CB delivery; and documentation. The generic HRM CB <b>process</b> <b>map</b> encompasses the staff and patients' journey and the CB's integration into routine community pharmacy practice. Pharmacist involvement was required only for clinical assessment, indicating suitability for whole-team involvement. Conclusions: Understanding CB integration into routine practice has positive implications for successful implementation. The generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> can be used to develop targeted resources, and/or be disseminated to facilitate CB delivery and foster whole team involvement.

40|$|Background The Scottish Patient Safety Programme – Pharmacy in Primary Care {{collaborative}} {{has developed}} High Risk Medicine (HRM) Care Bundles (CB). These CBs, which are interventions that improve care processes and outcomes, focus on clinical assessment and patient education. Using quality improvement methods, {{these have been}} implemented in 28 community pharmacies in four health service regions – two focus on Warfarin and two on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. The intent is for national roll out of a HRM CB, where a standardised process may act as a platform to accelerate uptake of pharmacoepidemiology findings into routine practice. Objective To develop a generic HRM CB <b>process</b> <b>map</b> to facilitate implementation. Methods Regional process maps were developed through data collection in four pharmacies, involving simulation of the CB process, staff interviews and documentation of resources. Following validation by the onsite pharmacist, commonalities among the process maps were collated to create a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> for each HRM. To develop a generic HRM <b>process</b> <b>map,</b> these were validated by 93 % (n= 26) of participating pharmacies. Consent was gained throughout. Ethical approval was not sought as this was service evaluation. Results Although some regional variation existed, the validation identified six core stages required for successful CB delivery: patient identification, clinical assessment, patients’ eligibility flagged, CB delivery, enrolling non-attending patients and documentation. The commonalities were sufficient to develop a generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> encompassing staff and patients' journey, its integration into usual practice and resources utilised. Conclusion To maximise implementation success, the <b>process</b> <b>map</b> allows for targeted development of resources to facilitate each core stage. The feasibility of developing a generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> suggests adaptability of the CB to varying clinical contexts, strengthening the CBs potential to facilitate national implementation of health informatics research. Safety concerns highlighted by pharmacoepidemiology studies could be addressed by adapting the CBs' content, allowing seamless translation of evidence into practice...|$|E
