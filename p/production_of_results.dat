5000|$|The global {{distance}} test (GDT), {{also written}} as GDT TS to represent [...] "total score", {{is a measure}} of similarity between two protein structures with identical amino acid sequences but different tertiary structures. It is most commonly used to compare the results of protein structure prediction to the experimentally determined structure as measured by X-ray crystallography or protein NMR. The metric is intended as a more accurate measurement than the more common RMSD metric, which is sensitive to outlier regions created by poor modeling of individual loop regions in a structure that is otherwise reasonably accurate. GDT_TS measurements are used as major assessment criteria in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> from the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP), a large-scale experiment in the structure prediction community dedicated to assessing current modeling techniques and identifying their primary deficiencies.

40|$|In {{a mobile}} ad hoc network (MANET), the nodes {{represent}} mobile computers in which database systems may reside. Such mobile computers (nodes) {{are free to}} move arbitrarily. In such an environment, {{we may have a}} collection of autonomous, distributed, heterogeneous and mobile databases (denoted Mobile Database Community or MDBC). Thus, each database user (in a mobile host) can access databases belonging to an MDBC through the MANET. Traditional query processing techniques fail to support the access to databases in an MDBC, since data delivery rate in such an environment becomes unpredictable and mobile hosts may suffer from limited available main memory to process some query operators (e. g., join). To react to those events, this paper presents an adaptive join operator, called AJAX, for processing join operations on mobile databases in an MDBC. AJAX ensures: (i) incremental <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> as soon as the data become available; (ii) progress of the query processing even when the delivery of data is blocked, and; (iii) reaction to situations of memory limitation on the execution of operator.
