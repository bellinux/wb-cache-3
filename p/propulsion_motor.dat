25|$|Orizaba and {{her sisters}} had turbo-electric transmission. Each ship had two oil-fired high {{pressure}} boilers that fed a single AEG turbo generator. This produced current for an AEG electric <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor</b> that drove a single propeller shaft. This was a sophisticated propulsion system that required skilled operation. Both Antilla and Arauca suffered technical failures on their maiden voyages to the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|While during normal icebreaking {{operations}} each {{main generator}} fed its dedicated double-armature electric motor, the diesel generator supplying the forward <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor</b> {{could also be}} switched to supply electricity to either of the stern motors. In addition, the current {{from any of the}} main generators could be split between the port and starboard propulsion motors with the control of both motors remaining independent from each other. While the stern propulsion motors were built for double torque to overcome the additional loads from propeller-ice interaction, the electric motor driving the forward-facing propeller was dimensioned for a three-fold torque to keep the propeller turning in difficult ice conditions. The nominal speeds of the propulsion motors were 140 rpm in the stern and 160 rpm in the bow.|$|E

25|$|The {{electric}} power {{produced by the}} main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor,</b> located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{advanced}} icebreaker in the world, Voima still looked aesthetically pleasing with her low, gently rounded hull and superstructure. Many of her features, such as the open bridge with covered bridge wings, could {{be traced back to}} the pre-war steam-powered icebreakers. She had two continuous decks and a long forecastle that contained most of the cabins and social areas for the crew of 58. Although Voima was built with two small cargo holds for storage purposes, most of the space under the main deck is occupied by the engine and <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor</b> rooms, making the icebreaker literally [...] "a ship loaded with power". She also has eight heeling tanks that can be used to free the icebreaker from compressive pack ice. Like the steam-powered icebreakers built before the war, she was also fitted with deck gun mounts. During the refit, the old superstructure was completely removed and replaced with an angular deckhouse slightly resembling those of Sisu and Urho. The crew, now accommodated in individual cabins high in the superstructure away from the noises generated by the icebreaking process, was reduced to 44 due to advancing automation. Later the crew has been further reduced to 21.|$|E
2500|$|The rebuilt Powhatan, renamed Cuba, {{underwent}} {{trials and}} began operation in late 1920 as the world's first passenger ship {{with an electric}} drive.

50|$|Another {{component}} of the hydraulic system is the <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor.</b> The hydraulic <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor</b> is responsible for providing forward movement of the vehicles. The <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor</b> is of the axial piston pump type, and is capable of variable speed.

When traveling down a hill, the vehicles will drive {{the position of the}} swash plate within the <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor</b> to a negative angle, utilizing the <b>propulsion</b> <b>motor</b> as a pump.
