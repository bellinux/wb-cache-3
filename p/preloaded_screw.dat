30|$|Many factors {{affect the}} <b>screw</b> <b>preload,</b> {{such as the}} {{coefficient}} of friction between the surface, the elastic modulus of the screw, the geometry of the screw and of the connection, the fit of the components, insertion torque, the presence of lubricant, and occlusal overload [12].

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Loosening or {{fracture}} of the abutment screw are frequent complications in implant dentistry and are {{detrimental to the}} long-term success of the restorations. However, {{little is known about}} the factors influencing the stability of the screw-abutment complex. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of lubricant action during implant assembly on <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> and stresses in a dental implant-abutment complex. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A dental implant was modeled for finite element stress analysis. Different friction coefficients (μ= 0. 2 to 0. 5) were chosen for the interfaces between implant components to simulate lubricant action or dry conditions. The stress analyses were each divided into 2 load steps. First, the abutment screw was virtually tightened with a torque of 25 Ncm. This was achieved by applying an equivalent preload calculated according to the different friction coefficients chosen. Second, the construction was externally loaded with a force of 200 N inclined by 30 degrees relative to the implant axis. RESULTS: The <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> increased with the decreasing friction coefficient. In all components, stresses increased with decreasing friction coefficient. Plastic deformation was observed at the implant neck in an area that expanded with decreasing friction coefficient. No plastic deformation occurred in the abutment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> should be included in the finite element analysis of dental implants for a realistic evaluation of stresses in the implant-abutment complex. The friction coefficient significantly influenced the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> value and modified the stresses in the implant-abutment complex...|$|R

30|$|Although the {{reduction}} in RTVs was observed after mechanical cyclic loading, no screw loosening occurred after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading, which it assumed represents 3 [*]years of function in worse scenario setting according to ISO 14801 in vivo [23]. Our study presents similar results to those of Binon and McHugh, who reported that the 30 -N-cm insertion torque can maintain screw-joint stability in 3 [*]years of simulated function [34]. The reduction of <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading was 42.74 %. This {{is considered to be}} relatively low and might be because of the implant-abutment connection design [39]. The eccentric force has little effect on the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> under functional loading because the contacting part of the cone connection helps to provide frictional resistance and mechanical stability [7, 8]. Moreover, the Octatorx lobular anti-rotational design help produce little micromovement in the joint system under load [9]. The screw design also has an effect on the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> [39]. Paepoemsin et al. [31] found that the retaining tapered screws of their implants maintained higher preload efficiency than did the flat head screws of the implants before and after cyclic loading (P[*]<[*] 0.05). In our study, RTVs were constant from 50, 000 [*]cycles of loading to 1, 800, 000 [*]cycles. This result is not in agreement with those of Khraisat et al. [40], who concluded that 1, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading significantly affected the RTVs of CeraOne abutment external hex implants compared with 500, 000 [*]cycles of loading. This might be because different types of implant-abutment connections were used. In external connections, implant-abutment stability is obtained primarily by the tension of the screws [4]. Therefore, the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> in external connections is affected by the cyclic loading more than in internal connections.|$|R

30|$|In most studies, {{the removal}} torque values (RTVs) {{decreased}} after cyclic loading [27, 28], {{but in some}} studies, higher RTVs were reported [29, 30].

Few studies have truly focused on the effect of functional loading duration on preload maintenance of the screw. How the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> may change under different functional loading times is still unknown.

30|$|Bickford has {{explained}} how the screw is loosened in two stages [19].

40|$|MastersObjective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the effect of different tightening sequences of prosthetic <b>screws</b> on <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> in full arch implant supported superstructure. In addition, to compare the effect of a protocol of gradual tightening force of prosthetic screws to an instantaneous one, on the values of <b>screw</b> <b>preload.</b> Material and Methods: A stainless steel master metal model was machined to represent mandibular arch form with four implant fixtures 4. 1 × 14 mm (ITI system, Straumann) distributed quadrilaterally two on each side in posterior and anterior segments. A single metal superstructure was constructed in semiprecous gold alloy. One linear strain gauge was attached on the smooth neck surface of each ITI implant and wired into a quarter-bridge configuration. The signals from the bridges were fed into a 10 -channel strain gauge monitoring system and calibrated in Newton. The prosthetic screws of the superstructure were tightened according to six different tightening sequences using a digital torque gauge. Each tightening sequence included two different tightening protocols: gradual tightening (0 - 5 - 10 - 15 Ncm), and Instantaneous tightening (0 - 15 Ncm), with a total of 60 experiments (6 sequences × 2 protocols × 5 replications). A new prosthetic screw was used for each sequence and protocol while the same screw was used in the replication experiments. A total of 48 new screws were utilized. The experiment runs were randomized between sequences and protocols. The preload values for the four implants was recorded simultaneously in each experiment. Results: results indicated a statistically significant difference between tightening sequences at each implant (P< 0. 05). The protocol effect was significant only at implant 2 and 3. A significant interaction between sequence and protocol effects was found at all implants (P< 0. 05). In the gradual tightening protocol, higher sum preload was found in tightening sequences B (311. 5 N± 84. 6), C (245. 9 N± 54. 1), and D (309. 8 N± 95. 5). In the instantaneous tightening protocol, higher sum preload was found in tightening sequences A (285. 5 N± 94), E (763. 4 N± 141. 4), and F (349. 7 N± 68. 7). Tightening sequence E resulted in a statistically significantly higher sum preload than all other sequences only in the instantaneous protocol (763. 4 N± 141. 4) but not in the gradual protocol which showed lower sum preload values compared to other sequences (P< 0. 05). Results showed on average the sum preload increased upon repeated use of the same prosthetic screw. Conclusion: From the results of the study, it is concluded that: 1. There were significant differences in the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> between different tightening sequences, and protocols. 2. Gradual tightening resulted in higher preload in sequences B, C, and D. 3. Instantaneous tightening resulted in higher preload in sequences A, E, and F. 4. Minor fit inaccuracy of superstructure resulted in large variations in the registered preload between implants as the superstructure was tightened which was more distinct in the instantaneous protocol. 5. The highest sum <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> was achieved when anterior implants of the superstructure were first tightened instantaneously followed by posterior implants. 6. A trend of increased <b>preload</b> with repeated <b>screw</b> use was observed...|$|R

Compared to traditional optical and electron microscopy techniques, which provide two-dimensional images, this innovative investigation technology enables a sample tri-dimensional analysis without cutting, coating or exposing the object to any particular chemical treatment. X-ray micro-tomography matches ideal 3 D microscopy features: the possibility of investigating an object in natural conditions and without any preparation or alteration; non-invasive, non-destructive, and sufficiently magnified 3 D reconstruction; reliable measurement of numeric data of the internal structure (morphology, structure and ultra-structure).

30|$|From the study, the RTVs of {{the control}} group, which was left {{unloaded}} for 10 [*]min after second tightening decreased 7.78 % from the tightening torque. Previous studies have shown a 2 to 10 % loss of <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> [21]. These results {{can be explained by}} the settling effect as follows [16]. Firstly, the tightening torque is used to overcome the friction of the contacting metal surface connection [32]. Secondly, wear of the contacting implant-abutment surface can cause axial displacement of the abutment into the implant bore and the length of the elongated screw is shortened microscopically, leading to the loss of <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> [12, 33]. After mechanical cyclic loading, all experimental groups from 50, 000 to 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles showed significant decreases in mean RTVs compared with the initial RTVs (P[*]<[*] 0.05). These results are similar to those of several studies. Mohammed et al. [17] reported that the post-loading RTVs of internal hex implants were significantly lower than the initial RTVs after 16, 000 [*]cycles and Cibirka et al. [26] found decreasing RTVs in the internal hexagon of Nobel Biocare implants after 5 [*]million cycles of fatigue testing. The decrease in RTVs after cyclic loading {{can be explained by the}} micromovement of the joint connection or progressive settling effect from functional loading [33]. It is assumed that mechanical cyclic loading will serve as a proxy for oral functional loading, which can cause micromovement and slipping between the abutment screw thread and the implant, reducing the tensional force and resulting in decreased <b>preload</b> of the <b>screw</b> [34, 35]. Additionally, in functionally loaded implants, the progressive settling effect and the wedge effect cause increased axial displacement of the abutment into the implant connection [36]. Seol et al. [37], who analyzed the axial displacement of an internal implant-abutment connection after cyclic loading, found that the two-piece abutment of an internal octagon connection showed continuous axial displacement, but the rate of axial displacement was slow after 100, 000 [*]cycles. In our study, the decrease in RTVs was also constant after 50, 000 [*]cycles. This might imply that the axial displacement has a great effect on the loss of <b>screw</b> <b>preload.</b> Additionally, Kim et al. [38] indicated that the RTVs of abutment screws are related to the settling value. They found that after cyclic loading, there were statistically significant differences in the settling value and also in RTVs in internal connections, whereas external connections showed no significant changes in settling values and resulted in no significant changes in RTVs. However, the relation between settling values and RTVs varies depending on many factors, such as the material, design, and characteristic of the abutment-implant interface [38].|$|R
40|$|AbstractBall screws are {{the most}} common {{elements}} in machine tools for transferring rotational into linear movements. Within an electromechanical machine tool axis, ball screws belong to the decisive components for achieving small positioning errors. Due to wear, the <b>preload</b> of ball <b>screws</b> decreases. This often leads to vibrations in the electromechanical power train and influences the machining results negatively. This results in the need of preload compensation systems, which ensure the required machine accuracy. In this article, an adaptronic approach with piezoelectric self-sensing transducers for an active compensation system of preload control in ball screws is presented and common results of the developed self-sensing actuator are discussed...|$|R

30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} conical connection interface also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the wedge effect, and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the wedge effect occurs when tightening torque or loading force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> [17]. The settling effect is the main cause of screw loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the loosening torque becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % fastening torque. After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the <b>screw</b> <b>preload.</b> On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the cone connection surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|R
40|$|Objective: Accurate {{delivery}} of torque to implant screws {{is critical to}} generate ideal <b>preload</b> in the <b>screw</b> joint and to offer protection against screw loosening.

Materials and Methods: Five unused MTLDs were selected from each of Strau-mann (ITI), Astra TECH and CWM systems. To measure the output of each MTLD, a digital torque gauge with a 3 -jaw chuck was used to hold the driver.

Then MTLDs were subjected to fatigue condi-tions at 500 and 1000 times and steam sterilization processes at 50 and 100 time...|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{etiology}} of screw loosening, several causes are to be considered [8]. Screw-nut systems generally become unstable when the load that {{is applied to the}} system exceeds that of the <b>preload</b> of the <b>screw</b> that causes a clamping force preventing separation of the joint [9]. Preload is proportional to the tightening torque at placement. Hence, tightening torque on the one hand has a significant effect on screw loosening [10]. Embedment relaxation or settling can be overcome by retorquing abutment screws after a certain period of time, increasing joint stability [9, 11]. On the other hand, the magnitude of forces applied to the system is of major influence. The transfer of high forces can be generated by bruxers, through non-occlusal loading or because of a non-passive fit of suprastructures [8, 12 - 15]. Other factors that are of influence of a systems’ resistance to screw loosening include lubrication, screw design, screw material, and surface characteristics [16 - 20]. Especially implant designs with an external hex configuration are prone to abutment screw loosening [21].|$|R
30|$|Tzenakis et al. [42] {{reported}} that retightening of the screw is strongly recommended, but the appropriate timing of retightening {{is still not}} clear. Cho et al. [39] recommended retightening abutment screws in the early stage of functional loading, at {{the first week in}} vivo, in internal type implants because they found no significant difference in RTVs between 20, 000 and 100, 000 [*]cycles of loading. In our study, the RTVs decreased in the early stage at 50, 000 [*]cycles of loading and then remained constant to 1, 800, 000 [*]cycles. The result can be used to estimate that the implant should also be retightened in the early stage of cyclic loading under a worst-case situation [26]. Seol et al. [37] stated that to minimize screw loosening, the screw should be retightening at 1 [*]month in vivo after constant axial displacement at 100, 000 [*]cycles of loading. Nevertheless, different implant-abutment connections, designs, and materials influence the <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> differently. Therefore, it may be summarized that re-tightening is a theoretical recommendation based on in vitro studies that have found it beneficial in terms of RTV reduction.|$|R

This study investigated changes in preload generation after repeated torque applications to gold and titanium screws. The test set-up consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment, and the test samples of gold and of titanium retaining screws. The implant bodies were anchored using a load cell, and the transmucosal abutments were attached using either gold or titanium retaining screws. A torque gauge was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm, and 40 Ncm to the retaining <b>screws.</b> The <b>preloads</b> generated in each screw type were compared at each torque setting, and after repeated tightening episodes. In addition, the effect of applying torque beyond the manufacturers’ recommendations was also examined. Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining <b>screws.</b> <b>Preload</b> values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of the gold screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Based on the findings of this study, gold retaining <b>screws</b> generate better <b>preload</b> than titanium.

40|$|The {{complicated}} {{failure mechanisms}} at {{the interface between}} the mandible bone and dental implant, as influenced by the implant design, are investigated in this study. Using the Finite Element Method (FEM), three implant thread designs, namely, Nobel Biocare, 3 i and Neoss, are evaluated for {{their role in the}} stress distribution within the mandible. The aim {{of this article is to}} help advance the use of an innovative engineering approach in dental practices, especially in the understanding of implant failures. The FEM is used to replicate the complex geometric and material properties of the bone and implant. In addition to the various implant thread design, the abutment <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> as a result of the applied torque is also considered as a variable. The characteristics of von Mises stresses in the cancellous bone are examined for all variables. The assumptions made in the modelling and simulation process include: - a two-dimensional representation of the bone and implant is used because this is considered to be equally accurate and more efficient in terms of computation time, as compared to a three-dimensional approach; - temperature sensitive elements are used to replicate the preload within the abutment screw. This study has demonstrated that the Neoss thread design yields more favourable stress profile within the cancellous bone than the Nobel Biocare and 3 i designs. Compared to the Neoss' more smoothed-out thread profile, both the Nobel Biocare and 3 i designs have more abrupt changes in geometry, which results in higher stress. This is particularly true for the Nobel Biocare design where a notch is present.

30|$|A single-tooth osseointegrated implant is {{composed}} of an implant body, an abutment, an abutment screw, and an artificial crown. The implant and abutment are typically connected by an abutment screw. The degree of mechanical integrity at the implant-abutment interface depends on <b>screw</b> <b>preload,</b> abutment connection design, the fitness of all components, and dynamic loading conditions. Fractures of the internal or external connection between implants and implant abutments or abutment screws are encountered in the clinical setting [1 – 3]. Fractures may occur {{as a result of}} excessive axial forces (bending moments), horizontal loading, or rotational torque during functional activities such as chewing or parafunctional activities such as grinding and clenching. Several studies [4, 5] have evaluated implant-abutment assemblies in dynamic cyclic fatigue testing according to ISO 14801 [6]. However, evaluation of the strength of the implant-abutment assembly has not been reported when subjected to torsion testing. Test methods and standard vales have not yet been established for such torsion testing of implant-abutment assemblies. Abutment connections are principally classified as either internal or external types and are available in a variety of designs, including hexagonal, octagonal, cone screw, cone hex, cylinder hex, spline, cam, cam tube, and pin/slot. Implants incorporate features for rotation-prevention at the implant-abutment interface. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of implant-abutment connections have been discussed in several studies [7 – 11]. Norton reported that internal implant-abutment interface connections have higher bending moment resistance than external connections [10]. Presently, although more than 200 kinds of implant systems are available on the market, most manufacturers do not provide specific data regarding system-specific implant-abutment connection design complications [12, 13]. In the oral cavity, implant restorations are exposed to vertical, horizontal, and rotational forces during chewing. The maximum torsional strength and proportional limited strength on crown and tooth restoration materials were measured, and the values were compared with a mechanical bending and pull test value [14].|$|R

When both reference pins are securely held in their respective screw guides in the proximal and distal clamp templates, insertion of the remaining screws is a mechanical process as the position of the rail against the femur would have been determined by first two reference screws. Place the remaining screws in the template seats so that the first, third and fifth positions are filled. It is important to note that the most proximal screw of the proximal clamp is likely to be at a level where the second cortex for the screw will be across the femoral neck; perforating the femoral neck with a screw may leave the patient at risk of a femoral neck fracture after fixator removal. My recommendation is that the drill (4.8  mm in the Orthofix system) is advanced across this level by 2 – 3  cm, and the screw is inserted in a unicortical fashion until it abuts against the femoral calcar. This creates a reasonable level of radial <b>preload</b> by the <b>screw</b> in the cancellous bone, and bonding will occur between it and the HA coating of the screw (Fig.  2).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the preload and tensile fracture load values of prosthetic retaining screws after long-term use in vivo compared to unused screws (controls). Additionally, the investigation addressed whether the preload and fracture load values of prosthetic retaining screws reported by the manufacturer become altered after long-term use in vivo. Materials and Methods: For preload testing, 10 new screws (controls) from Nobel Biocare (NB) and 73 used retaining screws [58 from NB and 15 from Sterngold (SG) ] were subjected to preload testing. For tensile testing, eight controls from NB and 58 used retaining screws (46 from NB and 12 from SG) were subjected to tensile testing. Used screws for both tests were in service for 18 – 120 months. A custom load frame, load cell, and torque wrench setup were used for preload testing. All 83 prosthetic screws were torqued once to 10 Ncm, and the produced preload value was recorded (N) using an X–Y plotter. Tensile testing was performed on a universal testing machine and the resulting tensile fracture load value was recorded (N). Preload and tensile fracture load values were analyzed with 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests. Results: There was a signiﬁcant difference between <b>preload</b> values for <b>screws</b> from NB and screws from SG (p < 0. 001). The preload values for gold alloy screws from NB decreased as the number of years in service increased. There was a signiﬁcant difference between tensile fracture values for the three groups (gold alloy screws from NB and SG and palladium alloy screws from NB) at p < 0. 001. The tensile fracture values for gold alloy screws from NB and SG decreased as the number of years in service increased. Conclusions: In ﬁxed detachable hybrid prostheses, perhaps as a result of galling, the intended preload values of prosthetic retaining screws may decrease with increased in-service time. The reduction of the fracture load value may be related to the increase of in-service time; however, the actual determination of this relationship is not possible from this study alone.

40|$|Today's {{economic}} {{demands in}} manufacturing drive {{the requirements for}} high precision and productivity rates in machine tools design. One {{of the most common}} used machine tool drives for linear motion is the ball screw drive (BSD), which converts rotational motion of the servo motor to linear motion of the machine tool structural component. The advantages of modern BSD are high rigidity and low friction, and therefore a high efficiency compared to alternative systems like rack and pinion systems. However, to achieve the required accuracy it is necessary to <b>preload</b> the ball <b>screw</b> drive to prevent backlash. Backlash is caused by the clearance between the contacts of the ball bearings and the threads of the nut and screw. Clearance, however, is needed to prevent unnecessary friction during operation of the BSD. Different preload levels, on one hand, determine the rigidity and thus the maximum load a drive can carry and, on the other hand, the amount of heat to be dissipated due to friction which also leads to wear of the components. Due to their high specific workloads and relatively small spatial requirements, shape memory alloys (SMA) possess an outstanding potential to serve as miniaturized positioning devices in adaptronic and mechatronic applications. In comparison to other actuators such as hydraulics, electric motors or piezoelectric actuators, SMA based-actuators have the highest mechanical work output per volume. Nevertheless, most of the known SMA drives are used in the application area of small and lightweight actuators such as flaps and locks in the automotive industry, medical technology and life science. In this paper we present an approach to retrieve a preload loss which causes a loss to positioning accuracy in BSD due to wear over lifetime. The main purposes are reduced maintenance, longer service life and improved workpiece quality by regenerating previous preload conditions which leads to higher gainings for manufacturers. For this purpose, a novel SMA actuator driven module for BSD has been designed. The device was developed to be implemented in standard drives without major changes in component design. It is installed between flanged nut and counter nut and replaces a spacer usually used to define a specific preload. It was required to scale the actuator module over a wide range of screw diameters respectively nut diameters. Besides mechanical properties, thermal boundary conditions during operation of BSD must be taken into consideration. A prototype has been manufactured and tested to evaluate the current design and first results will be introduced...|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} precision machines {{will require}} ever more rigid elements {{to achieve the}} required machining tolerances. The presented work focuses on the application of ultra stiff servo-controllable kinematic couplings and hydrostatic bearings to minimize the structural loop of multi-axis precision grinding machines while reducing complexity. The fundamental importance of these ultra stiff, adjustable machine elements is demonstrated {{in the design of}} a grinding machine for 450 mm diameter silicon wafers. A new generation of silicon wafer grinding machines is needed to back-grind large (450 mm diameter) wafers from the production thickness of up to 1 mm down to less than 50 pm so as to reduce the cost of Si-wafer based components. The grinding process {{needs to be done in}} about 90 sec (fine-grinding, e. g. - 200 micron) to 160 sec (coarse grinding, e. g. - 600 micron). After completion of the fine grinding process the wafer must be flat to 0. 1 pm/o 45 mm and parallel to 0. 6 pm/ 450 mm diameter. The surface roughness must be less than Rymax 0. 1 pm and Ra 0. 01 pm. Even though the required machining forces are 1 N/nm is required, which is many times stiffer than a typical machine tool (0. 1 to 0. 3 N/nm). In cooperation with industry, this work had the aim of creating a new machine design philosophy, with an example application that focuses on nano-adjustable kinematic coupling and feedback controlled water hydrostatic bearing technology. This new design philosophy is needed to enable the design of a relatively small footprint, compact precision machines. In particular, a ball <b>screw</b> <b>preloaded</b> height adjustable kinematic coupling and a magnetically preloaded hydrostatic thrust bearing were designed and built. The adjustable kinematic coupling allows for up to 8 mm of vertical height adjust and 7 N/nm stiffness at 26 kN preload. By varying the preload on the coupling by +/- 10 %, in-process nm to micron height and tilt adjustment at > 95 % of the nominal stiffness is possible. Under the assumption of a constant flow supply, the hydrostatic bearing achieves a theoretical stiffness of 1 N/ nm at a 20 micron bearing gap and 7000 N combined gravitational and magnetic preload. In practice, the stiffness is limited by the pressure flow characteristics of the supplying pumps. To increase the bearing stiffness to a required 4 N/ nm, various control loops have been developed and tested. by Gerald Rothenhöfer. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|MDent, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandPURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this in vitro {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} effect of using either gold or titanium retaining <b>screws</b> on <b>preload</b> in the dental implant body-abutment complex. This preload is of vital importance for the long term success of the dental implant complex. Inadequate preload results in either loosening or fracture of the retaining screw, and is the most commonly occurring mechanical complication in implant supported/retained prostheses. Similar complications occur when excessive preload is applied to the retaining screws. These complications can result in unscheduled visits with costly and time consuming repairs for the clinician and patient. Routine maintenance protocols for implant supported prostheses range from biannually to five year visits to the dentist. Maintenance visits involve removal of the prosthesis facilitating cleaning of both the implant and prosthesis and inspection of retaining screws. This study sought to gain insight into changes in preload generation after repeated torque application to gold and titanium screws and to observe whether gold or titanium generated better preload. A maintenance protocol would be suggested if any observable pattern was noted. MATERIALS AND METHODS The test setup consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment and the retaining screws (gold or titanium). The implant body was anchored using a load cell. Transmucosal abutments were attached to the implant body using either a gold or titanium v retaining screw. A torque gauge was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm and 40 Ncm to the retaining screws. This was undertaken to investigate the effect of gold or titanium on preload generated. The effect of applying torque beyond manufacturers recommended 32 Ncm was carried out to see if greater preloads could be achieved. All components were from the Southern Implant system. RESULTS Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining <b>screws.</b> <b>Preload</b> values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of gold retaining screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Maintenance protocols suggest replacing retaining screws every 20 years. After ten torque cycles were applied to each screw there was an insignificant change in preload generated in both titanium and gold screws. This study was therefore inconclusive with regards to maintenance protocols. CONCLUSION Within the limitations of this study, gold retaining <b>screws</b> generated better <b>preload</b> than titanium. Torque application beyond manufacturers’ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex. Further investigation into repeated torque application to retaining screws is required, to determine ideal maintenance protocols...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Osteoporosis is {{the most}} common bone disease, {{contributing}} to over 3. 5 million fragility fractures each year in the EU [1]. Managing these fractures costs € 37 billion each year with a 25 % increase predicted by 2025. Fracture fixation in reduced density osteoporotic bone is a surgical challenge and failures are common, occurring in 15 - 40 % of cases [2]. It is hypothesised that the torque used to fasten bone screws during fracture fixation significantly influences the holding strength of screws and thus the likelihood of fixation failure. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the effect of different insertion torques on the holding strength of cortical bone screws for a range of bone densities and cortical thicknesses. Methods Experimental tests (n= 100) were conducted to evaluate cortical screw pull-out strength using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months). The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded. Screws were inserted using a range of insertion torques, and the pullout strength was measured for each (Instron 5967, High Widcomb, UK). Additionally, the effect of stress-relaxation was investigated by imaging the surface of the bone surrounding the screw immediately after screw fastening at logarithmic intervals up till 17 hours post-fixation. Strains were evaluated using digital image correlation (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T., USA). An axisymmetric finite element (FE) model was developed based on the experimental tests. An idealized screw geometry incorporating screw threads was based on CT-images (Simpleware ScanIP, Exeter, UK). Using a maximum tensile strain failure criteria, (considering the tensile yield strain of cortical bone to be 1. 0 %), the FE model was used to predict the pull-out strength for the variables considered (Ansys 15. 0, USA). Results Significant stress relaxation was found to occur post-fixation, with the strain distribution appearing to be related to the proximity of the thread to the surface. There was good agreement in predicted and measured pullout force versus mean cortical thickness. Discussion Although relatively simple, the developed validated model is capable of predicting cortical bone screw pullout strength for a range of bone densities and cortical thicknesses. This study found that significant stress-relaxation occurs post-fixation, in line with previous literature [3]. Currently, the effect of screw insertion and stress-relaxation is not included in the models. The relationship between fastening torque and axial <b>screw</b> <b>preload</b> is well defined [4], thus screw insertion torque can be reasonably approximated in this way. We aim to incorporate both of these effects to understand the post-fixation screw mechanics and further improve our modelling predictions. Our intention is to develop this model into a patient-specific tool providing surgeons with guidance regarding appropriate screw fastening torques for different bone qualities. This tool has the potential to enhance construct stability and reduce the incidence of failures. The developed model could also be used as a design tool for screws. References 1.
