It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly industrial landscape during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron until the Middle Ages.|$|E

40|$|Background: Peak expiratory flow (PEF) {{monitoring}} {{is frequently}} used to diagnose occupational asthma (OA). The variability of PEF between <b>periods</b> <b>at</b> work {{and away from}} work has not been described in workers with work-exacerbated asthma (WEA). We sought to assess and compare the diurnal variability of PEF during <b>periods</b> <b>at</b> and away fromwork between subjects with OA andWEA. Methods: Workers referred for work-related asthma underwent PEF monitoring for 2 weeks at and away from work. The diagnostic of OA or WEA was subsequently made according to the respective positivity or negativity of the specific inhalation challenges. PEF mean diurnal variability was calculated during <b>periods</b> <b>at</b> and away from work. PEF graphs were also interpreted using direct visual analysis by five observers and using a computer program (Oasys- 2, Expert System) [available at...|$|R
