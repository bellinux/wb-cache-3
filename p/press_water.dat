Some form of treatment, such as pretreatment with membrane may however, improved the output efficiency of sugar plants. In this study, nanofiltration membrane (AFC 80) were used to investigate the permeate flux, fouling percent and rejection percent of most important molassogenic ions (sodium and potassium) and sucrose. Sugar beet <b>press</b> <b>water</b> was provided by Abkoh sugar beet factory. The effect of operating parameters such as temperature (at levels of 25, 40 and 55 °C), trans membrane pressure (at levels of 10, 15 and 20 bar) on nanofiltration performance (permeate flux, fouling and rejection) were investigated. The results show that maximum permeate flux is obtained at 55 °C and 20 bar, while the average value is 49. 27 kgm- 2 h- 1. The minimum permeate flux is obtained at 25 °C and 10 bar, and the average value in this conditions is 14. 63 kgm- 2 h- 1. Maximum and minimum fouling are reached at 55 °C and 20 bar and 25 °C and 15 bar, respectively. Furthermore maximum rejection of sodium and potassium (84. 3 % and 72. 5 % respectively) is obtained at 25 °C and 20 bar, and minimum of rejection of sodium and potassium (74. 3 % and 69. 05 % respectively) is obtained on 55 °C and 10 bar.

40|$|Summary. Food {{production}} {{requires a}} significant consumption of energy derived from natural resources. The main direction of increase of competitiveness of production of sugar beet and sugar is reduction {{the consumption of}} energy resources, losses of sucrose and enforcement of existing environmental regulations. We conducted research on the reduction of energy consumption in obtaining sugar in various directions. We investigate the possibility of reducing energy consumption for drying of sugar beet pulp. One of the directions of hardening {{of the structure of}} the fabric during the extraction process is the preliminary chemical impact on beet chips. In our studies, it was found the effect of the method of preparation pulp <b>press</b> <b>water</b> on mechanical strength beet chips. One of the directions of energy saving is the reduction of scale formation and the related increase in the efficiency of water evaporation from the pure juice. With this purpose, we studied the different coating applied to the surface of the boiling tubes evaporating. The best results in reduction of scale formation has been observed when blueing heat transfer surface. Positive results can be obtained from the use of such technological operations as the ripening of juice after II carbonation. We analyzed the technology with the use of magnetic treatment to reduce the consumption of lime on the physical and chemical cleaning of diffusion juice. Determined that the rational conditions of processing preliming juice at pH 8, 5 pulsed magnetic field is the duration of its impact 8 sec and with the induction of 0, 25 T.

40|$|Water {{management}} in sugar factories doesn’t have analogues in its complexity among food industry enterprises. Water intensity of sugar production is very high. Circulation water, condensed water, pulp <b>press</b> <b>water</b> {{and others are}} used in technological processes. Water plays the main role in physical, chemical, thermotechnical processes of beet processing and sugar production.

The reduction of fresh water expenditure {{is one of the}} main tasks in economy of sugar industry. The substantial role in fresh water expenditure is played by efficiency of cooling and aeration processes of conditionally clean waters of the 1 st category. The article contains an observation of the technologies of the available solutions and recommendations for improving and upgrading the existing recycling water-cooling systems of sugar mills.

40|$|The {{conventional}} viscose {{manufacturing process}} is a mature process {{that needs to be}} improved with respect to its environmental impact and its production cost structure. Therefore a research study has been done with the aim to improve the reactivity of the dissolving pulp used, {{in order to reduce the}} chemical demand in the viscose process and thus reduce the cost and indirectly the environmental impact. The work described in this thesis has shown that it is possible to enhance the pulp reactivity and to use less carbon disulphide in the production of viscose, while maintaining a good quality viscose dope, by two entirely different pretreatment methods, one chemical and one enzymatic. The chemical method used pressurized oxygen after the mercerisation step, which increased the reactivity of the alkali cellulose. The viscose dopes produced from the pressurized oxygen treated alkali cellulose had lower filter clogging values, Kw, compared to conventionally produced viscoses. The temperature and the oxygen treatment time of the alkali cellulose were however crucial for the viscose quality. The best performing enzyme of several tested was a cellulase of the mono component endoglucanase preparation Carezyme®. This enzymatic treatment was optimized with respect to viscose dope preparation. The study showed that the enzyme treatment could be carried out under industrially interesting conditions with respect to temperature, enzyme dose and reaction time. A re-circulation study of the enzyme showed that it was possible to re-use the spent <b>press</b> <b>water</b> from the enzymatic treatment step several times, and thus lower the production cost. Some of the viscose process stages were modified to properly fit the enzymatically treated dissolving pulp and a comparison between viscose made from enzyme-treated pulp and viscose made from conventional pulp, showed that the enzyme-treated samples had a lower filter clogging value, Kw. This indirectly indicates that the enzyme pretreatment could reduce the carbon disulphide charge in the viscose manufacturing process. An initial study of how the Carezyme® influenced different cellulosic sources was also performed...|$|E

From a biorefinery point of view, DSCcomponents can be promising renewable raw materials for biofuels, bio‐basedchemicals and materials. In this thesis, a new approach using induced air flotation (IAF) without a cationicpolyelectrolyte addition for the removal of pitch and metal ions from mechanicalpulp mill process waters is presented. The induced air flotation of different processwaters is facilitated by the addition of a chelating surfactant and different foamingagents. The influence of the pH value, temperature and foaming agentconcentration on the flotation efficiency has been investigated. The investigations presented show that the disturbing components can be removed from TMP presswater to a high extent. A 90 % decrease in turbidity and a 91 % removal of lipophilicextractives (i. e. resin and fatty acids, triglycerides, sterols and steryl esters) fromunbleached and bleached TMP process water can be obtained by addition of acationic surfactant as foaming agent during flotation. Lower amount of foamingagent is needed to purify efficiently bleached TMP process water, than unbleached. Additionally, fibres located in TMP <b>press</b> <b>water</b> are not removed with the foamfraction but purified. A retained concentration of hydrophilic extractives (i. e. hemicelluloses and lignans) in the process water indicates that the flotation isselective. Moreover, by introduction of a new recoverable surface activecomplexing agent, a chelating surfactant, manganese ions in the form of chelatescan be successfully removed from the pulp fibres and separated from the processwater in the same flotation process. Furthermore, from the purified unbleachedTMP process water a 90 % recovery of dissolved hemicelluloses by anti‐solventprecipitation was obtained. The findings presented above indicate new possibilities for the internal watercleaning stage to decrease DSC emissions to recipient and for recovery of valuableraw materials from purified process water if flotation technology is applied in anintegrated mechanical pulp mill.
