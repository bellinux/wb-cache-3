40|$|Modern {{precision}} pneumatic drills (1 - 500 kg/ha) used in {{the cultivation}} of high density crops such as winter cereals (up to 400 plants/m 2) are very high performance equipment that triple the working width (up to 9 m) and rates (up to 14 km/h) compared to those used fifteen years ago. Most of enterprises commercialize such devices using as cornerstone a central <b>pneumatic</b> <b>distributor</b> in combination {{with a large number}} of radial outlets (24 - 48). In spite of the unquestionable advantages of these devices with regard to more conventional gravitational distributors, the main drawback remains the lack of transversal uniformity which has proven to be fairly sensitive to seed size and shape, to slight air flow changes related to partial obstructions of outlets, elbows and grips in discharge outlets, or vibrations and inclinations of the central distributor, as well associated to inadequate maintenance of the machine by untrained operators. Moreover, the lack of behavior predictability derives in a certain discredit of the pneumatic procedure. This work proposes a theoretical-empirical methodology to analyze the pneumatic circuit and its interaction with a variety of seeds types to be delivered, and selected operational machinery settings, within the aim of elaborating a test protocol which combined with low cost instrumentation will serve a base for predictive maintenance. Experimental data gathered in static and dynamic tests performed by the authors on at least two different seeders together with published information available on technical papers will be reviewed and used for further discussion on reliable diagnosis procedure...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a linear pneumatic actuator with short working stroke. It {{consists of a}} pneumatic motor (a simple stroke cylinder or a membrane chamber), two 2 / 2 <b>pneumatic</b> <b>distributors</b> “all or nothing” electrically commanded for controlling the intake/outtake flow to/from the active chamber of the motor, a position transducer and a microcontroller. There is also presented the theoretical analysis (mathematical modelling and numerical simulation) accomplished...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new control method {{applied to the}} electro-pneumatic field. This strategy originates from the hybrid control theory recently developed for the control of asynchronous or synchronous electrical motors, e. g. Retif (2004). The interest of this strategy concerns {{the possibility of using}} standard on/off distributors instead of the usual servodistributors (components issued from proportional technology) for the force control of a <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder. <b>Distributor</b> components have less performance but are cheaper than a servodistributor. The aim is to obtain, with a distributor, the same performances as servodistributors on the global system. Based on both cylinder and distributor models, the hybrid control presented here chooses the best state for each on/off distributor to reach the desired force value. Experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R
