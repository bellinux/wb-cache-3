This comes from somewhat known geometric algorithms but, in most cases, with initial conditions different from those usually seen in this context. These definitions are shown to be consistent with other ones directly deduced from “classical” approaches like matrix <b>pencil</b> <b>tools</b> or discrete algebraic formalism. The key starting point for their introduction is the extension of structural descriptions for these generalized systems such as have been available for proper systems. Many results from the proper case can thus be extended, for instance the geometric definition for controllability indices and something similar to the famous Morse canonical decomposition of the strictly proper case. Some links with the inversion algorithm are also sketched...|$|R

Reductions in errors and inaccurate perseverative responding during intervention periods were higher, and the repetition of errors during maintenance test was lower, when feedback was provided by an educator in Study 1. These results were replicated and extended in Study 2 to the operation of subtraction. In Study 3, the concurrent presentation of both forms of immediate feedback was more effective than the presentation of either form separately.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{manufacturing}} companies have {{had to deal with}} an increasing demand for feature-rich products at low costs. The pressures exerted on their existing manufacturing processes have lead manufacturers to investigate internet-based solutions, in order to cope with growing competition. Today, the availability of powerful and low cost 3 D tools, along with web-based technologies, provides interesting opportunities to the manufacturing community, with solutions directly implementable at the core of their businesses and organizations. The wooden sign is custom i. e. each sign is completely different from each other. Mass Customization is a paradigm that produces custom products in masses. A wooden sign is custom in nature, and each sign must be completely different from another. Although process planning for mass customized products is same, the tool path required to CNC machine the custom feature varies from part to part. If the tool path is created manually the economics of mass production are challenged. The only viable option is to generate the tool path automatically; furthermore, any time savings in the tool path lead to better profit margins. This thesis presents the automatic web-based tool path planning method for machining sculptured wooden sign on 3 axis Computer Numerical Controlling (CNC) Machines using optimal and cost-effective milling cutters. The web-based tool path planning strategy is integrate with web-based CAD system to automatically generate tool paths for the CAD model using optimal cutter within desired tolerances. The tool path planning method is divided into two parts: foot print (path along which cutter moves) and cutter positioning. The tool path foot print is developed during design stage from the CAD model based on the type of surface to be machined. The foot print varies from part to part which facilitates the mass customization of wooden sign. After designing foot print, the foot print is discretized into points and the gouge-free cutter position at each of these points is found using "Dropping Method". The Dropping Method where cutter is dropped over the work piece surface, and the highest depth at which cutter can go without gouging the surface is calculated. This is repeated for all the position along the foot print. This tool path planning strategy is developed for ball nose, flat-end and radiused end milling cutter for machining wooden sign. The tool path generated using this method is optimized for machining time, tool path generation time and final surface finish. The bucketing technique is developed to optimize tool path generation time, by isolating the triangles which has possibility of intersection at particular position. The bucketing Technique reduced the tool path computation by 75 %, and made tool path generation faster. The optimal cutter selection algorithm is developed which selects best cutter for machining the surface based on the scallop height and volume removal results. The radiused end milling cutter results in highest volume removal which results in lower machining time compared to ball nose end milling cutters, but the scallop heights is higher. However, the scallop height in the radiused end milling cutter is higher only in few regions which reduces the final surface finish. For a sign, it was found around the boundary of logo, outline of lettering, interface of border and background. Thus, in order to achieve higher surface finish and lower machining time, a separate tool path is developed using "Pencil Milling Technique" which will remove the scallops from the regions that was inaccessible by radiused end mills. This tool path with the smaller cutter will move around the boundary of logo and lettering, and clean-up all the scallops left on the surface. The designed tool path for all the three cutters were tested on maple wood and verified against the actual Computer Aided Design model for scallop height and surface finish. The numerical testing of tool path was carried out on a Custom Simulator, ToolSim and was later confirmed by actually machining on a 3 axis CNC machine. The same sign was machined with variety of milling cutters and the best cutter was selected based on the minimum scallop and maximum volume removal. The results of the experimental verification show the method to be accurate for machining sculptured sign. The average scallop height in a machined using 1 / 8 th inch radiused end milling cuter and using <b>Pencil</b> <b>tool</b> path on the machined surface is found to be 0. 03989 mm (1. 5708 thou) ...|$|E

To avoid this negative impact a new machine tool - the Nano Grinding Center - has been developed at the Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Production Systems. The Nano Grinding Center is a fully integrated tool production and application machine for micro <b>pencil</b> grinding <b>tools</b> without re-clamping. The manufacturing of ultra-small tool diameters (< 5 μm) with customized tool shapes requires an individualization of the micro manufacturing process and further a modularity of the desktop sized machine tool.

Objectives: Facing the problem of lacking patient-tailored, comprehensive health management software, {{the aim of this}} thesis is to generate ideas for a graphical user interface (GUI) to support stroke patients in the management of their individual care process. The objectives are to prototype a GUI for a patient e-service and to evaluate its usefulness and usability with stroke patients. Methods: A scenario-based, user-centered design method was used to envision ideas for the user interface. Static prototypes were realized with the <b>tool</b> <b>Pencil</b> and for the implementation of a dynamic prototype web programming techniques were used. For the evaluation of the prototypes the methods of focus group discussion and cooperative evaluation were applied. Results: The situation of a representative stroke patient and his interaction with the e-service were described in scenarios. Graphical user interfaces of the involved system views were derived from the scenarios and illustrated with static wireframe prototypes. A welcome screen, a care process timeline overview, and a diary with data sharing functionality were designed. The diary functionality was further examined by implementing a prototypical web application. During the evaluation, feedback for further improvements was gathered, and assumptions about the user information and functionality needs could be verified. Conclusion: The developed prototypes represent a suitable graphical user interface and visualizations to support stroke patients in the management of their care process.

Proust, I acknowledge that ???the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes?????? (1871 ??? 1922). The media I have investigated are photography and painting. In photography, the sequential and fragmentary aspect of the camera, its use {{as an extension of the}} brush or <b>pencil,</b> i. e. <b>tool,</b> to provide structural formations, have been explored. Multiple viewpoints, angles, distortions, characteristic of the camera, can be applied to more fully experience an object observed in space. The dual nature of the camera (positive/negative) is symbolized in the sections left out and those included. Through unfamiliar juxtapositions, our perception, based on the familiar, is both disoriented and directed in an integrated way of seeing, including a kinesthetic sense. By using the landscape and familiar objects, an identification of the observer with my point of view is promoted. Each individual part is a completed image, yet the work is to be read as a whole. In painting, the emotional quality and fluidity of paint complements, for me, the impersonal photographic materials of chemicals plastic. By superimposing the camera-image over paint, I reversed the process used until now. This has opened up new possibilities for photography as well as painting. To keep the integrity of the plastic allowing the wall to become part of the work. The motivation behind this methodology stems from my interest in the subjective/objective nature of perception. Perception relies largely on relations rather than absolutes. In sensory experience generalities precede particulars, the organization of which takes place in the mind. The perceptual transaction in itself is fundamentally an innovative act, i. e. thinking. A prerequisite of our ability to think is the construction of internal representations of external events; mental simulation thus is the essence of thought. A nexus between art, especially photography, and the psychology of perception seems like a natural process. Through photographic reconstruction empirically based facts, the ultimate purpose of art is to develop a more conscious and intimate approach to the myriad of processes going on inside as well as outside our bodies. This includes the notion of being part of something far greater than ourselves, a concept called ???Satori??? in Zen Buddhism??...|$|R
40|$|Twentieth century mathematicians have succesfully {{mastered}} {{a method}} or {{way of looking}} that combines local and global tools, and which has lead, for example, to the resolution of long standing open problems such as Fermat´s Last Theorem 2 and the Conjecture of Taniyama, Shimura and Weil. In parts 1 and 2 we will give {{a brief description of}} this way of looking, which we will then use, in part 3 {{as well as in the}} appendix, to analyse three concrete paintings of Pablo Picasso. When Michele Emmer invited me to participate in the second volume of “The Visual Mind”, I was already deeply inmersed in an on-going process that has been moving quite different people -most of us mathematicians, painters, musicians and architects-, for a long time. This process has lead us to analyze, in conversations and reflections as well as in concrete pieces of work, what we have been calling “transmission of knowledge”, in its many facets, starting from its personal, intellectual and professional impact on us and our work. As part of this process, in the spring of 1997 Laura Tedeschini-Lalli invited me to participate with a short cycle of conferences in the mathematics course she was then teaching at the School of Architecture, University Roma 3. During the mini-course, whose material can be found in [4] and [5], I reflected on the evolution of the concept of space in mathematics and painting during the XIXth. and XXth. centuries. When trying to understand the mathematical notions and tools developed along these centuries, I invited the students to, and provided the material for,keep in mind the art painted at each specific time as a raphical reference from where to select some of the characteristics of the abstraction process we were looking at in mathematics. While preparing the project required for the course, some of the students asked Tedeschini-Lalli if it would be possible to work in the opposite, complementary, direction: to keep in mind the (abstract) tools being used by the mathematical community at a specific time while looking at artworks, in order to select some questions, and a method. This question lead Tedeschini-Lalli and her students to the analysis of Maya with Doll (see appendix). Although the possibility of working in the direction they follow had already emerged in many of the conversations with mathematicians and artists that have nurtured and given shape to this process along the years, the study of Maya with Doll was the first actual contribution in this direction, and the one that gave me the push to trust my <b>pencil</b> as a <b>tool</b> of deep thought outside mathematics. ...|$|R
