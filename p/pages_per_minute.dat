5000|$|One {{reason for}} this is that, when {{rendered}} in studio format, most screenplays will transfer onto the screen at the rate of approximately one <b>page</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> This rule of thumb is widely contested [...] - [...] a page of dialogue usually occupies less screen time than a page of action, for example, and it depends enormously on the literary style of the writer [...] - [...] and yet it continues to hold sway in modern Hollywood.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} DocuTech Production Publisher {{was capable}} of scanning and then printing black-and-white pages at up to 135 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minutes</b> (for letter or A4 sizes) with an output resolution of 600 x 600 dots per inch (dpi). Scanned documents could be saved to a special memory area on disk known as the [...] "Save Queue" [...] {{where they could be}} retained, edited if desired (using the built in editor), and later printed [...] "on demand". The system was also capable of printing on sheet sizes up to 14x17 inches. Another important feature of this earliest DocuTech was its ability to perform signature imposition and generate [...] "2-up signatures" [...] (later 4-up was added) in the proper page imposition order to create signature booklets. (note: Folding, trimming, and stitching of booklets was done by an optional accessory known as a C.P. Bourg Signature Booklet Maker or SBM-1, which could be attached in-line to the system's output finisher.) ...|$|R
40|$|Web site {{personalization}} {{could be}} immensely improved if the user’s current intentions could {{be recognized by}} the surf-ing behavior. The latter can be captured {{in the form of}} events occurring in the browser, like mouse moves or opening web pages. But which aspects of the user’s behavior best con-tribute to the recognition of the task a user is performing? Is it the number of mouse clicks, {{the amount of time spent}} on each page, the use of the back button or anything else? First results of an exploratory study give hint that already simple attributes, such as the average page view duration, the number of <b>page</b> views <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and the number of different URLs requested, may be usable for the automatic user task identification. 20 participants solved exemplary exercises which corresponded to the user tasks Fact Finding, Information Gathering and Just Browsing.

50|$|Laser printer speed {{can vary}} widely, and depends on many factors, {{including}} the graphic {{intensity of the}} job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 monochrome <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color laser printers can print over 100 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed laser printers are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with lithography in some commercial applications.|$|E

50|$|In {{the network}} laser-printer market, the 5Si series was succeeded by the 8000, {{and later by}} the 8100 and 8150.

The 8100 and 8150 brought faster printing (32 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute),</b> but this speed was only realized for single-sided (simplex) printing; double-sided printing remained at 24 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> These models, which used the Canon WX engine, provided excellent durability and good maintainability.|$|E

50|$|The {{speed of}} early {{printers}} {{was measured in}} units of characters per minute (cpm) for character printers, or lines per minute (lpm) for line printers. Modern printers are measured in <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (ppm). These measures are used primarily as a marketing tool, and are not as well standardised as toner yields. Usually <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> refers to sparse monochrome office documents, rather than dense pictures which usually print much more slowly, especially colour images. PPM are {{most of the time}} referring to A4 paper in Europe and letter paper in the United States, resulting in a 5-10% difference.|$|E
