40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between parent-child conflict and academic engagement for Hmong American and Caucasian adolescents. A total of 136 participants were included in the present cross-sectional, non- experimental study. Students received two or three surveys: the Asian American Family Conflicts Scale (FCS; Hmong), the parent-child conflict questions of the <b>Child</b> <b>s</b> <b>View</b> Questionnaire (CVQ; Hmong and Caucasian), and three subscales of the ClassMaps Survey (CMS; Hmong and Caucasian). Five hypotheses were generated regarding Hmong American and Caucasian students parent-child conflict and academic engagement. Results indicate that while Hmong American students have similar levels of conflict with their parents as Caucasian students, Hmong American students talk less than Caucasian students about school- related topics with their parents. As well, for both Caucasian and Hmong American students, parent-child conflict {{was a significant predictor of}} students talking with their parents about school. Points of interest are discussed in the context of Hmong and dominant American culture; implications for interventions will be drawn within the context of the school setting...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how I {{improved}} my portfolios assessment {{practices by}} making <b>children</b> <b>s</b> portfolios freely available to children, {{their parents and}} whānau in the early childhood care and education centre where I worked. As the teacher researcher I present an insider perspective, my world view on how I improved my pedagogical practices {{in order to gain}} a deeper understanding of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning, and my role in supporting <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. This study has two components, a) the writer as the teacher researcher and, b) accessibility of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> portfolios and the involvement of children in the portfolio process. This study uses a qualitative research design, a mixed methodology of self-study action research and case study. Three theories, ecological, sociocultural, and Donald Schön s (1983) theory of learning and practice have informed and guided this research. This eclectic mix of theoretical frameworks provided me with some valuable insights on ways of examining and using portfolios with children, and understanding <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>views</b> on their portfolios. The findings in this study are particular to the centre where I worked and they may not be generalisable to other early childhood care and education centres. Nonetheless, my experiences highlight the potential importance of the process and issues that arise from making portfolios accessible. The findings revealed that my experiences of engaging in self-study action research promoted within the centre a community of learners, and an enquiry approach to teaching and learning. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} making portfolios freely available provides children with an understanding of the purpose, contents and ownership of their portfolios. When children frequently use and share their portfolios with peers and teachers it can promote critical self-reflection and self-assessment of their learning. Involving children in the portfolio process makes visible to children the value of their contributions to their learning. Overall, this study has significantly improved my pedagogical practices. It has enhanced teachers learning which has in turn, benefited the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. Beyond that, making the portfolios accessible has strengthened parental understanding of their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> experiences at the centre...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSW (Forensic)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 <b>Pre-school</b> <b>children</b> often {{spend the}} most {{part of the day}} at a pre-primary school or a day care centre. <b>Pre-school</b> <b>children</b> {{sometimes}} make the first statement of sexual abuse to a pre-school teacher. Due to this phenomenon it is important that pre-school personnel are knowledgeable about basic information in connection with sexual abuse of the <b>pre-school</b> <b>child</b> and the reporting of the abuse. A positive attitude toward the protection of children against sexual abuse and the willingness {{to get involved in the}} reporting of sexual abuse or the suspicion there of, will guarantee that the best interest of the <b>pre-school</b> <b>child</b> is served. Die purpose of the research was to ascertain the knowledge and attitude of pre-school personnel toward sexual abuse of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> and the reporting there of, to determine whether pre-school personnel act in the best interest of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children.</b> The research followed a quantitative approach. 13 Pre-primary schools took part in the research and 70 pre-school personnel completed the questionnaires. The questionnaires were completed in the participants own time. The findings clearly showed that pre-school personnel who were involved in the research did not have sufficient knowledge, nor a desirable attitude toward sexual abuse of the <b>pre-school</b> <b>child</b> and the reporting thereof.

40|$|This {{research}} {{study focused on}} {{the factors that influence}} the disciplining of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> during the divorce process. Divorce is an escalating phenomenon and more <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> are being exposed to divorce. A <b>pre-school</b> <b>child’s</b> development limits his abstract thinking processes which keep him to fully comprehending concepts like divorce. The verbal capacity of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> is still limited and therefore they are not always able to communicate what they experience and observe. They are also not always able to express their emotions. The <b>pre-school</b> <b>child</b> communicates through behaviour and play. Divorce is not only the legal termination of the marriage for adults, but in fact entails more responsibilities, challenges, losses and adaptations. More pressure is placed on the parents and they tend to be emotional overwhelmed, physical exhausted and emotionally drained. This causes that the parents to not see their way open to care for and especially discipline their <b>pre-school</b> <b>child.</b> Discipline in general is left aside and is not followed through consistently. The {{purpose of this study is}} of ‘n explorative nature. It aims to explore the factors that have an impact on the disciplining of the <b>pre-school</b> <b>child,</b> prior to, during and after the divorce process. A quantitative research approach has been followed with this study and a questionnaire has been used for gathering information. A non-probability sampling method was used and the respondents were selected through a purposive sample. The respondents were selected from the Pretoria East region. The organisations that assisted the researcher in selecting the respondents were the Counselling centre of the Dutch Reformed Church of Moreletapark and the Child Trauma Clinic. For this study 19 respondents were selected. The questionnaires was given out by hand and collected by hand. The children of the respondents who participated in the study were all <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> when going through the divorce. It has been concluded from this study that the factors impacting the discipline of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> during the divorce process, is of an emotional nature. A factor that played an important role in the disciplining of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> is the guilt feelings that the respondents experienced for exposing their children to a divorce. Physical tiredness, emotional exhaustion, conflict between parents during and after the divorce and the number of times that one of the parents leaved the house, are factors that according to the respondents, influenced the disciplining of their <b>pre-school</b> <b>children.</b> Dissertation (MSD (Play Therapy)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Background: In {{light of}} the various {{challenges}} faced by public dental health services, especially when large geographical areas and isolated communities are concerned, targeting of high risk groups within these populations needs to be investigated. This study aimed to assess caries experience, dental health behaviour and dental service utilization among a sample of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> in a rural community in Western Australia. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional oral health survey of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> {{between the ages of}} 2 and 5 in Carnarvon, Western Australia. Results: In total, 70 <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> (representing approximately 15 per cent of the total 2 – 5 year old population of Carnarvon) were examined. Less than half of the children were caries free. Both caries prevalence and severity (mean dmft) were significantly higher among Aboriginal children than non-Aboriginal children. Caries prevalence and severity were also significantly higher among children who often consumed carbonated drinks. Conclusions: This survey indicates that some <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> in rural areas, and especially Aboriginal <b>pre-school</b> <b>children,</b> are at high risk of developing dental caries. Effective oral health programmes commencing well before the usual first contact with dental services at age 5 are needed for young children at high risk of dental caries.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} Social games with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> is to present social games {{as one of the}} work methods for {{relational}} learning. The theoretical part defines the social development of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> and focuses on social skills that begin to emerge in the preschool period and of course social games. The purpose of social games is active learning, meaning they provide concrete situations, through which children actively learn as well as use social skills and express their views and feelings. The empirical part comprises a study based on the implementation of social games, observing children, and using a rating scale. I wanted to see how many children will achieve the objectives of individual games. For {{the purposes of this study}} I observed their participation, behavior and motivation. The results have shown that co-operation as well as collective identity games are more suitable for <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> from fifth year onwards. Games encouraging getting to know each other and learning about our differences are suitable for <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> from their second year on and only need to be adapted if necessary. Conflict-resolving games are suitable for <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> from the third year onwards. Conclusions encourage all teaching staff to use social games, which aim to improve relationships between children and teachers. ...|$|R

The Pre-school Observational Scale of Anxiety was used to measure the degree of anxiety experienced by the children. The hypothesis stated that there would be a significant decrease in anxiety of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> who participated in needle play as compared with the anxiety scores of <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> who did not participate in needle play. The sample consisted of 20 <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> who were receiving routine health care and injections for immunizations or PPDs (purified protein derivative) at a county health department in the southeast. After obtaining informed consent, children were randomly assigned to either a control group (n = 10) or experimental group (n = 10). The control group was involved in putting together a puzzle with the investigator prior to their injection. The experimental group participated in needle play with the investigator prior to their injection. The Pre-school Observational Scale of Anxiety (POSA) which specifies behavioral indicators of anxiety in children was used on all subjects immediately prior to the actual needle penetration and a score was given to each subject. The scores on the Pre-school Observational Scale of Anxiety showed no statistically significant difference between the control group and the experimental group when analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U Test. On the basis of these findings, the hypothesis that <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> who participate in needle play immediately prior to receiving an injection would show a significant decrease in anxiety when compared to <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> who did not-participate in needle play prior to an injection was not accepted...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out how a group of faculty wives with {{children}} used their time and to investigate some factors in housing and equipment which might influence how they used their time. A comparison was made between homemakers with two <b>pre-school</b> age <b>children</b> and homemakers with two school age children in the way they used their time. Following a letter of explanation of the study, the writer contacted the homemakers by phone to make an appointment to visit them. During this visit the writer obtained the information for the questionnaire and explained the time sheets. Twenty-four homemakers, 12 with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children,</b> and 12 with school-age children kept usable records for this study. The homemakers ranged in age from 21 to 62 years of age. All of the homemakers had attended college with 42 percent graduating and an additional 16. 5 percent earning their master's degree. Two were registered nurses. Both groups averaged four years of work before marriage. The homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> had been married an average of eight years while the homemakers with school age children had been married an average of 18 years. The children ranged in age from four months to 18 years old. The 12. 5 percent of the families that did not own their own homes were all from the group with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children.</b> Although all of the homes were well equipped, the families that had been established the longest time had slightly more equipment. Half of the total group used time plans; the majority of the homemakers using time plans were homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children.</b> Homemakers in this study as well as previous studies most often listed food preparation as the homemaking activity they most enjoyed. Again, cleaning house was most often listed as the activity least enjoyed, followed by ironing. Improved housing, equipment, and methods have failed to change these attitudes in over a quarter of a century. The homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> spent the greatest percentage of their time caring for children followed by meal preparation and clean-up; the homemakers with school age children spent the greatest percentage of their time on food preparation and clean-up. Both groups spent a little over two and a half hours on meal preparation and clean-up. Homemakers with school age children averaged 48 minutes a day on laundry, whereas homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> averaged 70 minutes a day. Cleaning house averaged 63 minutes a day for homemakers with school age children and 45 minutes a day for homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children.</b> Homemakers with school age children averaged 39 minutes for shopping, whereas homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> averaged 23 minutes. The homemakers with school age children averaged 8 hours and 45 minutes of rest per day, whereas the homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> averaged 8 hours and 8 minutes. Homemakers with school age children spent more time eating meals, on personal care, and on entertaining and social activities, whereas homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> derived much of their leisure time from unplanned coffee breaks and chatting with neighbors. Other than the great difference in the amount of time the two groups spent in caring for their children, (the homemakers with <b>pre-school</b> <b>children</b> spent 3 hours and 38 minutes while the homemakers with school age children spent 39 minutes), there was great similarity in the way the two groups used their time. Another finding is that there is little difference in the amount of time the homemaker spent on different homemaking activities at the time of this study in comparison to studies done during the past quarter of a century...|$|R
