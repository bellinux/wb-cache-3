5|$|The {{extraction}} of peat from the Moors {{is known to}} have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. The introduction of <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3feet (0.3–0.8m) over 100years. Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the use of}} <b>plastic</b> in <b>packaging</b> {{has largely}} increased, {{consumer}} research consistently indicates that consumers attach a high quality perception to glass packaged products. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine individuals’ recognition and affective judgments of 30 food packages after visual and haptic exploration. We included packages of three food products that are more often packaged in glass (wine, honey, chocolate cream) and three products that are usually <b>plastic</b> <b>packaged</b> (yogurt, milk, juice). For each product, five packages were used: a glass package; a transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> with a shape similar to the glass package; a transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> with a shape different from the glass package; a non-transparent plastic package; a <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> with a very unusual shape. 30 participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: visual, haptic, and visual + haptic exploration. The visual group watched the packages while their eye-movements were recorded, whereas participants of the other two groups were video-recorded and haptic Exploration Procedures were coded. All participants were asked to name each package and to rate how much they liked it. Moreover, they blind tasted 20 products and were asked to judge liking and quality. Participants were unaware that, for each food category, they were tasting the exact same product repeatedly. The results show that pleasantness judgments were higher for glass <b>packages</b> than for <b>plastic</b> <b>packages.</b> Similarly, participants reported to like the products they believed to come from glass packages more than products contained in <b>plastic</b> <b>packages.</b> Unusual shapes required longer visual and haptic exploration, were overall rated as less pleasant and containing the lowest quality products. The implications for packaging material, shape and design are discussed...|$|R

500|$|Large {{areas of}} peat were laid {{down on the}} Somerset Levels, {{particularly}} in the River Brue Valley, during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted. Peat extraction on the Somerset Levels has occurred since the area was first drained by the Romans.

Large parts of Westhay Moor have now been dug back to the underlying clay exposing estuarine deposits dating from about 6000 BP before isolation from the sea and peat formation began.
