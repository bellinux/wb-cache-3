5|$|On 7 April 1967, the {{grandstand}} caught {{fire and the}} entire structure burned down beyond repair. The buildings and stands were subsequently demolished. At the same time, the Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> proposed that the Fetveien road, which runs {{to the south of}} the stadium, should be moved to run through the stadium, which would have required the stadium to be moved. However, the <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> abandoned their plans and a building permit was issued. New changing rooms, club house and terraces were completed in September 1968.|$|E
5|$|In December 1986, the <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> {{recommended}} a bridge. A report published by SBT in 1987 considered detailed {{plans for a}} subsea tunnel to the mainland, which was followed up by seismic surveys in the fjord. SBT {{changed its name to}} Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge, as it would interfere with ship traffic. On 26 June 1987, SBT's board decided to work towards getting permission to collect advance tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration,</b> who stated that it would take a longer time to plan, and thus complete, the Triangle Link.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> {{published}} a report documenting high administration {{costs in the}} 46 toll companies throughout the country. Along with the company for the Osterøy Bridge, SBT received the harshest criticism in the report. Especially a trip made by Chairman Harry Herstad and his wife to San Francisco to participate at a conference was criticized, as it cost the toll company NOK118,000. Also annual board member fees of NOK200,000 and excessive trips for the board were commented as wasted money. The internal audit concluded with that there were costs of NOK300,000 in 2002 and 2003 which were not properly documented or were not used in line with regulations. The report {{was rejected by the}} board, who claimed that several of the issues were misunderstandings and that the <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> was using the report in a campaign to establish a state-run toll collection agency. Øyvind Halleraker withdrew as managing director of SBT and as chairman of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association in January 2005. He was at the time also member of parliament for the Conservative Party.|$|E

5|$|Surveys {{of traffic}} {{patterns}} on Bømlo were undertaken by Hordaland <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> in 1984. Based {{on it and}} other feedback, the agency stated that it preferred a pontoon bridge between Foldrøyholmen and Sørstokken, north of the ferry between Bømlo and Stord. It was estimated to cost NOK190 million, in addition to auxiliary roads for NOK40 million. In 1982, plans were launched for a fixed link to the mainland further south, which would include a bridge over Digernessundet, a causeway and low bridge across Spissøysundet and a low bridge over Gassasundet. In addition, a tunnel {{would have to be}} built from Føyno to Sveio. This proposal was similar to the finalized Triangle Link. In 1985, an all-tunnel proposal, following the same route, was proposed. Hordaland <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> stated that the proposals were unrealistic. The limited company Ytre Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap AS (SBT) was founded in October 1986 by the municipalities of Bømlo, Stord, Fitjar and Sveio, Hordaland County Municipality and five banks.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link {{was passed}} by the various {{municipal}} councils in February and March 1988. Hordaland <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council. They recommended that collection start on 1 July 1990, but this was not immediately supported by the government.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood held up by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E

5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train. This was rejected because buses were not able to give the comfort and reliability of a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration.</b> Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, 8,000 people {{commuted}} between Sotra and Bergen, and {{the bridge}} {{had an average}} daily traffic of 22,000 vehicles. On National Road 555 between Straume, the municipal center of Fjell, and Storavatnet, where National Road 555 becomes a motorway, there are long queues during rush hour. The Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> has proposed a four-lane motorway along National Road 555 from Stoavatnet to Straume. This will require a new crossing across Knarreviksundet. Such a motorway extension is estimated to cost between NOK3 and 4 billion, {{and the government has}} allocated NOK400 million in National Transport Plan 2010–2019 for the project. It is presumed that most of the project will be financed as a toll road.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the automobile in Belgium from 1895 onwards brutally disrupted the traditional social order on the roads, transforming social practices and the order of society from the mundane—the everyday use of transport—to the more rarified—urban planning {{and the use of}} public space. In this article, we will deal with the earliest history of motorization in Belgium. We will analyze motorization as a process of interaction between a specific set of social actors, and focus on its outcome: modern traffic policy as a conflict management strategy.

For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{crossing}} {{arose in}} the 1960s; and until the 1990s proposals were for a pontoon bridge further north. The Stord Bridge was conceived after the decision to combine the crossing with the Bømlafjord Tunnel. The project was resisted both by local environmental groups and the Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration,</b> the latter because the new plans would delay completion. Construction was undertaken by a joint venue between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Construction started in 1999 {{and was the first}} bridge in Norway to have the cables spun on-site.

They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line.

30|$|Not {{least in}} the Scandinavian countries, the various levels of <b>public</b> <b>road</b> <b>administration</b> have {{introduced}} procedures that afford the user some influence over the planning and shaping of the road transport system [2]. For example, Scandinavian <b>road</b> <b>administrations</b> have developed forms of organization and working methods in which users are regarded as market “customers” [3] and transport planners have the task of creating knowledge about how users want the road transport system to be designed. This information then forms {{the basis for the}} goals set for the operations as whole and for how the road transport system is designed. This change, noted at all the Scandinavian <b>road</b> <b>administrations,</b> is part of a wider international reform among government authorities whereby market thinking is applied to the public service sector in order to increase user influence. The concept of New Public Management (NPM) encompasses some of these reforms. 1 One of the leading principles of NPM is that “customers” are expected to take part by deciding what services should be provided and how that is to be achieved [6]. The “customers” range of choices when it comes to transport systems is limited, however, and they can rarely take part in actual decisions. Instead, their wishes are collated and interpreted by transport planners. It is therefore important to study the methods that transport planners use to produce knowledge about the users, because it is with them that much of the organizational conceptualization and information about the users are shaped. To {{the best of our knowledge}} there are few such studies.|$|R
