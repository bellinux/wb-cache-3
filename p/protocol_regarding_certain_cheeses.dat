40|$|Recently, the Internet {{has become}} an {{essential}} business platform, aiding trading, distribution and sales between organisations, consumers and even between consumers themselves. This technology revolution has brought e-commerce to an entirely new level, which therefore has raised some new security issues. Security protocols in e-commerce are required to manage the transactions between buyers and sellers. In order to engage customers in e-commerce, these protocols should be well formulated and secured; they should protect both parties from fraudulent users and subsequently promote the growth of e-commerce. There are some protocols, known as fair exchange protocols, in e-commerce {{that are designed to}} guarantee fairness between the customer and the merchant so that neither party gains any advantage over the other. Therefore, in this paper, we review these protocols in detail. In addition, we present a survey of three fair exchange protocols based on online TTP from different application areas. In particular, we review these <b>protocols</b> with <b>regard</b> to <b>certain</b> properties, namely, fairness, correctness of product, customer's anonymity, timeliness and channel requirement...|$|R

40|$|During the {{ripening}} of <b>certain</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{a reddish}} or reddish-brown slimy growth often develops on the surfaces. The material contains various microorganisms, among which Bacterium linens usually {{is present in}} relatively large numbers.

Despite its probable importance in the ripening of various cheeses and its possible importance in other connections, Bact. linens has been investigated relatively little.

50|$|A common myth {{holds that}} turkey is {{especially}} high in tryptophan, resulting in sleepiness {{after it is}} consumed, as may occur at the traditional meal of the North American holiday of Thanksgiving. However, the tryptophan content of turkey is comparable to chicken, beef, and other meats and does not result in higher blood tryptophan levels than other common foods. Certain foods, such as soybeans, sesame and sunflower seeds, and <b>certain</b> <b>cheeses,</b> are high in tryptophan. Although it is possible these may induce sleepiness if consumed in sufficient quantities, this is not well-studied.|$|R
