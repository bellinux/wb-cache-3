5|$|The Main Stand covers {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} the length of the pitch, though the attached enclosure is longer, covering the whole distance. The Main Stand, which seats 4,277 fans, also contains the dressing rooms, club offices and television gantry, {{as well as a number}} of supporting pillars, a car park and the Nick Owen and Eric Morecambe suites. To the Main Stand's right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand, is the David <b>Preece</b> Stand, a family area which seats 711 spectators. The David <b>Preece</b> Stand acquired its present name in 2008, a year after the former player's death.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Main and <b>Preece</b> Stands are 25 {{executive}} boxes, {{which have}} an attached net to catch balls directed {{over them and}} a total capacity of 209. The Bobbers Stand stood here until 1986, when the seats {{were removed from the}} stand and replaced with the boxes.|$|E
5|$|The David <b>Preece</b> Stand {{was erected}} in 1991, simply called the New Stand on construction. The final {{improvements}} to the ground came in 2005, when {{the conversion of the}} Kenilworth Stand was finally completed to bring the capacity to its present 10,356.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} players left the club {{following}} the end of the 2005–06 season. Senior players John Anderson, who had been assistant manager to Paul Trollope during his spell as caretaker manager the previous year, Ali Gibb, Jon Bass and Christian Edwards were released, while Jamie Forrester moved to Lincoln City on a free transfer. Also leaving the club were a number of younger players who had failed to earn extensions to their contracts. These were Mark <b>Preece,</b> Matt Thorne, Ben Willshire and goalkeepers Ryan Clarke and Martin Horsell.|$|E

5|$|A serious {{incident}} involving hooliganism before, {{during and after}} a match against Millwall in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, Conservative MP David Evans, to introduce a scheme effective {{from the start of}} 1986–87 banning all visiting supporters from the ground, and requiring home fans to carry identity cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for 1990–91, and grass a year later. The David <b>Preece</b> Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand to an all-seater was completed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|He spent £200,000 on striker Andy <b>Preece,</b> {{and also}} brought in young defender Jason Lydiate and goalkeeper Steve Banks for the 1995–96 campaign. Blackpool {{finished}} third, {{missing out on}} automatic promotion {{on the last day}} of the season, and were beaten in the play-off semi-finals by Bradford City. They had won 2–0 away at Valley Parade, only to lose 3–0 in the return leg at Bloomfield Road. Chairman Owen Oyston, while he was in a prison cell, sacked Allardyce shortly after the play-off defeat. Allardyce then had a brief spell on the coaching staff under Peter Reid at Sunderland, working as director of the academy.|$|E
5|$|Revolution held {{a casting}} session at a studio called The Spotlight (in Leicester Square in London), in which {{multiple}} parts were auditioned for by multiple actors. Originally, Nico was {{planned to be}} voiced by a native French speaker, {{to get the right}} accent; however, she ended up being voiced by Sarah Crook, a native English speaker. The rest of the credited voice actors were Alison Pettit, Andrew Secombe, Bob Golding, Jay Benedict, John Bull, Laurence Bouvard, Peter Marinker, Rachael Rogers, Rachel <b>Preece,</b> Simon Treves, and Seamus O'Neil.|$|E

5|$|After Prince died in 1899 he was {{replaced}} by the Reverend John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. Around 1890, Smyth-Pigott again started leading meetings of the community and recruited 50 young female followers to supplement the ageing population of Agapemonites. He took Ruth Anne <b>Preece</b> as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he will claim that he was a god another time, which did come true as in the life time of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god. After the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he claimed again being god and was sentenced to death and died.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{needed to}} get past five rounds to reach the showpiece event at Wembley. Both clubs made {{comfortable}} progress; Luton scored 14 goals and conceded three, Arsenal {{on the other hand}} conceded two fewer. Luton for the final were without Darron McDonough who injured himself in training, but David <b>Preece</b> and Ricky Hill both returned to the side after lengthy periods of treatment. Goalkeeper Les Sealey was not fit in time to play, so Andy Dibble deputised in goal for only his sixth appearance of the season. Gus Caesar replaced David O'Leary in Arsenal's starting eleven, as the Irishman was ruled out for the final having damaged his achilles weeks prior.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} by helicopter, taking over from 2nd Battalion, US 38th Infantry Regiment. <b>Preece</b> immediately instituted {{a program of}} twenty-four-hour dispersed patrolling, and within two days this had succeeded in reducing the level of Viet Cong activity against the road construction. Two platoons of American M48 Patton tanks were also moved into the area, patrolling by day with the Australian armoured personnel carriers, while securing the laterite pit at night. Several contacts took place and by 22 February the Australians began to suspect that a major attack on them was being planned, noting that they were now facing Main Force elements. In the early morning of 23 February three Viet Cong soldiers were killed in an Australian ambush, while several others were wounded but escaped. The dead soldiers were well equipped with new AK-47 assault rifles and webbing, and they were identified as being from 761st Main Force Regiment. Also captured was a large quantity of ammunition, rations and medical supplies. Later that night a North Vietnamese engineer officer was also killed in a separate ambush, adding further weight to the Australian suspicions. As dawn broke the next day, two half-platoon ambushes from B Company, 1 RAR—under the command of Major Ian McFarlane—engaged two squads of Viet Cong Main Force. <b>Preece</b> immediately warned Glotzbach of an imminent attack, and then informed Sargent that the Australians were moving {{to set up a}} defensive position, recommending that the engineers relocate in order to join them.|$|E

5|$|The 10,356 {{capacity}} all-seater {{stadium is}} in the Bury Park area of Luton, and named after the road that runs along one end of it, although the official address of the club is 1 Maple Road. Opposite the eponymous Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which has evolved from a stand first used exclusively by Luton supporters, then later by away supporters, and now used by both except in times of high ticket demand from away clubs. The Main Stand is flanked by the David <b>Preece</b> Stand, and opposite them stands a row of executive boxes. These boxes replaced the Bobbers Stand in 1986, as the club sought to maximise income.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex <b>Preece.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Preece</b> {{moved to}} push his other {{companies}} around each flank of D Company, and towards the battalion's original blocking position. Soon they were also in contact with small groups of Viet Cong from positions behind trees and in bunkers, while others popped up from spider holes and tunnel entrances; it became apparent to the Australians that they had stumbled across a significant Viet Cong force in extensive fortifications, sufficient to hold a battalion. B Company, {{under the command of}} Major Ian McFarlane, also uncovered a small dug-in hospital with simple transfusion equipment, documents and bandages. Meanwhile, the remaining battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade had also been inserted. The 1st Battalion, US 503rd Infantry Regiment flew into LZ April at 12:00, while US 2/503rd Battalion arrived at LZ May at 14:30. With the insertion going largely according to plan, the brigades began their advance eastwards. Converging on the suspected location of the communist headquarters, a thorough search of the area yielded little, and it was believed that the Viet Cong had withdrawn earlier in response to the initial Australian advance.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} North Devon {{line was}} signalled using disc and crossbar signals. With a considerable network in Devon now open or in course of completion, there were greatly increasing traffic volumes, and the LSWR decided to modernise the signalling. On 1 October 1873 {{most of the}} stations from Copplestone to Umberleigh were equipped with semaphore signals and block instruments using <b>Preece's</b> three wire system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Preece's</b> posthumous {{memoir of}} her life with Spencer (earlier written with Louise Collis) was {{published}} by Heinemann in 1972 as Stanley Spencer: A Private View. The painful intricacies of the Preece-Spencer-Carline relationship became the subject in 1996 of a play by the feminist playwright Pam Gems. Titled Stanley, it played at the National Theatre and, later, on Broadway. It won the Olivier Best New Play award for 1997.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1919, Reynell and Preston {{shared an}} {{exhibition}} of paintings and pottery at <b>Preece’s</b> Gallery in Adelaide, which was just becoming established as a center of the city's cultural life. In his opening address, the governor of South Australia expressed the then-common view {{that he did not}} understand the modern style of art, while agreeing that [...] "the work now exhibited is certainly the work of great artists." ...|$|R
5|$|Minor actions {{continued}} into the night, with small groups of Viet Cong able to pop up undetected and then disappear at will from within the Australian defensive position. The searching units were unable to locate Viet Cong in large numbers but experienced {{a significant number of}} sudden engagements and ambushes throughout the day, and {{it became clear that the}} communists were using tunnels for movement and concealment. <b>Preece</b> suspected that the area was honeycombed with tunnels and that the communist headquarters that he had been tasked to destroy was in fact located beneath the feet of the battalion. The Australians were the only battalion in the US 173rd Brigade to strike significant resistance, and by the end of the first day 1 RAR had suffered a total of three killed and 15 wounded, while the artillery Forward Observer from 105 Field Battery had also been killed. The battalion spent a sleepless night and in the early hours of the morning there were a number of short exchanges of fire as small groups of Viet Cong returned to the area. Not wanting to fire the machine-guns for fear of giving their positions away or hitting friendly troops, the Australians resorted to using grenades forward of the perimeter. Meanwhile, in the US 3rd Infantry Brigade area of operations contact had been light, with only six Viet Cong killed.|$|E
25|$|James <b>Preece,</b> catechist, {{arrived in}} 1830 and in December 1833 {{he worked with}} John Morgan to {{establish}} the Puriri Mission; and continued at that mission into the 1840s.

50|$|In September 2011, he {{received}} a wildcard to participate at the Shanghai Masters, but could not advance to the first round as he lost 5-1 against Fergal O'Brien. In December, he won the World Amateur Snooker Championship by defeating Lee Walker 10-9 in the final. He won the title {{at the age of}} 17 years and 81 days, which made him the youngest ever winner of the tournament, breaking Ian <b>Preece's</b> record.|$|R
25|$|Almost all of <b>Preece's</b> matches for Worcestershire came in {{the period}} between 1920 and 1924. Although he played quite {{regularly}} during this period, he never had more than moderate success, his highest season's aggregate of wickets being 42 (at 30.11) in 1920. He claimed five wickets in an innings on four occasions, {{the best of these}} being the 7-35 he achieved against Essex at Leyton in 1921. It was to prove in vain, however: Essex, having been bowled out for 90 in their first innings, reached 560 in their second and won by 132 runs.|$|R
5000|$|Collection system {{managers}} {{are asked to}} specify the capabilities of their assets. <b>Preece's</b> ontology focuses on ISTAR sensors, but also considers HUMINT, OSINT and possible methodologies.
