40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether, from {{a health}} provider and patient perspective, surgical stabilisation {{of the spine}} is cost effective when compared with an intensive programme of rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: 349 patients randomised to surgery (n = 176) or to an intensive rehabilitation programme (n = 173) from 15 centres across the United Kingdom between June 1996 and February 2002. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs related to back pain and incurred by the NHS and patients up to 24 months after randomisation. Return to paid employment and total hours worked. Patient utility as estimated by using the EuroQol EQ- 5 D questionnaire at several time points and used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost effectiveness was expressed as an incremental cost per QALY. RESULTS: At two years, 38 patients randomised to rehabilitation had received rehabilitation and surgery whereas just seven surgery patients had received both treatments. The mean total cost per patient {{was estimated to be}} 7830 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (SD 5202 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling)</b> in the surgery group and 4526 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (SD 4155 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling)</b> in the intensive rehabilitation arm, a significant difference of 3304 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (95 % confidence interval 2317 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> to 4291 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling).</b> Mean QALYs over the trial period were 1. 004 (SD 0. 405) in the surgery group and 0. 936 (SD 0. 431) in the intensive rehabilitation group, giving a non-significant difference of 0. 068 (- 0. 020 to 0. 156).

METHODS: An economic evaluation undertaken alongside a randomised controlled trial of first eye cataract surgery in secondary care ophthalmology clinics. A sample of 306 women over 70 years old with bilateral cataracts was randomised to cataract surgery (expedited, approximately four weeks) or control (routine, 12 months wait); 75 % of participants had baseline acuity of 6 / 12 or better. Outcomes included falls and the EuroQol EQ- 5 D. RESULTS: The operated group cost a mean <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 2004 (bootstrapped) more {{than the control group}} over one year (95 % confidence interval (CI), <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 1363 to <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 2833) (p> 0. 001), but experienced on average 0. 456 fewer falls, an incremental cost per fall prevented of <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 4390. The bootstrapped mean gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient was 0. 056 (95 % CI, 0. 006 to 0. 108) (p> 0. 001). The incremental cost-utility ratio was <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 35 704, above the currently accepted UK threshold level of willingness to pay per QALY of <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 30 000.

One possible model of care to meet demand is patient self-management (PSM), beneficial to patients who need control over their condition. This study aimed to determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of PSM of anticoagulation compared with routine clinic-based care for patients receiving long-term anticoagulation. A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial; 617 patients were recruited and followed up for 12 months. There {{was no significant difference}} in mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between groups - after adjusting for baseline, the mean difference in QALYs was 0. 009 (95 % CI, - 0. 012 to 0. 030).

5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E

5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Approximately 110, 000 {{people in}} the United Kingdom are {{affected}} with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). At least 75 per cent are undiagnosed. Treatment with statins is effective but effective primary prevention requires early diagnosis. The best strategy to achieve this is unclear. This paper compares {{the costs and benefits}} over a 10 year period of two strategies found in our previous modelling: population screening of 16 -year-olds or tracing family members of affected patients. METHODS: Computer modelling of time-limited data was conducted. The number available for screening and the potential new cases in England and Wales aged 16 - 54 years were estimated. The costs (of screening and treatment) and benefits (deaths averted) that might be accrued over 10 years were assessed. RESULTS: Screening 16 -year-olds results in 470 new diagnoses, and over 10 subsequent years averts 11. 7 deaths at a cost of 6, 176, 648 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling,</b> giving a cost per case identified and treated of 13, 141 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (including a 10 year drug cost of 1, 584, 918 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling).</b> By contrast, screening first-degree relatives of known uases results in 13, 248 new diagnoses, 560 deaths averted over 10 years, at a cost of 46, 430, 681 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> giving a cost per case identified and treated of 3, 505 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (including 10 year drug cost of 44, 645, 760 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling).</b> The cost per death averted would be 3, 187 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Although the two approaches appear similar in cost-effectiveness over a lifetime, the shorter-term (10 year) cost-effectiveness clearly favours family tracing.

5|$|Royal emblems {{depicting}} lions {{were first}} {{used by the}} Norman dynasty, later a formal and consistent English heraldry system emerged {{at the end of}} the 12th century. The earliest surviving representation of an escutcheon, or shield, displaying three lions is that on the Great Seal of King Richard I (1189-1199), which initially displayed one or two lions rampant, but in 1198 was permanently altered to depict three lions passant, perhaps representing Richard I's principal three positions as King of the English, Duke of the Normans, and Duke of the Aquitanians. In 1340, Edward III laid claim to the throne of France, and thus adopted the Royal arms of France which he quartered with his paternal arms, the Royal Arms of England. Significantly he placed the French arms in the 1st and 4th quarters of greatest honour, signifying the feudal superiority of France over England (The King of France was the feudal overlord of the Duke of Aquitaine). This quartering was adjusted, abandoned and restored intermittently throughout the Middle Ages as the relationship between England and France changed. When the French king altered his arms from semée of fleur-de-lys, to only three, the English quartering eventually followed suit. After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland entered a personal union, the arms of England and Scotland were marshalled (combined) in what has now become the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. It appears in a similar capacity to represent England in the Arms of Canada and on the Queen's Personal Canadian Flag. The coat of three lions continues to represent England on several coins of the <b>pound</b> <b>sterling,</b> forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (although with altered tinctures) and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{gold standard}} {{was established in}} 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion. France, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Japan each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The {{early years of the}} Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on gold reserves in the United Kingdom {{to such a degree that}} the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and Sweden abandoned gold. Following widespread bank failures and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over Prime Minister Léon Blum's government.|$|E

Major electronic databases were searched from their inception to August 2003; and updated from January 2003 to July/August 2004. Databases were searched for studies that met the criteria and selected data were extracted and evaluated. Studies were assessed for their relevance to the UK context and the revie cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ] in the base case ranged from <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 380, 000 to <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 476, 000 per QALY, depending on genotype. Univariate sensitivity analyses examined ERT not restoring full health, more severe disease progression in the untreated cohort, and only treating the most severely affected patients. These produced ICERs of approximately <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 1. 4 million, <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 296, 000 and <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 275, 000 per QALY, respectively. The base-case unit cost of the drug is <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 2. 975. The unit cost would have had to be reduced ten-fold, to <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 0. 30, to obtain an ICER of <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 30, 000 per QALY. At a unit cost of <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 1 the ICER would be <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> 120, 000 per QALY. Although ERT for treating the 'average' Gaucher's disease patient exceeds the normal upper threshold for cost-effectiveness seen in NHS policy decisions by over ten-fold, some argue that since orphan drug legislation encouraged the manufacture of Cerezyme, and Gaucher's disease can be defined as an orphan disease, the NHS has little option but to provide it, despite its great expense. More information is required before the generalisability of the findings can be determined. Although data from the UK have been used wherever possible, these were very thin indeed. Nonetheless, even large errors in estimates of the distribution of genotype, genotype [...] phenotype associations, effectiveness and numbers of patients will not reduce the ICER to anywhere near the upper level of treatments usually considered cost-effective. Further research could help to clarify the many uncertainties that exist. However, although doing so will be of clinical interest, it is questionable whether, within the current pricing environment, such research would have any substantive impact on policy decisions. It is highly improbable that, whatever the findings of such research, the ICER could be brought down by the orders of magnitude required to make ERT an efficient use of health service resources. (The possible exception to this would be investigating the most efficient alternative treatment strategies for using ERT in a paediatric population only.) Moreover, if under equity considerations for orphan diseases the NHS feels it is important to provide this drug, regardless of its cost-effectiveness, then refining the precision of the ICER estimate also becomes superfluous...|$|R
