5|$|However, when {{a country}} is {{suffering}} from high unemployment or wishes to pursue a policy of export-led growth, a lower exchange rate {{can be seen as}} advantageous. From the early 1980s the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed devaluation as a potential solution for developing nations that are consistently spending more on imports than they earn on exports. A lower value for the home currency will raise the price for imports while making exports cheaper. This tends to encourage more domestic production, which raises employment and gross domestic product (GDP) – though the effect may not be immediate due to the Marshall–Lerner condition. Devaluation can be seen as an attractive solution to unemployment when other options, like increased public spending, are ruled out due to high public debt, or when a country has a balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficit</b> which a devaluation would help correct. A reason for preferring devaluation common among emerging economies is that maintaining a relatively low exchange rate helps them build up foreign exchange reserves, which can protect against future financial crises.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{direct impact on}} the UK economy, air {{transport}} is an £11.4billion industry, a figure which represents 1.1 per cent of the country’s economy. It employs 186,000 people (full-time equivalents), and indirectly supports an additional 334,000 jobs, although the inclusion of indirect employment as an economic benefit of air transport is disputed. In terms of productivity the aviation industry in 2004 was the third most productive, after the oil/gas extraction and utilities sectors, exceeding the national average {{by a factor of}} two and a half. The industry is also very capital intensive, accounting for up to 3.5 per cent of total UK business investment in the period 2000 to 2004. Air transport was directly responsible for £3.6billion in tax and national insurance contributions in 2004/5, which includes £0.9billion raised in Air Passenger Duty (APD), a figure set to double after APD rates were doubled in February 2007. Because of the global nature of the industry, article 15 of the Chicago Convention effectively prevents the imposition of fuel duty on aviation, and the industry does not pay Value Added Tax (VAT). Environmental groups argue that these, along with duty-free sales, are iniquitous tax concessions valued at £9billion annually. Despite generating £6.9billion in exports in 2004, representing 3 per cent of all UK exports and 7 per cent of the total export of services, the patronage in the UK of air transport services provided by overseas airlines resulted in a £3.3billion balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficit</b> attributable to the industry.|$|E

25|$|In 1960 Robert Triffin, Belgian American economist, {{noticed that}} holding dollars was more {{valuable}} than gold because constant U.S. balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficits</b> helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth.

But incurring such <b>payment</b> <b>deficits</b> also meant that, over time, the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability.|$|R

Dollars flowed out through various U.S. aid programs: the Truman Doctrine entailing aid to the pro-U.S. Greek and Turkish regimes, which were struggling to suppress communist revolution, aid to various pro-U.S. regimes in the Third World, and most important, the Marshall Plan. From 1948 to 1954 the United States provided 16 Western European countries $17 billion in grants.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{upon the}} {{creation}} of Bretton Woods, with the U.S. producing half of the world's manufactured goods and holding half its reserves, the twin burdens of international management and the Cold War were possible to meet at first. Throughout the 1950s Washington sustained a balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficit</b> to finance loans, aid, and troops for allied regimes. But during the 1960s the costs of doing so became less tolerable. By 1970 the U.S. held under 16% of international reserves. Adjustment to these changed realities was impeded by the U.S. commitment to fixed exchange rates and by the U.S. obligation to convert dollars into gold on demand.|$|E

25|$|Callaghan {{introduced}} his next Budget on 4 May. He had informed {{the house that}} he would bring a full Budget to the House {{when he made his}} 'little budget' speech prior to the election. The main point of his budget was the introduction of a Selective Employment Tax, penalising the service industry and favouring the manufacturing industry. Twelve days after the budget, the National Union of Seamen called a national strike and the problems facing Sterling were multiplied. Additional strikes caused the balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficit</b> to increase and the 3.3billion loan was now due. Unemployment was also rising; it had been just over 300,000 when Labour came to power, but two years later it was climbed to more than 500,000.|$|E

It was a tough election, but Labour won a narrow majority, gaining 56 seats (a total of 317 to the Conservatives' 304). The new Labour government under Harold Wilson immediately faced economic problems and Wilson acted within his first hours to appoint Callaghan as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new government {{had to cope with}} a balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficit</b> and speculative attacks on Sterling. It was the policy of the whole government, and one in which Callaghan concurred, that devaluation should be avoided {{for as long as possible}} and he managed to arrange loans from other central banks and some tax rises to stabilise the economy. Callaghan's time as chancellor was to be during a time of crisis; with high inflation, high unemployment and an unstable economy with a deficit in the budget, a deficit in the balance of import and exports and most importantly conflict over the value of the pound.|$|E

40|$|The US posts a {{large and}} growing deficit in {{international}} telephone services, a phenomenon often blamed on the accounting rate system. Using data for international calls between the US and 148 foreign destinations between 1991 and 1997, this paper finds that the increasing <b>payment</b> <b>deficit</b> for the US is associated with decreasing accounting rates. In other words, the international revenue settlement is related more to imbalances in telephone traffic than to accounting rates. The econometric model shows that growing asymmetries in teledensity, market concentration, and income levels between the US {{and the rest of}} the world explain the imbalances.

Callaghan steadily moved towards the right, but maintained his reputation as [...] "The Keeper of the Cloth Cap" [...] – that is he was seen as dedicated to maintaining close ties between the Labour Party and the trade unions. Callaghan's period as Chancellor of the Exchequer coincided with a turbulent period for the British economy, during which he had to wrestle with a balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficit</b> and speculative attacks on the pound sterling (its exchange rate to other currencies was almost fixed by the Bretton Woods system). On 18 November 1967, the government devalued the pound sterling. Callaghan became Home Secretary.

2500|$|The United States enjoys many {{benefits}} because the dollar {{serves as the}} international reserve currency. The United States could not face a balance of payments crisis as American debts are denominated in dollars, thus the Federal Reserve could simply print more dollars. [...] In other words, the United States cannot suffer a debt crisis, per se, but would instead face an inflation crisis. The cost of producing a dollar to the United States is simply the cost of printing the note, whereas a foreign government must provide a dollar’s worth of goods for that dollar; {{the difference between these}} two values is called seigniorage and its benefits go directly to the American government. [...] Further, the United States dollar's position in the world allows the American federal government to borrow money at exceptionally low interests rates due to high demand for the dollar.

2500|$|While {{the overall}} BoP {{accounts}} will always balance when {{all types of}} payments are included, imbalances are possible on individual elements of the BoP, such as the current account, the capital account excluding the central bank's reserve account, or {{the sum of the}} two. [...] Imbalances in the latter sum can result in surplus countries accumulating wealth, while deficit nations become increasingly indebted. [...] The term balance of payments often refers to this sum: a country's balance of payments is said to be in surplus (equivalently, the balance of payments is positive) by a specific amount if sources of funds (such as export goods sold and bonds sold) exceed uses of funds (such as paying for imported goods and paying for foreign bonds purchased) by that amount. There {{is said to be a}} balance of <b>payments</b> <b>deficit</b> (the balance of payments is said to be negative) if the former are less than the latter. A BoP surplus (or deficit) is accompanied by an accumulation (or decumulation) of foreign exchange reserves by the central bank.|$|E
