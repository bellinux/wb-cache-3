40|$|Nitrifier {{denitrification}} (i. e. nitrite reduction by ammonia oxidizers) {{is one of}} the biochemical pathways of {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) production. It is increasingly suggested that this pathway may contribute substantially to N 2 O production in soil, the major source of this greenhouse gas. However, although monoculture studies recognize its potential, methodological drawbacks prohibit conclusive proof that nitrifier denitrification occurs in actual soils. Here we suggest and apply a new isotopic approach to identify its presence in soil. In incubation experiments with 12 soils, N 2 O production was studied using oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) isotope tracing, accounting for O exchange. Microbial biomass C and N and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) patterns were analysed to explain potential differences in N 2 O <b>production</b> <b>pathways.</b> We found that in at least five of the soils nitrifier denitrification must have contributed to N 2 O production. Moreover, it may even have been responsible for all NH 4 +-derived N 2 O in most soils. In contrast, N 2 O as a by-product of ammonia oxidation contributed very little to total production. Microbial biomass C and N and PLFA-distinguished microbial community composition were not indicative of differences in N 2 O <b>production</b> <b>pathways.</b> Overall, we show that combined O and N isotope tracing may still provide a powerful tool to understand N 2 O <b>production</b> <b>pathways,</b> provided that O exchange is accounted for. We conclude that nitrifier denitrification can indeed occur in soils, and may in fact be responsible for the greater proportion of total nitrifier-induced N 2 O production...|$|R

The NuDIST technique for flammability scores calculation is used in the case study. Ranking between the <b>productions</b> <b>pathways</b> involved was calculated by considering all chemicals in the route as a mixture instead of individual components. Aside from that, mass fractions of the chemicals involved were used as weightage factor {{in order to determine the}} main contributors to the largest hazards in the process route. Four biodiesel <b>production</b> <b>pathways</b> were used as case study. According to the inherent safety assessment done, the acid-catalyzed transesterification using fresh vegetable oil (PP 4) pathway is the most hazardous route with the highest assessment score of 15. 59 while the enzymatic transesterification using fresh vegetable oil (PP 2) pathway is the safest route with the lowest assessment score of 1. 39 in term of flammability parameter. The case study shows that the amount of chemicals existed in the process as well as their flammability characteristic, plays an important roles in determining the main contributors to the largest hazards in the route. In this work, mass fractions for every chemical were used as the weightage factor which helps in identifying the main contributors to hazards with more accuracy. A chemical with high flammability score but existed in low amount in the process might not be as hazardous as a chemical with low flammability score but existed in huge amount in the process as shown by methyl oleate and methanol in the base-catalyzed transesterification using fresh vegetable oil (PP 3) ...|$|R

40|$|Five {{activated}} sludge models describing N 2 O production by ammonium oxidising bacteria (AOB) {{were compared to}} four different long-term process data sets. Each model considers {{one of the two}} known N 2 O <b>production</b> <b>pathways</b> by AOB, namely the AOB denitrification pathway and the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway, with specific kinetic expressions. Satisfactory calibration could be obtained in most cases, but none of the models was able to describe all the N 2 O data obtained in the different systems with a similar parameter set. Variability of the parameters can be related to difficulties related to undescribed local concentration heterogeneities, physiological adaptation of micro-organisms, a microbial population switch, or regulation between multiple AOB pathways. This variability could be due to a dependence of the N 2 O <b>production</b> <b>pathways</b> on the nitrite (or free nitrous acid-FNA) concentrations and other operational conditions in different systems.

Sustainability is expressed by three main factors: efficiency in (Process) Energy Returned On Invested (P) EROI, carbon footprint in Global Warming Potential GWP(100), and environmental impact in EcoPoints. The green gas <b>production</b> <b>pathway</b> operates on a mass fraction of 50 % feedstock with 50 % manure. The sustainability of the analyzed feedstocks differs substantially, favoring biomass waste flows over, the specially cultivated energy crop, maize. The use of optimization, {{in the shape of}} internal energy production, green gas powered trucks, and mitigation can significantly improve the sustainability for all feedstocks, but favors waste materials. Results indicate a possible improvement from an average (P) EROI for all feedstocks of 2. 3 up to an average of 7. 0 GJ/GJ The carbon footprint can potentially be reduced from an average of 40 down to 18 kgCO(2) eq/GJ. The environmental impact can potentially be reduced from an average of 5. 6 down to 1. 8 Pt/GJ. Internal energy production proved to be the most effective optimization. However, the use of optimization aforementioned will result in les green gas injected into the gas grid as it is partially consumed internally. Overall, the feedstock straw was the most energy efficient, where the feedstock harvest remains proved to be the most environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, transport distances of all feedstocks should not exceed 150 km or emissions and environmental impacts will surpass those of natural gas, used as a reference. Using green gas as a fuel can increase the acceptable transportation range to over 300 km. Within the context aforementioned and from an {{energy efficiency}} and sustainable point of view, the anaerobic digestion process should be utilized for processing locally available waste feedstocks with the added advantage of producing energy, which should first be used internally for powering the green gas production process.

30|$|The {{yields and}} productivities {{that can be}} {{achieved}} from the degradation of a specific substrate are adjusted such that ATP gain and thermodynamic efficiency are optimal for the respective growth conditions. Although the thermodynamic efficiency of ATP synthesis through acetate <b>production</b> <b>pathways</b> was reported to be higher in C. pasteurianum (85 %) than the efficiency of acetate <b>production</b> <b>pathways</b> (63 %), butyrate was always produced suggesting an incompatibility of high efficiency with the entropy requirements of the cells (Thauer et al. [1977]). In addition, reducing equivalents are formed simultaneously in the form of reduced NADH during the formation of biomass (via the oxidation of glycerol), since glycerol has a higher degree of reduction per carbon than the cell mass (CH 1.9 O 0.5 [*]N 0.2). In this case, the ability of the microorganism to maintain an overall redox balance would also be relevant to its ability to produce a product more reduced than glycerol by the consumption of the reducing equivalents (Nakamura and Whited [2003]). When compared with sugars, such as glucose, this degradation to pyruvate generates twice the number of reducing equivalents. Regeneration of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) requires the formation of a more reduced end-product, such as 1, 3 -PDO, to serve as an electron sink (Nakamura and Whited [2003]; Clomburg and Gonzalez [2013]).|$|R

The measured actual O incorporation from H 2 O into N 2 O (AOI) was compared with the theoretical maximum O incorporation (MOI) from various scenarios that differed in their assumptions on the presence of O exchange. We found that scenarios where O exchange was assumed to occur exclusively during denitrification could not explain the observed AOI, as it exceeded the MOI for 9 out of 10 soils. This demonstrates that additional O exchange must have occurred in N 2 O <b>production</b> through nitrifier <b>pathways.</b> It remains to be determined in which steps of these pathways O exchange can take place.
