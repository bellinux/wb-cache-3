40|$|The SMAD 4 gene {{codes for}} cell-signaling {{proteins}} that prevent abnormal vascular growths. DNA <b>palindromes</b> are inversely proportional sequences that play roles in gene expression through {{the formation of}} stem-loops and disease/tumor detection. Previous research approximated that there were 100 <b>palindromes</b> in every 1000 base pairs of a randomly generated sequence. A Java program was written to mutate fasta sequences based on ARUP’s SMAD 4 database, information from NCBI, and random locations and another was written to find <b>palindromes</b> in the DNA sequences and output their lengths. These lengths were plotted sequentially using the Mathematica software. By measuring shifts in each mutated plot superimposed on the wild type plot, the number of pixels shifted between peaks was recorded and, using a scale which {{was measured to be}} 12 pixels per 100 <b>palindromes,</b> converted into the number of <b>palindromes</b> deleted. The amount of base pairs (bp) deleted was proportional to the amount of <b>palindromes</b> deleted. The relationship between bp and <b>palindromes</b> is described by the equation p=round(- 0. 242996 + 0. 425309 *l) such that p represents the number of <b>palindromes</b> and l represents the length of a sequence. This linear regression shows that <b>palindromes</b> are evenly distributed throughout the SMAD 4 gene assuming the distribution follows a Poisson distribution. Out of every 1000 bp, there are approximately 420 <b>palindromes</b> in the SMAD 4 mRNA which is approximately 475 <b>palindromes</b> in SMAD 4 ’s Primary Assembly genomic region. The SMAD 4 gene exhibits 275 (137. 5 %) more <b>palindromes</b> than the randomly generated palindromic distribution projected by previous research. Finding the distribution of <b>palindromes</b> in RNA molecules can lead to future research and classification of key regions that determine the shape of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures...|$|R

25|$|The Sixteen Kingdoms were a {{collection}} of numerous short-lived sovereign states in northern China and its neighboring areas (304-439), founded after the Jin Dynasty lost {{the northern part of}} their territory and were confined to their former southern territory, thus chronologically overlapping the end of the Jin Dynasty and the actual establishment of the full Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 to 589). One noted poet of this era, somewhere in the fourth century, was Su Hui, a poet of the Former Qin state (351-394), which unified northern China, in 376. Typically, for female poets of this time and place in history, almost all of her literary works are lost. Her sole surviving piece is of the huiren shi (<b>palindrome</b> poem) genre.|$|E

500|$|In {{anticipation}} of the band's appearance at the 1992 Lollapalooza tour, a limited edition of Badmotorfinger was released on June 23, 1992 with a second disc containing the EP Satan Oscillate My Metallic Sonatas (or SOMMS). The title is a <b>palindrome.</b> This EP includes three covers, an unreleased original song, and a live version of [...] "Slaves & Bulldozers". For its cover of Black Sabbath's [...] "Into the Void", the original lyrics are replaced by words of protest by Chief Seattle (also known as Sealth), which fit the meter of the song. At the 1993 Grammy Awards, [...] "Into the Void (Sealth)" [...] received a nomination for Best Metal Performance.|$|E
500|$|The album {{marked the}} first {{conscious}} effort by John Linnell and John Flansburgh to branch out of their early sound, opting for more traditional rock rhythms and fuller arrangements. The duo adopted a backing band with live drums during the supporting tour. It was their last album recorded as a duo, and the band expanded to include a regular rhythm guitarist, bass player, and saxophone player for their subsequent releases. Apollo 18 also includes the [...] "Fingertips" [...] suite, a series of twenty-one songs, each under thirty seconds long. The album generated three singles, [...] "The Statue Got Me High", [...] "The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)" [...] and [...] "I <b>Palindrome</b> I", although only the first charted.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Dig My Grave" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Parry Gettelman of the Orlando Sentinel as [...] "an angry, fuzzed-out rocker". The vocals for the track were recorded through a guitar fuzz-box in order to distort them. [...] "I <b>Palindrome</b> I", is the final single that was released to promote Apollo 18. [...] The circular nature of the song's lyrical themes is reinforced by its title and use of palindromes. In fact, the song is notable for featuring a word-by-word <b>palindrome</b> in one of the verses: [...] "'Son, I am able', she said, 'though you scare me.' 'Watch', said I. 'Beloved", I said, 'watch me scare you, though.' Said she, 'Able am I, son.'" [...] "She's Actual Size" [...] was written by Flansburgh after he contemplated the imagery of someone viewing a departing person in a mirror; he felt that the symbolism was a [...] "really succinct way of talking about leaving somebody behind". The band later expressed disappointment with the [...] "definitive" [...] version featured on this album, largely because the song continued to develop as the band played it live. Flansburgh called the album version [...] "timid" [...] and noted that [...] "later performance versions of [...] have so much more spirit than the recorded version." [...] Although Linnell and Flansburgh usually write songs individually, [...] "My Evil Twin" [...] was an example of the two collaborating. Linnell wrote the musical structure of the song, rendering it as a MIDI file, and Flansburgh then wrote the melody and the lyrics. [...] "Mammal" [...] discusses various members of the titular vertebrate class, and, according to Linnell, poetically explores the fact that all mammals have hair {{at some point in their}} lifespan. According to Linnell, most of the scientific information in the song was gathered from an encyclopedia.|$|E

40|$|We look at {{sex-limited}} chromosome (Y or W) evolution {{with particular}} emphasis {{on the importance of}} <b>palindromes.</b> Y chromosome <b>palindromes</b> consist of inverted duplicates that allow for local recombination in an otherwise nonrecombining chromosome. Since <b>palindromes</b> enable intrachromosomal gene conversion that can help eliminate deleterious mutations, they are often highlighted as mechanisms to protect against Y degeneration. However, the adaptive significance of recombination resides in its ability to decouple the evolutionary fates of linked mutations, leading to both a decrease in degeneration rate and an increase in adaptation rate. Our paper emphasizes the latter, that <b>palindromes</b> may exist to accelerate adaptation by increasing the potential targets and fixation rates of incoming beneficial mutations. This hypothesis helps reconcile two enigmatic features of the “palindromes as protectors” view: (1) genes that are not located in <b>palindromes</b> have been retained under purifying selection for tens of millions of years, and (2) under models that only consider deleterious mutations, gene conversion benefits duplicate gene maintenance but not initial fixation. We conclude by looking at ways to test the hypothesis that <b>palindromes</b> enhance the rate of adaptive evolution of Y-linked genes and whether this effect can be extended to <b>palindromes</b> on other chromosomes...|$|R

500|$|Much of Garage Mahal {{was written}} on the road, while touring, and as such had a {{different}} sound from the band's prior work. Most of the writing was done in two places; Mount Macedon in Victoria, and <b>Palindrome</b> Studio in Venice Beach, California, the home of producer Fred Maher. Mixing was done by David Way and Mike Shipley. Despite the change in sound, the band were still seen as purely a pop band—Australian Musician magazine claimed this was because they {{spent too much time}} overseas. Gary Glauber of PopMatters praised the album, noting it had not lost the quality of its predecessor, although it was a good deal heavier. Glauber reported on the overall high quality of songs, noting that [...] "almost any of these songs could work as a single", and calling the lyrics of [...] "Creepin' Up Slowly" [...] "perpetually catchy". Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald said that the band did not hold back in their aim for American radio, calling the lyrics overly generic, and arguing the band only focused on their mainstream image.|$|E
500|$|The opera {{begins with}} a martial-sounding toccata for {{trumpets}} which is repeated twice. When played on period wind instruments the sound can be startling to modern audiences; Redlich calls it [...] "shattering". Such flourishes were the standard signal for the commencement of performances at the Mantuan court; the opening chorus of Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers, also composed for Gonzaga's court, employs the same fanfare. The toccata acted as a salute to the Duke; according to Donington, {{if it had not}} been written, precedent would have required it to be improvised. As the brass sound of the toccata fades, it is replaced by the gentler tone of the strings ritornello which introduces La musica's prologue. The ritornello is repeated in shortened form between each of the prologue's five verses, and in full after the final verse. Its function within the opera as a whole is to represent the [...] "power of music"; as such it is heard at the end of act 2, and again at the beginning of act 5, one of the earliest examples of an operatic leitmotiv. It is temporally structured as a <b>palindrome</b> and its form of strophic variations allows Monteverdi to carefully shape musical time for expressive and structural purposes in the context of seconda prattica.|$|E

Parks conducted his orchestrations at Studio B in the Capitol Studios complex. Wainwright and Brion did not always get along, the latter admitting to The New York Times: [...] "Rufus had all these beautiful songs but every time the vocals would kick in, he'd write some complicated keyboard part so you couldn't hear them.

Similar to Christgau, Robbins called the lyrics throughout the album [...] "whimsy", and said that they were not too complex to weigh down melodies. Robbins also praised the album's eclecticism, observing that Turn Around' mimics Forties swing; the funky bass groove of 'The Guitar' interpolates a rewrite of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', fetchingly sung by Laura Cantrell.
