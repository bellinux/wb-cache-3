5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E

Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop in Cork in 1961.

50|$|Home {{mortgage}} burnings, {{and particularly}} home mortgage burning parties, are nearly {{unheard of in}} the present-day United States for a few reasons. American families are increasingly mobile, {{and it is now}} much less likely that a homeowner will be in a home long enough to make enough monthly payments to fully satisfy a mortgage. Also, starting {{in the late twentieth century}} and until the housing bubble burst, it was fairly common to get an over-leveraged mortgage, and possibly even an interest-only mortgage, that was intended to eventually be flipped to another mortgage by presumed increasing home value as opposed <b>paying</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> via a long series of payments. That, and the refinancing of homes to take advantage of fluctuating interest rates, often leads to refinancing and “resetting the clock” on a mortgage period, lengthening the time that one is subject to a mortgage beyond the period of the original mortgage taken upon purchase of the home.|$|R
