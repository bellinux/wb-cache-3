40|$|For centuries dikes in the Netherlands {{have been}} {{protected}} against wave attack by revetments constructed of <b>pitched</b> <b>blocks.</b> Due to {{new insights into}} the behaviour of <b>pitched</b> <b>blocks</b> and increased hydraulic boundary conditions, a significant part of those dikes does not meet the current prescribed standards and safety norms anymore. As a result, large parts have to be reinforced in the coming years. The main failure mechanism of a placed block revetment is uplifting due to water overpressures. This happens when the upward pressures, caused by a hydraulic head difference over the revetment, exceed the dead weight of the structure. The concrete elements are lifted up and the waves subsequently induce erosion of the dike body. Therefore, the renovation of these revetments is currently done by adding more weight to the structure by covering the block revetment with large rocks, or even completely replacing the elements by bigger concrete blocks. In view of the large renovation areas, replacing the concrete elements is a time consuming process and will require considerable financial efforts. Therefore, innovative refurbishment techniques are desired and researched. A relatively new type of revetment is the polyurethane bonded aggregate (PBA) which consists of aggregate glued by the adhesive polyurethane (PU) and is currently marketed under the brand name Elastocoast. This study focuses on the use of PBA in strengthening pitched stone revetments. In this report an effort is made to describe the mechanical behaviour of refurbished block revetments under wave loading. A PBA refurbishment layer adds coherence to the revetment and will prevent the blocks from uplifting. Another notable advantage is its high permeability. Firstly, an analytical model was elaborated to gain a first general insight into the structural behaviour of a composite PBA/block revetment. In the analytical model, the interaction and stress distribution between the revetment and subsoil were modelled as an elastically supported beam (Winkler model). Furthermore the structure was modelled with a finite element package. Although this research is based on multiple assumptions, it is possible to formulate some qualitative statements that resulted from this study. 9 ̆ 5 The findings suggest that a rigid connection between the PBA layer and the existing block revetment is most effective in reducing the bending stresses in the PBA layer. 9 ̆ 5 The results of this study support furthermore the idea that the composite PBA/block revetment could be schematized as an Euler Bernoulli bending beam. 9 ̆ 5 The findings also indicate that the current design method is conservative. In this design method it is assumed that only the PBA cover layer contributes to the flexural strength of the structure. The results of this thesis indicate that this design approach is conservative and therefore resulting in thick PBA layers. 9 ̆ 5 Lastly, two conventional refurbishment techniques (Open Stone Asphalt (OSA) and hydraulic asphalt concrete) were compared with the PBA. Calculations were performed what the most effective approach would be. On the one hand, an impermeable cover layer constructed by asphalt concrete resulting in higher water pressures but increasing its dead weight (asphalt concrete), or on the other hand, applying a permeable refurbishment layer (PBA and OSA) which is less heavy but resulting in lower water overpressures. The results suggest that it is more effective to use a less heavier but more permeable material as a refurbishment than the other way around. It must be noted that this greatly depends of its permeability. If its leakage length is increased by clogging or when applying the refurbished material, it results in a significant increase of the maximum bending stresses. In this case the refurbishment techniques with asphalt concrete becomes more effective since it is heavier. Structural EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Human short-radius {{centrifugation}} (SRC) {{is being}} investigated as a volume-efficient means of delivering intermittent doses of "artificial gravity" to counter the deleterious effects of long exposures to weightlessness. Rotation rates on short radius centrifuges are high to provide the needed g-loading, and therefore entail a variety of unusual vestibular stimuli when certain head movements are made. Since these movements can elicit inappropriate nystagmus, illusions of tumbling, and motion sickness, efforts {{have been made to}} adapt people to the stimuli. So far these efforts have been successful in showing that people will adapt to at least one plane of head motion, the yaw (transverse) plane, during supine head-on-axis rotation. However, astronauts must be adapted to all planes of head motion if they are to function normally on the centrifuge. If adaptation to yaw head turns transferred to some extent to pitch (sagittal) plane turns, or any other plane of motion, it would greatly simplify and hasten the adaptation process. To investigate if transfer of adaptation across planes is possible, 10 subjects in the Experimental Group performed a sufficient number of yaw plane head turns to demonstrate adaptation. Adaptation was indicated by decreases in metrics of the off-axis vestibuloocular reflex induced by the head turns, and by subjective ratings of illusory motion. A <b>block</b> of <b>pitch</b> movements was performed before and after the yaw movements, and these two <b>pitch</b> <b>blocks</b> were compared to assess how much adaptation to pitch head turns had taken place. The same procedure was followed on a subsequent day. A Control Group of 10 subjects performed only the <b>blocks</b> of <b>pitch</b> turns, and their adaptation was compared to the adaptation to pitch turns measured in the Experimental(cont.) Group. While both Control and Experimental Groups showed statistically significant signs of adaptation to pitch head turns, we failed to find any significant differences between the amounts of adaptation. If true, this result implies that adaptation to SRC may need to be performed one plane of motion at a time. Additionally, it implies that the brain and vestibular system does not build up a generalized model of SRC stimulation, but rather builds adaptation one input at a time. by Ian Garrick-Bethell.

Although the set of stimuli tones remained the same throughout the experiment, task <b>blocks</b> alternated between <b>pitch</b> and spatial comparisons. For example, during <b>pitch</b> comparison <b>blocks,</b> participants were instructed to report whether the second stimulus was higher, lower, or equal in pitch relative to the first pitch, regardless of the two tones spatial locations. Conversely, during spatial comparison blocks, participants were instructed to report whether the second tone was leftward, rightward, or equal in space relative to the first tone, regardless of tone pitch. This task was used in two experiments, one utilizing fMRI and one ERP, to gauge the spatial and temporal properties, respectively, of 'what' and 'where' auditory processing. Comparing the pitch and spatial judgements revealed increased activation in primary auditory cortices and right inferior frontal gyrus during the pitch task, and increased activation in bilateral posterior temporal areas, and inferior and superior parietal cortices during the spatial task.

In order to realize the highest achievable data storage capabilities, {{there is a need for}} better control of the magnetic media microstructure, particularly in terms of minimizing grain size and grain boundary thickness distributions. In this work, a guided magnetic media growth is attempted by creating a pre-fabricated template with a specific material and morphology. The template is designed in such a way that, when magnetic media consisting of the magnetic alloy and segregant are sputtered, the sites on the template result in a controlled two-phase growth of magnetic media. The template is fabricated using self-assembling block copolymers, which can be used to fabricate nanostructures with a regular hexagonal lattice of spheres of one block in the other’s matrix. These are then used as etch-masks to fabricate the template. In this thesis, we describe the approach used to fabricate these templates and demonstrate the two-phase growth of magnetic recording media. In such an approach, the magnetic grain size is defined by the uniform <b>pitch</b> of the <b>block</b> copolymer pattern, resulting in a uniform microstructure with much better grain size distribution than can be obtained with conventional un-templated media growth. The templated growth technique is also a suitable additive technique for the fabrication of Bit Patterned Media, another potential next-generation technology wherein the magnetic bits are isolated patterned islands. Combining nanoimprint lithography with templated growth, we can generate a long range spatially ordered array of magnetic islands with no etching of the magnetic material...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years the author had the {{opportunity}} to work in partnership with international researchers in order to investigate on case law issues often affecting negatively the outcome of planning applications for Gypsy and Traveller sites in the UK and other European countries. These research activities took place during a two-year European funded project with the title Wor(l) ds which Exclude (WE). The author and her team in the UK had carried out visits to various sites; reports and recommendations have been written in relation to the latest developments in the planning framework which also regulates the construction of pitches for Gypsy and Traveller users in its special supplement. Some changes emerged after Law Court hearings and relevant decisions referring to accommodation arrangements for Gypsy and Traveller Communities. Although these arrangements were often established after consultation between local authorities and communities involved, rejections of planning applications were often based upon strong disagreements amongst members of local communities and neighborhoods in proximity of proposed new pitches. According to Gypsy and Traveller culture toilets, showers and kitchens should not be integral parts of their mobile homes and caravans; all these facilities should be grouped mainly in blocks of facilities (or blocks of facility rooms) according {{to the size of the}} site. Because of certain local petitions though opposing the size and view of caravans and facilities inside the <b>pitches,</b> the facilities’ <b>blocks</b> do not provide enough space and equipment for water uses and drainage. The researchers had the opportunity to visit some sites providing facilities and accommodation and interviewed the inhabitants of the sites. It was also found that often rejections of extensions to planning applications of previously approved temporary sites for Gypsy and Traveller people, when challenged to the law courts, were hardly successful mainly because of planning inspectors and local residents’ preconceptions on these groups’ unsanitariness (not enough use of water) or, strange enough, because of overflows and waste of water during so-called extremely dirty works, such as recycling processes in pitches. In reality, the European Law Courts often found that rejections occurred because of local communities’ misconception on water uses in services attached to the accommodation pitches. The main question should be what the title of this paper is asking, so that the groups interested could get swift and competent answers. The research findings in the UK were compared with solutions and findings in other partner European countries participating in the WE project and an interactive website was created for ongoing discussions and dissemination of best practice activities and projects...|$|R

The catcher must avoid hitting the batter-runner with the thrown ball, implying that he must move to a position in which he has a clear throw to the infielder at first base. Guarding home plate on plays in which a baserunner attempts to score a run. The catcher is often obliged to catch a ball thrown from a fielder and to tag out a runner arriving from third base. Naturally, the runner's objective, in this situation, is to elude the catcher's tag and touch the plate. Prior to 2014, the catcher's best strategy was to block the runner's path so as to prevent the runner from reaching the plate at all. Collisions between runners and catchers were common. Since the start of the 2014 season, a catcher may only obstruct a runner's path to home plate when he, the catcher, is in possession of the ball. Without the ball in hand, the catcher must allow the runner to score uncontested. If the catcher drops the ball while tagging the runner, the runner is safe. Although contact between a runner and a catcher was generally allowed in the major leagues until the beginning of the 2014 season, little league, high school, and college runners are encouraged or mandated to avoid significant contact.Preventing stolen bases by throwing to second base or third base to allow an infielder to tag a baserunner attempting to reach the base. A catcher who is very good at preventing stolen bases is said to have a low stolen-base percentage; a poor one has many bases stolen while he catches. (A pitcher who is slow to deliver is often more at fault for stolen bases than the catcher is.) Ideally, a catcher {{should be able to get}} the ball from his glove to that of the player covering second base in under two seconds. This is referred to as a catcher's [...] "pop time", the time elapsing between the popping sound of the pitch striking the catcher's mitt and the similar pop when the ball arrives at the glove of the fielder covering second base.Rarely, a catcher can make a successful pick-off throw to a base to surprise an inattentive or incautious baserunner. Especially at the higher levels of baseball (where this play almost never results in an out), the catcher's snap throws are mainly for psychological effect. If the runner knows that the catcher often attempts snap throws, the runner is likely to take a smaller lead from his base before each pitch, which will allow the infielders an extra fraction of a second to throw the runner out at the next base if he attempts to advance (as, for example, when a ground ball is hit). Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals and former MLB catcher Iván Rodríguez are known for using pickoffs with success, particularly at first base. Teams may sometimes call a deliberate play, the pitchout, wherein the pitcher intentionally throws the ball wide and high to the catcher, who comes out of his crouch to receive it and relays the ball quickly to a base to put a runner out.Rarely, a catcher will run to first base or third base to participate in rundown plays at those bases.In certain game situations, typically a ball batted to the shortstop or third baseman with no runners on base, the catcher may be expected to back-up first base in case the first baseman misses or mishandles a throw.In certain game situations, when a runner is on first and the batter bunts the ball or hits the ball softly, which causes the third baseman to rush in to get the ball and throw to first base, the catcher must cover third base so that the runner from first base does not advance to third base on the play and this then forces the third baseman to cover home plate.|$|R
