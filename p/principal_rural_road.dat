The information derived from the study reported in this paper is based on scientific data and provides an objective assessment of the wet road skid resistance performance of this material. This paper seeks to establish the wet road frictional resistance of stone mastic asphalt surface courses laid in a county in England during the period 1999 to 2004. The change in skid resistance with time is examined together with the texture of the material to assess its suitability for use on the <b>rural</b> <b>principal</b> <b>road</b> network.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Rural</b> <b>roads</b> {{are very}} {{cardinal}} to the socio-economic {{development of the}} rural population. They enhanced increased agricultural production, facilitate access to educational and health facilities and provide spatial interaction among rural communities. However, in Nigeria, the condition of <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> is pathetic. More than 70 % of <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> network is in deplorable condition, which is due partly to inadequate finance, weak technical know-how of personnel, the use of heavy equipment, official corruption and most importantly lack of political will by the government or its agencies. The consequences are disruption of socio-economic activities of the rural inhabitants. Therefore, the adoption of Labour- Based Approach which is participatory in nature and utilizes local knowledge and initiatives as well as requiring little resources could be the panacea to the protracted deplorable and deteriorating condition of <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> in the country. The approach will not only {{improve the quality of}} life of the rural populace through the creation of job opportunities for the teeming rural population and lowering of transport cost, it will also ensure the sustainable maintenance of <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> in the country. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{number and}} {{severity}} of <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> crashes {{has been shown to}} decrease with reduced traveling speed. One method of reducing the traveling speed on <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> is to reduce the speed limit of those roads. Despite the considerable road safety benefits resulting from reduced speed limits, public opposition to the change exists. One of the main concerns of the public is the increase in travel times associated with a reduction in speed limit. In South Australia the default rural speed is 100 kph, however many undivided <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> in the state are signposted at 110 kph. This study quantifies this increase in travel time on an arbitrary <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> in South Australia if the signposted speed limit was replaced with the defult speed limit of 100 kph. A Markov model of travel time on an undivided <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> is developed. The model includes factors such as vehicle speed distributions, passing lanes, traffic congestion, and speed advisory signs. Real data collected on South Australian <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> that have had a similar reduction in speed limit are used to define the distribution of speeds of vehicles before and after the change in speed limit. The model shows that an increase in travel time is expected, however this increase is less than is first predicted by considering only the allowed speed limit. J. K. Dutschke, J. E.
