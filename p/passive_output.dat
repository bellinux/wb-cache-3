We focus on the special case where only the <b>passive</b> <b>output</b> is changed (while retaining the original input) and subsequently define a general class of new passive outputs for the PHSD.

40|$|Passivity in {{physical}} systems is a restatement of energy balancing, and therefore is a ubiquitous property in engineering applications. Under some weak conditions, the unique equilibrium state of passive systems is stable. However, to ensure asymptotic stability, strict output passivity and a detectability property are required. Although strict output passivity may be enforced via a damping injection that feeds back the <b>passive</b> <b>output,</b> this signal may be noisy or unmeasurable — the paradigmatic example being velocity in mechanical systems. In this paper a sampled integral stabilization (SIS) technique for the asymptotic regulation of passive systems, that requires only {{the knowledge of}} the time integral of the <b>passive</b> <b>output</b> — i. e. position in mechanical systems — is proposed.

40|$|This paper first {{addresses}} the question when a given (possibly nonlinear) RGLC circuit can be rewritten as a port-Hamiltonian (PH) system—with state variables the inductor currents and capacitor voltages {{instead of the}} fluxes and charges, respectively. The question has an affirmative answer for a class of circuits that fulfills a certain regularity condition. This class includes circuits where all dynamic elements are linear, and the associated resistors and conductors are passive—though possibly nonlinear. Interestingly, the resulting Hamiltonian function is related with the circuits instantaneous reactive power associated with the inductors and capacitors. This novel circuit representation, called a reactive port-Hamiltonian description, naturally suggests {{a new set of}} non–standard <b>passive</b> <b>outputs,</b> which are shown to be useful for the design of reactive power compensation schemes.

The control problem in these systems is challenging, especially with gravity coupling and large deformations, because of inherent under actuation {{and the combination}} of lumped and distributed parameters of a nonlinear system. In this paper we consider an ultra-flexible inverted pendulum on a cart and propose a new nonlinear energy shaping controller to keep the pendulum at the upward position with the cart stopped at a desired location. The design {{is based on a}} model, obtained via the constrained Lagrange formulation, which previously has been validated experimentally. The controller design consists of a partial feedback linearization step followed by a standard PID controller acting on two <b>passive</b> <b>outputs.</b> Boundedness of all signals and (local) asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium is theoretically established.

40|$|A {{technique}} that provides closed loop integral action {{depending on the}} <b>passive</b> <b>outputs</b> of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems is already available. This paper addresses a new method {{that allows us to}} add integral action also on system variables having relative degree higher than one, while still preserving the Hamiltonian form and, thus, closed loop stability. The new approach is applied to design speed regulation controllers for the permanent magnet synchronous motor. Closed loop stability and asymptotic rejection of unknown piecewise constant load torques are formally proved. This theoretically predicted control system performance is illustrated via simulation experiments, which also show that the properties hold under parameter uncertainties. This is in line with the usual practice of including integral action in a controller with the aim of improving its closed loop robustness. The fact that the method enhances the range of possible integral actions in the controller, enriched with this robustness property, allows us to assess it as a practically important complement to the well-known interconnection and damping assignment techniques developed in the framework of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{negative}} imaginary and counter-clockwise {{systems have}} attracted attention as an interesting class of systems, which is well-motivated by applications. In this paper first the formulation and extension of negative imaginary and counter-clockwise systems as (nonlinear) input-output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation is summarized. Next it is shown how {{by considering the}} time-derivative of the outputs a port-Hamiltonian system is obtained, and how {{this leads to the}} consideration of alternate <b>passive</b> <b>outputs</b> for port-Hamiltonian systems. Furthermore, a converse result to positive feedback interconnection of input-output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation is obtained, stating that the positive feedback interconnection of two linear systems is an input-output Hamiltonian system with dissipation if and only if the systems themselves are input-output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation. This implies that the Poisson and resistive structure matrices can be redefined {{in such a way that}} the interaction between the two systems only takes place via the coupling term in the Hamiltonian of the interconnected system. Subsequently, it is shown how network interconnection of (possibly nonlinear) input-output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation results in another input-output Hamiltonian system with dissipation, and how this leads to a stability analysis of the interconnected system in terms of the Hamiltonians and output mappings of the systems associated to the vertices, as well as the topology of the network.
