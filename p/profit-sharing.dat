5|$|During the war it {{had become}} clear that private {{patronage}} {{was no longer a}} practical means of sustaining Britain's musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest budget for public subsidy. The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the <b>profit-sharing</b> principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the players, and the offered subsidy was declined.|$|E

Two auction rules are considered: standard first-price and <b>profit-share</b> auctions, supplemented by entry fees. Since non-merged firms benefit from a merger if the synergies are low, bidders are subject to a positive externality. Nevertheless, pooling does not occur; and the <b>profit-share</b> auction is strictly more profitable than the first-price auction, regardless of whether firms observe the synergy parameter or only the winning bid before they play the oligopoly game. ...|$|R

5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller <b>profit-sharing</b> deals would also begin to collect their cut.|$|E
5|$|The crisis {{point for}} the UERL was the need to redeem the five-year <b>profit-sharing</b> secured notes on 30 June 1908. The UERL {{did not have the}} money. Speyer unsuccessfully tried to persuade the London County Council (LCC) to inject £5million into the UERL and used some of his own bank's money to pay-off disgruntled {{shareholders}} threatening bankruptcy proceedings. Eventually, Speyer and Gibb managed to obtain agreement from the shareholders to convert the notes into long-term debt to be repaid in 1933 and 1948.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a <b>profit-sharing</b> agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

50|$|By 1978, BCal had fully {{recovered}} from the 1974 crisis year, which had threatened its very existence at that time. After the severe contraction forced upon it by the early 1970s' oil crisis, the company's core scheduled operation was growing again with new widebodied aircraft and routes being added and schedules being expanded. Business was booming with planes being fuller {{than at any time}} in the firm's history. The airline recorded a pre-tax profit of £12.2 million during its 1977/78 financial year to 31 October 1978. This translated into a £10 million retained profit. It was the company's best financial result since its formation back in November 1970. BCal's senior management decided to allocate £644,000 of the retained profit to a new <b>profit-share</b> scheme to reward its staff for their hard work, and as an incentive for the future. BCal's <b>profit-share</b> scheme, which began the following year, was one of the first of its kind in the UK airline industry.|$|R
5|$|Cominco's president, Selwyn G. Blaylock, was cautious. There {{might be}} no post-war demand for heavy water, and the patent {{on the process}} was held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a <b>profit-sharing</b> {{agreement}} would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 for plant modifications. There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock {{had a meeting with}} the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided to find another source of heavy water. Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir Edward Beatty. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The heavy water project became known as the P-9 Project in October 1942.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company grew {{quickly in}} the 1940s and 50s, {{especially}} in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities like San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, {{as well as in}} Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's <b>profit-sharing,</b> executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war the LSO had to face new competition. The BBC SO and the LPO {{had survived}} the war intact, the latter, {{abandoned}} by Beecham, as a self-governing body. All three were quickly overshadowed by two new orchestras: Walter Legge's Philharmonia and Beecham's Royal Philharmonic (RPO). To survive, the LSO played in hundreds of concerts of popular classics under undistinguished conductors. By 1948 the orchestra was anxious to resume promoting its own concert series. The players decided to accept the Arts Council's conditions for subsidy, and changed the LSO's constitution to replace <b>profit-sharing</b> with salaries. With a view to raising its playing standards it engaged Josef Krips as conductor. His commitments in Vienna preventing him from becoming the LSO's chief conductor until 1950, but from his first concert with the orchestra in December 1948 he influenced the playing for the better. His chosen repertoire was good for the box office: cycles of Beethoven symphonies and concertos (the latter featuring Wilhelm Kempff in one season and Claudio Arrau in another) helped restore the orchestra's finances as well as its musical standards. With Krips and others the orchestra recorded extensively for the Decca Record Company during the early 1950s. The orchestra's workload in these years was second only to the other self-governing London orchestra, the LPO: the LPO played 248 concerts in the 1949–50 season; the LSO 103; the BBC SO 55; the Philharmonia and RPO 32 each. When the Royal Festival Hall opened in 1951 the LSO and LPO engaged in a mutually bruising campaign for sole residency there. Neither was successful, and the Festival Hall became the main London venue for both orchestras and for the RPO and Philharmonia.|$|E

40|$|I am {{grateful}} to Jeffrey Bernstein for helpful discussions. This paper has also benefited from discussions with Irv Emmons, Neil Langland and staff members at numerous public service commissions. The usual caveat applies. A growing concern {{on the part of}} regulators is that price regulation may weaken incentives for investment in service quality. Participation by the firm in complementary, competitive markets may serve to temper this incentive. This analysis reveals that unlike revenue-share penalties that can [actually] reduce investment in quality, and <b>profit-share</b> penalties that can distort efficient levels of cost-reducing effort, information dissemination increases investment in quality without distorting the regulated firm’s efficient investment in cost-reducing effort. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{variable}} pay schemes (VPS) appears to threaten collective approaches to pay determination, {{which are based}} on standardization and centralization. This article utilizes case study research to analyse the still little-known relationship between collective bargaining and VPS. It focuses on the retail banking sector, where trade union representation and collective bargaining remain relatively robust. The research identifies an emergent process whereby the growth of bonus schemes has both supplanted collective <b>profit‐share</b> and permitted greater standardization of merit‐pay awards. Unions have therefore achieved some success in terms of limiting variation in base pay, {{at the same time as}} the overall purchase of collective bargaining on employee earnings has diminished. The factors contributing to this development are explained. ...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{characteristics}} of individual crowdfunding practices and drivers of fundraising success, where entrepreneurs can tailor their crowdfunding initiatives better than on standardized platforms. Our {{data indicate that}} most of the funds provided are entitled to receive either financial compensations (equity and <b>profit-share</b> arrangement) or nonfinancial benefits (final product and token of appreciation), while donations are less common. Moreover, crowdfunding initiatives that are structured as nonprofit organizations tend to be significantly more successful than other organizational forms in achieving their fundraising targets, even after controlling for various project characteristics. This finding is in line with theoretical arguments developed by the contract failure literature which postulates that nonprofit organizations may fund it easier to attract money for initiatives that are of interest for the general community due to their reduced focus on profits...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the effectiveness}} of the current Croatian regional fiscal policy in terms of its potential effects on stimulating economic growth in the war-affected regions. It is investigated whether sector (production vs. services), firm size, and the after-tax profit affect the investment behaviour in terms of the profit share re-investment. We estimate single and multigroup structural equation models treating firm size and re-investment behaviour as latent variables. The result suggest significant differences between production and service sector firms, and also some differences between firms of different sizes in respect to their re-investment tendencies. Namely, we find the relationship between the latent size normalised to net profit and re-investment share most pronounced among small and medium production firms, while such effect was not found for service sector and large firms. The results suggest that the enterprise size and sector do affect <b>profit-share</b> re-investment and that a more efficient fiscal policy could be designed by differently treating firms of different sectors and sizes...|$|R
5000|$|Individual bonuses {{can range}} from a few {{thousand}} to {{tens of millions of}} dollars, pounds or euros, payable in cash or less obvious forms including pension funds, shares, options, <b>profit-shares</b> and assets derived from the bank's transactions. A variable performance-related bonus is often the substantial part of a senior banker's contractual remuneration; thus they effectively work for a share in the net profits (but not net losses) for which they are responsible, with a relatively small fixed salary. Such bonuses are payable under contract, rather than at discretion; nevertheless the amount of a contractual bonus usually depends on some subjective assessment of the factors required to be taken into account. Individual bonus awards may be calculated by reference to complex formulae combining personal, departmental, corporate, group or share price performances against targets; additional adjustments may be made for factors such as [...] "guaranteed bonuses" [...] often agreed for the early stages of a new employment or venture, loyalty bonuses, or [...] "smoothing" [...] in years where an individual outperforms the bank as a whole. In case of disagreement, especially on resignation, the proper basis of contractual bonus assessment, even if to some extent discretionary, can be negotiated or litigated.|$|R
25|$|The initial {{intention}} of the Union {{was that it would}} support and promote the interests of worker co-operatives but, given the number and financial strength of the consumer co-operatives, these soon began to dominate the organisation.

The behavioural equations are used to estimate the injluences of various factors on the conventional demand deposits, conventional time deposits, Islamic demand deposits, Islamic time deposits, and Islamic investment deposits. The implications of the study are {{that the increase in}} real gross domestic product, interest rate stability, and an increase in the <b>profit-share</b> for savings and investments are important for maintaining and enhancing the development of Malaysian money deposits. The results show that all the models (conventional and Islamic banks deposits) are stable; however Islamic demand deposits and Islamic time deposits are more stable than conventional demand deposits and conventional time deposits, because their Chow tests valzres are smaller than those of conventional deposits. The findings of this study suggests that as shariah compliant deposits are more stable than their conventional equivalents, then this makes a run on deposits less likely, reducing the potential amount of capital adequacy cover needed...|$|R
