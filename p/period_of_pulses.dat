We obtain an exact periodic solution with substrate and prey. The stability analysis for this periodic solutions yields an invasion threshold for the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> of the predator. When the impulsive period {{is more than}} the threshold, there are periodic oscillations in the substrate, prey, and predator. If the impulsive period further increases, the system undergoes a complex dynamic process. By analyzing bifurcation diagrams, we can see that the impulsive system shows two kinds of bifurcation, which are period-doubling and period-halving.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the dc and pulsed current-induced electroresistance in phase separated manganite Nd 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 Mn 0. 95 Ni 0. 05 O 3 (NCMONi 05) {{as a function of}} temperature and magnetic field. It is shown that the negative differential resistance which appears above a threshold current (Ic) and hysteresis in the V-I progressively vanish with increasing period of the current pulses. However a strong non-linearity in V-I exists even for a pulse period of 6 s. The peak voltage at Ic decreases in magnitude and shifts towards higher current values with increasing strength of the magnetic field. The strong nonlinear behavior and the negative differential resistance in the dc current sweep are accompanied by a rapid increase of the sample surface temperature and therefore primarily arise from the Joule heating in the sample. While the Joule heating assists electroresistance in the high dc current regime, the nonlinearity in the pulsed current sweep and the resistivity switching between a high and low value induced by controlling the width and <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> can not be explained {{solely on the basis of}} Joule heating.

40|$|Pulsed {{electric}} fields (PEF) is a non-thermal processing {{technology that}} uses instantaneous, pulses of high voltage {{for a short}} period in the range of milliseconds to microseconds; the application of high intensity electric field on toasted wood chips leads to a quick diffusion of extractable molecules. Currently most PEF studies, in the field of oenology, have been focusing on the application of PEF as a pretreatment of grape musts by examining the microbial inactivation and the enhancement of polyphenol extraction. In this study a post-treatment of wine is introduced as method to enhance the wood flavor in the wine with a green noninvasive technology. Major phenolic aldehydes that have been identified as the characteristic compounds of oak volatile compounds were selected as markers and were analyzed instrumentally to compare the influence of PEF processing to non-treated samples. PEF treated samples brought about higher concentrations of the examined oak compounds in the samples treated with PEF, which may explain the advantages of its application. The modulation of the intensity of the electric field and the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> influenced the concentrations of the volatile phenols that were leached out.

30|$|Recently, {{vaccines}} {{are generally}} {{used to protect}} animals from Rift Valley Fever in endemic regions. Right now, two types of vaccines are available for susceptible animals to reduce amplification of the virus: inactivated whole-virus and live-attenuated Smithburn vaccines [16]. Inactivated vaccines {{can be applied to}} ruminants of all ages without causing abortions, but they are expensive, and repeated doses are required. In comparison, live-attenuated vaccines are cheap and effective since they confer a lifelong immunity with a single dose. But the undesirable side effects are obvious: they may lead to fetal abnormalities and abortions in pregnant ruminants, and there is the safety concern of reversion to virulence [17]. Based on this, Farida et al. [18] used the mathematical model to investigate RVFV among ruminants and considered continuous vaccination for animals and found that vaccination was efficient to reduce the loss of animals. We know, however, that the continuous vaccination is not practical in the reality living, and the control measures are only employed in the particular moment. So for this reason, infectious models with impulsive vaccination are concerned by more and more scholars. For example, Sabin [19] controlled successfully measles and poliomyelitis throughout Central and South America, and another example of successful application of this strategy is the U.K. vaccination action against measles in [20]. Using a SIR epidemic model, Shulgin et al. [21] showed that under a planned pulse vaccination region, the sate of model converges to a stable sate with which the size of infectious population is zero. This result shows that the pulse vaccination may lead to the eradication of infectious disease, provided that the magnitude of vaccination keeps a rational proportion and the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> is sustained. d’Onofrio [22] proposed a SEIR epidemic model based pulse vaccination strategy by which the local and global asymptotic stabilities of the periodic eradication solution are analyzed. More related research works on the dynamical behaviors of epidemic models with pulse vaccination also can be found in [23 – 27] and the references therein.|$|E
40|$|Long-periodic (LP) modulations of {{intensity}} of Saturnian Kilometric Radiation (SKR) recorded by RPWS instrument onboard Cassini spacecraft were studied {{by means of}} a combined data analysis algorithm based on a ”sliding window” Fourier (SWF) procedure and the nonlinearWigner-Ville (WV) method. The analyzed SKR data record covers the years 2004 - 2005. It has been found that SKR has well pronounced impulsive modulation, with quasi-periodic pulses appeared approximately each 10. 74 hours and having duration of about 5 hours. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses,</b> in spite of the overall stability, has sometimes the disturbances within the interval of 10. 74 - 10. 76 hours. By this, the whole impulsive modulation of SKR appeared in 2004 - 2005 in a form of quasi-regularly repeated modulation activity storms. Time interval between the adjacent modulation activity storms most often was within 8 - 13 days. Altogether, 55 impulsive modulation activity storms were registered during 2004 - 2005. Besides of the storms of 10. 7 h pulses, the intensity of SKR has several more long periodic modulations. In particular, ~ 6 - 7 days, ~ 8 - 9 days, ~ 12 - 13 days and ~ 25 - 27 days components were detected. These are connected probably with the quasi-regular character of the storms of 10. 74 h pulses. While the origin of 10. 74 hour pulses can be associated with the rotation of Saturn, the long periodic modulation features are very likely connected with the detected similar variations of the solar wind parameters. The last in their turn may be caused by the varying solar surface magnetic activity and rotating streams of high speed solar wind. Besides of that, the performed analysis shows that some Saturnian moons may also have influence on the intensity of SKR. In particular, specific modulations with periods corresponding to orbital motions of close moons (Enceladus, Tethys) as well as Titan, Hyperion and Dione were detected...|$|E

40|$|Plumes of {{bipropellant}} thrusters are {{a source}} of contamination. Small bipropellant thrusters are often used for spacecraft attitude control and orbit correction. Such thrusters typically operate in a pulse mode, at various pulse lengths. Quantifying their contamination effects onto spacecraft external surfaces is especially important for long-term complex-geometry vehicles, e. g. International Space Station. Plume contamination tests indicated the presence of liquid phase contaminant in the form of droplets. Their origin is attributed to incomplete combustion. Most of liquid-phase contaminant is generated during the startup and shutdown (unsteady) <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> thruster <b>pulse.</b> These <b>periods</b> are relatively short (typically 10 - 50 ms), and the amount of contaminant is determined by the thruster design (propellant valve response, combustion chamber size, thruster mass flow rate, film cooling percentage, dribble volume, etc.) and combustion process organization. Steady-state <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulse</b> is characterized by much lower contamination rates, but may be lengthy enough to significantly conh'ibute to the overall contamination effect. Because there was no standard methodology for thruster pulse time division, plume contamination tests were conducted at various pulse durations, and their results do not allow quantifying contaminant amounts from each portion <b>of</b> the <b>pulse.</b> At present, the ISS plume contamination model uses an assumption that all thrusters operate in a pulse mode with the pulse length being 100 ms. This assumption may lead to a large difference between the actual amounts of contaminant produced by the thruster and the model predictions. This paper suggests a way to standardize thruster startup and shutdown period definitions, and shows the usefulness of this approach to better quantify thruster plume contamination. Use of the suggested thruster pulse time-division technique will ensure methodological consistency of future thruster plume contamination test programs, and allow accounting for thruster pulse length when modeling plume contamination and erosion effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{coherence}} {{of the electron}} spin in a semiconductor quantum dot is strongly enhanced by mode locking through nuclear focusing, where the synchronization of the electron spin to periodic pulsing is slowly transferred to the nuclear spins of the semiconductor material, mediated by the hyperfine interaction between these.

For typical magnetic fields used in experiments, the energy scale of the nuclear Zeeman effect is {{comparable to that of}} the hyperfine interaction, so that it is not negligible. In this work, we analyze the influence of the nuclear Zeeman effect on mode locking quantitatively.
