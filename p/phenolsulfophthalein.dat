40|$|AbstractTo {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} histamine in the pathogenesis of post-ischemic reperfusion injury of tissues, the effect of diamine oxidase (DAO) was studied on the changes in renal functions induced by 30 min occlusion followed by reperfusion of the renal vessels of unilaterally nephrectomized rats. Kinetic analysis using radiolabeled albumin revealed that vascular permeability of the kidney increased markedly after reperfusion. Although the intensity of neutrophil-dependent chemiluminescence of the blood remained unchanged during the occlusion, it increased significantly after reperfusion. Histological examination revealed a marked degeneration of glomeruli and proximal tubules in the reperfused kidney. Transtubular transport of <b>phenolsulfophthalein</b> (PSP) decreased markedly after reperfusion with concomitant increase in plasma levels of creatinine. Intravenously administered DAO markedly inhibited the reperfusion-induced increase in vascular permeability, preserved {{the structure of the}} kidney and normalized the rate of clearance of PSP and creatinine. Combined use of diphenylhydramine and ranitidine also inhibited the reperfusion injury of the kidney. These results suggested that histamine and its receptors might play critical roles in post-ischemic reperfusion injury of the kidney...|$|E
40|$|The author {{have made}} {{a study on the}} renal {{function}} in 46 cases of bilateral renal tuberculosis by examining the fluid test and the blue excretion test; the Nephrectomia was performed in 14 cases of all; the fluid test, the blue excretion test, the quantity and the specific gravity of the urine were compared. The results were as followed: (1) Concerning the excretion ability, 56. 8 % of all showed normal (i. e., 15. 9 % were excellent, 40. 9 % were good) aud 43. 2 % were insufficient. In the concentration ability, 18. 1 % showed normal (i. e., 2. 2 % were excellent, 15. 9 % were good) and 81. 9 % were insufficient. These results were inferior to those observed in the unilateral renal tuberculosis. (2) In the <b>Phenolsulfophthalein</b> test, 22. 2 % showed the excretion level above 71 % in an hour. In the Indigocarmin excretion test, 57. 5 % showed unsatisfactory on both side. These results were also inferior to those of the unilateral cases. (3) In these examinations, the cases in which the operation was performed showed superior results than the cases in which the operation was not able to be performed. Concerning the results of these tests performed after the operation, the urine quantity was rather inferior to that of the unilateral cases and the specific gravity showed no difference, but the results of the fluid test and the colouring matter excretion test were superior to those of the unilateral cases. (4) No difference could be seen between the side of affection or the sex of the patients, but concerning the age of the patients, cases of younger generations showed somewhat superior results than that of older generations...|$|E
