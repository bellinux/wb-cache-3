50|$|The chestnut-bellied {{sandgrouse}} (<b>Pterocles</b> <b>exustus)</b> is {{a species of}} sandgrouse. They are found in sparse, bushy, arid land which is common in central and northern Africa, and southern Asia. Though they live in hot, arid climates, they are highly reliant on water. They {{have been known to}} travel up to 50 mi in one day in search of water. All species of sandgrouse that have been studied in habitat have proved to be entirely vegetarian throughout their lives, specialising in leguminous weed seeds and seldom eating grass seeds.|$|E
50|$|Birds: About 1,600 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) {{have been}} {{recorded}} from this site. According to Wetlands International (2002), 1% threshold of this species is 560; accordingly about 3% {{of the population is}} found at this IBA site. This site could also attract more than 20,000 birds, if fishing and other disturbances are curtailed during winter when most of the migrants are found in India. Beyond the cultivated areas, these waterbodies are surrounded by barren, rocky terrain. Consequently, dryland birds are also seen, such as the Indian courser Cursorius coromandelicus, chestnut-bellied sandgrouse (<b>Pterocles</b> <b>exustus),</b> yellow-wattled lapwing (Vanellus malabaricus) and Indian robin (Saxicoloides fulicata). The site falls in Biome-12, i.e. Indo-Gangetic plains, but species of Biome-11 are also sighted.|$|E
40|$|The type {{locality}} of <b>Pterocles</b> <b>exustus</b> Temminck, 1825, is 'West {{coast of}} Africa, Egypt and Nubia'. This is problematic because {{it includes the}} type locality of <b>Pterocles</b> <b>exustus</b> floweri (Nicoll, 1921), which is Fayum, Egypt. In the interest of clarification and to preserve stability of nomenclature, a non-Egyptian specimen from the type series of P. exustus is designated as lectotype of the taxon, and the type locality is restricted to Senegal...|$|E
