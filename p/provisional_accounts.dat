40|$|In this paper, I {{explore how}} postmodern ideas about gender may impact on clinicians working with gender variant {{children}} and adolescents. The postmodern turn has {{built on the}} feminist rejection {{of the idea of}} ‘essential’ gender, to further interrogate accepted conceptions of sex and gender and the stability of all identity categories. Some queer theorists have taken a further step, viewing all gender as fictional and artificial and celebrating the subversive potential of transgender identities. However, those working clinically with trans adolescents may experience a troubling tension between, on the one hand, a view of sex and gender categorisations as undecidable and fragmented (as postmodern theory suggests), and, on the other hand, the apparent need of many for a coherent and settled sense of self. In particular, how do we justify supporting trans youngsters to move towards treatment involving irreversible physical change, while ascribing to a highly tentative and <b>provisional</b> <b>account</b> of how we come to identify and live as gendered? I conclude that the meaning of trans rests on no demonstrable foundational truths but is constantly being shaped and re-shaped in our social world. Clinicians must be accountable in this process; far from succumbing to a paralysing relativism, the task for clinicians is to be highly attuned to our young clients’ complex narratives and to question our complex investments in the positions we adopt...|$|R
40|$|This {{volume is}} a <b>provisional</b> <b>account</b> {{of the origins}} and {{subsequent}} work of the Bureau of Sociological Research (BOSR) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL). This study was prepared {{at the request of}} Julia McQuillan, Chair of the UNL Department of Sociology and a past BOSR Director, for the 50 th anniversary celebration of the Bureau in April 2014. This study falls within the field known generally as “the sociology of sociology” and this accounts for the devising of a typology of sociologies that delineates the intellectual field of play historically occupied by the Bureau of Sociological Research at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Harriet Martineau advised, “The grand secret of wise inquiry... is to begin with the study of THINGS, using the DISCOURSE OF PERSONS as a commentary upon them. ” Thus, the present investigation is based almost entirely on documentary sources (die Quellen) — and these are often frustratingly fragmentary. As much as possible, the author has tried to avoid the difficulties that not infrequently confront writers of organizational histories, especially in cases where many of the central protagonists are still living. The Bureau of Sociological Research, established in 1964, was founded as a formal organization within the Department of Sociology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It is part of a departmental heritage that is now more than a century long. Directors of the Bureau have included Herman Turk, Alan Booth, David R. Johnson, Hugh P. Whitt, Lynn K. White, Helen A. Moore, D. Wayne Osgood, Laura A. Sanchez, Dan R. Hoyt, Julia Mcquillan, Philip Schwadel, and Jolene D. Smyth. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|What follows {{will support}} the {{centrality}} of appeals {{to the integrity of}} places as a plausible way of extending the concept of integrity in the light of our actual practices of valuing. The emphasis will, however, be upon practices of valuing rather than upon metaphysical claims about "inherent value”. The latter are not dismissed, they are merely set aside. The guiding thought is that our ethical theory should not depart too greatly from our understanding of how and what humans actually do hold to be of value in any particular culturally-shaped context. Following an introduction to the concept of integrity (Section 1), the discussion will open with an attempt to show that we do sometimes value places non-instrumentally (Section 2), even though we tend to look elsewhere to justify our respect for, and valuing of, places (Section 3). It will then proceed through a defence of appeals to such valuing as ethically significant (Section 4), before moving on to a <b>provisional</b> <b>account</b> of integrity as an effective way of making sense of what it is that we value when we value places in their own right (Section 5). Unlike Rolston, who is strongly associated with the concept of integrity, the intention is not to go metaphysically deep and identify something akin to the moral properties of things. Rather, the concern will be with the kinds of considerations that agents would typically point to as a reason for valuing places without any deeper set of claims about inherent value. This provides a less troubling, more metaphysically “neutral”, way of addressing matters. The paper is intended for an audience working on Geoethics; however, the norms of argument will be those associated more narrowly with philosophical ethics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} archetypal theme of {{initiation}} in selected texts by Joseph Conrad. The Introduction first surveys critical attention to initiatory motifs in Conrad {{with the objective}} of demonstrating the need for an approach to the topic informed by a more formal and theorized understanding of initiation. It then offers a prima facie case for the centrality of the idea of initiation in Conrad's oeuvre, based on references culled from a range of the author's writings. Chapter One seeks to contextualise initiation by providing a history of anthropological research into and theorisations of the rite, proceeding to a description of its typical structure and functions. A detailed account is given of the most widely accepted model of initiation, Arnold van Gennep's tripartite schema. Moving on to Conrad's writing, Chapter Two draws on both his fiction and more personal writings in order to provide a <b>provisional</b> <b>account</b> of the writer's own understanding of initiation and its importance, and to offer some explanation of why Conrad should have been prompted to accord the motif such prominence in his work. Conrad's presentation and (impliedly) his understanding of initiation was never entirely consistent and underwent some change {{in the course of his}} writing career. The critical assessment of "Typhoon" in Chapter Three depicts Conrad's more optimistic conception of initiation as a rite benefitting both society, by promoting solidarity, and the individual, by advancing self-knowledge. Chapter Four introduces, via analyses of the novellas "Youth" and "The Shadow Line", that variation on the motif of initiation which is more typical of its manifestation in Conrad: the failure of individuals to complete their cycles of initiation. Chapter Five identifies those characteristics of initiation which appear to be determinative in the representations of incomplete initiation in Conrad's work. Initiation seems to play out approximately seven paradoxes; the impact of some of these is examined through analysis of the initiatory ordeals of the main protagonists in The Secret Agent. Integral to this discussion is an attempt to demonstrate the vital role which initiation plays in the healthy maintenance not only of social order but also of faith and life itself. The Conclusion summarises the more important findings of the study and indicates some directions for further, related research. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{chapter on}} the Brazilian economy after 1994 is of a {{somewhat}} different nature compared to those on the economy in earlier periods. It is more speculative than its predecessors and based on a more restricted range of bibliographical material, as there is less consolidated research work on the period. It is to stress the obvious that the essay is inevitably marred {{to a certain degree}} by the lack of a sufficiently long time perspective. But it was thought that the benefits of providing a <b>provisional</b> <b>account</b> of the more recent economic developments in Brazil far outstripped the costs. The Brazilian economic history from 1995 to 2004 was still dominated by efforts to stabilise the economy. The essay is structured around an analysis of the eventful macroeconomic policies followed during the period. Other aspects are also considered, but often only to allow a clearer picture of the evolution of macroeconomic policies and the constraints they had to face. At first, the main economic policy objective was to consolidate the results of the Real Plan {{and to make sure that}} the long high inflation experience was really over. But soon the need to put public accounts under control and to make a sizable external adjustment would become the main challenges to be faced. A major balance of payments crisis in early 1999 imposed much overdue drastic changes in economic policy. Further disturbances occurred in 2002, the last year of Cardoso’s second term, as financial markets reflected fears that economic policy could be reversed with the likely victory of the opposition presidential candidate, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. But, somewhat surprisingly, the new government opted for policies that by and large represented a continuation of the orthodox economic policies of its predecessor. In contrast with the previous fifteen years there was success, in spite of many difficulties. Advance in the stabilisation front required reforms and institutional building efforts that brought very important changes and a sound foundation for future economic expansion. But effective growth performance over the period continued to be mediocre: between 1994 and 2004 per capita GDP (gross domestic product) increased an average of only 0. 9 percent yearly. Together with structural fiscal difficulties, low economic growth imposed strict constraints on policies seeking to alleviate the country’s severe social imbalanceseconomic history, stabilization, Brazil...|$|R

40|$|May 2002 "Thesis (PhD) [...] Macquarie University, School of English, Linguistics and Media, Department of Linguistics, 2003. Bibliography: p. 399 - 419. Introduction [...] Brief {{overview}} of above-clause analysis in Japanese [...] Methodology and conventions of analysis [...] Marco Polo text [...] Bean Scattering Day text [...] University lecture text [...] Family conversation text [...] Generalisation and a university tutorial text [...] Conclusion. This thesis {{is concerned with}} the construction of texture in Japanese, in particular with resources related to the general area of cohesion and particular aspects of participant tracking. An investigation is here presented as to the degree to which conventional views adequately represent Japanese in the light of authentic data. Such statements as "WA marks Given information", "GA marks New information", "zero is a pronoun in Japanese" are common throughout the literature characterising Japanese texts, but {{there is reason to believe}} that they stem, at least in part, from a naive transfer of English grammars, in particular, those with a narrow focus on the sentence. This thesis proposes a new framework for the description of Japanese; and in this proposal, an essential dimension is a detailed account of relevant contextual factors, both linguistic and nonlinguistic. The aim is to offer a description of Japanese more defensible to Japanese speakers, that is, to represent Japanese "in its own terms". [...] Chapter 1 sets out problems and issues in the related literature on Japanese cohesion. It also addresses issues that are seen to be most pressing in relation to the description of Japanese. The chapter gives a brief account of the resources for cohesion and referential tracking and the particular deployment in Japanese, so that it offers a <b>provisional</b> <b>account</b> of the meaning potential for Japanese speakers. [...] Chapter 2 reviews several standard treatments of cohesion and participant tracking in Japanese. This review is organised around two different kinds of resources, that is, those pre-predicate elements (such as WA, GA and other particles), and those post-predicate elements (such as conjunctive particles and certain sentence final expressions). [...] Chapter 3 explains the method undertaken here and the conventions of analysis employed in subsequent desclipiions of texts from five separate contexts. Methods are set so as not only to view choices synoptically, but also to try to give careful description of choices in the logogenetic reality of text. That means the choices are viewed as being available to the speaker, writer or reader, as they unfold in text time. [...] In each of Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7, one of the following four texts, a (1) Marco Polo Text, (2) Bean Scattering Day Text, (3) University Lecture Text and (4) Family Conversation Text, is analysed and discussed in detail. The texts are chosen for the detailed examination of four different registers, representing a continuum from most written-like to most spoken-like, as well as continua of other kinds (like hierarchically differentiated social distance and formality differentiated). Each chapter has two major components, the first of which looks at subject realisations from the perspective of referential progression, and the second of which looks at the text from the perspective of subjectJreferent sequencing. Furthermore, these issues concerning subject are mapped against the macro structures individually for the three "writerly" texts (Texts (1) - (3)). [...] In Chapter 8, generalisations are proposed, based on the results of the investigations of these four texts; and then, those principles, as they have emerged from the preceding arguments, are tested on a further study: (5) the University Tutorial Text, a text which combines characteristics across the continuum from most written to most spoken. (It is both strongly dialogic as well as involving sustained spoken 'turns'.) In Chapter 9, findings of the analytical chapters are further distilled. The outline for a new, although provisional, model of cohesion in Japanese is set out. These findings suggest future directions for research projects as well.

40|$|Anecdotally, {{hospitality}} has {{a reputation}} for poor ethical standards, and preliminary results from this doctoral study indicate such a reputation is well founded. However, the expected crimes of sexual harassment, theft, the service of alcohol to minors, and poor food hygiene, {{do not appear to be}} the main concerns. Instead, staff complain of persistent unfair treatment by supervisors, and the struggle to provide service in an environment of poor training and critical under-staffing. This paper investigates the incidence of constructive dismissals and harsh treatment by supervisors in the Auckland hospitality industry, and the under-staffing and high turnover rates currently being experienced. Initial quantitative and qualitative analyses from 453 questionnaires are presented, in an attempt to shed light on some disturbing trends in this industry.

40|$|The current {{analysis}} {{argues for}} a feature geometric analysis of grammatical Situations and Events (S/E structures). Individual Situations and Events are represented as substructures of an S/E geometry that includes representations of inception and causation, and the contrasts between static and eventive Situations, telic and atelic Events, and punctual and extended Events. In addition, insights from localist and causal approaches to predicate decomposition are incorporated. S/E structures are analyzed as grammatical templates or constructions and are merged with morphemes through head nodes, equivalent to subevents. The interfaces between S/E structures, Argument structures, and Tense and Aspect are analyzed {{in a similar}} manner. The visibility or opacity of S/E structures in the surface forms of predicates is accounted for {{in terms of the}} associations between nodes in the S/E structure and morphemes: one-to-one associations yield predicates with visible S/E structures, many-to-one associations, which are restricted, produce predicates with opaque S/E structures on the surface. Evidence from English, in which S/E structures tend to be opaque, is presented involving various adverbial tests. Three distinct types of predicates in ASL are also analyzed, including classifier predicate constructions (CLP), agreeing predicates (A-predicates) and plain predicates (P-predicates). The distinctions between these predicate types are analyzed here in terms of distinctions in the underlying S/E structures. This analysis accounts for the particular spatial morphology found in CLP, the referring morphology in A-predicates, and the lack of this morphology in P-predicates. In all of these ASL predicates the S/E structures are highly visible. This analysis also includes <b>provisional</b> feature geometric <b>accounts</b> of the lexical semantics of verbal roots, and viewpoint Aspect. ...|$|R
