2500|$|The Soviet rule in Georgia was {{established}} by the Soviet Red Army during the February-March 1921 military campaign that was largely engineered by the two influential Georgian-born Soviet Russian officials, Joseph Stalin, then People's Commissar for Nationalities for the RSFSR, and Grigol Ordzhonikidze, head of the Transcaucasian Regional Committee (Zaikkraikom) of the Russian Communist Party. Disagreements among the Bolsheviks {{about the fate of}} Georgia preceded the Red Army invasion. While Stalin and Ordzhonikidze urged the immediate Sovietization of independent Georgia led by the Menshevik-dominated government, Trotsky favored [...] "a certain <b>preparatory</b> <b>period</b> of work inside Georgia, in order to develop the uprising and later come to its aid." [...] Lenin was unsure about the outcome of the Georgian campaign, fearful of the international consequences and the possible crisis with Kemalist Turkey. Lenin finally gave his consent, on February 14, 1921, to the intervention in Georgia, but later repeatedly complained about the lack of precise and consistent information from the Caucasus. Well aware of widespread opposition to the newly established Soviet rule, Lenin favored a reconciliatory policy with Georgian intelligentsia and peasants who remained hostile to the militarily imposed regime. However, many Communists found it difficult to abandon the methods used against their opposition during the Russian Civil War and make adjustment to the more flexible policy. For moderates like Filipp Makharadze Lenin’s approach was a reasonable way to secure for Soviet power a broad base of support. They advocated tolerance toward the Menshevik opposition, greater democracy within the party, gradual land reform, and above all, respect for national sensitivities and Georgia’s sovereignty from Moscow. Communists like Ordzhonikidze and Stalin pursued a more hard-line policy; they sought to eliminate completely political opposition and centralize party control over the newly Sovietized republics.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} both monkeys and humans {{indicate}} that the dorsal premotor cortex participates in spatial attention and working memory, {{in addition to its}} well known role in movement planning and execution. One important question is whether these functions overlap or are segregated within this frontal area.

To test whether this possibility also holds true in humans, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare, in the same set of subjects, brain activation related to strong spatial attention and memory demands to that elicited by long motor <b>preparatory</b> <b>periods.</b> The behavioral protocol was based on a task that had proved effective for dissociating neuronal properties related t...|$|R

Subsequent comparison and verification of adequate knowledge gained from optimal resources are used to improve fitness condition during yearly training cycle. Methods: First, the information about fitness training was compared based upon {{the analysis of the}} scientific literature. Secondly, the model training units focused on individual fitness assumptions were created. Thirdly, research data {{in the form of a}} survey from football coaches was compiled.

The research {{was based on a}} two-part questionnaire by Kłodecka-Różalska adjusted for disabled sports, and was conducted one month before each PG. Part 1 contained 20 closed-ended questions regarding conditions during preparations, while Part 2 concerned socio-demographic and sports-related data. Three levels of conditions: good, satisfactory and poor, were identified. The analysis showed that while the relationships between the athletes were good in all the <b>preparatory</b> <b>periods,</b> the co-operation with the paralympic coaches worsened. The standards of accommodation, food and sports facilities lowered. Personal orthopaedic supply was satisfactory in London; personal sporting equipment was good at all PG. The quality of medical care was the highest in London. The co-operation with physicians, physiotherapists and massage therapists was satisfactory. Consultations with the dietician were sporadic and assessed as poor. Psychological consultations were rare but satisfactory in Beijing and London. Contacts with the mass media were poor at all PG. Although combining private life, work, and education with sport was satisfactory, it was increasingly difficult to manage, particularly before London. The conditions during preparations for the PG 2004 - 2012 varied. Improvement was noticed only in the quality of medical care and personal orthopaedic supply...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{quality of}} health care depends on the {{competence}} and motivation of the health workers that provide it. In the West, several tools exist to measure worker motivation, and some have been applied to the health sector. However, none have been validated for use in sub-Saharan Africa. The complexity of such tools has also led to concerns about their application at primary care level. Objective: To develop a common instrument to monitor any changes in maternal and neonatal health (MNH) care provider motivation resulting from the introduction of pilot interventions in rural, primary level facilities in Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania. Design: Initially, a conceptual framework was developed. Based upon this, a literature review and preliminary qualitative research, an English-language instrument was developed and validated in an iterative process with experts from the three countries involved. The instrument was then piloted in Ghana. Reliability testing and exploratory factor analysis were used to produce a final, parsimonious version. Results and discussion: This paper describes the actual process of developing the instrument. Consequently, the concepts and items that did not perform well psychometrically at pre-test are first presented and discussed. The {{final version of the}} instrument, which comprises 42 items for self-assessment and eight for peer-assessment, is then shown. This is followed by a presentation and discussion of the findings from first use of the instrument with MNH providers from 12 rural, primary level facilities {{in each of the three}} countries. Conclusions: It is possible to undertake work of this nature at primary health care level, particularly if the instruments are kept as straightforward as possible and well introduced. However, their development requires very lengthy <b>preparatory</b> <b>periods.</b> The effort needed to adapt such instruments for use in different countries within the region of sub-Saharan Africa should not be underestimated...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: The {{researchers}} {{introduce the}} contents of specific training means and&# 13; the reps number during the training micro-cycles along <b>preparatory</b> and competitive <b>period</b> of the&# 13; performance weightlifters. Approach: This approach has lead to the organization of a study in&# 13; Olympic team of weightlifting. The scientific argument is {{the introduction of the}} content of the means&# 13; specific to the performance weightlifters training in the <b>preparatory</b> and competitive <b>period,</b> which,&# 13; by ensuring optimal relations between technical and physical training during workouts, will help to&# 13; boost sports performances in competitions. Results: The analysis of the specific training means&# 13; content during the competitive period shows that training was made with an average of 270 reps&# 13; and the relation between the means of technical and physical training is 45 % technique (46 snatch&# 13; and 54 % clean and jerk) and 55 % strength (67 squats and 41. 25 % back exercises). As for the&# 13; contents of strength specific means within the training period {{it is obvious that the}} strength&# 13; exercises are divided into two groups: for squats, the share is 35 % chest squats and 72 % back&# 13; squats, while the share for back squats is 57. 5 pulls and 42. 5 % bending. The study highlights the&# 13; contents of specific means in the training micro-cycles of <b>preparatory</b> and competitive <b>periods</b> in&# 13; performance weightlifting. Conclusion: The effort parameters indicate the growth of effort intensity&# 13; from one micro-cycle to another by increasing the load, the number of reps; the gradually increasing&# 13; effort parameters, kept at their maximal level and diminution of the volume before competitive&# 13; period; the dynamics of effort parameters, regarding the relationship of technical and physical&# 13; training.
