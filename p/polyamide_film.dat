40|$|In {{membrane}} based desalination processes, {{the thin}} film composite (TFC) membrane {{is an industry}} standard which uses interfacial polymerization technique to form an ultra-thin polyamide layer {{on the surface of}} polymeric substrates. Remarkably, in 30 years of using this approach, the RO industry has yet to create a <b>polyamide</b> <b>film</b> onto a supporting membrane with controllable thickness, roughness and properties that are independent from the substrate properties. While the film formation essentially is “self-controlled”, the reaction itself is simply allowed to proceed uncontrolled. Thickness and roughness impact membrane permeance and fouling propensity, respectively, and controlling these parameters could greatly benefit any process that uses a TFC membrane. We developed a highly scalable, and green method for making tunable polyamide films for desalination. The method uses electrospraying technique to spray-deposit monomer solutions directly on to substrate which react to form the <b>polyamide</b> <b>film.</b> This is achieved through the use of lypophilic ionic liquid in the organic phase that contains one of the monomers. Comparable desalination performance to that of commercial membranes with sub- 2 nm smoothness and a sub- 4 nm resolution in film growth was achieved regardless of substrate properties. We also demonstrated the formation of a bulky 1 µm thick <b>polyamide</b> <b>film</b> of similar chemical structure for the first time. We further verified a two orders of magnitude lower chemical footprint using electrosprayed polymerization than the conventional method...|$|E

Kapton XC(reg.) is a commercially-available, carbon-loaded <b>polyamide</b> <b>film</b> manufactured by Dupont(reg.). Though these films are exceptionally durable and available in a range of surface resistivities, their effective permittivity is complex valued and, therefore, their sheet impedance is frequency dependent as is typical of carbon-loaded dielectrics. We have measured the X-band complex permittivity of Kapton XC(reg.) with a manufacture's quoted direct current (DC) sheet resistivity of approximately 370 {Omega}/sq. and thicknesses of 40. 0 {mu}m. This study showed the need for relatively precise knowledge of the real part of a carbon particulate loaded, lossy thin film's permittivity in order to accurately engineer the reflection coefficient of high-impedance surface enhanced electromagnetic absorbers. Specifically, simple, approximate models can be obtained for the X-band complex pennittivity of commercially available, carbon loaded, 370 {Omega}/sq., Kapton XC(reg.) thin film. These simple, approximate models can be used in the analytic modeling of high-impedance surface enhanced X-band absorbers or computational modeling of other possibly more complicated absorbing structures which are composed, in part, of 370 {Omega}/sq.

Interfacial polymerization is typically MPD diffusion-controlled during growth of the polyamide layer. If TMC concentration is increased, the amine/acyl chloride molar ratio will decrease. This will, in turn, increase film density, causing a lower permeate flux [41, 44]. However, a decrease in permeate flux was also observed at the lowest TMC concentration of < 0.1  %. Thus, the interfacial polymerization reaction is also reported to be TMC diffusion-limited [45]. A low concentration of acyl chloride groups in the reaction zone may allow the <b>polyamide</b> <b>film</b> to grow thicker, which would decrease flux [39].|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of silicate layers {{may be expected}} to decrease the water uptake due to a more tortuous path for the diffusing molecules that must bypass impenetrable platelets. The improved barrier characteristics, chemical resistance, reduced solvent uptake, and flame retardance of clay–polymer nanocomposites take advantage from the hindered diffusion pathways through the nanocomposite. The water uptake of composite materials measured under the saturation conditions (168 h) are shown in Table 1. The results showed maximum water absorption for the neat <b>polyamide</b> <b>film</b> 16.1 % due to exposure of amide and sulfonyl polar groups to the surface of polymer where water molecules developed secondary bond forces with these polar groups. The increase in weight of the hybrid films due to uptake of water gradually decreased as the organoclay content in nanocomposites increased. This decrease is apparently due to the mutual interaction between the organic and inorganic phases. This interaction resulted in lesser availability of amide and sulfonyl groups to interact with water.|$|E

In the second technique called " projected area" TEM (PA-TEM), isolated <b>polyamide</b> thin <b>films</b> are placed with their surface perpendicular to the electron beam. The resulting images capture the thickness, morphology and mass density of the entire thin film. In combination, these new techniques provide information on polyamide nanostructure that is not evident using conventional methods.

Under visible light exposure, singlet oxygen (1 O 2) is generated in the porphyrin containing-polyamide film, reaching the bacteria in the feed by diffusion and enhancing the biofouling resistance and anti-microbial activity. Anti-biofouling and anti-microbial photoactivity in solution are demonstrated on Staphylococcus aureus at different porphyrin concentrations and light exposure time...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} some {{properties}} {{of a new}} general-purpose isothermal microcalorimeter are reported. The instrument is a twin thermopile heat conduction calorimeter, which is designed for use up to 200 degreesC. The calorimetric units and surrounding heat sink are suspended inside a hollow aluminium construction, which is thermostated. Above that unit a second thermostated block is positioned and the whole assembly is suspended inside a Dewar vessel. When the instrument is used at room temperature and below, the thermostated units are cooled by use f an insertion Peltier effect cooler. The instrument {{can be used with}} a wide range of different reaction vessels (diameter 14 mm). Baseline experiments have been conducted in the temperature range 15 - 200 degreesC. Typical values obtained during 10 h periods at 200 degreesC are +/- 3 and +/- 10 nW for the baseline drift and baseline fluctuations, respectively. The heat detection limit, determined by release of electrical energy, is about 2 muJ. Preliminary stability measurements have been conducted at 100 degreesC on samples of stabilised and non-stabilised <b>polyamide</b> <b>film.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|A major {{limiting}} factor of forward osmosis (FO) membrane, particularly in pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) mode, is fouling by natural organic matters. In this work, we investigated {{the effect of}} the nanocomposite substrate on the fouling of a thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membrane due to organic foulants in PRO mode. The TFN membrane was synthesized by coating a <b>polyamide</b> <b>film</b> over the surface of substrate made of polysulfone–titanium dioxide. The TFN membrane always showed much higher FO water flux than the typical thin film composite TFC membrane prepared from the pristine polysulfone substrate. Reduced internal concentration polarization following a significant decrease of the structural parameter in the nanocomposite substrate causes the mass transfer coefficient of the substrate to increase. In the PRO mode, BSA removal in the presence of Ca 2 + confirmed that the TFN FO membrane could significantly mitigate fouling tendency compared to a typical TFC membrane. Results also showed that fouling in TFN FO is highly reversible, recovering > 92 % permeate flux after a simple water rinse process. A complete study of the membrane fouling was reported with detailed scientific discussion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on {{the effect of the}} nanocomposite membrane on membrane fouling in PRO mode...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the flow {{activity of the}} nanostructured polyamide layer in reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, using gold nanoparticle (NP) tracers of 1 – 40 nm diameter. Following a detailed structural examination of a commercial SW 30 RH membrane selected for this study, NP solutions were infiltrated from either the polyamide front or the polysulfone support side. The permeate was then analyzed spectroscopically while the entrapment of NPs within the membrane was mapped by high resolution electron microscopy. Results show that back-filtered NPs exhibited a fractionated distribution according to size: 1 nm nanoparticles permeate across the polyamide-polysulfone interface reaching {{the interior of the}} polyamide corrugations, while the larger ones (> 10 nm) are retained within the polysulfone and gradually arrested at approximately 100 nm below the polyamide-polysulfone interface. Intermediate-sized 5 nm nanoparticles reached the undulating folds just below the polyamide layer. Permeation pathways across polyamide layer appear to exclude all tracers above 1 nm, which become selectively distributed across the polyamide layer: positively charged NPs label the outer surface of the <b>polyamide</b> <b>film</b> (expected to be carboxylate-rich), while negatively charged particles are uniformly distributed within the layer. Diafiltration measurements quantify the transient kinetics of NP retention and permeation. Overall, our results establish the flow activity of the polyamide nodular surface and provide estimates for the dimensions of permeation pathways...|$|E

40|$|Two {{antimicrobial}} coatings, namely Sodium octanoate and Auranta FV (a commercial antimicrobial {{composed of}} bioflavonoids, citric, malic, lactic, and caprylic acids) were used. These two antimicrobials were surface coated onto the inner polyethylene layer of cold plasma treated <b>polyamide</b> <b>films</b> using beef gelatin as a carrier and coating polymer. This packaging material was {{then used to}} vacuum pack beef sub-primal cuts and stored at 4 °C. A control was prepared using the non-coated commercial laminate and the same vacuum packaged sub-primal beef cuts. During storage, microbial and quality assessments were carried out. Sodium octanoate treated packages significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced microbial counts for all bacteria tested with an increase of 7 and 14 days, respectively compared to control samples. No significant effect on pH was observed with any treatment. The results suggested that these food grade antimicrobials {{have the potential to}} be used in antimicrobial active packaging applications for beef products...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available at}} [URL] thin film composite (PA TFC) membranes are synthesized from interfacial polymerization using two amines in the aqueous phase. The conventional monomer, mphenelynediamine (MPD), is partially replaced by a linear monomer, 1, 3 –diamino- 2 - hydroxypropane (DAHP). The water permeability of the membranes improves by around 22 % (to 2. 67 ± 0. 09 L. m- 2. h- 1. bar- 1) while keeping the same high salt rejection (96 - 98 %) at an optimum DAHP/MPD ratio of 12. 8 %. While developing the control PA TFC membrane we introduce a washing step and show that the support surface should be free from surface protective coatings to achieve high water flux (2. 18 ± 0. 08 L. m- 2. h- 1. bar- 1). Incorporating DAHP units into the polyamide network improves the water flux through the membranes fabricated on both original and washed supports. The surface morphologies of <b>polyamide</b> <b>films</b> change significantly with introduction of DAHP, from large ridge-and-valley structure to enlarged nodular structures. High resolution SEM images show an ultrathin <b>polyamide</b> thin <b>film</b> with a thickness that is reduced with addition of DAHP. These influences of DAHP, namely {{a reduction in the}} selective layer thickness, an alteration in surface morphology, changes in internal molecular packing and hydrophilicity, are suggested as factors behind the improved water permeability.
