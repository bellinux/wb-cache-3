40|$|Using a {{dark-field}} microscope {{equipped with a}} high-efficiency TV camera including a video tape-recorder, we recorded the sliding movement between outer doublet microtubules of the demembranated axonemes of sea-urchin (Pseudocentrotus depressus and Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus) sperm flagella by adding ATP and trypsin at 25 °C. The time and length of the sliding doublet microtubules from axonemes were measured directly from {{the image on the}} <b>picture</b> <b>monitor</b> from the video tape. The sliding velocity was almost constant in the range from o to 2 % polyethylene glycol concentration in the reactivation medium and decreased a little at more than 2 %. We prepared various lengths of axoneme fragments by homogenizing whole axonemes and found that the shorter fragments showed similar sliding velocity to that of longer ones at less than 200 fiM ATP, but slightly decreased speed at more than 500 fiM ATP. The sliding movement sometimes stopped and the percentage of sliding axonemes was lower below 2 fig/ml trypsin. Above 3 /ig/ml, the process appeared to be more like disintegration than sliding movement, which may be due to excess digestion by trypsin. Sliding speed was therefore measured in a reactivation medium containing 2 % polyethylene glycol with the addition of ATP and 2 /tg/ml trypsin. The velocity increased in proportion to the increase in ATP concentration. VmMI was approximately 14 /im/s at 1 mM ATP. In order to compare the Km for the sliding velocity with that of the ATPase activity of the axonemes, we measured ATPase activity of axonemes prepared and assayed under conditions in which sliding movement in the axonemes could be induced. Neither the curve of ATPase activity nor the curve of sliding velocity plotted against ATP concentration obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The close relationship between ATPase activity and sliding velocity suggested that ' sliding-movement-coupled ATPase activity ' may well be reflected in the axoneme ATPase reported here...|$|E

Compared to the cheaper R-Y and B-Y decoding which requires only one filter, I and Q each requires a different filter to satisfy the bandwidth differences between I and Q. These bandwidth differences also requires that the 'I' filter include a time delay to match the longer delay of the 'Q' filter. The Rockwell Modular Digital Radio (MDR) was one I and Q decoding set, which in 1997 could operate in frame-at-a-time mode with a PC or in realtime with the Fast IQ Processor (FIQP).

40|$|Background: Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) of {{the lungs}} facilitates visualization of ventilation distribution during mechanical ventilation. Its intraoperative use could {{provide the basis for}} individual optimization of ventilator settings, especially in patients at risk for ventilation-perfusion mismatch and impaired gas exchange, such as patients undergoing major open upper abdominal surgery. EIT throughout major open upper abdominal surgery could encounter difficulties in belt positioning and signal quality. Thus, we conducted a pilot-study and tested whether EIT is feasible in patients undergoing major open upper abdominal surgery. Methods: Following institutional review board’s approval and written informed consent, we included patients scheduled for major open upper abdominal surgery of at least 3 hours duration. EIT measurements were conducted prior to intubation, at the time of skin incision, then hourly during surgery until shortly prior to extubation and after extubation. Number of successful intraoperative EIT measurements and reasons for failures were documented. From the valid measurements, a functional EIT image of changes in tidal impedance was generated for every time point. Regions of interest were defined as horizontal halves of the <b>picture.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> of ventilation distribution was assessed using the center of ventilation index, and also using the total and dorsal ventilated lung area.
