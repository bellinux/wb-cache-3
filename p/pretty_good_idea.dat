40|$|IDEA {{stands for}} International data {{encryption}} algorithm {{and is considered}} {{as one of the}} strongest cryptographic algorithm. It was designed by Xuejia Lai, James L Massey, and Murphy in 1991. It was launched in 1990 as Proposed Encryption Standard and underwent certain changes and finally named as International Data Encryption algorithm (IDEA). One popular email privacy technology known as <b>Pretty</b> <b>Good</b> Privacy uses <b>IDEA</b> for encrypting the data because of its proven design and its maximum security. IDEA is a symmetric block cipher and like DES, it also works on 64 - bit plain text block. This algorithm is performed in rounds. Each of these blocks passes through 16 rounds and one output transformation phase (i. e. 16 + 1 = 17 rounds). In most description of IDEA, it is described as having 8 rounds, where each round does the work of two rounds. (An odd round and an even round) i. e. 8 * 2 = 16 rounds + 1 round(named as output transformation) = 17 rounds...|$|R
