5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and <b>Portugal</b> would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of <b>Portugal</b> on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: <b>Portugal</b> was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of <b>Portugal</b> and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in <b>Portugal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since 1640, <b>Portugal</b> {{had been}} {{fighting}} a war against Spain to restore its independence after a dynastic union of sixty years between the crowns of Spain and <b>Portugal.</b> <b>Portugal</b> had been helped by France, but in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 <b>Portugal</b> was abandoned by its French ally. Negotiations with <b>Portugal</b> for Charles's marriage to Catherine of Braganza began during his father's reign and upon the restoration, Queen Luísa of <b>Portugal,</b> acting as regent, reopened negotiations with England that resulted in an alliance. On 23 June 1661, a marriage treaty was signed; England acquired Catherine's dowry of Tangier (in North Africa) and the Seven islands of Bombay (the latter having {{a major influence on}} the development of the British Empire in India), together with trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies, religious and commercial freedom in <b>Portugal</b> and two million Portuguese crowns (about £300,000); while <b>Portugal</b> obtained military and naval support against Spain and liberty of worship for Catherine. Catherine journeyed from <b>Portugal</b> to Portsmouth on 13–14 May 1662, but was not visited by Charles there until 20 May. The next day the couple were married at Portsmouth in two ceremonies—a Catholic one conducted in secret, followed by a public Anglican service.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, {{after nearly}} three decades of forced {{political}} and economic rule under Salazar's dictatorship, <b>Portugal's</b> per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the EC-12 average. This stagnation and the emerging war in the colonies were reasons {{for a change in}} policy to an outward-looking economic policy. By the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, GDP had risen to 48 percent, and in 1973, {{on the eve of the}} revolution, <b>Portugal's</b> per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average. In 1975, when revolutionary turmoil peaked, <b>Portugal's</b> per capita GDP declined to 52.3 percent of the EC-12 average. Convergence of real GDP growth toward the EC average occurred as a result of <b>Portugal's</b> economic resurgence since 1985. In 1991 <b>Portugal's</b> GDP per capita climbed to 54.9 percent of the EC average, exceeding by a fraction the level attained during the height of the revolutionary period. In addition, the events of 1974 prompted a mass exodus of citizens from <b>Portugal's</b> African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique), creating over a million Portuguese destitute refugees known as the retornados.|$|R

5|$|Cosimo {{went about}} {{arranging}} a marriage for his elder son, Ferdinando, in 1686.

5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, <b>Portugal</b> and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line {{down the middle}} of the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to <b>Portugal.</b> That gave <b>Portugal</b> dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific.

5|$|In 1815, the Portuguese {{crown prince}} Dom João (later Dom JoãoVI), acting as regent, created the United Kingdom of <b>Portugal,</b> Brazil and the Algarves, which raised {{the status of}} Brazil from colony to kingdom. He ascended the Portuguese throne the {{following}} year, {{after the death of}} his mother, Maria I of <b>Portugal.</b> He returned to <b>Portugal</b> in April 1821, leaving behind his son and heir, Prince Dom Pedro, to rule Brazil as his regent. The Portuguese government immediately moved to revoke the political autonomy that Brazil had been granted since 1808. The threat of losing their limited control over local affairs ignited widespread opposition among Brazilians. José Bonifácio de Andrada, along with other Brazilian leaders, convinced Pedro to declare Brazil's independence from <b>Portugal</b> on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed PedroI, first Emperor of the newly created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. The declaration of independence was opposed throughout Brazil by armed military units loyal to <b>Portugal.</b> The ensuing war of independence was fought across the country, with battles in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers to surrender did so in March 1824, and independence was recognized by <b>Portugal</b> in August 1825.|$|E
