40|$|The {{presence}} of malarial pigment (haemozoin) due to Plasmodium infection {{is a common}} histopathological effect in mouse liver. Previous research showed that by using a <b>polarized</b> light <b>microscope,</b> researchers were better able to detect haemozoin in mouse liver histology section. Thus, {{the aim of this}} research was to compare the haemozoin area observed by a conventional vs. simple <b>polarized</b> light <b>microscope</b> by using image processing analysis. A total of 40 images produced from both conventional light <b>microscope</b> and simple <b>polarized</b> light <b>microscope</b> were collected. All images were analyzed using ImageJ 1. 47 software to measure the haemozoin areas. Our results showed that non birefringent haemozoin and birefringent haemozoin area was significantly different. This was because when using conventional light microscope the brown area that contained images of non birefringent haemozoin images also contained Kupffer cells which appeared as the same brown color as haemozoin. In contrast, haemozoin gave bright effect and can be easily differentiated with Kupffer cells in the birefringent haemozoin images. This study concluded that haemozoin detection in mouse liver histology using a simple <b>polarized</b> light <b>microscope</b> was more accurate compared to that of conventional light microscope...|$|R

40|$|The <b>polarizing</b> optical <b>microscope</b> {{has been}} used since the 19 th century to study the {{structural}} anisotropy of materials, based on the phenomenon of optical birefringence. In contrast, the phenomenon of x-ray birefringence has been demonstrated only recently and {{has been shown to}} be a sensitive probe of the orientational properties of individual molecules and/or bonds in anisotropic solids. Here, we report a technique—x-ray birefringence imaging (XBI) —that enables spatially resolved mapping of x-ray birefringence of materials, representing the x-ray analog of the <b>polarizing</b> optical <b>microscope.</b> Our results demonstrate the utility and potential of XBI as a sensitive technique for imaging the local orientational properties of anisotropic materials, including characterization of changes in molecular orientational ordering associated with solid-state phase transitions and identification of the size, spatial distribution, and temperature dependence of domain structures.

50|$|A <b>polarizing</b> <b>microscope</b> {{is similar}} to an {{ordinary}} microscope, but it has two plane-polarized filters, a (polarizer) below the sample and an analyzer above it, polarized perpendicular to each other.

However, an anisotropic sample will generally change the polarization so some of the light can pass through. Thin sections and powders can be used as samples.|$|E
