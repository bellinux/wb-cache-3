5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the <b>pangolin</b> radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the <b>pangolin,</b> or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E
50|$|The journal Frontiers in Ecology & the Environment {{estimated}} that the remains of about 10,000 <b>pangolins</b> are intercepted each year. Zhao-Min Zhou and Macdonald from Frontiers in Ecology & the Environment claim from their records that 220 living <b>pangolins</b> {{and the remains of}} 4,909 dead <b>pangolins</b> were seized in 43 law enforcement actions since 2010.|$|R

After random inspections on May 28, 2014, at the Kwai Chung cargo port in Hong Kong, officials detained scales from nearly 8,000 <b>pangolins.</b> Just two weeks later, Hong Kong officials seized a second shipment that contained scales from about 5,000 <b>pangolins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Overexploitation {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{pressures}} driving wildlife closer to extinction, yet broad-scale data to evaluate species’ declines are limited. Using African <b>pangolins</b> (Family: Pholidota) as a case study, we demonstrate that collating local-scale data can provide crucial information on regional trends in exploitation of threatened species to inform conservation actions and policy. We estimate that 0. 4 - 2. 7 million <b>pangolins</b> are hunted annually in Central African forests. The number of <b>pangolins</b> hunted has increased by ~ 150 % and the proportion of <b>pangolins</b> of all vertebrates hunted increased from 0. 04 % to 1. 83 % over the past four decades. However, there were no trends in <b>pangolins</b> observed at markets, suggesting use of alternative supply chains. We found evidence that the price of giant (Smutsia gigantea) and arboreal (Phataginus sp.) <b>pangolins</b> in urban markets has increased, mirroring trends in Asian <b>pangolins.</b> Efforts and resources are needed to increase law enforcement and population monitoring, and investigate linkages between subsistence hunting and illegal wildlife trade.

40|$|Abstract Chinese <b>Pangolins</b> {{are least}} studied {{burrowing}} mammals. There is great role {{of this species}} in nature to maintain ecological balance. Due to illegal trade and habitat destruction, Chinese <b>Pangolins</b> are in great risk of extinction although being protected by national as well as international laws. This research was carried out {{to find out the}} distribution, habitat utilization, social belief and conservation status of Chinese <b>Pangolins</b> in Nangkholyang VDC of Taplejung district, Eastern Nepal. This study was done with direct field observation followed by direct observation along the tracks and random search, group discussion, key informant survey and questionnaire survey. This study showed the presence of indirect signs of Chinese <b>Pangolins</b> such as 211 burrows (including 16 new and 195 old), scats, foot prints and trace of tail in Nangkholyang VDC, Taplejung. The distribution of <b>Pangolins</b> was found in all wards (political unit of village) with highest number of burrows in southwest aspect and least in north. The burrows were found in the elevation from 1126 m to 2406 m. The habitat utilized by Chinese <b>Pangolins</b> was found to be forest and agricultural land. In the forest, the maximum numbers of burrows were located at the crown cover of 0 - 25 %. <b>Pangolins</b> were taken as the sign of bad luck but due to profit motive people were hunting this mammal.

40|$|<b>Pangolins</b> are {{increasingly}} threatened by demand for their scales, {{which are used}} in traditional medicines, and for their meat, which is consumed as a luxury. As populations of Asian <b>pangolins</b> decline, the demand is shifting to the four species in Africa, where local cultural use may already pose some level of threat. During 2010 − 2015 a total of 65 pangolin-related seizures (surrendered and confiscated) were reported in Zimbabwe, with the annual number of confiscations increasing significantly over this period. Zimbabwean authorities have toughened their stance against this trade, and during January−June 2015 three-quarters of confiscations of <b>pangolins</b> (n = 12) resulted in the maximum jail sentence {{for at least one}} of the offenders in each case. At present there is no evidence that <b>pangolins</b> are being traded from Zimbabwe to China, and the increased enforcement may be key to ensuring Zimbabwe's <b>pangolins</b> are not threatened by the large-scale illegal trade witnessed in Asia.

40|$|<b>Pangolins</b> {{are unique}} placental mammals with eight species {{existing}} in the world, which {{have adapted to}} a highly specialized diet of ants and termites, and are of significance in the control of forest termite disaster. Besides their ecological value, <b>pangolins</b> are extremely important economic animals with the value as medicine and food. At present, illegal hunting and habitat destruction have drastically decreased the wild population of <b>pangolins,</b> pushing them {{to the edge of}} extinction. Captive breeding is an important way to protect these species, but because of pangolin’s specialized behaviors and high dependence on natural ecosystem, there still exist many technical barriers to successful captive breeding programs. In this paper, based on the literatures and our practical experience, we reviewed the status and existing problems in captive breeding of <b>pangolins,</b> including four aspects, the naturalistic habitat, dietary husbandry, reproduction and disease control.

25|$|Bipedal {{movement}} is less common among mammals, {{most of which}} are quadrupedal. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), kangaroo rats and mice, hopping mice and springhare move bipedally by hopping. Very few mammals other than primates commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping. Exceptions are the ground <b>pangolin</b> and in some circumstances the tree kangaroo. One black bear, Pedals, became famous locally and on the internet for having a frequent bipedal gait, although this is attributed to injuries on the bear's front paws.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{have also}} arisen {{over the use}} of <b>pangolin</b> scales, turtle plastron, seahorses, and the gill plates of mobula and manta rays. Poachers hunt {{restricted}} or endangered species animals to supply the black market with TCM products. There is no scientific evidence of efficacy for tiger medicines. Concern over China considering to legalize the trade in tiger parts prompted the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to endorse a decision opposing the resurgence of trade in tigers. Fewer than 30,000 saiga antelopes remain, which are exported to China for use in traditional fever therapies. Organized gangs illegally export the horn of the antelopes to China. The pressures on seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) used in traditional medicine is enormous; tens of millions of animals are unsustainably caught annually. Many species of syngnathid are currently part of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or national equivalents.|$|E
