Knight Dunlap was one of his earliest students at Berkeley and he became the twenty-second president of the American Psychological Association.

25|$|Boring {{was born}} on October 23, 1886 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania {{and grew up in}} a Quaker family {{interested}} in science. His elder sister was the zoologist, Alice Middleton Boring. In 1904, Boring attended Cornell University, where he studied electrical engineering. He earned a M.E. degree in electrical engineering in 1908 and then took a job at Bethlehem Steel Company in Pennsylvania. Boring returned to Cornell for an A.M. in physics, but he was instead drawn to the world of psychology by I. Madison Bentley’s animal <b>psychology</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
25|$|Titchener {{presented}} Boring {{with his}} first opportunity not only to teach but also to practice writing {{about the history of}} experimental psychology. Titchener wanted to redesign a systematic <b>psychology</b> <b>course</b> and enlisted his graduate students to do the job. It was a large task; the course covered the entire history of psychology in 3 lectures a week for 2 years. Boring {{and the rest of the}} team read through German literature on experimental psychology and many other primary sources of information to complete this project. The finished product was a 200-lecture course. The task sparked Boring's interest in the history that shaped the field; it would also serve as great training for Boring's later publication of his own text, The History of Experimental Psychology, in 1929. The work also gave Boring experience in teaching psychology. He continued to teach psychology at Cornell for 4 years but was glad when the war forced him to leave this position, as he felt that Cornell did not need him.|$|E

40|$|Teaching of <b>psychology</b> <b>courses</b> trains {{graduate}} students in pedagogy, but {{little is known about}} how diversity is addressed in these courses. A survey of instructors in teaching of <b>psychology</b> <b>courses</b> assessed their coverage of diversity and classroom bias, as well as the instructional methods used to cover them. Results indicated that 87 % of instructors covered diversity issues, and 78 % covered bias that occurs in the classroom. Instructors who covered diversity and bias devoted 3 to 5 hr to the topics and primarily used traditional instructional methods, such as discussion, readings, and lectures. Older instructors tended to cover fewer topics than younger instructors. Although diversity topics are part of teaching of <b>psychology</b> <b>courses,</b> {{it is unlikely that the}} time devoted to the topics is sufficient preparation for teaching in diverse classrooms...|$|R

2500|$|Walden Two {{was criticized}} in John Staddon's The New Behaviorism. Skinner thought Walden Two an {{accomplishment}} comparable to two science-fiction classics: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1931) and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). [...] He assigned all three in his Nat Sci 114 introductory <b>psychology</b> <b>course</b> at Harvard. [...] There is some irony in Skinner’s choice, because Orwell’s and Huxley’s novels are both dystopias. [...] They portray not the supposed {{benefits of a}} technological approach to human society, but the evil consequences of either coercive (Nineteen Eighty-Four) or stealthy (Brave New World) efforts to control or gentle human beings. [...] On the contrary, Walden Two is supposed to light the technological path to utopia.|$|E
5000|$|Instructor {{personality}} is {{one factor that}} {{has been shown to}} affect course evaluations. For example, in one study examining the big five personality dimensions, teachers who were perceived to be more extroverted, open, agreeable, and conscientious were evaluated more favorably, whereas teachers who were perceived to be more neurotic were evaluated less favorably. Further, Murray and colleagues suggested that the effects of instructor personality on student evaluations of instructor vary across the type of course. [...] Although some traits, like a teacher’s leadership, consistently predicted course evaluations, other traits varied across type of course. For example, a teacher’s sociability positively predicted course evaluations in introductory <b>psychology</b> <b>courses,</b> but not graduate <b>psychology</b> <b>courses,</b> whereas the ambition of an instructor showed the opposite relationship - predicting evaluations of graduate, but not introductory <b>psychology</b> <b>courses.</b>|$|R

40|$|Project-based {{learning}} (PBL) is {{a teaching}} approach where students {{engage in the}} investigation of real-world problems through their inquiries. Studies found considerable support for PBL on student performance and improvement in grades K- 12 and at the collegiate level. However, fewer studies have examined the effects of PBL at the collegiate level in comparison to K- 12 education. No studies have examined the effects of PBL with preservice teachers taking educational <b>psychology</b> <b>courses.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide an analysis of PBL with preservice teachers taking educational <b>psychology</b> <b>courses.</b> An experiment was conducted throughout two semesters to evaluate student achievement and satisfaction in an undergraduate educational <b>psychology</b> child development <b>course</b> and in an undergraduate educational <b>psychology</b> assessments <b>course,</b> which included the same students from the first semester. Student achievement was determined using quantitative and qualitative analyses in each semester and longitudinally. Results in semester one indicated that the comparison group outperformed the PBL group. Results in semester two suggested there were no differences in instructional styles between groups. Longitudinal analyses showed that the comparison group declined in performance over time, whereas the PBL group improved over time; although, the comparison group still outperformed the PBL group. Results of this study indicate that PBL was not an influential teaching method for preservice teachers taking educational <b>psychology</b> <b>courses...</b>|$|R
