30|$|The water {{layer of}} {{extremely}} high turbidity {{observed in a}} terminal basin on the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> soon after the 2004 off-Kii Peninsula earthquakes was studied by a high-resolution subbottom profiler. Comparing the seafloor depths from surveys in 2004 and 2010, {{the thickness of the}} BTL was estimated to be more than 2.5  m. The BTL thickness was independently estimated to be 2.6  m by submersion of a heat-flow probe system in the turbid layer. The existence of this thick BTL suggests that a large amount of sediment may have settled out of suspension before the first dive 20  days after the mainshock. The subbottom profile across the terminal basin was characterized by a sequence of homogeneous transparent layers. We conclude that the thin veneer of sediment on the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> could be mobilized to flow into the basin by earthquake shaking and create the observed BTL. Accordingly, {{it can be said that}} a terminal basin on a <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> can serve as an excellent earthquake recorder.|$|E
30|$|BSRs {{were present}} across the area, {{ranging from the}} forearc basin to the accretionary <b>prism</b> <b>slope.</b> These were {{verified}} {{for the first time}} at the accretionary prism toe and at the trough floor offshore of the Tokai region.|$|E
40|$|The petrophysical {{properties}} of fine-grained marine sediments {{to a large}} extent depend on the microstructureand crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs). In this contributionwe showthat Rietveld-based synchrotrontexture analysis is a newand valuable tool to quantify textures ofwater-saturated fine-grained phyllosilicate-richsediments, and assess the effects of compaction and tectonic deformation. Westudied the CPO of compositionallyalmost homogeneous silty clay drillcore samples from the Nankai Accretionary <b>Prism</b> <b>slope</b> and the incomingPhilippine Sea plate, offshore SWJapan. Basal planes of phyllosilicates show bedding-parallel alignment increasingwith drillhole depth, thus reflecting progressive burial and compaction. In some samples calcite and albitedisplay a CPO due to crystallographically controlled non-isometric grain shapes, or nannofossil tests. Consolidated-undrained experimental deformation of a suite of thirteen samples from the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> showsthat the CPOs of phyllosilicate and calcite basal planes develop normal to the experimental shortening axis. There is at least a qualitative relation between CPO intensity and strain magnitude. Scanning electronmicrographs show concurrent evolution of preferred orientations of micropores and detrital illite flakes normalto axial shortening. This indicates that the microfabrics are sensitive strain gauges, and contribute to anisotropicphysical properties along with the CPO...|$|E
30|$|The {{reactivated}} {{deformation of}} the accretionary <b>prism</b> with continuous <b>slope</b> deposition occurred later than ~[*] 1.3  Ma (Fig.  5 c). The growth strata {{might have been}} associated with uplift of the accretionary prism (Fig.  5 c). The anticlinal uplift of the accretionary <b>prism</b> with <b>slope</b> sediments caused erosion in place (US 1), and a subsurface slope might have appeared (Fig.  5 c).|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the novel {{fabrication}} of optically variable watermarks (OVW) in a transparent substrate. The OVW is incorporated into the substrate via an embossing process. The master embossing die is produced {{by a combination of}} electron beam lithography, greytone photolithography, and precision electroplating techniques. The micro-embossing into polypropylene film is performed at 130 °C and 100 kN, a similar pressure to that used in intaglio printing. The optical effect produced by the device corresponds to a switch from one image to another as the device is observed in transmission when held in front of a light source and moved up and down. The image switching mechanism {{is a result of the}} refraction of the incident light through the embossed interlaced rows of micro-prisms, with the two different images corresponding to opposite <b>prism</b> <b>slopes.</b> Specific results reported here include an OVW image switch from a "$" to a " 50 " symbol and a second test image corresponding to an image switch from a portrait to a logo style image. Applications of the OVW technology include anti-counterfeiting protection for polymer banknotes, identity cards with transparent regions and labels attached to brand name products...|$|R
40|$|Pogonophoran tube worms, {{elongated}} pyrite {{tubes and}} authigenic carbonate nodules {{are used to}} evaluate the occurrence of potential cold seeps in the syn-collision accretionary <b>prism</b> Kaoping <b>Slope</b> off SW Taiwan. At least two species of pogonophoran tubeworms were found in surface and core sediments. Pyrites occur in three different forms: fillings inside foraminiferal chambers, cements between calcareous microfossils, and elongated tubes. The bottom water off SW Taiwan is aerobic, but authigenic pyrites are found in the surface sediments at several sites, suggesting the existence of local reducing environments enabling the formation of pyrites. These environments are most likely caused by the occurrence of active cold seeps where methane expulses. Authigenic carbonates with highly depleted carbon isotope values (- 54 to - 43 â°) were found at more than 5 locations, in agreement with a methane-derived source for the carbon...|$|R
30|$|In {{the same}} manner, the heat flow {{exhibited}} a minimum value when the average P-wave velocity {{was set at}} its highest value. Because {{the wide range of}} P-wave velocities (1700 – 1900  m/s) ensured an appropriate error evaluation, the error of the heat flow produced by the maximum and minimum P-wave velocities must be within 11 %. The different physical properties of the forearc basin at IODP Site C 0002 and the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> at ODP Site 1178 caused an average error of 5.2 %.|$|E
30|$|Seismic shaking {{is a major}} {{trigger for}} {{sediment}} redistribution in subduction zones, and clouds of dilute suspended sediment {{have been reported in}} association with large earthquakes. Dive observations in a basin on the slope of the central Nankai accretionary prism soon after the 2004 off-Kii Peninsula earthquakes documented a layer of suspended sediment with extremely high turbidity. We estimated the thickness of this bottom turbid layer to be more than 2.5  m by comparison of seafloor depths between surveys in 2004 and 2010 and about 2.6  m from instrumental evidence involving the submersion of a heat-flow probe. A high-resolution subbottom profiling survey across the basin revealed acoustically transparent layers thicker than 2  m. Because the slope basin is a terminal basin completely enclosed by topographic highs, we examined the possibility that the uppermost transparent layer was deposited {{as a consequence of the}} 2004 earthquakes. Considering the sediment source area and the volume of the basin fills, the mobilization and redeposition of thin surface sediments on the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> can account for the volume of the transparent layer. We conclude that the 2004 earthquakes caused widespread disturbance of the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> and concentrated surface sediments in this terminal basin. Our results emphasize the utility of a terminal basin in a subduction zone as an earthquake recorder.|$|E
30|$|Ashi et al. (2012) {{reported}} seafloor disturbances due to earthquake {{shaking and}} their evolution between the cruises in 2004 and 2010. The September 2004 cruise started 2  weeks after the mainshock of the 2004 off-Kii Peninsula earthquakes. Twelve ROV dives (dives 29 to 36 and 40 to 43) were conducted near the epicenters (Figure  1). All dive {{observations on the}} <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> noted a snow-like suspension of marine particles within 200 to 320  m of the seafloor (Ashi et al. 2012), but this dilute suspension layer (DSL) was not recognized in the forearc basin site (dives 30, 31, and 32). The DSL on the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> was ascribed to clouds of suspended sediment produced by mass movements at multiple locations during the earthquakes. Dives 40, 41, and 42 documented a localized layer of extremely high turbidity {{at the bottom of}} the slope basin (site NG 2 hereafter) (Figure  2). The upper boundary of this high-turbidity layer was very clearly defined and exhibited a pseudo-seafloor on video images (Ashi et al. 2012). This first cruise, therefore, revealed two types of turbid layers: a widespread DSL and a localized bottom turbid layer (BTL) at site NG 2. The BTL was estimated to be at least 1.5 -m thick from its complete burial of a pogo-type heat-flow probe system (Figure  2).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{computer}} program written in FORTRAN 90 specifically designed to determine the Bouguer anomaly from publicly available global gridded free-air anomaly and elevation database sets. FA 2 BOUG computes the complete Bouguer correction (i. e. Bullard A, B and C corrections) for both land and sea points in several spatial domains according to {{the distance between the}} topography and the calculation point. In each zone a different algorithm is used. In a distant zone we consider the harmonic spherical expansion of the potential of each right rectangular prism representing an elevation grid point. In an intermediate zone we compute the gravitational attraction produced by each prism using the analytic formula. Finally, an inner zone contribution is divided into two parts: a flat-topped prism with a height equal to the elevation of the calculation point, and four quadrants of a conic <b>prism</b> <b>sloping</b> continuously from each square of the inner zone to the calculation point. The program has been applied to the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition zone to obtain a complete Bouguer anomaly map of the area, integrating available onshore Bouguer anomaly with satellite-derived free-air anomaly data. Positive Bouguer anomalies are found in the Atlantic oceanic domain (240 – 300 mGal), central and eastern Alboran Basin (40 – 160 mGal) and SW Iberian Peninsula (> 40 mGal). Major negative Bouguer anomalies are located beneath the west Alboran Basin (<− 40 mGal), the Rif, the Rharb Basin and the Atlas Mountains (<− 120 mGal). An isostatic residual anomaly map of the study area has been computed and compared with the crustal and lithospheric structure inferred from previous work.

40|$|Over {{the last}} four years Potgietersrust Platinums (PPRust) has {{successfully}} implemented new geotechnical strategy and tactics to reduce risk, improving safety but also maximising profitability. A large database of core logging, face mapping and rock testing has been assembled and used in the slope design process. The data has also been used for optimising blast designs on a daily basis {{through the use of a}} geotechnical block model. This greatly improves blast fragmentation and therefore loading and milling efficiencies. Slope management includes a limit blasting programme, daily visual inspections, and state-of-the-art slope monitoring equipment, namely GroundProbe radar, Riegl lasers and GeoMoS automated <b>prism</b> monitoring. <b>Slope</b> optimisation incorporates all the field data, operational controls, cost of failure, full economic analysis of various slope angles and fault tree analysis. Savings on waste stripping of hundreds of millions of Rands were gained from the optimisation as slope angles could be increased due to improved geotechnical knowledge and management.

30|$|Suspended {{sediment}} clouds {{have also}} been recognized after the 2004 off-Kii Peninsula earthquakes (maximum magnitude 7.4) in the Nankai subduction zone (Ashi et al. 2012). Such a layer of extremely high turbidity was observed in a basin on the <b>prism</b> <b>slope.</b> This layer is apparently similar to lutoclines observed between heavily mud-laden bottom layers and clearer overlying layers in estuaries and muddy coastal environments (e.g., Wolanski et al. 1988). This study reports details of the observation of a bottom turbid layer in the slope basin off Kii Peninsula, documents sedimentary structures from a subbottom profiling survey, and discusses the source and redeposition processes associated with the high-turbidity layer.|$|E
30|$|The Nankai Trough, {{formed by}} the northwestward {{subduction}} of the Philippine Sea Plate (PHP in Fig.  1) beneath the Eurasian plate at approximately 4  cm/year (e.g., Seno et al. 1993), is a plate boundary where earthquakes of magnitude 8 have occurred at intervals of 100 – 200  years (e.g., Satake 2015). Recent megathrust earthquakes with magnitude classes of 8 in the Nankai subduction zone include the Tonankai earthquake in 1944 and the Nankai earthquake in 1946 (e.g., Kanamori 1972). The geological structure in the Nankai accretionary margin can be divided from the southeast to the northwest into a deformation front, a <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> with slope basins, an outer ridge associated with a megasplay fault, and a forearc basin. The Kumano Basin, {{one of the major}} forearc basins along the Nankai Trough, is approximately 100  km from east to west and approximately 70  km from north to south (Morita et al. 2004). The Nankai Trough is characterized by a shallow trench due to the subduction of the young plate and contains thick trench-fill sediments at a water depth of approximately 4000  m ranging from south of Suruga Bay to the northern tip of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge.|$|E
30|$|A final {{factor that}} can {{influence}} the chemical and isotopic compositions of the pore fluids is the freshwater derived from MH dissociation. MH has never actually been recovered from Site C 0001, which is situated in a position similar to the Oomine Ridge (Ashi et al. [2009 a]). However, discontinuous bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) suggesting the presence of MH have been observed beneath {{the slope of the}} Nankai accretionary prism (e.g., Colwell et al. [2004]). Moreover, MH was recovered from several hundred meters below the seafloor at Site C 0008, which is near the surface trace of another megasplay fault on the seaward side of the Oomine Ridge (Screaton et al. [2009]). In general, MH is recovered where sand layers occur (Ginsburg et al. [2000]), although beneath the Nankai accretionary <b>prism</b> <b>slope,</b> which is composed mainly of silty clay, dispersed MH may be present (Screaton et al. [2009]). Taken together, these findings suggest that it is possible for freshwater derived from MH dissociation to contribute to the fluids supplied to the cold seeps on the Oomine Ridge. Therefore, we also considered freshwater from MH dissociation in our estimation of possible contributions to the seepage fluid.|$|E
40|$|High-resolution multibeam {{bathymetry}} {{data from}} the Sumatran subduction zone reveal the regional and local morphology, including small-scale fault-related features and landslides that {{may be linked to}} earthquakes in the recent geological past. The accretionary <b>prism</b> is steeply <b>sloped</b> and pervasively eroded, with evidence of unusual landward vergence (seaward fault dip) of the frontal thrusts. Small-scale (5 – 100 m height) fault scarps, folds, and troughs are common along the seaward edge of the frontal thrust at the deformation front. A model of back-thrust fault slip or bending moment folding during plate-boundary slip, such as during the 2004 M 9. 2 megathrust earthquake, can explain the position of these features on the seaward fold limb of a seaward-dipping thrust. We infer that in major Sumatran (and other similar settings) plate-boundary earthquakes, coseismic surface rupture may occur at the prism toe...|$|R
40|$|Multichannel seismic {{reflection}} data recorded between Itata (36 °S) and Coyhaique offshores (43 °S) were processed {{to obtain}} seismic images. Analysis of the seismic profiles revealed that weak and discontinuous bottom simulating reflectors were associated to basal accretion processes, while strong and continuous bottom simulating reflectors were associated to frontal accretion processes. This {{can be explained}} considering that during basal accretion processes, extensional tectonic movements due to uplifting can favour fluid escapes giving origin to weaker and most discontinuous bottom simulating reflectors. During frontal accretion processes (folding and thrusting), high fluid circulation and stable tectonic conditions however can be responsible of stronger and most continuous bottom simulating reflectors. Along the Arauco-Valdivia offshores, steep accretionary <b>prisms,</b> normal faults, <b>slope</b> basins, and thicker underplated sediment bed were associated to basal accretion, while along the Itata, Chiloe and Coyhaique offshores, small accretionary prisms, folding, and thinner underplated sediment bed were associated to frontal accretion...|$|R

30|$|We {{examined}} {{the possibility that}} surface sediment from the <b>prism</b> <b>slope</b> flowed episodically into the terminal basin, given that the basin is isolated from terrigenous sources and has no outflow pathway. The source area capable of supplying sediment to the basin by sediment gravity flow (white dotted line in Figure  1) has an area of about 85  km 2. Although this value was estimated without consideration of sediment transport beyond barriers, {{it is assumed that}} a considerable amount of sediment could pass over topographic highs. Muck and Underwood (1990) indicated that the maximum run-up elevation of a turbidity current is approximately equal to 1.53 times the flow thickness, which was determined through field observations, theory, and laboratory models. The thicknesses of dilute suspension layers during the 2004 earthquakes were more than 200  m in the study area (Ashi et al. 2012). Moreover, the thickness of the similar turbidity anomalies observed during the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake increased with depth up to about 1, 300  m above the seafloor (Noguchi et al. 2012). Although there is no evidence about how much the height barrier turbidity currents or suspension clouds were that passed beyond, the source area capable of supplying sediment to the basin is 688  km 2 for the case of a 100 -m-high barrier (white dashed line in Figure  1).|$|E
40|$|The {{streams and}} rivers of the Ozark Plateaus are an unrivaled natural {{resource}} for the region. They provide habitat {{to some of the}} North America’s most abundant and rich biodiversity, while also serving as water sources for human drinking, agricultural, and recreational needs. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has identified several priority watersheds through its Ozarks Ecoregional Conservation Assessment of 2003, where it focuses its on-the ground conservation planning and implementation efforts. Sedimentation from unpaved roads is a primary threat to water quality in Ozark streams. TNC has partnered with various organizations including the US Forest Service (USFS), the Watershed Conservation Resource Center (WCRC), and others to develop a multi-phased approach to address the impacts of unpaved roads on these priority watersheds. The first step in the approach utilizes advanced GIS/GPS technologies to develop a detailed vehicle-based road inventory of the target watershed or subwatershed. Sub-meter differential GPS with customized data dictionaries are used to characterize the location and function of sediment-producing and conveying features of the road infrastructure, including the road surface, <b>prism</b> and <b>slope,</b> ditches, bars, lead-offs, culverts, crossings, and outlets. The road inventory yields a comprehensive geodatabase and map series of the mapped features. A stratified random sample of the inventoried road network is then measured to generate sediment yield predictions on ten percent of the road network. Detailed field measurements are collected with differential GPS and customized data dictionaries. The data are entered into the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process-based erosion prediction model developed by multiple federal agencies over the past 20 years. With sediment yields predicted for sample sites, erosion predictions are then extrapolated for the entire study watershed using the road inventory geodatabase. Once sedimentation yields are predicted for each road segment in the entire study area, priority sub-watersheds are identified in the GIS using watershed sediment accumulation tools. These sub-watersheds with high potential for sediment yield may be compared to species inventory data, stream bank erosion surveys, and other land use information to set priorities for conservation planning and prioritization efforts. Priority infrastructure maintenance improvements are also identified through features that were flagged in the road inventory geodatabase as needing repair or replacement. Road maintenance workshops are held with USFS engineers, county road crews, and other partners to transfer the inventory information, present the findings of the study and to demonstrate best management practices for road maintenance. Since 2004, TNC and its partners in the Arkansas have worked in three priority Ozark watersheds to inventory over 600 miles of unpaved roads and 3000 associated point features in an area greater than 900 square miles. The area comprises over thirty 6 th level (12 -digit) HUCs...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{bathymetric}} {{data and}} multichannel seismic data, the Manila subduction system {{is divided into}} three segments, the North Luzon segment, the seamount chain segment and the West Luzon segment starts in Southwest Taiwan and runs as far as Mindoro. The volume variations of the accretionary <b>prism,</b> the forearc <b>slope</b> angle, taper angle variations support the segmentation of the Manila subduction system. The accretionary prism is composed of the outer wedge and the inner wedge separated by the slope break. The backstop structure and a 0. 5 - 1 km thick subduction channel are interpreted in the seismic Line 973 located in the northeastern South China Sea. The clear d,collement horizon reveals the oceanic sediment has been subducted beneath the accretionary prism. A number of splay faults occur in the active outer wedge. Taper angles vary from 8. 0 A degrees A A +/- A 1 A degrees in the North Luzon segment, 9. 9 A degrees A A +/- A 1 A degrees in the seamount segment to 11 A degrees A A +/- A 1 A degrees in the West Luzon segment. Based on variations between the taper angle and orthogonal convergence rates in the world continental margins and comparison between our results and the global compilation, different segments of the Manila subduction system fit well the global pattern. It suggests that subduction accretion dominates the north Luzon and seamount chain segment, but the steep slope indicates in the West Luzon segment and implies that tectonic erosion could dominate the West Luzon segment. We thank the crew members of the R/V Tanbao for their efforts for collecting the Line 973 seismic data.

40|$|International audienceBecause of its {{location}} in an active margin context, the sand-rich Orinoco turbidite system is controlled morphologically and tectonically by the compressional {{structures of the}} Barbados prism, and as a consequence, the sedimentation system does not exhibit a classic fan geometry. The sea-floor geometry between {{the slope of the}} front of the Barbados <b>prism</b> and the <b>slope</b> of the Guyana margin induces the convergence of the turbidite channels toward the abyssal plain {{at the front of the}} Barbados accretionary prism. Also, whereas in most passive margins the turbidite systems are commonly organized upstream to downstream as canyon, then channel levee, then lobes, here, because of the control by active tectonics, the sedimentary system is organized as channel levee, then canyons, then channelized lobes. In shallow water, landward of the prism, the system has multiple sources with several distributaries, and progressively downward, the channel courses are more complex with frequent convergences or divergences that are emphasized by the effects of the undulating sea-floor morphologies. Erosional processes are almost absent in the upper part of the turbidite system shallower than 1500 m (4921 ft). Erosion along channels develops mostly between 2000 and 4000 m (6562 and 13, 123 ft) of water depth, above the compressional structures of the Barbados prism. Incisions show irregular meandering and sinuous courses in the low-relief segments and less sinuous courses where channels incise the structures. Larger incisions (canyons) are 3 km (1. 9 mi) wide and 300 m (984 ft) deep. The occurrence of different phases of successive incisions is responsible for the development of morphologically correlative terraces in both flanks of the canyons. This might be the consequence of two mechanisms: the tectonic activity of the deformation front characterized by progressive uplift and thrusting of recent sediments, and the superimposition of the cycles of the Orinoco turbidite system. Piston-core surveys have demonstrated that turbidite sediments moving through the channel and canyon system and deposited in the abyssal plain are mostly coarse sandy deposits covered by recent pelagic planktonic-rich sedimentation, which indicates that sand deposition slowed down during the postglacial sea level rise...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{wide-angle}} seismic data {{recorded on}} ocean bottom instruments of a combined onshore- offshore investigation on the tectonic framework of central Java {{are presented in}} this study. The joint inter- disciplinary project MERAMEX (Merapi Amphibious Experiment) was carried out to characterize the subduction of the Indo-Australian plate beneath Eurasia. Three marine wide-angle profiles are analyzed by combined forward- and inverse modeling of first and later arrival traveltimes and are integrated to- gether with gravity data. The {{results of this study}} are compared with former investigations off southern Sumatra, western Java and eastern Java to obtain a detailed image of the Java margin. The subduction of the oceanic Roo Rise plateau, located south of central Java, with its thickened and buoyant crust, strongly influences subduction dynamics. The trench is retreated about 60 km in a land- ward direction. Large scale forearc uplift is manifested in isolated forearc highs, reaching water depths of only 1000 m compared to 2000 m water depth off western Java, and results from oceanic basement relief subduction. The dip angle of the underthrusting oceanic lithosphere is 10 ◦ underneath the marine forearc and its crustal thickness increases eastward from 9 - 10 km over a distance of 100 km between both dip profiles off central Java, which is thicker than the global average of 7. 4 km. The incipient subduction of a broad band of seamounts off central Java causes frontal erosion of the margin here and leads to mass wasting due to oversteepening of the upper trench wall. The well-developed accretionary wedge off southern Sumatra and western Java diminishes into a small frontal <b>prism</b> with steep <b>slope</b> angles of the upper plate off central Java. This causes a persistent threat for generating tsunamis, which may also be triggered by smaller (Mw 8) earthquakes. The rough surface of the Indo-Australian plate with its volcanic edifices strongly influences the interplate coupling. A subducted and dismembered seamount is revealed on the eastern profile at the toe of the backstop in 15 km depth. This seamount and similar features present on the megathrust may potentially act as asperities or as barriers to seismic rupture, limiting lateral rupture propagation in the co-seismic phase. Subduction earthquakes with a magnitude ≥ 8 are not observed, while smaller earthquakes fre- quently occur. A remarkable clustering of earthquakes in the forearc mantle wedge below the shallow forearc Moho may be the seismic expression of seamount detachement...|$|R
40|$|Several marine {{geophysical}} {{data and}} piston-coring surveys acquired {{during the last}} decade allow one to better understand the close dynamic interactions between the sand-rich Orinoco turbidite system and the compressional structures of the Barbados prism. These interactions have been active since Eocene time as illustrated by the study of outcrops onshore Barbados Island. Because of strong morphologic and tectonic control in the east-Caribbean active margin, the present-day Orinoco turbiditic pattern system does not exhibit a classic fan geometry. The sea-floor geometry between the slope of the front of the Barbados <b>prism</b> and the <b>slope</b> of the South-American margin induces the convergence of the turbidite channels toward the abyssal plain, {{at the front of the}} accretionary prism. Also, whereas in most passive margins the turbidite systems are organized upstream to downstream as canyon, channel-levee and lobes, here, due to the tectonic control, the sedimentary system is organized upstream to downstream as channel-levee, canyons and channelized lobes. Indeed, at the edge of the Orinoco platform, the system has multiple sources with several distributaries and downstream the channel courses are complex with frequent convergences or divergences that are emphasized by the effects of the undulating seafloor tectonic morphologies associated with active thrust tectonics and mud volcanism. On top of the accretionary prism, turbidite sediments are filling transported piggy-back basins whose timing of sedimentation vs. deformation is complex. While erosion processes are almost absent on the highly subsiding Orinoco platform and in the upper part of the turbidite system, they develop mostly between 2000 and 4000 m of water depth, above the compressional structures of the Barbados prism (canyons up to 3 km wide and 300 m deep). In the abyssal plain, the main turbiditic channel develops toward the east and connects with the Vidal mid-Atlantic channel. The sediments transported in this channel are filling several elongated basins linked with fracture zones (notably the Barracuda Basin), and finally end their course in the Puerto-Rico trench, the deepest morphologic depression of the region. Piston-cores have demonstrated that turbidite sediments above the accretionary prism and in the abyssal plain are mostly coarse sandy deposits covered by recent pelagic planktonic-rich sediments, which corresponds to slower sand deposition during the post-glacial sea level rise. Numerical stratigraphic modelling suggests that during the last glacial event, the main depocentres were located above the tectonic prism and in the abyssal plain, at the front of the prism and that, during the Holocene eustatic rise, a large accommodation space formed on the shelf confining sedimentation mostly on the Orinoco deltaic platform and producing a starvation downstream in the turbidite system...|$|R
40|$|As long linear ecosystems, {{rivers and}} streams are {{particularly}} vulnerable to fragmentation. There is growing concern {{about the role of}} road crossings – and especially culverts – in altering habitats and disrupting river and stream continuity. The River and Stream Continuity Project began in the year 2000 with a startup grant from the Massachusetts Watershed Initiative. The University of Massachusetts took the lead in convening a group of people from a variety of agencies and organizations who were concerned about the impact of road-stream crossings on fish and other aquatic organism passage. In 2005, three of the organizations/agencies that were key players in initiating and implementing the project joined to create the River and Stream Continuity Partnership. Founding members of the Partnership include: • UMass Extension (University of Massachusetts Amherst) • Massachusetts Riverways Program (MA Department of Fish and Game) and • The Nature Conservancy Members of the Partnership have made a commitment to the ongoing implementation of the River and Stream Continuity Project, including updates and revisions to the MA River and Stream Crossing Standards, coordination and implementation of volunteer assessments, management of the Continuity database, and projects to upgrade or replace substandard crossing structures. Since its beginning, the River and Stream Continuity Project has: • Developed “Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing Standards” to facilitate river and stream continuity as well as fish and wildlife passage. These standards are referenced in federal and state regulations and policies affecting road-stream crossings. • Created a field protocol for volunteer assessment of road-stream crossings, including data forms, instructions, and training materials. • Developed a system for scoring crossing structures for their effects on river and stream continuity and aquatic organism passage based on volunteer assessments. • Created an online database for data on road-stream crossings collected by volunteers. All crossings are geo-refer enced and information from the database can be easily used in a GIS to depict the location and score of all as sessed structures in participating states. • Developed a statewide GIS coverage prioritizing all mapped stream segments in Massachusetts into three catego ries based on information about their importance for fish and wildlife. • Conducted volunteer assessments of road-stream crossings in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire. • Initiated demonstration projects to mitigate known barriers to aquatic organism passage on high-priority streams. • Developed workshops, presentations and other educational material on the subject of river and stream continuity and the Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing Standards. Sedimentation from unpaved roads is a primary threat to water quality in Ozark streams. TNC has partnered with various organizations including the US Forest Service (USFS), the Watershed Conservation Resource Center (WCRC), and others to develop a multi-phased approach to address the impacts of unpaved roads on these priority watersheds. The first step in the approach utilizes advanced GIS/GPS technologies to develop a detailed vehicle-based road inventory of the target watershed or subwatershed. Sub-meter differential GPS with customized data dictionaries are used to characterize the location and function of sediment-producing and conveying features of the road infrastructure, including the road surface, <b>prism</b> and <b>slope,</b> ditches, bars, lead-offs, culverts, crossings, and outlets. The road inventory yields a comprehensive geodatabase and map series of the mapped features. A stratified random sample of the inventoried road network is then measured to generate sediment yield predictions on ten percent of the road network. Detailed field measurements are collected with differential GPS and customized data dictionaries. The data are entered into the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process-based erosion prediction model developed by multiple federal agencies over the past 20 years. With sediment yields predicted for sample sites, erosion predictions are then extrapolated for the entire study watershed using the road inventory geodatabase. Once sedimentation yields are predicted for each road segment in the entire study area, priority sub-watersheds are identified in the GIS using watershed sediment accumulation tools. These sub-watersheds with high potential for sediment yield may be compared to species inventory data, stream bank erosion surveys, and other land use information to set priorities for conservation planning and prioritization efforts. Priority infrastructure maintenance improvements are also identified through features that were flagged in the road inventory geodatabase as needing repair or replacement. Road maintenance workshops are held with USFS engineers, county road crews, and other partners to transfer the inventory information, present the findings of the study and to demonstrate best management practices for road maintenance. Since 2004, TNC and its partners in the Arkansas have worked in three priority Ozark watersheds to inventory over 600 miles of unpaved roads and 3000 associated point features in an area greater than 900 square miles. The area comprises over thirty 6 th level (12 -digit) HUCs...|$|R
