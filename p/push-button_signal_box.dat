50|$|The {{station was}} opened with the Hamburg-Lübeck railway by the Lübeck-Büchen Railway Company (Lübeck-Büchener Eisenbahn, LBE) on 1 August 1865. The station became a branch station on 10 December 1875 with the {{building}} of the line to Neumünster by the Altona-Kiel Railway Company (Altona-Kieler Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). The Altona-Kiel Railway Company was taken over 1884 by the Prussian state railways and it opened a line to Schwarzenbek on 1 August 1887. The line to Ratzeburg was put into operation on 15 August 1897, also by the Prussian state railways. Both lines crossed the line to Hamburg to the south of the station on flyovers. Operations of the Elmshorn-Bad Oldesloe railway began on 9 June 1907. The station was built as an Inselbahnhof ("island station", that is the station building was surrounded by rail tracks) to handle the increase of traffic. The Prussian state railways tracks were in the north-western part of the station, while the LBE's were in the southeastern part. This separation ended with the nationalisation of the LBE in 1938. The entrance building was destroyed during an air raid on 24 April 1945. Due to the progressive loss of traffic on branch lines from Bad Oldesloe from 1959, the north-western part of the station became superfluous. Today it consists only of a dead-end platform track with a bypass for trains to and from Hamburg. Its northern exit no longer exists. The existing signal boxes were replaced by a <b>push-button</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> in 1973. The current entrance building was built in 1998 to the north-west of the remaining tracks. Tracks 1 and 2 were built over. The former island station platform and central platform 6/7 are reached by an underpass, which is also accessible from the south-eastern side of the station, and the platforms are connected by stairs and lifts. The goods yard to the east of the Lübeck-Hamburg line has lost all of its tracks and the area has been remodelled, although some goods sheds still exist. The shunting and storage sidings to the south have been largely dismantled. Between the line to Ratzeburg (now the industrial connecting track to Besendorf) and the main line, there are still remnants of the locomotive depot as well as the locomotive shed, which is used for commercial purposes. Since 2008 the Lübeck-Hamburg railway has been electrified, while the line branching to Neumünster is operated by Nordbahn with LINT 41 diesel multiple units. According to a 2010 survey, electrification of the line would have a benefit-cost ratio of only 0.6. The platform canopy of tracks 6/7 has heritage protection.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} signalled by {{a mixture of}} semaphore signals and colour lights by several <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> over the years. Almost every station had a <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> Lewes even had five <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> controlling the area including the goods yard. Polegate had three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and other <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at Willingdon and Stone Cross junctions and at Pevensey Bay and Cooden Beach There were also crossing boxes at Ripe, between Glynde and Berwick, and at Wilmington, between Berwick and Polegate.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2013 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was repainted externally. In June 2016 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{frame and}} point {{connecting}} rods were renewed increasing {{the life expectancy}} of the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and reducing the chance of failure ...|$|R
50|$|Bidston {{had four}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in 1899. These <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{situated}} alongside the Dee, West, East and North junctions. The nearest {{to the station}} was the Bidston Dee Junction box. The second Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{was built in the}} 1930s by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and was much larger than the earlier <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> which had been built by the Wirral Railway. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> had a 65-lever frame and also took over the operation of Bidston North Junction, when built. Bidston Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was closed on 17 September 1994, and demolished two months later on 20 November.|$|R
50|$|The {{dismantling}} of the Rhenish line between Steinfurt and St. Arnold started on 30 September 2005. Of the four former <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> two have already been demolished, the Bn <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on the Rhenish line and the Bmf <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> which was located on the former middle platform. The two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on the Enschede line (the Bf <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the south and}} the Bw <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the north of the}} station) are still standing, but are out of service. Since 26 October 2008, signalling and points at the station have been remotely controlled from the electronic signalling centre at Coesfeld (Westf) station.|$|R
50|$|The station did {{not have}} a passing loop being only a block post {{splitting}} the line into two sections. It had a goods yard, <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> goods shed, and a level crossing with gates. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> near the level crossing was replaced by a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> located on the platform in 1915. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was renamed Dousland from Dousland Barn.|$|R

One day before, the dispatchers <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jm", {{was taken out}} of operation. The guard <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Js", was also closed. Until September 2006, there was another <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jn". All were mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> of the Jüdel type.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{were opened}} in 1889, the 13-lever North <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Torquay Road level crossing, the 17-lever South <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Sands Road level crossing. Both were {{replaced}} in 1924 by two new boxes. The North box closed on 26 March 1988 when control of trains {{was transferred to}} the Panel <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> at Exeter but the South box was retained to monitor the two level crossings. In 1990 this function was transferred to a panel in the station buildings and the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> closed.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{computerised}} railway control {{methods are}} making traditional railway <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> obsolete and most <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> owned by Network Rail in Great Britain will close by 2026. Many of these <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> have a listing as buildings of architectural or historical significance. Listed buildings should ideally {{remain in their}} original location and this particularly applies to <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> where the railway environment is an intrinsic aspect of the listing. However, there is pressure to relocate redundant listed and heritage <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> Primary research methodology is by focusing upon key exemplars to determine the actual situation against theoretical conservation policy and practice. Findings are that while relocation affects the building’s conservation integrity, presentation of relocated <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in a heritage railway environment provides for interpretation of railway history. The conclusions identify that there are contradictory requirements and pressures in conserving heritage <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> These pressures materially affect the conservation process {{and there is a}} need to redefine accepted conservation theory to cope with the realties of <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> preservation. This will necessitate engagement by all interested parties and a systematic identification of all affected <b>signal</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Oban {{originally}} had two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> namely Oban Station <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> (the larger of the two), and Oban Goods Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> The latter was situated {{about a quarter}} mile further south, where the line to the goods yard and engine shed diverged from the single line. The original <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> contained 21 and 5 levers, respectively. The single line between the two boxes was doubled in 1881.|$|R
50|$|The Weilheim station {{originally}} had three mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 1 controlled movements between {{different parts of}} the station precinct and was located at the northern end of the station west of the tracks. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 2 was operated by the train despatcher and was situated south of the entrance building between the local loading tracks and the station building. Both were mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1902. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 3 was a mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1925, which controlled the marshalling yard and was located {{at the southern end of}} the sidings to the west of the station. In 1983, the three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were replaces by a centralised <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> with a track-plan push-button interlocking of the Lorenz L60 class, which is housed in an cubic, three-storey building with an attached observation deck. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> controls, in addition to the Weilheim station area, the Wilzhofen and Polling areas. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is located on the main platform north of the entrance building.|$|R

5000|$|... 14 {{mechanical}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{were built}} for {{the operation of the}} freight yard, mainly of the Bruchsal G design. Over the years, <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> B and D were abolished during the replacement of sets of points and in 1974 <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> 5, 7, 8 (old), 10 and 11 were replaced during the commissioning of the new central <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> B8. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 4 was destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War and reconstructed in 1947 in a different style with yellow clinker brickwork and a lever frame of the Jüdel design from old spare parts. In the 1960s, an electro-mechanical lever frame of a 1907 design was installed in the previously mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> A and, in addition, the approach track received three beam retarders. In 1971, colour light signals were installed on the western hump. These are operated centrally by the dispatcher at the western hump, who was moved from <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 2 to exit <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 1 at the same time. During the construction of the Engelsdorf crossing structure, which took the Leipzig-Geithain railway under the exit from the yard, exit <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> A and 3 were remodelled. Both were equipped with electro-mechanical lever frames of 1912 design with lamp monitoring and <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> A was relocated from its old position on the crossing structure to the already prepared Bremsturm (brake <b>signal</b> <b>box).</b> In 1988, the sorting tracks were equipped with screw-type track brakes so that since then no riders have been required to retard wagons.|$|R
50|$|The {{tracks of}} the former {{marshalling}} yard have been controlled since December 2008 by the electronic interlocking at the yard, which is also connected to the Munich operation centre. The track plan interlocking of 1951 and two mechanical interlocking of 1900 (<b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 3) and 1894 (<b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 1) were taken out of service at the same time. Since the commissioning of the Moosburg/Isar electronic interlocking and the related closure of <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in the Langenbach (Oberbayern) station, <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 2 in Laim yard has been Bavaria's oldest <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{that can be used}} to control signalling directly.|$|R
