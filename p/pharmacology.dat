5|$|New Hunt's House Library: Situated at Guy's Campus, {{the library}} covers {{all aspects of}} {{biomedical}} science, including anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, neuroscience, <b>pharmacology</b> and physiology. There are also extensive resources for medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy and health services.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is divided}} into 37 books, {{organised}} into ten volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, <b>pharmacology,</b> mining, mineralogy, sculpture, painting, and precious stones.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} the Navy, Shulgin {{returned}} to Berkeley, California, and in 1954 earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley. Through the late 1950s Shulgin completed post-doctoral {{work in the fields}} of psychiatry and <b>pharmacology</b> at University of California, San Francisco. After working at Bio-Rad Laboratories as a research director for a brief period, he began work at Dow Chemical Company as a senior research chemist.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine {{also offers}} the Doctor of Philosophy degree to train {{students}} as biomedical researchers and scientists. The PhD {{is available in}} six fields offered by the basic science departments: <b>pharmacology</b> and toxicology, molecular and cell biology, immunology, molecular pathogenesis, systems biology, and experimental and molecular medicine. Research and teaching positions at DMS and its centers and institutes are available to PhD candidates.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{corporeal}} beings and, as such, {{they are}} subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings {{play an important role in}} the philosophy of mind. There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: biology, computer science, cognitive science, cybernetics, linguistics, medicine, <b>pharmacology,</b> and psychology.|$|E
5|$|In <b>pharmacology,</b> {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, logp). For example, ionization of any compound {{will increase the}} solubility in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the pKa of an ionizable group.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and <b>pharmacology.</b> A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The Xinyi Xiangfayao was Su's best-known treatise, but the polymath {{compiled}} {{other works}} as well. He completed a large celestial atlas of several star maps, several terrestrial maps, {{as well as}} a treatise on <b>pharmacology.</b> The latter discussed related subjects on mineralogy, zoology, botany, and metallurgy.|$|E
5|$|While on {{the faculty}} at the University of Chicago, Kelsey was awarded her M.D. during 1950. She {{supplemented}} her teaching with work as an editorial associate for the American Medical Association Journal for two years. Kelsey left the University of Chicago in 1954, {{decided to take a}} position teaching <b>pharmacology</b> at the University of South Dakota, and moved with her husband and two daughters to Vermillion, South Dakota, where she taught until 1957.|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral <b>pharmacology.</b> This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical <b>Pharmacology</b> of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, {{which showed that}} the 107 deaths were caused {{by the use of}} diethylene glycol as a solvent. The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in <b>pharmacology</b> at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to her interest in teratogens, drugs that cause congenital malformations (birth defects).|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of <b>pharmacology</b> and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{research}} performance, High Impact Universities 2010 ranked Dalhousie 239th out of 500 universities, and 12th in Canada. The university was ranked 194th out of 500 universities and 12th {{in the country}} for research performance in the fields of medicine, dentistry, <b>pharmacology,</b> and health sciences. The Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT) ranked Dalhousie 279th in the world and 12th in Canada for its 2011 scientific paper's performances. HEEACT had also ranked Dalhousie 86th in the world and fourth nationally for research performance in geoscience in its 2010 rankings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the study}} of {{medicinal}} plants was not being neglected and a full synthesis of ancient Greek <b>pharmacology</b> was compiled in Materia Medica c. 60 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40-90 AD) who was a Greek physician with the Roman army. This work {{proved to be the}} definitive text on medicinal herbs, both oriental and occidental, for fifteen hundred years until the dawn of the European Renaissance being slavishly copied again and again throughout this period. Though rich in medicinal information with descriptions of about 600 medicinal herbs, the botanical content of the work was extremely limited.|$|E
5|$|Science in {{the medieval}} Islamic world was the science {{developed}} and practised during the Islamic Golden Age under the Umayyads of Córdoba, the Abbadids of Seville, the Samanids, the Ziyarids, Buyid Persia, Tamerlane's Transoxiana, the Abbasid Caliphate and beyond, spanning the period c. 800 to 1429. Islamic scientific achievements encompassed {{a wide range of}} subject areas, especially astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included alchemy and chemistry, botany, geography and cartography, ophthalmology, <b>pharmacology,</b> physics, and zoology.|$|E
5|$|Siddiqui is {{credited}} for pioneering {{the isolation of}} unique chemical compounds from the Neem (Azadirachta indica), Rauwolfia, and various other flora. As the founder director of H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry, he revolutionised the research on <b>pharmacology</b> of various domestic plants found in South Asia to extract novel chemical substances of medicinal importance. During his career, Siddiqui published more than 300 research papers and obtained 40 patents mainly {{from the field of}} natural product chemistry. In addition to his scientific talents, Siddiqui was also an avid painter, a poet, and a great connoisseur of Western music. His paintings were exhibited in the United States, Germany, India, and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{facilities}} and patronage {{provided by the}} Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in different branches of knowledge and learning throughout the territories they controlled. They took special interest {{in the fields of}} medicine, <b>pharmacology,</b> and botany. Saladin built and maintained two hospitals in Cairo emulating the well-known Nuri Hospital in Damascus which not only treated patients, but also provided medical schooling. Many scientists and physicians flourished in this period in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. Among them were Maimonides, Ibn Jami, Abdul Latif al-Baghdadi, al-Dakhwar, Rashidun al-Suri, and Ibn al-Baitar. Some of these scholars served the Ayyubid household directly, becoming the personal physicians of sultans.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking control}} of Bayer's overall {{management}} in 1890, Duisberg began to expand the company's drug research program. He created a pharmaceutical group for creating new drugs, headed by former university chemist Arthur Eichengrün, and a <b>pharmacology</b> group for testing the drugs, headed by Heinrich Dreser (beginning in 1897, after periods under Wilhelm Siebel and Hermann Hildebrandt). In 1894, the young chemist Felix Hoffmann joined the pharmaceutical group. Dreser, Eichengrün and Hoffmann would be the key figures {{in the development of}} acetylsalicylic acid as the drug Aspirin (though their respective roles {{have been the subject of}} some contention).|$|E
5|$|Vrba {{moved to}} Canada in 1967, {{where he worked}} for the Medical Research Council of Canada from 1967 to 1973. He became a Canadian citizen in 1972. From 1973 to 1975 he was a {{research}} fellow at Harvard Medical School, focusing on cancer research, where, in 1974, he met his second wife, Robin Vrba. They married in 1975 and returned to Vancouver, where she became a real-estate agent and he an associate professor of <b>pharmacology</b> at the University of British Columbia. He worked there until the early 1990s, publishing over 50 research papers on the chemistry of the brain, diabetes and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Different GABAA {{receptor}} subtypes have varying distributions within {{different regions}} of the brain and, therefore, control distinct neuronal circuits. Hence, activation of different GABAA receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions. receptor subtype functions | journal = Current Opinion in <b>Pharmacology</b> | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–23 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16376150 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2005.10.003 }} In terms of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, their similarities are too great to separate them into individual categories such as anxiolytic or hypnotic. For example, a hypnotic administered in low doses produces anxiety-relieving effects, whereas a benzodiazepine marketed as an anti-anxiety drug at higher doses induces sleep.|$|E
5|$|For <b>pharmacology,</b> Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{they moved}} to St. Louis, Missouri, as Washington University offered both Carl and Gerty positions, {{although}} Gerty's rank and salary were much lower than her husband's. Despite her research background, Gerty was only offered a position as a research associate at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might harm her husband's career. Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a special allowance for Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and <b>Pharmacology.</b> Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.|$|E
5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend Uppsala University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, <b>pharmacology</b> and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach {{obtained}} a position as {{an associate professor at}} Harvard Medical School's Department of <b>Pharmacology</b> in 1973. By 1978 he obtained tenure and became a full professor, and continued teaching at Harvard University for the next three years. After a nine-year stint at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, he returned to Harvard to serve as the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and Chairman of the Neurobiology Departments of both Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital from 1990 to 1998. During his years as an associate professor, he researched the development of precursor muscle cells, specifically the development of acetylcholine receptors on embryonic chick pectoral muscles. Later on he continued his research on ARIA that he started at the National Institutes of Health, specifically focusing on the expression of the protein's isoforms and their effects on tyrosine kinases. In 1993, Fischbach was involved with the founding of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute. This inter-disciplinary program aims to research the different structures, evolution, and development of the nervous system in order to better understand human behavior.|$|E
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's <b>pharmacology</b> {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would {{normally}} have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{were popular}} {{laboratory}} animals until the later 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used {{annually in the}} U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. As of 2007, they constitute about 2% of the current total of laboratory animals. In the past, they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. Less common uses included research in <b>pharmacology</b> and irradiation. Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats. This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W. E. Castle and Sewall Wright {{made a number of}} contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color. In 2004, the U.S.'s National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang era {{were also}} very {{interested}} in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in <b>pharmacology.</b> In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890. The use of the dental amalgam, manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text Xinxiu Bencao written by Su Gong in 659.|$|E
5|$|The University of Colorado's School of Pharmacy (SOP) {{began in}} 1911 as a {{division}} of the School of Medicine in Boulder. It became an independent college in 1913 and a school in 1957. It received its accreditation in 1938–1939 and awarded a B.S. in Pharmacy degree in 1995–1996 when it received a full accreditation status awarding the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree by the ACPE. In 1986, the School of Pharmacy was administratively transferred to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. The physical transfer from Boulder and final consolidation of faculty, staff and students was completed between August and November 1992. In 2008, the school moved to the Anschutz Medical Campus, and offers medical and graduate degrees in pharmacy, the pharmaceutical sciences, molecular toxicology, and pharmaceutical outcomes research. 30% of its class is from out of state. In 2009, the NIH awarded $7,310,389 and $19,189,543 in grants towards the SOP and <b>Pharmacology</b> department, respectively. In 2011, the school will move into its new building, the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences which will also be located on the Anschutz Medical Campus.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since {{the drug was}} first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the central nervous system. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the inhibitory effect of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with University of London <b>pharmacology</b> graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{was barely}} known to western Europe in the Middle Ages; his {{writings}} were popularized there {{only in the}} 15th century, when Greek manuscripts in the Vatican, possibly, like many other ancient Vatican Greek manuscripts, brought from the Byzantine Empire during its fall to the Ottomans in the 15th century, were translated into Latin by the Byzantine Greek refugee Theodorus Gaza {{at the request of}} pope Nicholas V. The effect was to stimulate Renaissance scholars to restart the exploration of plant taxonomy. The science of botany was founded as these scholars engaged with the accounts of plants, and especially of their medicinal uses, together with a newly critical reaction to mediaeval <b>pharmacology,</b> which was based on unthinking acceptance of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder and the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides. By the same token, however, Theophrastus (and Aristotle) fell abruptly out of use around 1550, as classical botany and zoology were effectively assimilated into Renaissance thought in the form of illustrated encyclopedias—which were still heavily based on classical writings.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pharmacology</b> is {{sometimes}} considered as the 4th discipline of pharmacy. Although <b>pharmacology</b> {{is essential to}} the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient oriented) and <b>pharmacology</b> (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline.|$|E

25|$|On September 22, 1913, the {{departments}} of Law and <b>Pharmacology</b> were established. The university at the time required only an 8th grade diploma, but with the expansion of its courses, this requirement changed. After 1917, {{the departments}} of Normal Education, Liberal Arts, <b>Pharmacology,</b> and Law required {{a high school diploma}} for admission.|$|E
