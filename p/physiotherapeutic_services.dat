A physiotherapist {{should be included in the}} team visiting the country to teach the parent or care-giver of each child to provide the basic physiotherapy that may be needed in the post-operative period. Consider setting up an orthotic unit with the help of local artisans. Although low-cost orthotic appliances may be made from locally available material [43], thermoplastic orthoses may be better in the long run.|$|E

Physiotherapy forms a part of the complex process of rehabilitation, and {{plays an important role in}} preventive, diagnostic and medical care. This thesis consists of two sections: theory and practical. The theory section deals with the history of physiotherapy, complex rehabilitation and the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health. The chapter entitled Physiotherapy explains the aims of this field, the training of physiotherapists and the scope of their work, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic tools used. This chapter also includes a code of ethics, a list of professional associations, a code of standards for physiotherapists, and possibilities of payments for the provided <b>physiotherapeutic</b> <b>services.</b> The final chapter of the theory section gives the definition of the words ?massage? and ?massage therapist?. The practical section aims to find out the level of knowledge the general public has about the meaning of the word ?physiotherapy? and its associated expressions, the physiotherapist training system, the uses to which physiotherapy and spa care could be applied, and the role physiotherapy plays in the Czech health system. My survey took the form of a quantitative research, and the data were collected from responses given in the questionnaires. Target groups were people from the regions of Vysoƒçina and South Bohemia. They were classified into four age groups. The questionnaire consisted of 22 questions and the collected results were processed using the occurrence analysis method, and also displayed graphically. The survey proved that the general public needs to be better informed about the field of physiotherapy and physiotherapy treatment conditions. For this reason, an informative brochure containing all necessary information for the non-medical section of the population has been issued. This {{bachelor degree}} thesis can be used as learning material for current and former students of physiotherapy, as well as by other medical and non-medical professionals. It also encourages us to think about how to raise the image of physiotherapy both amongst the general public and healthcare specialists...|$|E
