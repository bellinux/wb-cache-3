5|$|Karmal was {{recalled}} from Czechoslovakia {{but rather}} than returning to Afghanistan he went into hiding with Anahita Ratebzad, his friend and former Afghan ambassador to Yugoslavia, as he feared execution if he returned.

5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> as {{the leader}} of the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his grip on power and would be the dominating authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} Yamhad were Amorites and spoke the Amorite language, {{and apart from}} a few Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Aegean influences, Yamhad belonged mainly to middle Bronze Age Syrian culture. This culture {{influenced}} the architecture and {{the functions of the}} temples, which were mainly cultic, while <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> was invested in the royal palace, in contrast to the important political role of the temples in Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|At its height, the Mongolian empire {{stretched}} from Shanhaiguan {{in the east}} to Budapest in the west, from Rus' in the north to Tibet in the south. This meant that an extremely {{large part of the}} continent was united under one <b>political</b> <b>authority.</b> As a result, the trade routes used by merchants became safe for travel, resulting in an overall growth and expansion of trade from China in the east to Britain in the west. Thus, the Pax Mongolica greatly influenced many civilizations in Eurasia during the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period. The early history of Calakmul is obscure, {{although}} a dynastic list has been pieced together that extends back into an ancestral past. This dynasty has been reconstructed in part from Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The inability of the sovereign to monopolize <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E

5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned {{for lack of}} {{discipline}} published newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, an act of insubordination forbidden by law. Instead of being punished, the colonel was supported by his commander, Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca. The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize the colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views. In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors, thus undermining both military and <b>political</b> <b>authority,</b> including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{there had}} been rapid {{political}} development in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and by 630, he had successfully united most of the Arabia under a single <b>political</b> <b>authority.</b> When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was elected Caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, when several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr, who declared war against the rebels. In {{what became known as}} the Ridda wars of 632–633, Abu Bakr managed to unite Arabia under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and <b>political</b> <b>authority.</b> Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that {{can be interpreted as}} phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E

5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen as}} a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more were raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and it is probable that <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E
5|$|Gravel then boarded at Assumption Preparatory School in Worcester, Massachusetts, {{where his}} {{performance}} was initially mediocre. Then an English teacher, the Assumptionist Edgar Bourque, gave him personal attention, improving Gravel's language skills and instructing him in public speaking. Gravel's grades improved measurably {{in his final}} year, and he graduated in 1949. He has a sister, Marguerite, who became a Holy Cross nun, but Gravel himself struggled with the Catholic faith. He studied for one year at Assumption College, a Catholic school in Worcester, then transferred for his sophomore year to American International College in Springfield. Journalist I. F. Stone and philosopher Bertrand Russell strongly influenced Gravel in their willingness to challenge assumptions and oppose social convention and <b>political</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between direct democracy and political trust. We suggest {{a solution to the}} controversy in research centering on positive versus negative effects of direct democracy by analytically differentiating between the availability of direct democratic rights and the actual use of those rights. Theoretically, greater availability of direct democratic rights may enhance political trust by increasing citizens’ perception that <b>political</b> <b>authorities</b> can be controlled as well as by incentivizing <b>political</b> <b>authorities</b> to act trustworthily. In contrast, the actual use of the corresponding direct democratic instruments may initiate distrust as it signals to citizens that <b>political</b> <b>authorities</b> do not act in the public’s interest. We test both hypotheses {{for the very first time}} with sub-national data of Switzerland. The empirical results seem to support our theoretical arguments...|$|R

5|$|In 1809, {{after the}} {{separation}} of the western portion of the Indiana Territory to create the Illinois Territory, elections were held to select members of territorial legislature's upper and lower houses for the first time. (Previously, lower-house members were elected, but the territorial governor appointed members to the upper house.) Harrison found himself at odds with the legislature after the antislavery faction came to power and the eastern portion of the Indiana Territory grew to include a large, antislavery population. When the Indiana Territory's general assembly convened in 1810, its antislavery faction immediately repealed the indenturing laws enacted in 1803 and in 1805. After 1809 Harrison's <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> declined as the Indiana territorial legislature assumed more authority and the territory advanced toward statehood. By 1812 Harrison had moved away and resumed his military career.|$|E
5|$|In December, the 4th Infantry Division was {{deployed}} to Greece to reinforce British forces embroiled in the country's civil war. Conflict in Greece between government forces and Communist partisans followed the vacuum {{created by the}} German withdrawal. The partisans (ELAS) sought to establish themselves as the new <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> and confronted the British-supported government-in-exile when ordered to disband and disarm. Within 24 hours of being flown to Piraeus on 12 December, the 2nd King's had to engage partisans in a brief action, seizing occupied barracks {{at a cost of}} 14 casualties. During a seven-week internal security employment, there were many instances of house-to-house and street fighting in Athens. By mid-January 1945, the city had been cleared of insurgents and a ceasefire agreed upon, followed by the Varkiza Agreement in February. The King's remained for a year to support a tense peace until they left for Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's triumph at Marengo secured his <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> and boosted his {{popularity}} back home, {{but it did}} not lead to an immediate peace. Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in Lunéville and reported that Austria, emboldened by British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio. Britain now remained the only nation that was still at war with France.|$|E

Beginning in 1948, The Home Rule Arrangements {{transfer}} political competence and responsibility from the Danish <b>political</b> <b>authorities</b> to the Faroese and later the Greenlandic <b>political</b> <b>authorities.</b> In 1978, The Unity of The Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as rigsfællesskabet. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both The unity of the Realm and the Danish Realm itself have increasingly been referred to as simply rigsfællesskabet (ríkisfelagsskapurin; naalagaaffeqatigiit) in daily parlance.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{what factors}} contribute to perceiving <b>political</b> <b>authorities</b> as legitimate by individuals socialized in different political regimes. Using experimental vignettes and original survey data, the thesis investigates to what extent normative qualities of <b>political</b> <b>authorities</b> {{play a role in}} citizens’ evaluations of these authorities. It challenges the claim that citizens in non-democratic regimes have unique or special expectations about <b>political</b> <b>authorities.</b> It does so by comparing the factors influencing perceived legitimacy of governments in different political regimes: two post-Soviet non-democracies (Russia and Ukraine) and old and new democracies in Europe (France, Netherlands, and Poland). The findings in all five countries support the theoretical model of a citizen who is concerned with both her personal material well-being and the fairness of authorities. The factor that had the largest positive effect on perceived legitimacy across countries was distributive justice—fairness in providing goods and services across the individuals in a society. Furthermore, respondents’ beliefs about what makes <b>political</b> <b>authorities</b> legitimate were similar across regimes and suggest that for evaluating legitimacy, the output aspects of governing (e. g. welfare, order, and stability) are less important than the input (e. g. elections, trust, representation) and throughput aspects (e. g. fair procedures,transparency, and integrity of authorities) ...|$|R
5|$|Power was now wielded by {{the senior}} bureaucrats, who {{installed}} {{the weak and}} pliable al-Muqtadir on the throne. Over the next decades, the expenditure of both the court and the army increased, while maladministration and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified. By 932, when al-Muqtadir was assassinated, the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt, and authority soon devolved {{on a series of}} military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of amīr al-umarāʾ. This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, who put an end to caliphal independence even in name. Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads, but were divested of any military or <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> or independent financial resources.|$|E
5|$|President Paul von Hindenburg {{appointed}} Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. Over {{the next}} few months, during the so-called Gleichschaltung, Hitler dispensed {{with the need for}} the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic as a legislative body and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of <b>political</b> <b>authority.</b> As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected veteran field marshal. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence {{during the early years of}} the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli was reelected in 1948, but was toppled in a {{military}} coup in 1949. He subsequently went into exile in Egypt, returning to Syria in 1955 {{to participate in the}} presidential election, which he won. A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist-dominated government, Quwatli officially adopted neutralism amid the Cold War. After his request for aid from the United States was denied, he drew closer to the Eastern bloc. He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact. In 1957, Quwatli, who the US and the Pact countries attempted but failed to oust, sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria, but to no avail. By then, his <b>political</b> <b>authority</b> had receded as the military bypassed Quwatli's jurisdiction by independently coordinating with Quwatli's erstwhile ally, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser.|$|E
