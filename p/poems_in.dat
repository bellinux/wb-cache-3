5|$|Despite Dickinson's {{prolific}} writing, {{fewer than}} a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's Complete <b>Poems</b> <b>in</b> 1955, Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910s and 1920s, {{the title}} became the {{inspiration}} for the names of Little Orphan Annie and the Raggedy Ann doll, created by fellow Indiana native Johnny Gruelle.

5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū <b>poems</b> <b>in</b> the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E

5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish the <b>poems</b> <b>in</b> 1772, but was unable to obtain the permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
50|$|He {{produced}} several {{volumes of}} his own. Malvern Hills {{was published in}} 1798, John the Baptist, a <b>Poem,</b> <b>in</b> 1801, Alfred, an Epic <b>Poem,</b> <b>in</b> the same year, The Fall of Cambria in 1809, Messiah in 1815.

5|$|From the 1860s, Flemish {{literature}} {{began to}} reflect the Realist style already popular in France, under writers such as Anton Bergmann and Virginie Loveling. The works feature detailed depictions of ordinary aspects of daily life and often have a pessimistic tone. Heavily influenced by Belgian dialects such as West Flemish, the poet and priest Guido Gezelle produced lyric <b>poems</b> <b>in</b> Dutch from the 1850s {{until his death in}} 1899. In 1893, the cultural magazine Van Nu en Straks ("Of Today and Tomorrow") was launched to bring Flemish literature to an audience outside Belgium. Flemish literature continued to flourish in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century under writers such as Stijn Streuvels.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{took his}} first {{years of high school}} in the Colegio jesuita San José (today Instituto San José) from 1940, in which he {{published}} his first <b>poems</b> <b>in</b> the school magazine Juventud. Later, thanks to a scholarship given to him by the government, Gabriel was sent to study in Bogotá where he was relocated to the Liceo Nacional de Zipaquirá, a town located one hour from the capital, where he would finish his secondary studies.|$|E
5|$|Harihara, (also {{known as}} Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha I, wrote the Girijakalyana {{in the old}} Jain Champu style which {{describes}} the marriage of Shiva and Parvati in ten sections. He {{was one of the}} earliest Virashaiva writers who {{was not part of the}} vachana literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants (Karanikas) from Halebidu and spent many years in Hampi writing more than one hundred ragales (<b>poems</b> <b>in</b> blank verse) in praise of Virupaksha (a form of Shiva). Raghavanka was the first to introduce the Shatpadi metre into Kannada literature in his Harishchandra kavya which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.|$|E

5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer <b>poems</b> <b>in</b> 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves of Grass, critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional <b>poems,</b> <b>in</b> August 1856. Leaves of Grass was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1859, Heliade {{returned}} to Bucharest, {{which had become}} {{the capital of the}} United Principalities after the common election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza and later that of an internationally recognized Principality of Romania. It was during that period that he again added Rădulescu to his surname. Until his death, he published influential volumes on a variety of issues, while concentrating on contributions to history and literary criticism, and editing a new collection of his own <b>poems.</b> <b>In</b> 1863, Domnitor Cuza awarded him an annual pension of 2,000 lei.|$|E

5|$|Luoyang, {{the region}} of his birthplace, was {{recovered}} by government forces {{in the winter of}} 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) {{at the entrance to the}} Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 <b>poems</b> <b>in</b> his dense, late style.|$|E
5|$|Other {{works that}} {{followed}} continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist <b>poems.</b> <b>In</b> 1937 he composed {{his first major}} liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which {{has become the most}} frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and {{it was not until the}} 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{finally was}} {{discharged}} on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement {{to finish his}} enlisted term for him.
