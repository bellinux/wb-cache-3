40|$|Wastewater {{from the}} dye {{industry}} contains {{high level of}} organic nitrogen derived from urea. Thus, an effective nitrogen removal process is needed to reduce effluent nitrogen concentration. We have developed a new nitrogen removal process using non-woven biomass carriers. In this study, we used <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which are products of the local industry in the Wakayama prefecture, instead of non-woven materials as biomass carriers to improve nitrification rates. Several <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> were then used for nitrification and continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments. The specific NOx-N production rate using an acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> was 3. 4 times {{higher than that of}} non-woven carriers. About 75 % nitrification efficiencies were obtained under a T-N loading rate of 0. 5 kg-N/m 3 /day and a HRT of 10 hours during continuous nitrification using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Furthermore, continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments were carried out using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> in a base cloth with a mesh structure to improve the diffusion rates. Little biomass accumulated on the <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> surfaces so a high diffusion rate through the pile was maintained for long periods. Denitrification efficiencies of 56 and 77 % were achieved at HRTs of 12 and 19 hours, respectively, with influent concentrations of 200 mg/l T-N and 450 mg/lTOC...|$|R

While travelling in Istanbul, he saw an example of the looped <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> that is known today as terry towelling, but which was initially known as the 'Turkish towel'.The company found a method of weaving the looped <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> on an industrial scale using a machine designed by one of their employees Samuel Holt, who patented the design.

However, the cost is a major problem in small and medium scale companies. We investigated the feasibility of using a <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> biomass carrier that can be produced at low cost with existing equipment. The TOC removal rate of E-pile, a polyester <b>pile</b> <b>fabric,</b> was as high as that of the nonwoven material under a volumetric loading rate of 4 to 15 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. A packing ratio of 0. 17 m 3 -carrier/m 3 -reactor was sufficient for TOC removal if the volumetric loading rate was less than 8 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. In a system using a biomass carrier, the decrease in TOC removal caused by a temperature drop from 25 to 5 ℃ was slower and the increase in TOC removal upon raising the temperature to 10 ℃ was faster, compared with a system without a biomass carrier. These results may be attributed to the stable retention of yeast in the reactor by entrapment inside the biomass carrier...|$|R

50|$|On {{mechanical}} looms {{the technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both loop pile and cut pile in the same fabric. Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric {{on top of each}} other, whereby the warp ends used for the pile are inserted {{in such a way that}} they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric. By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> With this technique only the cut pile effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|R

30|$|Current {{residential}} mattresses use a {{wide range}} of tickings, including <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> knits, woven fabrics and jacquard designs. To address issues of physiological comfort, fire safety, and the growing incidence of allergies within the U.S. population, a variety of functional coatings, including water-proof, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and/or flame retardant finishes, are applied to the ticking of the mattress. The majority of modern ticking materials have a high polypropylene and/ or polyester fiber count, with the fiber content varying significantly with the fabric structure and design pattern. While cotton, polyester and polypropylene fibers dominate the ticking industry, blends of luxury fibers, such as wool and silk, are becoming more prevalent. Renewable resources like corn, soybean and bamboo fibers are also gaining popularity as more environmentally friendly alternatives.

The topographical defects, produced by rubbing the film surface with a <b>piled</b> <b>fabric,</b> could be varied for the density by changing the number of rubbings, N. First, the dewetting mechanism was determined by comparing the dewetting morphology between the unrubbed and rubbed films. Nucleation dewetting was ascribed to samples wherein the characteristic wave vector, q{*}, of the final dewetted morphology increased with increasing N, whereas spinodal dewetting was ascribed to samples wherein was affected little. Second, the evolution of dewetting was compared between the unrubbed and rubbed films. Our, result shows that perturbations from rubbing do not produce changes in the free energy, of the films that will alter the prevailing dewetting mechanism or the characteristic wave vector in spinodal dewetting. Nonetheless, the rubbing-induced defects do affect the rupturing process, in manners depending on the dominating dewetting mechanisms...|$|R

Ryas are a knotted pile carpet, with each knot composed of three strands of wool, which enables the rug to exhibit rich texture from all the different shades of color. The name originates from a village in southwest Sweden. [...] The term rya may also refer to a breed of sheep whose wool is used to make rya carpets (see Rya (sheep)).|$|R

The influence of each tribological feature on the tactile rendering is studied via psychophysical studies comparing real and simulated fabrics.
