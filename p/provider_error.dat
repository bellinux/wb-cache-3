40|$|Objective: Patient {{safety is}} {{fundamental}} to high-quality patient care. Critical steps toward improving {{the safety of the}} health care system include ensuring that the system is aware of its errors so that effective remedies can be applied, and enhancing the trustworthiness {{of the health care system}} for patients by disclosing errors that are meaningful to them. This study aimed to construct a conceptual model of the factors that facilitate or hinder disclosure of medical errors. Methods: We conducted 25 separate focus groups with attending physicians, nurses, residents, patients, and hospital administrators at 5 academic medical centers in a university health care system. The protocol probed the ethical perceptions of participants and the details of disclosure expectations. Audiotapes of the focus groups were transcribed and analyzed using Atlas. ti software. Codes were assigned to the text in an iterative fashion. Themes were identified and assembled into a model of disclosure. Results: All groups believed that errors should be disclosed. Important influences on whether disclosure would occur fell into four categories: provider factors, patient factors, error factors, and institutional culture. Provider issues included perceived professional responsibility, fears, and training. Patient factors included their desire for information, level of health care sophistication, and rapport with their <b>provider.</b> <b>Error</b> factors included level of harm and whether patients and others were aware of the error and the harm. Perceived tolerance for error and a supportive infrastructure were institutional factors that influenced disclosure. Conclusion: This grounded model of error disclosure delineates areas for interventions to increase disclosure as a step toward improving patient safety...|$|E

In an effort to introduce order a protocol targeting user authorisation was developed and named Open authorisation (OAuth). Successful implementation of the protocol is paramount {{to the security of}} OAuth 1 and OAuth 2 providers. The development of a provider can be facilitated by a dedicated OAuth library, which in the field of information security is generally accepted as best practice. OAuthLib aims to fill the Python OAuth library void and has a strong focus on usability and security. My goal for this study was to advance the progress of OAuthLib by contributing a foundation for OAuthLib features, based on common security related mistakes made by OAuth <b>providers.</b> <b>Errors</b> were identified in a two-step process. Firstly an estimation of probable errors was created through a cross section analysis of the CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors list and the two OAuth protocols. Sixteen of the twenty five outlined errors were found to be applicable to OAuth providers. Secondly the estimation was validated and extended upon through interviews with providers and security experts. Three additional types of vulnerabilities were identified in these interviews including the surprisingly extensive but not yet widely recognised timing attack vulnerability. Mitigation techniques were explored for all nineteen identified errors. As a result, nine errors are now automatically mitigated through new features in the OAuthLib library, the majority through strict whitelisting of all input parameters and HTTPS enforcement. Furthermore, recommendations for how to mitigate the remaining 10 errors were included in the OAuthLib documentation. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions, only OAuth 1 features could be developed and OAuth 2 remains future work. Validerat; 20120627 (anonymous...|$|R

Implicit in this QA effort is a conflict between (1) external agents encouraging the medical profession to adopt strategies for reducing errors and (2) sociological characteristics of medical practice that systematically inhibit the uptake of these strategies. Using interviews with providers and observations in two diabetes clinics in a large Midwestern city in the USA, we examine how <b>providers</b> understand <b>error</b> in their work, {{as well as how}} they think about failures in care and efforts to standardize and impose guidelines in care. We find that the prototypical vocabularies of medical error and QA, which have been largely oriented to acute illness care, are systematically mismatched to ambiguities introduced by chronic illness. These ambiguities create problems for the definition of medical errors, the collection of relevant information, the determination of long-term treatment goals, and the application of standardization efforts.

This algorithm is adapted to point data with different densities and variable distributions. Uncertainty modelling includes modelling of the dependence between the vertices of a road polygon. Road polygons constructed from vertices with different truncated normal distributions along with their uncertain line segments are represented by random sets, and their parameters are estimated. The effect of distributions on the area of the mean set is analysed and validated by a set of reference data collected from GPS measurements and image digitising.

My research explores how organizational patient safety efforts related to the culture of safety affect the care delivery practices of frontline healthcare personnel. This research evaluates the implementation of a local hospital's Just Culture initiative (designed to help the hospital improve patient safety by encouraging staff to feel more comfortable reporting events). It also analyzes findings in regard to organizational culture change efforts aimed at mitigating the effects of error in healthcare more broadly.

Half of the administrators stated that the current mechanism is an appropriate and adequate outlet to ensure patient safety.

In contrast, for a small child both a 1x correct dose and a 10x overdose of a drug can be administered in the same syringe thus providing no clue as to a potential error.

One such health IT is electronic prescribing (e-prescribing), which is the direct transmission of prescription information from a provider to a pharmacy.

Multivariable associations comparing GPs to CPs were generated and content analysis of free text responses was undertaken. RESULTS: There was an overall response rate of 17. 7 % (897 respondents- 554 GPs/Registrars and 343 CPs). More than 90 % of GPs and CPs were positive about the effects of medication reconciliation on medication safety and adherence. Sixty per cent of GPs reported having no formal system of medication reconciliation. Communication between GPs and CPs was identified as good/very good by > 90 % of GPs and CPs.

40|$|Abstract Background In Japan, medical error {{leading to}} patient death is often handled through the {{criminal}} rather than civil justice system. However, {{the number of}} cases handled through the criminal system and how this has changed in recent years has not previously been described. Our aim was to determine the trend in reports of patient death to the police and the trend in the resulting prosecution of healthcare <b>providers</b> for medical <b>error</b> leading to patient death from 1998 to 2008. Methods We collected data regarding the number of police reports of patient death made by physicians, next-of-kin, and other sources between 1998 and 2008. We also collected data regarding the number of resulting criminal prosecutions of healthcare providers between 1998 and 2008. Reporting and prosecution trends were analyzed using annual linear regression models. Results Reports: The number physician reports of patient deaths to the police increased significantly during the study period (slope 18. 68, R 2 = 0. 78, P < 0. 001) while reports made by next-of-kin and others did not. Mean annual reporting rates by group were physicians 130. 1 (&# 177; 70. 1), next-of-kin 29. 3 (&# 177; 12. 5), and others 10. 4 (&# 177; 6. 0).

Conclusions The reporting of patient deaths to the police by physicians increased significantly from 1998 to 2008 while those made by next-of-kin and others did not. The resulting criminal prosecutions of healthcare providers increased significantly during the same time period.
