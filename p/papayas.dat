Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged.

5|$|Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri {{are largely}} {{dictated}} by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest.

40|$|ABSTRACT In Desa Timuhun, {{eventhough}} <b>papaya</b> is not primary fruit product, {{but usually}} <b>papaya</b> is planted {{among the other}} plants and easily to grow. <b>Papaya</b> has good potency to be processed to become food product. Matured <b>papaya</b> fruit is usually fresh served for desk fruit. On the other hand, for <b>papaya</b> which is not mature yet, usually used for vegetable. <b>Papaya</b> has high water content, so it makes <b>papaya</b> fruit easy to experience damage. With <b>papaya</b> processing, <b>papaya</b> which is originally assumed improper to be sold or to be consumed (mechanical damage, diseased, acid, physical damage) and will only to be thrown, finally can be used. The making of <b>papaya</b> dry candy is one of effort to preserve and to vary form of <b>papaya</b> serving. It also improves the economic value of <b>papaya.</b> The making of <b>papaya</b> can be conducted in big or small scale. The activity objectives are to introduce and give additional knowledge to society about <b>papaya</b> processing technology, to increase economic added value of <b>papaya</b> and the using of <b>papaya</b> which is improper to be sold or to be consumed becoming valuable food product. Realization of the objectives above are by performing an information sharing and discussion with the society about process of the making dry candy from <b>papaya,</b> training of <b>papaya</b> dry candy making, introduce simple technology of dry candy <b>papaya</b> making. This activity was performed {{at the head of}} Desa Timuhun office, on Friday, September 14, 2007 and was attended by 26 persons, including association of woman farmer and the staff in that office. The result of this activity shows that there was positive response of people who attend this activity, because by processing <b>papaya</b> fruit into dry candy, have a lot of advantage compare to sale it freshly. Beside that, this dry candy is healthy snack, without synthetic preservation, enriched with vitamins which is useful for health, also this dry candy is still good up to 1 month and of course it could to improve economic value compared to be sold freshly </div...|$|R

40|$|<b>Papaya</b> (Carica <b>papaya)</b> is {{severely}} {{damaged by the}} <b>papaya</b> ringspot virus (PRSV). This review focuses {{on the development of}} PRSV resistant transgenic <b>papaya</b> through gene technology. The genetic diversity of PRSV depends upon geographical distribution and the influence of PRSV disease management on a sequence of PRSV isolates. The concept of pathogen-derived resistance has been employed for the development of transgenic <b>papaya,</b> using a coat protein-mediated, RNA-silencing mechanism and replicase gene-mediated transformation for effective PRSV disease management. The development of PRSV-resistant <b>papaya</b> via post-transcriptional gene silencing is a promising technology for PRSV disease management. PRSV-resistant transgenic <b>papaya</b> is environmentally safe and has no harmful effects on human health. Recent studies have revealed that the success of adoption of transgenic <b>papaya</b> depends upon the application, it being a commercially viable product, bio-safety regulatory issues, trade regulations, and the wider social acceptance of the technology. This review discusses the genome and the genetic diversity of PRSV, host range determinants, molecular diagnosis, disease management strategies, the development of transgenic <b>papaya,</b> environmental issues, issues in the adoption of transgenic <b>papaya,</b> and future directions for research...|$|R

Since the 1970s General Electric has employed a few hundred workers at a manufacturing plant. Unemployment was widespread, with consequent social problems.

40|$|Background <b>Papaya</b> (Carica <b>papaya</b> L.) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} crop that produces climacteric fruits {{with a soft}} and sweet pulp that contain {{a wide range of}} health promoting phytochemicals. Despite its importance, little is known about transcriptional modifications during <b>papaya</b> fruit ripening and their control. In this study we report the analysis of ripe <b>papaya</b> transcriptome by using a cross-species (XSpecies) microarray technique based on the phylogenetic proximity between <b>papaya</b> and Arabidopsis thaliana. Results <b>Papaya</b> transcriptome analyses resulted in the identification of 414 ripening-related genes with some having their expression validated by qPCR. The transcription profile was compared with that from ripening tomato and grape. There were many similarities between <b>papaya</b> and tomato especially with respect to the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in primary metabolism, regulation of transcription, biotic and abiotic stress and cell wall metabolism. XSpecies microarray data indicated that transcription factors (TFs) of the MADS-box, NAC and AP 2 /ERF gene families were involved in the control of <b>papaya</b> ripening and revealed that cell wall-related gene expression in <b>papaya</b> had similarities to the expression profiles seen in Arabidopsis during hypocotyl development.
