5|$|Sibu town {{is located}} near the Rajang delta at the {{confluence}} of Rajang and Igan rivers. Peat swamp forests and alluvial plains are particularly prevalent in the Sibu Division. The Sibu town is located on a deep <b>peat</b> <b>soil.</b> This has caused problems in infrastructure development because buildings and roads will slowly sink into the ground after its construction completion. The location of Sibu in lowland peat swamps have subjected it to frequent floods which was about 1 to 3 times per year. Therefore, Sibu Flood Mitigation project was started to relieve the area from the floods. The highest elevation in Sibu is a peak at Bukit Aup Jubilee Park measuring 59 m above sea level.|$|E

40|$|Wetland {{is known}} as a source of {{atmospheric}} methane, typically produced by microbiological and chemical processes under anaerobic conditions. Soil temperature in the wetlands is a key factor to control the processes. <b>Peat</b> <b>soils</b> can be found in many types of wetlands. <b>Peat</b> <b>soils</b> contain high organic matter content and thus shows unique physical properties such as high total porosity and shrinkage.

Undisturbed peat samples were obtained from two different peat profiles at different depths.

Increased tractor weight caused significant decrease in yields on the <b>peat</b> <b>soils</b> with both mechanisation lines. When the <b>peat</b> <b>soils</b> {{were exposed to the}} light tractor treatments, DM yields increased significantly as the fertilization level rose from N 120 kg ha- 1 to N 180 kg ha- 1, but not for further increase to N 240 kg ha- 1. With the medium tractor treatments, there was no significant yield increase from N 120 kg ha- 1 to N 180 kg ha- 1, but a further increase to N 240 kg ha- 1 gave significantly higher yields. Use of lighter machines on <b>peat</b> <b>soils</b> may therefore lead to reduced fertilizer costs for farmers, and decrease the risk of leaching from the soil.

40|$|Peat is {{primarily}} {{derived from the}} decomposition {{of plant and animal}} matter when they are kept under anaerobic conditions for long periods. The fabric of peat is therefore totally different from inorganic soils such as clay, sand and gravel. In geotechnical engineering, the interpretation of soil genesis based on fabric analysis is essential to ascertain its influence on the analysis of its engineering behaviour. Aydemir et al. (2004) suggested the use of image analysis in research to identify more clearly the composition and structure of the fabric in a soil.

40|$|Peat forests emit methane {{and carbon}} dioxide naturally. Rate of the {{emissions}} may increase if the forest is converted for other uses such as rice field. The use of mineral soil, enriched with electric furnace slag containing high level of cationic irons, as ameliorant is expected to give several benefits. Firstly, it can reduce {{the harmful effects of}} phenolic acids in the soils thereby increasing yield of rice. Secondly, it will form complex bonding that improves peat stability and reduces methane (CH 4) andcarbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. This study evaluated the impact of using ameliorant in three <b>peat</b> <b>soils</b> of Central Kalimantan, i. e. inland peat at Berengbengkel, transitional peat at Sampit, and coastal peat at Samuda. The ameliorant was a combination of Ferich mineral soil (Fe 2 O 3 = 22. 06 %) and electric furnace slag (Fe 2 O 3 = 42. 60 %). The amount of ameliorant was determined based on 5 % maximum adsorption of Fe 3 +. It was found thatinland <b>peat</b> <b>soils</b> emit more CH 4 and CO 2 than transitional and coastal <b>peat</b> <b>soils.</b> The use of ameliorant reduced the rate of the emission significantly. Without amelioration, total amount of carbon losses through CH 4 and CO 2 emission were about 2. 086, 1. 986, and 1. 967 t ha- 1 yr- 1 for inland, transitional, and coastal peats, respectively. Ameliorant application reduced total carbon losses in these three <b>peat</b> <b>soils</b> by about 0. 597, 0. 609, and 0. 628 t ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively, and also significantly the yield of rice. Based on the findings and if there was no ameliorant application, it is estimated to require 660, 1247, and 2820 years to decompose all organic carbon of inland, transitional, and coastal <b>peat</b> <b>soils,</b> respectively. Meanwhile, with ameliorant application, the time required will be about 980, 1789, and 3950 years, respectively...|$|R
