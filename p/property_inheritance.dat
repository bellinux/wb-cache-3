5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, <b>property</b> <b>inheritance,</b> dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{indigenous}} peoples occupied Alaska {{for thousands of}} years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge. The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of <b>property</b> <b>inheritance</b> and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts. The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other {{indigenous peoples}} of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislation}} {{provided for}} {{two levels of}} courts: a number of Local Courts to established in each of Malawi's 27 districts, mainly in rural areas and District Appeals Local Courts, one in each district, to hear appeals from the Local Courts.

Each local court and District Appeals Local Court would be headed by chairperson, who need not be a lawyer, but with a reasonable standard of education, proficiency in English and adequate knowledge of the customary law and language of the area that the court serves. Local Courts also have assessors to advise on local customary law. Assessor must be at least 50 years old. The Local Courts would have no jurisdiction over civil cases involving title to or ownership of customary land, <b>property</b> <b>inheritance</b> involving the guardianship of infants, issues of witchcraft or about a chief's title. This is to help limit possible corruption. Complaints have been made that the Local Courts, popularly called Traditional Courts are charging excessive court fees to settle disputes.|$|E
25|$|The Leva or Lewa are {{synonymous with}} the Lewa Patil—the suffix Patil is a feudal title. The {{community}} {{does not have an}} oral history of their origin or migration, but they generally accept that they migrated from Gujarat to the Vidharba region via Nimar (now part of Madhya Pradesh). The community is associated with two other communities from Gujarat: the Lewa and the Lewa Patidar. The former are a well known community; the latter are sometimes referred to as their parental group, but the Kunbi Leva Patil of Maharashtra have roots which are long established in the Kunbi community of Maharashtra. The community perceives their distribution to be in 72 villages in the Jalgaon and Buldhana districts. The Lewa Patil are numerically, economically and educationally superior in some of the multi-ethnic villages of the Buldhana and Jalgaon district. Nuclear families are replacing the traditional extended family system due to a changing economy and an increasing number of conflicts over <b>property</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Cremation of the dead is the norm, burial the exception for the very young (up to three to four months old). There is no distinctive attire of the Leva community—they follow local fashion trends. On very rare occasions, older Leva men wear a Gujarati style, boat shaped topi or hat made from black or brown silk. Some of the common Leva surnames are Warade (Deshmukh), Narkhede, Kharche, Supe, Borle, Panchpande and Kolte. Dowry is practiced in the Leva community. The amount is negotiable. The attitude towards formal education is positive though Leva girls drop out of school earlier due to social conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Austen's novels have {{variously}} {{been described}} as politically conservative and progressive. For example, one strand of criticism claims that her heroines support the existing social structure through their dedication to duty and sacrifice of their personal desires. Another argues that Austen is sceptical of the paternalistic ruling [...] "other", evidenced by her ironic tone. Within her exploration of the political issues surrounding the gentry, Austen addresses issues relating to money and property, particularly the arbitrary quality of <b>property</b> <b>inheritance</b> and the precarious economic position of women. Throughout her work there is a tension between the claims of society and {{the claims of the}} individual. Austen is often considered one of the originators of the modern, interiorized novel character.|$|E
2500|$|Austen's novels {{raise and}} explore {{a variety of}} issues {{relating}} to money and property and the power they convey. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, the plot revolves around the problems caused by primogeniture, as the Bennet property is entailed away from the Bennet daughters, and Sense and Sensibility questions the arbitrariness of <b>property</b> <b>inheritance</b> when the elderly Mr. Dashwood disinherits one side of his nephew's family because of his affection for a baby on the other. As Copeland explains, [...] "rom the focus of Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey, where the single most significant economic problem for women is the lack of a fortune, Austen's works steadily engage women in more and more complex relationships to the economy. Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion, each in turn, move through an examination of the economy as measure of social morality, as agent of social disruption, [...] as source of national identity".|$|E
2500|$|In 1607, {{when the}} English made their first {{permanent}} settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, {{the area of}} the current state was occupied by numerous tribes of Algonquian, Siouan, and Iroquoian linguistic stock. Captain John Smith made contact with numerous tribes, including the Wicocomico. More than 30 Algonquian tribes were associated with the politically powerful Powhatan Confederacy (alternately Powhatan Chiefdom), whose homeland occupied much of the area east of the fall line along the coast. It spanned 100 by , and covered most of the tidewater Virginia area and parts of the Eastern Shore, an area they called Tsenacommacah. [...] Each of the more than 30 tribes of this confederacy had its own name and chief (weroance or werowance, female weroansqua). [...] All paid tribute to a paramount chief (mamanatowick) Powhatan, whose personal name was Wahunsenecawh. [...] Succession and <b>property</b> <b>inheritance</b> in the tribe was governed by a matrilineal kinship system and passed through the mother's line.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars such as Claudia Johnson {{argue that}} Austen is {{indebted to the}} {{political}} novels of the 1790s and that she is sceptical of the paternalistic ruling order. For example, Johnson argues that Sense and Sensibility is a critique of primogeniture and the arbitrariness of <b>property</b> <b>inheritance.</b> She contends that the novel is not, as it is often assumed to be, [...] "a dramatized conduct book patly favoring female prudence over female impetuosity". Johnson concludes that Austen created [...] "a progressive middle ground" [...] after the blistering political fights of the 1790s. Kelly agrees, writing that Austen embraced the [...] "hierarchical social structure and constitution of church and state" [...] yet also recognized that they needed reform. Jenkyns supports this view: [...] "What must be said emphatically is {{that she does not}} praise the existing state of society." [...] He gives as examples such flawed representatives of the status quo as Sir Walter Elliot, Sir Thomas Bertram and Emma Woodhouse's father; Austen's admiration of the Navy as an avenue of social mobility (the Crofts and Captain Wentworth in Persuasion); and her sympathetic portrayal of characters who are [...] "in trade" [...] or newly risen from it (Bingley and the Gardiners in Pride and Prejudice, the Westons and Frank Churchill in Emma).|$|E
6000|$|Before {{the eighteenth}} century the only {{property}} of serious importance consisted of land and buildings. These were [...] "real" [...] estate. Beyond these things were live-stock, serfs, and the furnishings of real estate, the surface aspect of real estate, so to speak, personal property, ships, weapons, and the Semitic invention of money. All such property had to be actually [...] "held" [...] and administered by the owner, he was immediately in connection with it and responsible for it. He could leave it only precariously to a steward and manager, and to convey the revenue of it to him at a distance was a difficult and costly proceeding. To prevent a constant social disturbance by lapsing and dividing property, {{and in the absence}} of any organized agency to receive lapsed <b>property,</b> <b>inheritance</b> and preferably primogeniture were of such manifest advantage that the old social organization always tended in the direction of these institutions. Such usury as was practised relied entirely on the land and the anticipated agricultural produce of the land.|$|E
