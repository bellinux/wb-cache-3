50|$|The {{library is}} set {{on the east side}} of Maine State Route 186, about 0.5 mi south of its western {{junction}} with United States Route 1, and immediately adjacent to the West Gouldsboro Union Church. It is a small single-story Tudor Revival structure, with a tall fieldstone foundation and a stuccoed exterior. It has a side-gable roof with chimneys at the sides, and a front-facing gable that projects slightly at the center of the main facade. The entrance consists of a single door flanked by sidelight windows with diamond lights, with paneling below that matches the door. This is topped by an elliptical hood, above which is the half-timbered gable front. The bays on either side of the entrance have three casement windows with small square panes. The inside consists of a single large room with projecting fireplaces on either side, which are flanked by niches with original bookcases. The ceiling is coved plaster, with a molded <b>plaster</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

The species of woods {{used to make}} the coffins were identified as Pinus densi-flora S. et Z., one of the major conifers in Korea. Of 12 graves, 10 were successfully dated using various red-pine chronologies of South Korea. Due to the absence of the last-formed tree ring before felling, the number of sapwood rings, used to obtain likely cutting dates, had to be estimated. The terminus post quem for two coffins without <b>plaster</b> <b>frames</b> were AD 1548 and AD 1571, respectively. Eight coffins with <b>plaster</b> <b>frames</b> yielded estimated dates from AD 1664 to AD 1799.

40|$|Sundial is {{a special}} solar clock which signals exclusively, {{every day of the}} year, when the Sun crosses the local meridian, at South, thus working as a {{perpetual}} calendar on which you can read the date, rather than the daily time. ‘Camera obscura sundials’ are traditionally housed in monumental architectures and are defined by two elements, in strict geometrical correspondence between them: the data line - marking on the floor the north-south direction - and the gnomonic hole that coincides with a small hole of circular shape, dug along one facades of the building, through which a star of solar rays enters, projecting, along the aforesaid graduated straight line, a small luminous ellipse on the floor. Sundials are the graphic evidence, on the ground, of complex astronomical projective events: to build them, frequently, there was the convergence of various doctrines, from mathematics to physics, geography, cartography, from geometry to art. In Italy and, in particolar, in the Campania region, several sundials of great artistic and scientific value were built, but they are not adequately appreciated, due to the progressive loss of this ancient millenary culture, related to the measurement of time before the advent of modern watches. Ruined by negligence but also by the inability to carry out adequate restorations, they are a precious cultural heritage to be urgently saved, providing actions for the protection and the recovery, but also for the dissemination of their knowledge, that is likely to disperse definitively, as well as rapidly. The research: Revealed geometries of a lost time: camera obscura sundials in Cava de 'Tirreni (SA) and Pizzofalcone (NA) In {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century, the polyvalent scientist Rocco Bovi states in Campania as designer and constructor of four important sundials. The latest one, according to a chronological order, is in the SS. Trinity Benedictine Abbey, in Cava de 'Tirreni; sundial is on the second floor of the facing south building, precisely in front of the old archive, today housing the library. Cava’s sundial consists of a white marble slab, with a thickness of 22 cm, with a total length of 8, 20 m, set in the floor just in front of the library, and it is oriented, as usual, according to the north-south axis and, thus, accidentally tilted respect to the main directions of the adjacent corridors, along which there were the ancient monks cells. The simple artistic decoration makes difficult, for casual visitors, to under stand its real value because their lack of knowledge in the field of gnomonics and the room misses of any expositive panel to exhibit this important instrument; this contributed to the low uptake of sundial value, because it is rarely mentioned in the several texts, dealing with the history of the monument. Today, the sundial is inactive because of the absence of the gnomonic hole and, thus, abandoned in the room where often are accumulated storage materials. On the night of October the 25 th 1954 Cava de' Tirreni is devastated by floods which cause considerable damages to the Abbey, destroying the building of the former diocesan seminary and the upper corridors of the building, including the one of the library. Restoration works consisted of large replacements of damaged floors with reinforced concrete beams, and they also repaired the facades, as well as the replacement of the original wooden trusses of the the pitched roof with similar structures, but of steel. The sundial was carefully removed and, then, replaced in the original position, however, surrounded today by a modern grit floor. The restoration work of the facade have instead caused the disappearance of the gnomonic hole: now, is visible an irregular slot, square shaped, which was carved out from the canal gutter, and some slight splays able to allow an easier entry of the solar rays in the room. The attempt to restore the original sundial functionality however failed because light can not follow the meridian line at noon. Consequently, our research work has been focused on geometric and historic analysis of this valuable scientific instrument, to provides a project of reactivation and, therefore, dissemination. A similar case of ancient meridian line, today inactive due to the closure of the gnomonic hole, was detected in the Theatine suppressed monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli at Pizzofalcone in Naples, currently hosting a branch of the Military Prosecutor of the Republic: this inaccessibility has led to a long period of oblivion of this valuable instrument, also absent from the more detailed censuses. Sundial is engraved on a marble slab of 7. 40 meters in length, in fairly good condition. Only in the last decade it has been released by a dividing wall which had been superimposed on it, as a result of loss of function, when the repeated restoration of the exterior facade, over the centuries, led to the closure of the small gnomonic hole that allowed the entry of sunlight. Using an exclusively geometric method, based on the knowledge of the solar declination in the most significant days and tracing the corresponding light rays in the respective intersections, indicated along the sundial, it has been possible to determine the location of the hole with respect to the marble slab and, subsequently, its location along the exterior facade. The creation of a new hole, aimed at restoring the proper functioning of the sundial, however would involve a partial disruption of the current decorations along the front, especially the <b>plaster</b> <b>frame,</b> above the windows, which over the centuries, should have definitely lost its original shape. A new gnomonic hole for inactive sundials Restoring the original gnomonic hole by drilling the masonry facade appears today as an intrusive alteration of the historical architecture and of its consolidated image, that is layered over the past two centuries. For this purpose, our study proposes an original gnomonic instrument, able to adapt itself to any type of relationship between the facade (along which the gnomonic hole should be recreated) an the sudial on the floor: regardless from the original position of the hole, the tool that we have designed allows the incoming sunlight to be caught by a system of reflections between flat mirrors, appropriately tilted, thus producing a solar ray that comes out from the instrument with a different inclination, calculated exactly like the one that touches the sundial in the point associated to that particular date. In this way it is possible to create new angular relationships within the original system of positions between the gnomonic hole and the astronomic data engraved along the sundial, advantaging the architecture which won’t be subjected to any alteration of the facade. Internal mirrors, allowing the reflection of the incident ray and converting it into an outgoing ray with a different inclination, however, must take into account the constant variability of the angle of incidence throughout the year and, therefore, must adapt its inclination to the Sun declination, day by day. We adopted an Arduino, not only for its simple use, but also for the close relationship that it can establish with a three-dimensional design software as Grasshopper and Rhinoceros. Arduino, in addition to receive commands via the direct writing of computer language, can be managed through the use of plug-in of the same software used to draw the 3 D celestial sphere and the sundial. Starting from the three-dimensional model of the context, in fact, we were able to exploit, through Grasshopper, a graphical algorithm editor tightly integrated with the modeling tools, the benefits of parametric design that allows to have 3 D configurations just depending on some parameters that we linked to a mathematical formula. In this way, day by day, starting from the inclination of light rays and from the alignment between the lighting “macula”, the gnomonic hole and the Sun, we can automatically generate the aforesaid geometric configurations in order to identify, in the virtual 3 D model, the position that mirrors have to assume The Cooper Formula and the sundials Knowing latitude of the place through simple measurement tasks, in principle it is possible to know the size and height of the gnomonic hole. It remains to find the right match between solar declinations and the days of the year. These values are well described by the Cooper formula, valid for the construction of sundials post reform: δ= 23. 45 sin⁡[(360 (284 +D_n)) / 365] How well is observed, it is made from the first multiplication factor, that is information on the declination of the Earth 27, 45 ' and the sine function, for the periodicity of the solstices (the maximum and the minimum of the function) whose topic It is dependent D_n days, compared to 365 days the year. This empirical formula reproduce well all the solar declinations during the year, with a negligible change for the leap year (is obtained by replacing the value 365 in 366), despite all the other motions of the Earth around the Sun due to gravitational primarily with the Moon. The error is reduced to be 3 ', which means in the projection of a few millimeters, it depends on the length of the sundial. The number 284 is calibrated so that the maximum of the function is aligned with the summer solstice and the slightest with the winter, while the zero declination corresponds to the spring and autumn equinoxes. Conclusions A good enhancement project about sundials must necessarily start from their knowledge, in order to achieve conservation, improvement and dissemination,so laying the foundations for their subsequent use. The current study has thus identified a methodology able to establish a dialogue between different fields of knowledge (architecture, geometry, math, new information technology, astronomy and gnomonic) with the main purpose of triggering the disclosure, the communication and the consequent use of these singular artistic goods, very often abandoned. The entire research was conducted with a dual method, weaving astronomy and gnomonic with the geometry and the mathematics, for the construction of a 3 D model to verify and plan sundials restoration, thanks to our innovative instrument which deflects sunlight.
