40|$|Abstract. The {{problem that}} the <b>pinch</b> <b>roll</b> of the Slab Size Press was worn away partly {{appeared}} in some domestic steel mill so based on the DEFORM finite element software a pressing mode 1 for Slab Sizing Press was established. After analyzing the deformation of dog bone by the modeling experiment finite element, {{a new kind of}} roll is brought forward. The contact condition between <b>pinch</b> <b>roll</b> and pressed slab is improved by it so that the use time of the <b>pinch</b> <b>roll</b> is extended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The back {{group of}} the <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> of the 1880 Slab Size Press are wearing away seriously in some {{domestic}} steel mill, so based on the finite element software a sizing press mode 1 is established. The major reason of the back <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> wearing away is the partly contact between the rolls and the “dog-bone ” of the pressed slab. The work condition of the new bank {{group of the}} <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> is greatly improved in the production line {{and the cost of}} production is saved...|$|R

50|$|The {{heart of}} the temper mill is the cold rolling mill stand which {{produces}} the temper pass. It will include electric powered drive motors and speed reduction gearing suited to the process desired. The design of the rolling mill can be a 2-high or 4-high (even 6-high in some cases). The mill stand can be work roll driven or back up roll driven. The mill can be designed with hydraulic work roll bending or back up roll bending. Installations typically have a single rolling mill stand, but may have two. <b>Pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> provide back tension for the pay off reel in the entry section and entry and exit tension for the temper pass.|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} roll formed {{products}} {{is known to}} be highly sensitive and dependent on the process parameters and thus the unavoidable variations of these parameters during mass production. To maintain a constant high product quality, a new roll former with an adjustable final <b>roll</b> forming <b>stand</b> is developed at Deakin University enabling the continuous compensation for possible shape defects. In this work, a numerical approach to robust in-line control of the roll forming of a V-section profile is presented, combining the aspects of robust process design and in-line compensation methods. A numerical study is performed to determine the relationship between controllable process settings and uncontrollable variation of incoming material properties with respect to the common product defects longitudinal bow and springback. The computationally expensive non-linear FE simulations used in this study are subsequently replaced by metamod-els based on efficient Single Response Surfaces. Using these metamodels, the optimal setting for the adjustable stand is determined with robust optimization techniques and the effect on product quality analyzed. It is shown that the subsequent adjustment of the final <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> position leads to a significantly improved product quality by preventing product defects and minimizing the deteriorating effects of scattering variables...|$|R

Therefore, the rigid tools and the tube are supported with elastic springs. Additionally, the influences of friction coefficients in the tube/mandrel and tube/roll interfaces are examined. A sensitivity study is performed to investigate the influences of these parameters on the strain path and the roll separation force. The results show the importance of accounting for the displacements of the tube and rigid tools on the roll separation force and the accumulative plastic strain...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} roll formed {{products}} {{is known to}} be highly dependent on the process design. In addition, unavoidable variations of material properties during mass production can have a significant deteriorating effect on the product quality. This study focuses on the question how to compensate for product defects while simultaneously minimizing the sensitivity for variation of material properties. This is achieved by using robust optimization techniques to determine the optimal process settings of adjustable tools in the final <b>roll</b> forming <b>stand.</b> The work covers both numerical analyses as well as experiments. Initial roll forming experiments of an Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) V-section profile showed a significant amount of longitudinal bow and springback in the final product. Finite Element (FE) simulations are subsequently performed to determine the relationship between adjustable process settings and uncontrollable variation of incoming material properties with respect to the product defects. The computationally expensive non-linear FE simulations are subsequently replaced by the best performing metamodel chosen from of a family of metamodels. Using these metamodels, the optimal robust process settings for the adjustable stand are determined and the effect on product quality analyzed. The results show that the effect of scattering material properties on the dimensional quality of the roll formed product is significant. Moreover, it is shown that the adjustment of the tooling in the final <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> leads to a significantly improved product quality by compensating for product defects and minimizing the deteriorating effects of scattering variables...|$|R
