Multiple <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> (109) are arranged {{at a distance}} from each other.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of analog readout electronics (built-in amplifier) integrated on the high-voltage (HV) CMOS silicon sensor chip, as well as its radiation hardness. Since the total collected charge from minimum ionizing particle (MIP) for the CMOS sensor is 10 times lower than for a conventional planar sensor, it is crucial to integrate a low noise built-in amplifier on the sensor chip to improve the signal to noise ratio of the system. As part of the investigation for the ATLAS strip detector upgrade, a test chip that comprises several <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> with different geometries, as well as standalone built-in amplifiers and built-in amplifiers in <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> has been fabricated in a 0. 35 μm high-voltage CMOS process. Measurements of the gain and the noise of both the standalone amplifiers and built-in amplifiers in <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> were performed before and after gamma radiation of up to 60 Mrad. Of special interest is the variation of the noise {{as a function of the}} sensor capacitance. We optimized the configuration of the amplifier for a fast rise time to adapt to the LHC bunch crossing period of 25 ns, and measured the timing characteristics including jitter. Our results indicate an adequate amplifier performance for monolithic structures used in HV-CMOS technology. The results have been incorporated in the next submission of a large-structure chip...|$|R
40|$|Professor Kevin Webb and {{students}} at Purdue University {{have demonstrated the}} design of conducting strip and <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> for focusing electromagnetic waves [1, 2]. Their key point was to design structures to focus waves in the near field using full wave modeling and optimization methods for design. Their designs included arrays of conducting strips optimized with a downhill search algorithm and arrays of conducting and dielectric pixels optimized with the iterative direct binary search method. They used a finite element code for modeling. This report documents our attempts to duplicate and verify their results. We have modeled 2 D conducting strips and both conducting and dielectric <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> with moment method and FDTD codes to compare with Webb's results. New designs for strip arrays were developed with optimization by the downhill simplex method with simulated annealing. Strip arrays were optimized to focus an incident plane wave at a point or at two separated points and to switch between focusing points with a change in frequency. We also tried putting a line current source at the focus point for the plane wave {{to see how it}} would work as a directive antenna.

Hybrid <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> have been fabricated by the Hughes Aircraft Co. by bump bonding readout chips developed by Hughes to an array of PIN diodes manufactured by Micron Semiconductor Inc. These hybrid <b>pixel</b> <b>arrays</b> were constructed in two configurations.

Measurements of detector performance show that excellent position resolution can be achieved by interpolation. By determining the centroid of the charge cloud which spreads charge into a number of neighboring pixels, a spatial resolution of a few microns has been attained.
