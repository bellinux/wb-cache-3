40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an essential}} tool {{in the study of}} internal stresses in composite materials. In most work only the peak shifts caused by the related elastic strains are considered, but other valuable information exists in the form of peak shape changes. The conditions under which the <b>pure</b> <b>diffraction</b> profile of the composite (i. e. the profile when all sources of broadening not caused by the residual stresses are removed) represents the probability distribution of the peak shifts corresponding to the strains are examined. It is shown that in these conditions, the <b>pure</b> <b>diffraction</b> profile has no attributes of particle size broadening (and vice versa), thereby providing a test for the validity of results interpreted in this way. The experimental derivation of measured strain distributions in Al 2 O 3 /SiCp composites using neutron diffraction is described. No apparent particle size broadening was detected, demonstrating the validity of the results, which also satisfied other tests for consistency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} {{analyzing}} and classifying two-dimensional <b>pure</b> point <b>diffraction</b> spectra (i. e. {{a set of}} Bragg peaks) of certain self-similar structures with scaling factor [beta] > 1, such as quasicrystals, is presented. The two-dimensional <b>pure</b> point <b>diffraction</b> spectrum [Pi] {{is viewed as a}} point set in the complex plane in which each point is assigned a positive number, its Bragg intensity. Then, by using a nested sequence of self-similar subsets called [beta]-lattices, we implement a multiresolution analysis of the spectrum [Pi]. This analysis yields a partition of [Pi] simultaneously in geometry, in scale and in intensity (the 'fingerprint' of the spectrum, not of the diffracting structure itself). The method is tested through numerical explorations of <b>pure</b> point <b>diffraction</b> spectra of various mathematical structures and also with the diffraction pattern of a realistic model of a quasicrystal...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{parameters of}} a crystalline sample {{can be determined}} by a proper analysis of XRD line profile broadening. The observed XRD line profile, h(ε), is the convolution of the instrumental profile, g(ε), and <b>pure</b> <b>diffraction</b> profile, f(ε), caused by small crystallite (coherent domain) sizes, by faultings in the sequence of the crystal lattice planes, and by the strains in the crystallites. Similarly, f(ε) is the convolution of the crystallite size/faulting profile, p(ε), and the strain profile, s(ε). The derivation of f(ε) can be performed from h(ε) and g(ε) by the Fourier transform method, which does not require mathe-matical assumptions. The analysis of f(ε) {{can be done by}} the Warren-Averbach method applied to the ob-tained Fourier coefficients. Simplified methods based on integral widths may also be used in studies where a good relative accuracy suffices. The relation among integral widths of f(ε), p(ε) and s(ε) can be obtained if one assumes bell-shaped functions for p(ε) and s(ε). Integral width methods overestimate both strain and crystallite size parameters in comparison to the Warren-Averbach method. The crystallite size parameter is more dependent on the accuracy in the diffraction profile measurement, than it is the strain parameter. The precautions necessary for minimization of errors are suggested through examples. The crystallite size and strain parameters obtained by means of integral widths are compared with those which follow from the Warren-Averbach method. Recent approaches in derivation of microstructure are als...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{diffraction}} of water waves {{passing through a}} gap in a breakwater is investigated experimentally, using close range photogrammetry, and numerically, using finite and infinite elements. The author was particularly interested in validating specific breakwater gap diffraction diagrams given in popular coastal engineering design manuals. Breakwater gap configurations with the following gap width to wave length ratios (B/L ratios) were analysed, both experimentally and numerically, namely: B/L = 1, 64; 1, 41; 1, 2; 1; 0, 75; 0, 5. These configurations are symmetrical, i. e. both breakwater arms lie on the same straight line. An asymmetrical B/L = 1, 64 breakwater gap configuration was also analysed. Previous experimental breakwater gap diffraction investigations are reviewed leading {{to the conclusion that}} the reported results are inconclusive due to (1) the relatively poor accuracy with which the wave heights were measured and (2) secondary basin effects which were superimposed upon and thus distorted the <b>pure</b> <b>diffraction</b> phenomena. In the experimental breakwater gap configurations investigated by the author, splitter plates were used to eliminate the reflection problems on the seaward side of the breakwaters, whilst a novel photogrammetric wave height measurement technique was used to measure accurately the wave heights in the entire basin, before they could be distorted by reflecting waves, basin resonance effects, etc. This "infinite basin technique" was used to simulate experimentally and measure the diffraction of a continuous wave train entering an infinite basin via a gap in an approximate totally absorbing breakwater. A number of different photogrammetric wave height measurement techniques based on analogue procedures, the theory of projective transformations, and the theory of the deformed reference plane, are investigated and developed. It was found that the technique based on the projective transformation theory, and in which the plates are analysed using a stereo-comparator linked to a microcomputer, is the most accurate. Using this technique it was found that, with the cameras situated approximately 5 m above the water surface, the wave heights in the basin can be measured with an accuracy of better than 2 mm. The above method, in conjunction with the infinite basin technique, was used to analyse the experimental breakwater gap configurations. The basic linear wave theory is described leading to the derivation of the Helmholtz diffraction equation. The classical diffraction theories for the semi-infinite breakwater and breakwater gap configurations are reviewed and compared. The Better-off refraction - diffraction equation is then briefly derived. A review of previous numerical refraction - diffraction investigations, and also of modern numerical methods for water wave diffraction and refraction-diffraction, is given. This review led to the adoption of the finite and infinite element program "WAVE", developed at the University College of Swansea, to model numerically the experimental breakwater gap configurations. The use of the "WAVE" program to model breakwater gap wave diffraction is novel and certain conceptual problems had to be overcome. Finally, the experimental and numerical diffraction diagrams obtained were compared to analytical diagrams where these were available. The correlation between the finite element and analytical results is excellent. When comparing the experimental and finite element results the general conclusions are : 1) in regions outside the shadow zones the linear diffraction theory is conservative except close to small gaps (B/L ≤ 1); and 2) within the shadow zones the linear theory is not conservative and one will have to allow for non-linear effects such as radiating second-order waves generated at the breakwater tips, and increased wave orthogonal spreading near the gap centre line and subsequent orthogonal bunching in the shadow zones caused by wave steepness differences along the crests. Other conclusions drawn are : 1) the photogrammetric techniques described are the best available for the experimental simulation and analysis of infinite domain diffraction and refraction - diffraction problems; and 2) the finite and infinite element program "WAVE" is a very useful tool for the prediction of wave heights in large harbour basins...|$|E
