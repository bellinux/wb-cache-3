40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{international}} best practices of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation and to establish the common valuation concept, awareness and application of valuation methodology and valuation process for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation in Malaysia. Using a qualitative approach, the content analyses were conducted from the international practices and current Malaysian implementation of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation. A quantitative approach, via questionnaire, was distributed amongst the registered and probationary valuers in Malaysia to investigate their understanding and opinion relating to <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation based on their current practices. The significance {{of this research is}} the identification of international <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery practices and the understanding of current practices of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation in Malaysia. It found the main issues impacting on <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation practices in Malaysia are the limited numbers of resources available either from scholars or practitioners. This is supported by the findings from the research survey which indicates that there are immediate needs for practical notes or guidelines to be developed and implemented to support the Malaysian valuers practising <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation. This move will lead {{to a better understanding of}} <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation, reducing discrepancies in the valuation of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery and increased accuracy among practising valuers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} and discuss on the <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation syllabus for higher learning education in Malaysia to ensure the practicality of the subject in the real market. There have been limited studies in <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery area, either by scholars or practitioners. Most papers highlighted the methodologies but limited papers discussed on the <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation education. This paper will determine inputs for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation guidance focussing on the syllabus set up and references for valuers interested in this area of expertise. A qualitative approach via content analysis is conducted to compare international <b>and</b> Malaysian <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation syllabus and suggest improvements for Malaysian syllabus. It is found that there are few higher education institutions in the world that provide <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation courses as part of their property studies syllabus. Further investigation revealed that on the job training is the preferable method for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation education and based on the valuers experience. The significance of this paper is to increase the level of understanding of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation criteria and provide suggestions to Malaysian stakeholders with the relevant elements in <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation education syllabus...|$|R

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>and</b> {{machinery}} valuation {{is important}} to every company. s annual financial reporting. It is reported under the non-current assets section, and the valuers are generally employed to provide the up to date valuation of the non-current assets valuation such as property, <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> equipment that can make up to 80 % of the total assets of a company. The valuation of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery is also important for other purposes such as securing loan facilities, sales, takeover, insurance and auction. The application of 2005 International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) has a subsequent impact on the financial sector, as a whole. The accountants {{have to choose between}} the Historical Cost approach and Market Value approach in determining the value of the client. s assets. In Malaysia, the implementation of IFRS has a domino effect on the financial system, especially for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation for financial reporting. The comparison data for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation is limited unlike land and building valuation. The question of Malaysian valuer. s ability to comply with the IFRS standard keeps rising every day, not just to the accountants, but also other related parties such as financial institutions, government agencies and the clients. This is happening because of different interpretations of premise of value for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery, as well as methods been used and differences in standards of reporting among the valuers conducting <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation. The root of the problem lies in the lack of practical guidelines governing <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation practices and different schools of thought among the valuers. Some follow the United Kingdom. s RICS guidelines, whilst some valuers are more comfortable with the United State. s USPAP rules, especially on the premise of value. This research is to investigate the international best practices of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation and to establish the common valuation concept, awareness and application of valuation methodology and valuation process for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation in Malaysia. This research uses a combination of the qualitative and quantitative research approach. In the qualitative approach, the content analyses were conducted from the international practices and current Malaysian implementation of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation.
