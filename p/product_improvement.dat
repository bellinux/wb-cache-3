5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the <b>product</b> <b>improvement</b> program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{a further}} {{improved}} version, the BN-2B Islander II, was produced {{as a result}} of a <b>product</b> <b>improvement</b> program. The BN-2B model involved several changes, including a redesigned cockpit and a reduction in cabin noise levels. In 1980, it was decided to make available turboprop engines for the type, adopting twin Allison 250-B17C engines; when the latter are installed, the aircraft is designated the BN-2T Turbine Islander. The first such BN-2T entered service in 1981.|$|E
500|$|The <b>product</b> <b>improvement</b> program kit {{replaced}} the original steel tubular stock {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the <b>product</b> <b>improvement</b> kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E

500|$|The Soviet Union also {{supplied}} Spain with 50 BT-5 tanks. [...] Although slightly {{heavier than}} the T-26, the BT-5 was faster; it was capable of reaching velocities of [...] with tracks, on road, and [...] with wheels. [...] However, given the non-ideal nature of Spanish terrain, the BT-5 was rarely capable of taking advantage of its speed. [...] The loss {{of many of the}} Republic's BT-5s during the Battle of the Ebro caused them to retire the tank to their reserves. [...] The BT-5 was a <b>product</b> <b>improvement</b> of J.

500|$|The barrel has a rifling {{twist rate}} of one turn in [...] Because firing heats up the bore, the {{air-cooled}} barrel {{is equipped with a}} mechanism to remove and replace the barrel assembly with a spare. A folding bipod with adjustable legs is attached near the front of the weapon, though there are provisions for hard-mounting to a M192 Lightweight Ground Mount tripod or vehicle mount. The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle, combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun. Its original gas regulator offered two different gas port sizes, allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725-rounds per minute (r/min) or 1,000r/min. The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions, such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather. The two-position gas regulator was discarded as part of a <b>product</b> <b>improvement</b> program. Sustained rate of fire, the rate of fire at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating, is approximately 85r/min.|$|E

[...] Program experts and Army officials asserted that the testimony misunderstood the carbine replacement initiative. [...] The Individual Carbine competition was to find a commercially available rifle design superior to the M4A1, while the M4 <b>Product</b> <b>Improvement</b> Program worked on improving the current M4 design if the competition didn't yield major improvements.

CEO Paul Costanzo indicated that factors involved in this situation included the dramatic fall in value of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar between 2003–2006, start-up and <b>product</b> <b>improvement</b> costs that were greater than expected and especially a venture capital environment in the Province of Quebec that Costanzo described as [...] "dismal". He stated at the time, [...] "We have simply been unable to attract sufficient capital to allow us to effectively exploit the obvious opportunity that we have with the SA-160, let alone fund our planned development of a diesel two-place and a four-place product."
