5000|$|In January 2011, Jobson gave {{a series}} of [...] "master classes" [...] in Japan, {{featuring}} performances of compositions throughout his career and lecture-style discussions of his music. In April of that year, a Jobson-Wetton [...] "U.K." [...] reunion tour provided performances in Japan and the US, with Alex Machacek (guitar) and Marco Minnemann (drums) completing the four-piece line-up. Jobson headlined the 2011 Zappanale festival on 21 August in Bad Doberan, Germany, and played an earlier gig in Zoetermeer, Netherlands on 19 August, with a U-Z <b>project</b> <b>line-up</b> of Marc Bonilla (vocals/bass), Alex Machacek (guitar) and Marco Minnemann (drums).|$|E
5000|$|The concert lasted {{approximately}} three hours, {{and it was}} divided into two parts, with an intermission in between. The band consisted of the same personnel as the recent years' Devin Townsend <b>Project</b> <b>line-up,</b> and the special guests were Anneke van Giersbergen and Jed Simon, with Steve Vai hosting the show via pre-recorded video projected onto screens. The setlist was focused heavily on material from Epicloud {{and a few other}} albums from Townsend's catalogue; the setlist included no songs from Terria, Accelerated Evolution, Ki and Ghost. Townsend also performed, against his current principles, two Strapping Young Lad songs. He later stated that this was because of the career-spanning nature of the concert, and playing those two songs was a [...] "closure for him and Strapping Young Lad". He also wanted to [...] "respect the legacy of the band" [...] and to reconnect and perform again with Jed Simon.|$|E

50|$|The band {{disintegrated}} in 2002, {{as various}} members decided {{to form their}} own <b>projects.</b> The <b>line-up</b> had already changed from the original five, and that happened {{at the height of}} their success. Speculation surrounded the split, with accusations of bad feeling between the singers and manager Juan Carlos Cáceres. Remuneration was also allegedly an issue.|$|R
50|$|Wetton and Jobson {{performed}} three {{concerts in}} Poland in November 2009 {{as part of}} Jobson's Ultimate Zero (U-Z) <b>project.</b> The <b>line-up</b> also featured Minnemann, Howe, and Tony Levin (stick).

The {{members of the group}} have changed a lot over time, with many former members going on to other, similar <b>projects.</b> The <b>line-up</b> now consists of 13 members under the leadership of Saimon Mambazo Phiri. On their 10th anniversary they changed their name to Siyaya (meaning 'on the move').|$|R

The band {{was formed in}} London in 1998 to perform material originally recorded and released by Richard Pyne as a solo <b>project.</b> This <b>line-up</b> then recorded and released their debut album Blessed Deviant on Nightbreed in 1999 and the subsequent Teenage Vampire single.|$|R
50|$|Toy-line {{based on}} the Saint Seiya {{franchise}} by Masami Kurumada is his characters.Saint Seiya Myth Cloth Appendix (聖闘士聖衣神話 Appendix) is another popular toy-line diverse from the Saint Seiya Myth Cloth line-up. In 2007, Bandai first announced this <b>project.</b> The <b>line-up</b> is focused on half size bust of the characters, characters in their casual outfits, and Pandora boxes for the cloths. Due to the higher detailed and sculpting for the specific line-up, {{it is intended to}} either display it as a half bust size figure alone or you can change/swap the head and cloth parts with existing Saint Seiya Myth Cloth figures to enhance their aesthetics.|$|R
5|$|In 1973, Ray Davies dived {{headlong into}} the {{theatrical}} style, {{beginning with the}} rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation <b>project,</b> the Kinks' <b>line-up</b> was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring {{the group as a}} theatrical troupe.|$|R

The two started working in his studio in late 1981 in hopes of a possible new Angel LP under a new line-up. It was in these Angel recordings where Frederiksen met bassist Ricky Phillips. The two became long-time friends and have collaborated on many <b>projects.</b> This <b>line-up</b> never completed an official album, as Giuffria started focusing heavily on the formation of his group Giuffria in 1982, but did record three songs during band sessions: [...] "Whips", [...] "Troubleshooter", and [...] "Should Have Known Better". These tracks were later released on the Angel Rarities collection, and were eventually covered by White Sister.|$|R

In November of that year, Michael Jackson's second posthumous album, Immortal, featured Howe's playing on [...] "Dancing Machine" [...] and [...] "Beat It".|$|R
5000|$|After Mike Ratledge {{left the}} band in 1976, Soft Machine {{did not include}} any of its {{founding}} members, but kept recording on a <b>project</b> basis with <b>line-ups</b> revolving around Jenkins and drummer John Marshall. Although Melody Maker had positively reviewed the Soft Machine of 1973 and 1974, Hugh Hopper, involved with the group since replacing bassist Kevin Ayers in 1968, cited Jenkins's [...] "third rate" [...] musical involvement in his own decision to leave the band, and the band of the late 1970s {{has been described by}} band member John Etheridge as wasting its potential.|$|R

The album sold 66,000 copies. The track [...] "Animal" [...] became a minor alternative radio hit and its music video was released at the same year.|$|R
5|$|Deal was {{satisfied}} with the material recorded up to this point, but realized {{she would not be}} able to tour without a band. She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical <b>projects.</b> The new <b>line-up</b> spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.|$|R
50|$|Following a short Australian tour, {{and during}} a period when they were without management, Cave and his band {{returned}} to London. Cave, Harvey, Bargeld, Race and Adamson formed the <b>project's</b> first consistent <b>line-up,</b> while Cave's longtime girlfriend Anita Lane was credited as a lyricist on the band's debut album. The group, which up to this time had been nameless, adopted the moniker Nick Cave and the Cavemen, which they used {{for the first six}} months of their career. However, they were later renamed Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in May 1984, in reference to the final Birthday Party EP The Bad Seed. They began recording sessions for their debut album in March 1984 at London's Trident Studios and these sessions, together with the abandoned Man Or Myth? sessions from September-October 1983 that were recorded at The Garden studios, formed the album From Her to Eternity, released on Mute Records in 1984. Race, and touring guitarist Edward Clayton-Jones, left to form the Wreckery in Melbourne.|$|R
