The interoperability goal was met in two phases: (1) agreeing on a common authorization query interface and protocol with an associated profile that ensures standardized use of attributes and obligations; (2) implementing, testing, and deploying on OSG and EGEE, middleware that supports the interoperability protocol and profile. The activity has involved people from OSG, EGEE, the Globus Toolkit project, and the Condor project.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} general {{framework}} for the real-time transmission of interactive media, i. e. media involving user interaction.

Examples are mechanisms for late join and session recording. The proposed framework {{is based on the}} Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) which is widely used in the Internet for the real-time transmission of audio and video. Using the experience gained through the framework for audio and video, our work consists of three important parts: the definition of a <b>protocol</b> <b>profile,</b> the instantiation of this profile for specific media, and the development of generic services.

40|$|Abstract — ebXML {{is a new}} {{framework}} for electronic business where each trading partner describes its capabilities in a Collaboration <b>Protocol</b> <b>Profile</b> (CPP). Two trading partners form a bilateral agreement, called a Collaboration Protocol Agreement (CPA), based on the two CPP’s. This process is called the CPA formation process and can be implemented as a software system; CPP and CPA documents are XML structured documents. During the implementation phase of the system a problem was identified whereby XML elements were found to reference other XML elements within a CPP, {{with the possibility of}} overwriting previously accepted checks. This problem can be solved by copying the referenced XML elements prior to running the proposed algorithm. This paper provides an introduction to ebXML and describes where the CPA formation process takes place, explains the referencing problem and provides a subsequent solution. The paper closes with a discussion on the consequences and has an outlook for future work {{in the area of the}} CPA formation processes. I...|$|E

To improve the throughput on a packet switching communications network, an adaptive ARQ strategy is developed and applied to the Stop-and-Wait protocol. A comparison of the throughput efficiencies of the simulated adaptive SW protocol with the non-adaptive SW protocol showed a marked improvement in throughput when the communication links are subjected to high channel bit error rates.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{emerging}} services that build, in addition to the traditional voice component, on new media elements as e. g. text, photos, videos etc. In order to improve exploitation of these new revenue opportunities it needs to be ensured that these services can also be used in inter-network scenarios, i. e. network domain boundaries. This work introduces deeper analysis of the needs regarding Management (operations, administrations, maintenance and provisioning – OAM&P) correspondingly to the specified requirements. The view of which resources and capabilities are applicable to an interconnect relationship are taken in consideration. That is, what kind of flows, paths, and/or circuits, are applicable and what QoS (Quality of Services) and CoS (Class of Services) features as well as QoS monitoring and SLA (Service Level Agreement) assurance capabilities are assumed. When the assumptions are identified the corresponding management requirements can be captured.

40|$|Web {{technologies}} {{promise to}} facilitate the growth of both B 2 B and B 2 C e-commerce by offering cheaper and flexible ways to do business. Web services in particular have become very popular, with support from both academic and industry researchers. The ebXML framework which is an initiative of UN/CEFACT and OASIS has also taken ground. Many challenges however still remain before both web services and ebXML {{can be used to}} their full potential by the business community to do business. One of the open issues is the automated matchmaking of business processes to find compatible business partners. In the web services world, standards exist to model and store business processes in registries like UDDI, but up to now, {{it is not possible to}} efficiently match business processes from different partners without using manually negotiated frame contracts like RossettaNet PIPs. In the ebXML framework, potential business partners register their profiles (including business processes) in a collaboration <b>protocol</b> <b>profile</b> (CPP), but so far it is not possible to automatically match CPPs from different partners to create a collaboration protocol agreement (CPA). It is our belief that automated support for matchmaking of business processes is needed, both in the web services and ebXML domains. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{powerful}} impetus exists for the realisation {{of a global}} multilateral electronic market infrastructure, as envisaged by the ebXML 1 endeavour. Crucial {{in this regard is}} the problem of interoperability: making it possible for disparate systems to interact fluently. An obvious panacea would be to use a pre-specified set of protocols comprised of selected globally-accessible open standards. However, the status quo B 2 B-interaction implementations comprise protocol-neutral technologies and standards that propagate unwieldy permutations of possible trading partner configurations, which, ultimately, are antithetical {{to the creation of a}} global electronic marketplace. Allowing diversity in the choice of protocols is a limiting factor in cross-integration. It facilitates the relatively smaller numbers of participants to negotiate common terms of agreement for bivalent relationships, but each participant might have to configure a different <b>protocol</b> <b>profile</b> for each trading partner it intends to interact with. Thus, interoperability in the wider global multilateral marketplace context would be stultified, since isolated pockets of discrete relationships are proliferating on an ad-hoc basis. Unless a global initiative in which a set of open standards is unequivocally specified as a single standard for global interoperability, an ebXML-like marketplace will remain a pipedream. It is clear that Web services provide the most promising means of achieving global interoperability. Yet, within the context of a global multilateral electronic marketplace, unless specific directives are forthcoming at the highest level, standards such as WS-Security 2 remain protocol-neutral and continue to support an opposing momentum...|$|E

Critical 21 st-century institutional leadership challenges for public doctoral-granting institutions were examined, focusing on the perceptions of selected Illinois University Administrators and College Deans regarding three challenge areas: Accountability for Institutional Change, Role Change, and Accountability for Institutional Outcomes. Six literature based themes frame both data collection and analysis: Accountability, Diversity, Politics, Resources, Technology, and Vision. The ten study participants were one senior-level "University Administrator" and one "College Dean" from each of Illinois' five public doctoral-granting institutions. "University Administrators" were sitting presidents, chancellors, or provosts. "College Deans" were from Agriculture, Business, Education, Engineering, and Liberal Arts. Data were collected using a researcher-developed participant profile form and interview <b>protocol.</b> <b>Profile</b> data included: anticipated years of service prior to retirement, years in present position, total years of university and/or college administrative experience, highest degree earned, doctoral discipline, types of university- or college-level administrative positions held at public doctoral granting institutions, and three greatest 21 st-century institutional leadership challenges. Interview data concerned participant perceptions of (1) the most critical 21 st-century institutional leadership challenges (Institutional Change, Role Change, and Accountability for Institutional Outcomes); (2) major points of role agreement and disagreement on these challenges; and (3) the single most critical challenge and recommendations for meeting that challenge. For profile data, the rank order of combined frequency of challenges identified, as categorized by the researcher, is: Resources (1), Accountability and Diversity (tied ranks), Vision (4), Politics (5), and Technology (6). For interview data, "Resources" emerged as the single greatest challenge, based on researcher categorization of combined frequency of participant identified challenges. In this historically unique time of increasing complexity, data from the study provide an expanded basis for linking the conceptual literature on institutional leadership challenges to the reported experience of current practicing higher-education presidents (or chancellors or provosts) and college deans. One without the other is decidedly incomplete. Integration of views from the literature and higher-education leaders provides a relatively more powerful standpoint from which to view current and future higher-education leadership challenges...|$|E
