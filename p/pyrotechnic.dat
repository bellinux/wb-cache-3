50|$|<b>Pyrotechnics</b> are {{dangerous}} {{and must be}} handled and used properly. Recently, several high-profile incidents involving <b>pyrotechnics</b> have re-enforced the need to respect these explosives at all times. Proximate <b>pyrotechnics</b> {{is an area of}} expertise that requires additional training beyond that of other professional <b>pyrotechnics</b> areas and the use of devices specifically manufactured for indoor, close proximity use.|$|R
5000|$|The International <b>Pyrotechnics</b> Society [...] {{was officially}} formed in May 1980. However, The International <b>Pyrotechnics</b> Society can claim that its roots {{go back to}} 1968 when the First International <b>Pyrotechnics</b> Seminar was held at Estes Park Colorado, USA. It was the Steering Committee of the Sixth International <b>Pyrotechnics</b> Seminar who officially formed the International <b>Pyrotechnics</b> Society. The Society has {{continued}} to sanction International <b>Pyrotechnics</b> Seminars. These have normally been held in the United States every other year and other countries including Australia, China, France, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom during the intervening years. Over the years, {{the membership of the}} Society has grown to approximately 275 people in 30 countries.|$|R

5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} {{is being}} investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density <b>pyrotechnic</b> payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} <b>pyrotechnic</b> applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} <b>pyrotechnic</b> initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, {{phosphorus}} and selenium {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} <b>pyrotechnic</b> ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{homogeneous}} Energetic Materials such as High Explosives and Propellants, those materials constituted from separate {{fuel and}} oxidizer particles are called pyrolants, or more commonly, <b>Pyrotechnics.</b> The International <b>Pyrotechnics</b> Society (IPS) offers membership {{to those who}} work with or have an interest in energetic materials especially <b>pyrotechnics.</b>|$|R

5|$|On November1, 1941, the Rainbow Bridge {{was officially}} opened during a simple ceremony. The oldest living couple {{known to have}} wed in Niagara Falls, a pair from Pennsylvania, {{were the first to}} cross, {{followed}} by a newlywed couple from Georgia. This symbolically tied the history of the two bridges together, and was followed by McQuesten and Johnson walking towards the centre of the structure from the Canadian and American sides, respectively, and shaking hands at the centre. Several <b>pyrotechnic</b> explosions at both ends capped the ceremony, and the bridge was opened to traffic.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original <b>pyrotechnic</b> igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the <b>pyrotechnic</b> display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how swedish {{newspapers}} represent the use of <b>pyrotechnics</b> and the users of <b>pyrotechnics</b> at football matches in the swedish first division. We wanted to see if there were any preconceived notions of the phenomenon and its perpetrators that could be perceived in the report in the occurence of <b>pyrotechnics</b> at football games. Using the methods of qualitative text analysis and critical discourse analysis we have examined 12 articles in Swedens biggest sports tabloid Sportbladet that were wrtitten in relation to events where <b>pyrotechnics</b> were used. These methods were used along with the theoretical framework of sensational journalism, the sports media complex and the dramaturgy of the press. The results show that the report surrounding <b>pyrotechnics</b> at football matches is more nuanced than our initial beliefs. There is report which supports legalising pyrotechnichs and there is report that support a ban on the users of <b>pyrotechnics.</b> Whether the report is more positive than negative towards the use of <b>pyrotechnics</b> is decided by the circumstances in which the article is written. Among other subjects we discussed whether the way in which the report on the phenomenon of <b>pyrotechnics</b> could have a influence on the relationship between different fractions within swedish football culture. ...|$|R

5|$|The stage show {{featured}} Wurst in a cream-covered mermaid-like dress {{standing on}} a pedestal {{in the middle of}} the stage. The stage appeared dark at the beginning of the song with minimal lighting, before the lighting rose towards the beginning of the first chorus. At the start of the song, the camera appeared at the back of the arena before swooping into centre stage to a close-up of Wurst, followed by it flying off again at the beginning of the chorus. The background LED screens featured at the first chorus flaming rain, followed by flames in the shape of wings, in reference to the phoenix in the title of the song. <b>Pyrotechnic</b> flames also featured at the finale of the song. Wind machines were also used to effect during the performance.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her <b>pyrotechnic</b> bra activates.|$|E

The show's final blast does not come from any of the 6 pyro barges, but rather 5 mines located along the island banks of the river.|$|R
40|$|<b>Pyrotechnics</b> {{have long}} been used to frighten birds from {{specific}} areas but birds might ha-bituate to them. Anecdotal and limited published reports suggest that killing a flock member can reduce habituation. However, little behavioral work has been conducted in this area. We exposed brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) to noise from either 0. 22 caliber blanks or 15 -mm <b>pyrotechnics</b> {{in a series of}} controlled, cage experiments to determine if killing a flock member increased the time that cowbirds re-spond to <b>pyrotechnics.</b> Cowbirds responded no differently to <b>pyrotechnics</b> following the death of a flock member either before or after habituation to <b>pyrotechnics.</b> Our results might have been influenced by cage effects or perceived inconsequence of the death of a conspecific. Further work with other species is warranted, particularly with regard to sociality...|$|R
