2500|$|The 1859 {{discovery}} {{of crude oil}} in western Pennsylvania set off an [...] "oil rush" [...] reminiscent of the 1849 California Gold Rush and {{would prove to be}} a valuable resource {{on the eve of the}} Civil War. Because crude oil needs to be distilled to extract usable fuel oils, oil refining quickly became a major industry in the area. However, the rural and mountainous terrain of these Pennsylvania oilfields allowed neither economical in-situ refining nor efficient railroad transportation of extracted oil. Beginning in 1865, the construction of oil pipelines to connect the oilfields with railroads or oil refineries alleviated this geographical bottleneck but also put thousands of coopers and teamsters (who made the barrels and drove the wagons to transport oil) out of business. As the network of oil pipelines expanded, they became more integrated with both the railway and telegraph systems which enabled even greater coordination in <b>production,</b> <b>scheduling,</b> and pricing.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{literature}} on scheduling of multi-product batch process does not consider the uncertainties in demand and variability in processing times. We develop a simulation based variable <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> model for a multi-product batch facility assuming zero wait transfer policy and single product campaign. The model incorporates the demand uncertainties and processing time variability. The impact of demand uncertainties is evaluated in terms of total annual cost, which comprises of the backorder and inventory costs per year. The effect of variability in processing time is measured by the annual production time. We also develop a constant <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> model that has uncertain demand arrival, but the schedule is independent of demand variations. We compare the variable <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> model with constant <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> model in terms of the total annual cost incurred and subsequent results are presented. The conclusion drawn from this comparison is that the total annual cost can be significantly reduced when the demand uncertainties are accounted for in the <b>production</b> <b>schedule...</b>|$|R

2500|$|For the English localization, Noctis is {{voiced by}} Ray Chase as an adult, and by Hyrum Hansen as a child. Localization lead writer Dan Inoue's English {{interpretation}} of the character was influenced by Suzuki's own influence. Speaking about his role, Chase was told that rather than create an English version of the Japanese performance outside a few select scenes, Chase was told to make a performance that would resonate with Western audiences. This resulted in Noctis' English version being noticeably different from the Japanese. If anything seemed wrong, the localization directors Keythe Farley and Dan Inoue would call either Chase or someone else in to re-record lines of dialogue. Noctis was not only Chase's first Final Fantasy character, but his first major role in a video game project. He was initially shocked when he received the call {{that he would be}} voicing Noctis. The group recording efforts were discontinued due to the need to roughly match the English dialogue to precisely match timing for the Japanese performances. Only one scene was recorded with several English actors together: the opening scene of the game, where Noctis sets out on his journey. English voice work was included for Episode Duscae, but it was cut close in terms of <b>production</b> <b>scheduling.</b> During the ROM checking stage, Tabata saw that the performance was wrong for the character, a feeling reflected in player feedback after the demo's release. As {{it was too late to}} re-record, the performance was carried into the demo. Tabata commented that the original performance made the character sound too old, comparing it to Batman. After release, the voice work was redone to show the character's youth and charm, along with his [...] "sense of ennui".|$|E

40|$|The mine <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> {{defines the}} {{sequence}} of extraction of selected mine units {{over the life of}} the mine, and consequentially establishes the ore supply and total material movement. This sequence should be optimized so as to maximize the overall discounted value of the project. Conventional schedule approaches are unable to incorporate grade uncertainty into the scheduling problem formulation and may lead to serious deviations from forecasted production targets. Stochastic mine production schedulers are considered to obtain more robust mine <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> solutions. The application of stochastic approaches to the mine <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> problem is recent and additional testing is required to better understand these tools and to define the value of a stochastic solution as compared to the conventional result. Two stochastic schedulers are tested in a low-grade variability copper deposit, optimization parameters are discussed and their results compared with a conventional schedule. The first method uses a stochastic combinatorial optimization approach based on simulated annealing to address the mine <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> problem. The method aims for maximization of the net present value (NPV) of the project and minimization of deviations from the production targets. These objectives are attained by incorporating grade uncertainty into the mine <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> problem formulation. The second method formulates the problem as a stochastic integer programming problem, in which the objective is the maximization of the projects' NPV and the minimization of production targets deviations. The model can also manage how the risk of deviating from the targets is distributed between production periods. Both stochastic approaches were tested in a low-grade variability copper deposit. In both case studies, the value of a stochastic solution is demonstrated to be higher than the conventional one. This fact demonstrated the misleading results that a conventional schedule may produce and shows the importance of not ignoring the presence of uncertainty when defining the mine <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> for a project...|$|R
