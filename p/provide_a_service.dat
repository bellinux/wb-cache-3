5|$|Coast Air {{continued}} to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>service</b> until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a {{trial for the}} use of public service obligations for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by Teddy Air, to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast Air had been receiving. Teddy Air operated until 1August 1999, when Widerøe took over using de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft. At the same time, the route from Fagernes to Bergen was dropped from the schedule. Widerøe's contract lasted only eight months, until 1 April 2000, when Guard Air, who bid NOK 6.93 million per year, won the tender, and started flying with Dornier 228 aircraft. On 8October 2001, Guard Air filed for bankruptcy, and the ministry signed an intermediate contract with Widerøe to fly the route. The subsequent tender was won by Arctic Air, who continued operation until 31 March 2003, using Dornier 228 aircraft.|$|E

25|$|However, closing {{times were}} {{increasingly}} disregarded {{in the country}} pubs.

That year {{was also the first}} to allow continuous opening for 36 hours from 11am on New Year's Eve to 11pm on New Year's Day. In addition, many cities had by-laws to allow some pubs to extend opening hours to midnight or 1am, whilst nightclubs had long been granted late licences to serve alcohol into the morning.

500|$|The bill {{proposed}} a [...] line with ten stations, {{to be operated}} by electric trains, which would <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>service</b> taking 32 minutes to reach Waterloo from Sutton. The LB opposed the line {{on the grounds that}} it would compete with its own services from Sutton to Central London, and claimed that its own planned electrification of its lines to Victoria and London Bridge would offer quicker journeys than the W route.The LB also believed that a connection for the W would give the DR service the chance to extend its service to Epsom and beyond. The L had concerns that its tracks from Putney to Wimbledon, over which the DR provided the service, were already at capacity and could not cope with the extended DR service to Sutton.|$|E

However, the Southern Railway rejected the proposal as too costly and impractical. Ramsgate Olympia and the Southern Railway were keen to make the attractions near the harbour accessible from the railway main line and to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>service</b> from the seafront to the greyhound stadium at Dumpton Park.

500|$|Before inauguration, GMPTE's {{original}} {{concept was}} for Metrolink's operator to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>service</b> every ten minutes from Bury-to-Piccadilly and Altrincham-to-Piccadilly , Monday to Saturday. Greater Manchester Metro Limited, the system's original operator, argued for adjustments, citing {{the need to}} provide an efficient and commercially viable operation in line with vehicle running times and passenger demand. Due to power limitations, this pattern was modified to a twelve-minute service throughout the day, doubling to a six-minute service in peak periods, resulting in a [...] "ten trams per hour" [...] service pattern on routes running from Altrincham and Bury to Manchester every six minutes. Operators are required to provide this level of service at least 98% of the time, or incur a financial penalty charge. This six-minute service pattern has been adopted {{on the rest of the}} network as the system has grown. Heavy snowfall during the winter of 2009/10 impaired Metrolink services and the operator was criticised for failing to have cold weather procedures. This prompted a programme to improve reliability and performance of the system in freezing conditions. Metrolink operated icebreaker-style vehicles at night during snowfall in January 2013 to provide normal services.|$|E
