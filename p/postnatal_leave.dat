40|$|The Australian {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s statutory paid {{parental leave}} scheme should be taxpayer-funded, and should provide paid <b>postnatal</b> <b>leave</b> {{for a total}} of 18 weeks that can be shared by eligible parents, at the adult federal minimum wage, according to this report. All those employed with a reasonable degree of attachment to the labour force should be eligible, including the self-employed, contractors and casual employees. A broad range of family types should be eligible, including conventional couples, lone parents, non-familial adoptive parents, same sex couples, and non-parental primary carers in exceptional cases, so long as they meet the employment test. Employers should participate in the scheme by: • acting as paymasters where the employee had sufficient workplace tenure, with the government prepaying employers by instalment to avoid cash flow impacts • providing superannuation contributions for long-term eligible employees, though this measure should be deferred {{for at least three years}} and reviewed at that time. A less ambitious version of this scheme was announced in the 2009 - 10 federal budget...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Most {{women in}} the U. S. are {{employed}} during pregnancy and work until the month of childbirth. For many, working throughout pregnancy poses little threat to their health; however, women experiencing difficult pregnancies and/or working in strenuous or inflexible jobs may benefit from taking time from work as they approach childbirth, but almost no empirical evidence examines antenatal leave (ANL). Methods: Using {{a national survey of}} English-speaking women, this paper offers the first national description of ANL and examines state policy predictors of uptake. Results: Thirty-seven percent of employed women worked until the week their baby was due. After controlling for characteristics of women and their jobs, living in a state with any or multiple leave laws increased the probability of ANL by 14 and 23 % points, respectively. Women living in states with multiple leave laws stopped work almost 2 weeks earlier than women in states without a policy. Discussion: Paid leave policies currently being considered at the federal, state, and local levels should consider the potential impact on antenatal leave, in addition to <b>postnatal</b> <b>leave,</b> and how they influence population health...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{provision}} of maternity leave offered to mothers, many American women fail to take leave. We developed an evidence-based maternity leave educational tool for working women in California using participatory design. We tested its short-term efficacy with a randomized controlled trial of pregnant English-speakers (n= 155). Among intervention participants exposed to the tool, 65 % reported that they learned something new; 38 % were motivated to seek more information; and 49 % said it helped them plan their maternity leave. Among participants who delivered at ≥ 37 weeks gestation and said the tool helped them plan their leave, 89 % took more than one week of prenatal leave, a significantly higher proportion than among controls who did not receive the tool (64 %, p= 0. 049). Other findings favored trial participants, but {{were not statistically significant}} in this small sample. More intervention participants took some prenatal leave (80 %) vs. controls (74 %, p= 0. 44). Among participants who had returned to work when surveyed (n= 50), mean <b>postnatal</b> <b>leave</b> uptake was on average 1 week longer for intervention participants vs. controls (13. 3 vs. 12. 2 weeks, p= 0. 54). The first-phase evaluation of this tool shows that it successfully informed women about maternity leave options, clarified complex regulations, encouraged women to seek further information and helped plan maternity leave. Compared to controls, trial participants who used the tool to plan their leave were far more likely to take prenatal leave close to term. Future evaluation of the tool when mediated by a health provider or employer is warranted...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{increase}} in expenses {{of the health}} care system caused by sick leaves, especially those granted to mothers with children of less than one year of age with severe diseases, is a topic of concern. Aim: To describe the rates of sick leaves granted to mothers with children of less than one year of age with severe diseases from 2004 to 2008. Material and Methods: Analysis of databases containing information about sick leaves coming from Chilean public and private health care subsystems. Leaves granted to mothers with sick children of less than one year were specifically analyzed in terms of days off work and the amount of monetary benefits. Results: A sustained increase, ranging from 20 to 120 % in the number of sick leaves motivated by diseases of children of less than one year, was observed. Thirty four percent of maternity leaves concentrate immediately after finishing the legal period (24 weeks after birth) and almost 60 % of them occured within the first 6 months after birth. The most frequent diagnoses that motivated the higher number of leaves were gas-troesophageal reflux and bronchitis. Conclusions: There is probably a bad use of the benefit in a percentage of leaves. The benefit is also regressive since it favors mostly mothers of a better socioeconomic condition. The law that will extend the <b>postnatal</b> maternity <b>leave</b> will solve in part these problems...|$|R
50|$|In general, neuroanatomical studies {{support the}} concept that autism may involve a {{combination}} of brain enlargement in some areas and reduction in others. These studies suggest that autism {{may be caused by}} abnormal neuronal growth and pruning during the early stages of prenatal and <b>postnatal</b> brain development, <b>leaving</b> some areas of the brain with too many neurons and other areas with too few neurons. Some research has reported an overall brain enlargement in autism, while others suggest abnormalities in several areas of the brain, including the frontal lobe, the mirror neuron system, the limbic system, the temporal lobe, and the corpus callosum. In neuroanatomical studies, when performing theory of mind and facial emotion response tasks, the median person on the autism spectrum exhibits less activation in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices of the brain than the median member of a properly sampled control population. This finding coincides with reports demonstrating abnormal patterns of cortical thickness and grey matter volume in those regions of autistic persons' brains.|$|R
50|$|Bianca and Liam {{decide to}} leave the Bay, but Liam realises {{that it is not}} what Bianca wants and he ends their marriage. Bianca {{develops}} Pre-eclampsia and is admitted to hospital. Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) tells her and Heath that the baby will have to be born early. Shortly before she goes into theatre, Bianca has a seizure and the doctors perform a caesarean section. When Bianca wakes up, she believes her baby has died, despite Heath taking her to meet their son. Sid then diagnoses her with <b>postnatal</b> psychosis. Bianca <b>leaves</b> to find Liam, forcing Sid to sedate her to get her back to the hospital. When Bianca comes round, she cannot remember the past few days and finally acknowledges the existence of her son. The baby has a fit and has to have a blood transfusion. Bianca and Heath decide to name their son Rocco. When Rocco is allowed home, Bianca and Heath decide to move into Irene's together, which makes Heath's daughter, Darcy (Alea O'Shea), feel left out. Bianca returns to work part-time, while Heath looks after Rocco. Rocco falls ill with meningitis, but recovers. The family move into the Braxton house and Bianca clashes with Heath's mother, Cheryl (Suzi Dougherty).|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{maternity leave}} policies, utilization and consequences in three separate, but related, papers. In the Introduction, I describe the ways state-level leave policies influence, {{but do not}} perfectly predict, utilization and then discuss the heterogeneity of women’s experiences during pregnancy and post-partum, and how that heterogeneity informs interpretation of results in this field. In Chapter 2 (“Laboring until labor: the prevalence and correlates of antenatal maternity leave in the United States”), I use {{a national survey of}} English-speaking women to examine maternity leave taken in the final weeks of pregnancy. I describe individual-, employer-, and policy-level correlates of antenatal leave (ANL), focusing in particular on variation in state temporary disability insurance (TDI) laws. I find that two-thirds of women in this sample stopped working more than a week before their due date, and that state policies significantly influenced leave-taking, even after controlling for characteristics of women and their jobs. While certain individual-level characteristics of women’s work were important, employer policies were not significantly associated with ANL use or duration. The literature does not yet include a national analysis of antenatal leave and its correlates. This paper fills that gap and sets up the following chapter on the consequences of taking ANL. In Chapter 3 (“Antenatal maternity leave and childbirth using the First Baby Study: a propensity score analysis”), I use survey data from a prospective cohort in Pennsylvania to test whether women who take maternity leave at the end of pregnancy have better labor and delivery outcomes. In this sample of women giving birth for the first time, fully half of the sample did not stop working before delivery. Using propensity score matching, I find that women who did stop working at least two days prior to delivery experienced more negative delivery outcomes, including an increased likelihood of unplanned Cesarean section. This paper highlights the strong selection into leave-taking, particularly in a context of limited leave availability. In Chapter 4 (“The impact of California’s Paid Family Leave law on maternal time use”), I shift focus to <b>postnatal</b> maternity <b>leave</b> and use the American Time Use Survey, a nationally-representative dataset collected by the U. S. Census Bureau, to examine whether the country’s first paid family leave (PFL) law increased the amount of time exposed women spent on childcare and decreased their time in paid work. Using a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach with variation in state, time, and age of youngest child, I find that after PFL, women in California significantly increased the time they spent with children in their care and slightly reduced their time spent working. Exploiting a natural experiment, I am able to avoid some of the selection concerns present in the previous chapter, but the daily diary nature of the data do not illuminate whether time use changed due to leave-taking, schedule changes, or some other factor. The results of these studies will inform future research on maternity leave and maternal health, and guide policymaking with regards to targeting and promoting maternity leave policies...|$|R
