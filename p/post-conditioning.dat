To elucidate longer lasting actions of ischemic <b>post-conditioning,</b> mice were exposed to a 60 -min stroke and <b>post-conditioning</b> by an additional 10 -min stroke that was induced 10  min after reperfusion onset. Animals were sacrificed 24  h or 28  days post-stroke. <b>Post-conditioning</b> reduced infarct volume and neurological deficits 24  h post-stroke, enhancing blood-brain barrier integrity, reducing brain leukocyte infiltration, and reducing oxidative stress. On the molecular level, <b>post-conditioning</b> yielded increased Hsp 70 expression, whereas nuclear factor (NF) -κB and proteasome activities were decreased. Reduced infarct volume and proteasome inhibition were reversed by Hsp 70 knockdown, suggesting a critical role of the Hsp 70 proteasome pathway in ischemic <b>post-conditioning.</b> The survival-promoting effects of ischemic <b>post-conditioning,</b> however, were not sustainable as neuroprotection and neurological recovery were lost 28  days post-stroke. Although angioneurogenesis was not increased by <b>post-conditioning,</b> the favorable extracellular milieu facilitated intracerebral transplantation of neural progenitor cells 6  h post-stroke, resulting in persisted neuroprotection and neurological recovery.

40|$|Background: Ischemic pre- or <b>post-conditioning</b> of {{the heart}} {{has been shown to}} involve opioid receptors. Remifentanil, an ultra-short-acting {{selective}} μ opioid receptor agonist in clinical use, pre-conditions the rat heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study investigates whether remifentanil <b>post-conditioning</b> is also cardioprotective. Methods: Remifentanil <b>post-conditioning</b> (5 -min infusion at 1, 5, 10 or 20 μg/kg/min) or ischemic <b>post-conditioning</b> (three cycles of a 10 s reperfusion interspersed with a 10 s ischemia) was induced in an open-chest rat heart model of ischemia and reperfusion injury, in {{the presence or absence of}} nor-binaltorphimine, naltrindole or CTOP, specific κ, δ and μ opioid receptor antagonists, respectively. The same sequence of experiments was repeated in the isolated heart model using the maximal protective dose of remifentanil from the dose-response studies. Results: Both ischemic and remifentanil <b>post-conditioning</b> reduced the myocardial infarct size relative to the control group in both models. This cardioprotective effect for both <b>post-conditioning</b> regimes was prevented by the prior administration of nor-binaltorphimine and naltrindole but not CTOP. The sole administration of the antagonists had no effect on the size of myocardial infarction. Conclusions: These results indicate that remifentanil <b>post-conditioning</b> protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury to a similar extent as of ischemic <b>post-conditioning.</b> This protection involves κ and δ but not μ opioid receptor activation. This drug has great potential as a clinical <b>post-conditioning</b> modality as it can be given in large doses without prolonged opioid-related side effects. © 2009 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation. postprin...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies, it {{was shown}} that <b>post-conditioning,</b> a transient period of brief ischemia following prolonged severe ischemia in the retina, could provide significant improvement in post-ischemic recovery, attenuation of cell loss, and decreased apoptosis. However, the mechanisms of <b>post-conditioning</b> in the retina have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that two kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase p 38 α and protein kinase B (Akt), {{were involved in the}} mechanism of <b>post-conditioning.</b> Ischemia was induced in rat retina in vivo. Recovery after ischemia followed by 8 min of <b>post-conditioning</b> early in the reperfusion period after prolonged ischemia was assessed functionally (electroretinography) and histologically at 7 days after ischemia. We examined the role of p 38 α and Akt subtypes 1 - 3 in <b>post-conditioning</b> by intravitreal injection of interfering RNA 6 h prior to ischemia and <b>post-conditioning</b> and compared the results to injection of non-silencing interfering RNA sequence. The blockade of p 38 α significantly decreased the recovery after ischemia and <b>post-conditioning,</b> and enhanced cell loss and disorganization of the retina. Blockade of Akt 1, and to a lesser degree, Akt 2, significantly decreased the recovery after ischemia and enhanced cell loss and disorganization. These differences in the effects of blockade of Akt subtypes were not explainable by distribution of Akt subtypes in the retina, which were similar.

We tested the hypothesis that alteration of brain mitochondrial (mito) K(ATP) channels might cause exacerbating brain injury after ischemic stroke and attenuate anesthetic <b>post-conditioning</b> induced neuroprotection in diabetes. We also examined whether hyperglycemic correction with insulin would restore anesthetic <b>post-conditioning</b> in diabetes. Non-diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with or without insulin were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia for 2 h followed by 24 h of reperfusion. <b>Post-conditioning</b> was performed by exposure to sevoflurane for 15 min, immediately {{at the onset of}} reperfusion. The role of the mitoK(ATP) channel was assessed by administration of a selective blocker 5 -hydroxydecanoate (5 -HD) before sevoflurane <b>post-conditioning</b> or by diazoxide (DZX), a mitoK(ATP) channel opener, given in place of sevoflurane. Compared with non-diabetic rats, diabetic rats had larger infarct volume and worse neurological outcome at 24 h after ischemia. Sevoflurane or DZX reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological outcome in non-diabetic rats but not in diabetic rats, and the protective effects of sevoflurane in non-diabetic rats were inhibited by pretreatment with 5 -HD. Molecular studies revealed that expression of Kir 6. 2, an important mitoK(ATP) channel component, was decreased in the brain of diabetic rats as compared to non-diabetic rats. In contrast, hyperglycemic correction with insulin in diabetic rats normalized expression of brain Kir 6. 2, reduced ischemic brain damage and restored neuroprotective effects of sevoflurane <b>post-conditioning.</b> Our findings suggest that decreased brain mitoK(ATP) channel contributes to exacerbating ischemic brain injury and the failure of neuroprotection by anesthetic <b>post-conditioning</b> in diabetes.

However, the relationship between PI 3 K with AMPA receptor GluR 2 subunit trafficking in propofol <b>post-conditioning</b> has never been explored. Here we showed that propofol <b>post-conditioning</b> promoted the binding of PI 3 K to the C-terminal of AMPA receptor GluR 2 subunit and formed a complex within 1 day after transient MCAO.

40|$|Abstract. The {{protective}} effects of sevoflurane <b>post-conditioning</b> against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (MIRI) have been previously reported. However, the mechanisms {{responsible for these}} {{protective effects}} remain elusive. In this study, in order to investigate the molecular mechanisms respon-sible for the protective effects of sevoflurane <b>post-conditioning</b> on isolated rat hearts subjected to MIRI, Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were randomly divided into the following 6 groups: i) the sham-operated control; ii) 2. 5 % sevoflurane; iii) isch-emia/reperfusion (I/R); iv) 2. 5 % sevoflurane <b>post-conditioning</b> plus I/R; v) 2. 5 % sevoflurane <b>post-conditioning</b> + NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) plus I/R; and vi) L-NAME plus I/R. The infarct size was measured using 2, 3, 5 -triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Additionally, the myocardial nitric oxide (NO), NO synthase (NOS) and nico-tinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels were determined. Autophagosomes and apoptosomes in the myocardium were detected by transmission electron microscopy. The levels of Bcl- 2, cleaved caspase- 3, Beclin- 1, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC 3) -I/II, Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE 1) and phosphorylated NHE 1 protein were measured by western blot analysis. NHE 1 mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with the I/R group, 15 min of exposure to 2. 5 % sevoflurane during early reperfusion significantly decreased the myocar-dial infarct size, the autophagic vacuole numbers, the NHE 1 mRNA and protein expression of cleaved caspase- 3, Beclin- 1 and LC 3 -I/II. <b>Post-conditioning</b> with 2. 5 % sevoflurane also increased the NO and NOS levels and Bcl- 2 protein expres-sion (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01). Notably, the cardioprotective effects of sevoflurane were partly abolished by the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. The findings {{of the present study}} suggest that sevo-flurane <b>post-conditioning</b> protects the myocardium against I/R injury and reduces the myocardial infarct size. The underlying protective mechanisms are associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and with the attenuation of cardiomyoctye apoptosis and excessive autophagy.

OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether activated ERK (pERK) plays a role in the acquisition and/or expression of lithium-induced CPA. METHODS: C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were subjected to lithium (150 mg/kg) -induced CPA. The role of pERK was determined by administering the mitogen-activating extracellular kinase inhibitor, SL 327, (a) 25 and 50 mg/kg, before each exposure to the lithium-associated compartment (acquisition), and (b) 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, before <b>post-conditioning</b> test (expression). To assess whether ERK is activated by acute lithium and, in distinct experiments, during CPA expression, mice were sacrificed, 30 min after lithium, and immediately after <b>post-conditioning</b> test, respectively, for pERK immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Lithium increased pERK-positive neurons in bed nucleus of stria termialis, in central and basolateral amygdala and elicited significant CPA. SL 327 (50 mg/kg) significantly prevented its acquisition. In addition, the <b>post-conditioning</b> test of lithium-conditioned mice determined a significant increase of pERK-positive neurons in the dorsal striatum and SL 327 (50 mg/kg), administered before <b>post-conditioning</b> test, while failing at the doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, to affect lithium-induced CPA expression, completely prevented it.

40|$|Brief {{periods of}} cardiac {{ischemia}} and reperfusion exert a protective effect against subsequent longer ischemic periods, a phenomenon coined ischemic preconditioning. Similar, repeated brief episodes of coronary occlusion and reperfusion {{at the onset}} of reperfusion, called <b>post-conditioning,</b> dramatically reduce infarct sizes. Interestingly, both effects can be achieved by the administration of any volatile anesthetic. In fact, cardio-protection by volatile anesthetics is an older phenomenon than ischemic pre- or <b>post-conditioning.</b> Although the mechanism through which anesthetics can mimic ischemic pre- or <b>post-conditioning</b> is still unknown, adenosine generation and signaling are the most redundant triggers in ischemic pre- or postconditioning. In fact, adenosine signaling has been implicated in isoflurane-mediated cardioprotection. Adenosine acts via four receptors designated as A 1, A 2 a, A 2 b, and A 3. Cardioprotection has been associated with all subtypes, although the role of each remains controversial. Much of the controversy stems from the abundance of receptor agonists and antagonists that are, in fact, capable of interacting with multiple receptor subtypes. Recently, more specific receptor agonists and new genetic animal models have become available paving way towards new discoveries. As such, the adenosine A 2 b receptor was shown to be the only 1 of the adenosine receptors whose cardiac expression is induced by ischemia in both mice and humans and whose function is implicated in ischemic pre-or <b>post-conditioning.</b> In the current review, we will focus on adenosine signaling in the context of anesthetic cardioprotection and will highlight new discoveries, which could lead to new therapeutic concepts to treat myocardial ischemia using anesthetic preconditioning...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{aim was to}} {{establish}} whether the efficacy of <b>post-conditioning</b> is maintained in aging hearts. BackgroundPost-conditioning, or relief of myocardial ischemia in a stuttered manner, {{has been shown to}} reduce infarct size, in part because of up-regulation of survival kinases (extracellular-signal regulated kinase [ERK] 1 / 2 or PI 3 -kinase/Akt) during the early min of reperfusion. All of these data have, however, been obtained in adult populations; the question of whether post-conditioning–induced cardioprotection is maintained in aging cohorts is unknown. MethodsIsolated buffer-perfused hearts were obtained from 3 - to 4 -month-old (adult) and 20 - to 24 -month-old C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and subjected to 30 min of ischemia. For each cohort, hearts were randomized to receive standard, abrupt (control) reperfusion, or were post-conditioned with 3 or 6 10 -s cycles of stuttered reflow. Primary end points were infarct size, cardiac expression of phospho-Akt, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 / 2 and phospho-ERK 1 / 2, and expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase-phosphatase- 1 (MKP- 1 : phosphatase purported to play a primary role in ERK dephosphorylation). ResultsIn adult mouse hearts, <b>post-conditioning</b> significantly reduced infarct size via up-regulation of ERK (but not Akt) signaling. In contrast, in the 2 -year-old cohort, <b>post-conditioning</b> failed to limit necrosis, possibly a consequence of the deficit in ERK phosphorylation and increased MKP- 1 expression seen in old hearts. Indeed, infusion of sodium orthovanadate, a nonspecific MKP inhibitor, attenuated MKP- 1 expression and restored the post-conditioned phenotype in old hearts. ConclusionsOld mouse hearts are refractory to infarct size reduction with <b>post-conditioning,</b> possibly because of an age-associated increase in MKP- 1 and resultant deficit in ERK phosphorylation...|$|E

We previously demonstrated involvement of protein kinase B (Akt) {{in this form}} of neuroprotection. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that specific Akt subtypes underlie this phenomenon. METHODS: Ischemia was produced by elevation of intraocular pressure above systolic arterial blood pressure for 55 min in anesthetized adult Wistar rats. <b>Post-conditioning</b> was produced by 8 min elevation of intraocular pressure to the same level at 5 min after reperfusion following ischemia. Interfering RNA (siRNA) to Akt subtypes 1, 2, or 3, or non-silencing siRNA was injected into the vitreous 6 h prior to ischemia. Recovery was assessed using electroretinography (ERG) and histological examination of 5 -micron thick retinal paraffin embedded sections. RESULTS: Injection of interfering RNA to Akt subtype 1 significantly decreased the <b>post-conditioning</b> ischemia protective effect as reflected by decreased recovery of the electroretinogram b wave and oscillatory potentials (OPs) (Figure).

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether <b>post-conditioning</b> {{at the time of}} percutaneous coronary intervention could reduce reperfusion-induced myocardial edema in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). BackgroundMyocardial edema is a reperfusion injury with potentially severe consequences. <b>Post-conditioning</b> is a cardioprotective therapy that reduces infarct size after reperfusion, but no previous studies have analyzed the impact of this strategy on reperfusion-induced myocardial edema in humans. MethodsFifty patients with STEMI were randomly assigned to either a control or post-conditioned group. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 48 to 72 h after admission. Myocardial edema was measured by T 2 -weighted sequences, and infarct size was determined by late gadolinium enhancement sequences and creatine kinase release. ResultsThe post-conditioned and control groups were similar with respect to ischemia time, the size of the area at risk, and the ejection fraction before percutaneous coronary intervention. As expected, <b>post-conditioning</b> was associated with smaller infarct size (13 ± 7 g/m 2 vs. 21 ± 14 g/m 2; p = 0. 01) and creatine kinase peak serum level (median [interquartile range]: 1, 695 [1, 118 to 3, 692] IU/l vs. 3, 505 [2, 307 to 4, 929] IU/l; p = 0. 003). At reperfusion, the extent of myocardial edema was significantly reduced in the post-conditioned group as compared with the control group (23 ± 16 g/m 2 vs. 34 ± 18 g/m 2; p = 0. 03); the relative increase in T 2 W signal intensity was also significantly lower (p = 0. 02). This protective effect was confirmed after adjustment for the size of the area at risk.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the protective effects of ischemic <b>post-conditioning</b> on damage to the barrier function of the small intestine caused by limb ischemia-reperfusion injury. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (N = 36 each) : sham operated (group S), lower limb ischemia-reperfusion (group LIR), and <b>post-conditioning</b> (group PC). Each group was divided into subgroups (N = 6) according to reperfusion time: immediate (0 h; T 1), 1 h (T 2), 3 h (T 3), 6 h (T 4), 12 h (T 5), and 24 h (T 6). In the PC group, 3 cycles of reperfusion followed by ischemia (each lasting 30 s) were applied immediately. At all reperfusion times (T 1 -T 6), diamine oxidase (DAO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) intestinal tissue concentrations, plasma endotoxin concentrations, and serum DAO, tumor necrosis factor-&# 945; (TNF-&# 945;), and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) concentrations were measured in sacrificed rats. Chiu&# 8217;s pathology scores for small intestinal mucosa were determined under a light microscope and showed that damage to the small intestinal mucosa was lower in group PC than in group LIR. In group PC, tissue DAO and SOD concentrations at T 2 to T 6, and IL- 10 concentrations at T 2 to T 5 were higher than in group LIR (P < 0. 05); however, tissue MPO and MDA concentrations, and serum DAO and plasma endotoxin concentrations at T 2 to T 6, as well as TNF-&# 945; at T 2 and T 4 decreased significantly (P < 0. 05). These results show that ischemic <b>post-conditioning</b> attenuated the permeability of the small intestines after limb ischemia-reperfusion injury. The protective mechanism of ischemic <b>post-conditioning</b> may be related to inhibition of oxygen free radicals and inflammatory cytokines that cause organ damage...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: 'Anaesthetic post-conditioning', that is {{administration}} of anaesthetics during early reperfusion, {{is known to}} have positive effects on several organs. For the kidney, however, the effects of <b>post-conditioning</b> by volatile anaesthetics are not well researched. We examined renal function and morphology after <b>post-conditioning</b> by desflurane. METHODS: Anaesthetized rats were subjected to 30 or 45 min of renal ischaemia 14 days after contralateral nephrectomy. <b>Post-conditioning</b> was achieved by {{administration of}} 1 MAC desflurane (6. 7 vol%) for 15 min during early reperfusion (all groups n= 8). Cystatin C (CyC), creatinine clearance (Cl(Cr)) and fractional sodium excretion (FE(Na)) were measured in the awake rats over 3 days. Cell damage was graded from 1 to 4 in histological sections. Functional variables [mean (SD) ] were compared statistically by a one-way anova followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test and histological scores (median and range) by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. RESULTS: Pre-ischaemia function did not differ between the groups, but was markedly reduced after ischaemia. After 30 min ischaemia, the area under the curve (AUC) for Cl(Cr) was smaller in the desflurane than in the control group [21. 5 (5. 0) vs 31. 6 (5. 1) ml min(- 1) h, P < 0. 05]. After 45 min desflurane reduced the AUC compared with the control group for both CyC [15 (4) vs 21 (3) mg litre(- 1) h] and FE(Na) [1054 (221) vs 1570 (572) % h, both P < 0. 05). Morphological differences were greater between the 30 min groups [control: 2. 75 (2. 0 - 3. 5) vs desflurane: 1. 5 (1. 0 - 2. 5); P < 0. 05] than between the 45 min groups [control: 3. 5 (3. 0 - 4. 0) vs desflurane: 3. 0 (1. 5 - 4. 0) ]. CONCLUSION: Desflurane <b>post-conditioning</b> protects renal function and tissue. This protection was greater after the short episode than after the long episode of ischaemi...|$|E

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta {{is known to be}} {{involved}} in myo-cardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and diabetes mellitus. However, the precise role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced brain injury is unclear. In this study, we observed the effects of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta on brain injury induced by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in diabetic rats. Rat models of diabetes mellitus were generated via intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury were generated by occluding the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. <b>Post-conditioning</b> comprised three cycles of ischemia/reperfusion. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays demonstrated that after 48 hours of reperfusion, the structure of the brain was seriously damaged in the experimental rats compared with normal controls. Expression of Bax, interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, and cleaved caspase- 3 in the brain was significantly increased, while expression of Bcl- 2, interleukin- 10, and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta was decreased. Diabetes mellitus can aggravate inflammatory reactions and apoptosis. Ischemic <b>post-conditioning</b> with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibitor lithium chloride can effectively reverse these changes. Our results showed that myocardial ischemic <b>post-conditioning</b> attenuated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced brain injury by activating glyco-gen synthase kinase 3 beta.

40|$|Ischaemic {{preconditioning}} and <b>post-conditioning</b> are cardioprotective {{interventions that}} salvage ischaemic myocardium and reduce infarct size. Yet this cardioprotective effect {{is not the}} sole response of the heart to ischaemic preconditioning and <b>post-conditioning.</b> It was known that protein kinase C activation in the signalling cascade of ischaemic preconditioning increased the affinity of the adenosine A 2 b receptor so that much lower concentrations of adenosine caused A 2 b receptor-dependent signalling. In {{this issue of the}} British Journal of Pharmacology, these cardioprotective interventions are shown to block desensitization of surface receptors on the sarcolemma of the cardiomyocyte and this receptor effect is divorced from any cardioprotection. Modulating receptor function through signalling pathways is a novel idea but, currently, whether these observations have any clinical relevance is not known. Additional investigations are warranted to determine whether this effect on receptors can be generalized to other surface receptors, and whether the effect can be harnessed to improve treatment of the patient with acute myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the current}} focus on {{developing}} neuroprotective therapies is aimed at preventing neuronal death. However, these approaches have not been successful despite many years of clinical trials mainly because the numerous side effects observed in humans and absent in animals used at preclinical level. Recently, the {{research in this field}} aims to overcome this problem by developing strategies which induce, mimic, or boost endogenous protective responses and thus do not interfere with physiological neurotransmission. Preconditioning is a protective strategy in which a subliminal stimulus is applied before a subsequent harmful stimulus, thus inducing a state of tolerance in which the injury inflicted by the challenge is mitigated. Tolerance may be observed in ischemia, seizure, and infection. Since it requires protein synthesis, it confers delayed and temporary neuroprotection, taking hours to develop, with a pick at 1 - 3 days. A new promising approach for neuroprotection derives from <b>post-conditioning,</b> in which neuroprotection is achieved by a modified reperfusion subsequent to a prolonged ischemic episode. Many pathways have been proposed as plausible mechanisms to explain the neuroprotection offered by preconditioning and <b>post-conditioning.</b> Although the mechanisms through which these two endogenous protective strategies exert their effects are not yet fully understood, recent evidence highlights that the maintenance of ionic homeostasis {{plays a key role in}} propagating these neuroprotective phenomena. The present article will review the role of protein transporters and ionic channels involved in the control of ionic homeostasis in the neuroprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning and <b>post-conditioning</b> in adult brain, with particular regards to the Na(+) /Ca 2 (+) exchangers (NCX), the plasma membrane Ca 2 (+) -ATPase (PMCA), the Na(+) /H(+) exchange (NHE), the Na(+) /K(+) / 2 Cl(-) cotransport (NKCC) and the acid-sensing cation channels (ASIC). Ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death and disability. Up until now, all clinical trials testing potential stroke neuroprotectants failed. For this reason attention of researchers has been focusing on the identification of brain endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms activated after cerebral ischemia. In this context, ischemic preconditioning and ischemic <b>post-conditioning</b> represent two neuroprotecive strategies to investigate in order to identify new molecular target to reduce the ischemic damage...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{a recent}} {{randomized}} controlled trial our group has demonstrated in 102 patients that late <b>post-conditioning</b> with sevoflurane {{performed in the}} intensive care unit after surgery involving extracorporeal circulation reduced damage to cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia reperfusion injury. On the first post-operative day the sevoflurane patients presented with lower troponin T values when compared with those undergoing propofol sedation. In order to assess possible clinical relevant long-term implications in patients enrolled in this study, we performed the current retrospective analysis focusing on cardiac and non-cardiac events during the first 6 months after surgery. METHODS All patients who had successfully completed the late <b>post-conditioning</b> trial were included into this follow-up. Our primary and secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients experiencing cardiac and non-cardiac events, respectively. Additionally, we were interested in assessing therapeutic interventions such as initiation or change of drug therapy, interventional treatment or surgery. RESULTS Of 102 patients analyzed in the primary study 94 could be included in this follow-up. In the sevoflurane group (with 41 patients) 16 (39 %) experienced one or several cardiac events within 6 months after cardiac surgery, in the propofol group (with 53 patients) 19 (36 %, p= 0. 75). Four patients (9 %) with sevoflurane vs. 7 (13 %) with propofol sedation had non-cardiac events (p= 0. 61). While a similar percentage of patients suffered from cardiac and/or non-cardiac events, only 12 patients in the sevoflurane group compared to 20 propofol patients needed a therapeutic intervention (OR: 0. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 04 - 1. 43, p= 0. 12). A similar result was found for hospital admissions: 2 patients in the sevoflurane group had to be re-admitted to the hospital compared to 8 in the propofol group (OR 0. 23, 95 % CI: 0. 04 - 1. 29, p= 0. 10). CONCLUSIONS Sevoflurane does not seem to provide protection with regard to the occurrence of cardiac and non-cardiac events in the 6 -month period following cardiac surgery with the use of extracorporeal circulation. However, there was a clear trend towards fewer interventions (less need for treatment, fewer hospital admissions) associated with sevoflurane <b>post-conditioning</b> in patients experiencing any event. Such results might encourage launching large multicenter <b>post-conditioning</b> trials with clinical outcome defined as primary endpoint...|$|E
