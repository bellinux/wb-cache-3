5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand as a challenge to duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 <b>paces.</b> He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 <b>paces.</b> While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} protect his retreat, Archduke Charles of Austria reunited his entire cavalry reserve, 44 squadrons in all, {{on either side of}} the Ratisbon road, next to the village of Eggolsheim. Between 19:00 20:00 in the evening, Napoleon ordered his cavalry to {{disperse}} the enemy horse from this position. In preparation of the charge, Nansouty formed five of his regiments in two lines: three regiments in the first line and two in the second line, leaving his remaining regiment with Saint-Sulpice. Saint-Sulpice's division was on Nansouty's right and it remained formed in regiment column formations, while the light cavalry was protecting the flanks of the whole. In all, the French had 48 squadrons, and, as they advanced, they were met by intense artillery fire from the Austrian batteries and then vigorously charged by the Gottesheim cuirassier regiment. Seeing the enemy charging, Nansouty ordered his squadrons forward towards the enemy, but at a gentle trot. Then, as soon as the Austrians were at about one hundred <b>paces,</b> the frontline regiment of Carabiniers-à-Cheval halted, loaded their carbines and fired a salvo from thirty or forty <b>paces,</b> then drew their swords and joined their fellow cuirassiers in an energetic charge. As Nansouty led, Saint-Sulpice followed and, despite the vigour and determination of the Austrian cavalry, they were repulsed after a brief hand-to-hand combat. Coming in support of the Gottesheim Cuirassiers, the Kaiser Cuirassier regiment shared the same fate, with the Stipsicz Hussars and Vincent Chevau-légers also repulsed. A generalised and bloody mêlée then occurred under the moonlight, with the sabre hits on the steel cuirasses producing sparkles in the night. Austrian General Andreas von Schneller was wounded during this action and General Karl Wilhelm von Stutterheim, commanding the entire Austrian cavalry, only just escaped capture. The Austrian cavalry was repulsed and pushed into the marshes beyond, subsequently retreating towards Köfering, with the bulk of Archduke Charles's forces retreating towards Ratisbon.|$|E

Much remains unknown about <b>PACE</b> as a choice of care, including what is enrollment in <b>PACE.</b> Thus, this qualitative descriptive study explored enrollment in a Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (<b>PACE)</b> {{from the perspective of}} elders, families, and staff. The research questions for this study were: What is enrollment in a <b>PACE?</b> When, how, and why do elders enroll in <b>PACE?</b> What events contribute or lead to enrollment in <b>PACE</b> from the perspectives of elders, families, and staff? This study answers to these questions through the description of <b>PACE</b> enrollment organized under the umbrella of Knowing the Whole Story, which exemplifies <b>PACE</b> enrollment at a collective level. Condition, Process, and Consequence illustrates the overall progression of <b>PACE</b> enrollment. The condition for <b>PACE</b> enrollment is The One, an individual who is accountable for what happens during <b>PACE</b> enrollment. The main process of <b>PACE</b> enrollment is looking for the best. Participants describe looking for the best using the practical terms of level four; learning, navigating, and visualizing.

5|$|Multiple rocket launcher: The first {{multiple}} rocket launchers {{were made}} during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty. It was designed to launch multiple rocket arrows from a gunpowder box. These also appeared later, in an expanded version, in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, where they were used with great effectiveness against the Japanese invasions of 1592–98, most notably the Battle of Haengju. Multiple rocket launchers evolved from Chinese fire lances when the Song military favored multiple rocket launchers that fired simultaneously up to 100 small fire-arrow rockets after the Mongol siege of Kaifeng. The typical powder section of such an arrow-rocket was 1/3 and 1/2 ft (10 to 15 cm) long. Bamboo arrow shafts varied from 1.5 ft (45 cm) to 2.5 ft (75 cm) long and the striking distance reached 300 to 400 <b>paces.</b> The Chinese also enhanced rocket tips with poison and made sure that the launchers were also mobile.

Analysis of pacemaker function and arrhythmias with various <b>pacing</b> modes (VVI <b>pacing,</b> 70 cases; AAI <b>pacing,</b> 19 cases; and DDD <b>pacing,</b> 35 cases) and measurement of hemodynamics revealed the following. In all <b>pacing</b> modes, atrial contraction {{was observed in}} cases of advanced atrioventricular block. However, in the VVI <b>pacing</b> mode with sick sinus syndrome, atrial contraction was often lost. In sick sinus syndrome group Ⅲ, pacemaker non-mediated arrhythmias were often recorded. <b>Pacing</b> failure was not noted with any atrial or ventricular <b>pacing.</b> Undersensing was observed in 26 % of the AAI <b>pacing</b> group and 7 % of the VVI <b>pacing</b> group. Myopotential inhibition was observed in 11 - 24 % of all <b>pacing</b> modes, but only two patients complained of subjective symptoms. DDD <b>pacing</b> with atrial sensing yielded effective increase of heart rate, but caused pacemaker tachycardia and pacemaker mediated tachycardia. In making these diagnosis and managing of pacemaker mediated arrhythmias, 24 -hour Hotter recordings were the most effective. In comparison of hemodynamics in any <b>pacing</b> mode, physiological <b>pacing</b> was significantly different from VVI <b>pacing</b> as to blood pressure, left atrial pressure and cardiac index.

The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 <b>paces</b> (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out.

The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E
40|$|Background: Has been {{reported}} that patients exhibiting prolonged <b>paced</b> QRS duration {{tend to have more}} serious heart disease, and the <b>paced</b> QRS duration can be an effective indicator of impaired left ventricular function.

Methods: A total of 14 patients who underwent electrophysiologic study for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were examined. RV <b>pacing</b> was performed at 10 different sites with cycle lengths of 600 ms and 500 ms utilizing a 6 - 7 F deflectable quadripolar electrode catheter. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures during <b>pacing</b> were measured once the blood pressure was stabilized. Results: During RV <b>pacing,</b> blood pressures (systolic/diastolic/mean) decreased.
