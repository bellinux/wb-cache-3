50|$|Dry {{granulation}} processes create granules {{by light}} compaction of the <b>powder</b> <b>blend</b> under low pressures. The compacts so-formed are broken up gently to produce granules (agglomerates). This process {{is often used}} when the product to be granulated is sensitive to moisture and heat. Dry granulation can be conducted on a tablet press using slugging tooling or on a roll press called a roller compactor. Dry granulation equipment offers {{a wide range of}} pressures to attain proper densification and granule formation. Dry granulation is simpler than wet granulation, therefore the cost is reduced. However, dry granulation often produces a higher percentage of fine granules, which can compromise the quality or create yield problems for the tablet. Dry granulation requires drugs or excipients with cohesive properties, and a 'dry binder' may need {{to be added to the}} formulation to facilitate the formation of granules.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, SOCOM {{requested}} Black Hills Ammunition {{to develop}} ammunition for the Mk 12 SPR that SOCOM was designing. For the rifle {{to be accurate}} out to 600 yards, Black Hills [...] "militarized" [...] a cartridge that used the Sierra 77 grain OTM (Open Tip Match) projectile; it switched from a [...]223 Remington to 5.56 mm case, increased pressure loading, crimped and sealed the primer, and added a flash retardant to the powder. The Mk 262 Mod 0 was adopted in 2002. Issues came up in development including reliability problems in different temperatures and when the weapon got dirty, and cycling issues in cold weather due to the slightly shorter barrel of the SPR compared to the full-length M16A2 barrel. The problems were addressed with a slower burning powder with a different pressure {{for use in the}} barrel, creating the Mk 262 Mod 1 in 2003. During the product improvement stage, the new propellant was found to be more sensitive to heat in weapon chambers during rapid firings, resulting in increased pressures and failure to extract. This was addressed with another <b>powder</b> <b>blend</b> with higher heat tolerance and improved brass. Also during the stage, Black Hills wanted the bullet to be given a cannelure, which had been previously rejected for fear it would affect accuracy. It was eventually added for effective crimping to ensure that the projectile would not move back into the case and cause a malfunction during auto-load feeding. Although the temperature sensitive powder and new bullet changed specifications, the designation remained as the Mod 1.|$|E

A method for simultaneous analysis of the two components of paracetamol and caffeine from <b>powder</b> <b>blends</b> has been developed by using chemometry with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The method development was performed on samples containing 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 % active pharmaceutical ingredients, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) spectra of prepared <b>powder</b> <b>blends</b> were recorded and analyzed {{in order to develop}} models for the prediction of drug content. Many calibration models were applied in order to perform quantitative determination of drug content in powder, and choosing the appropriate number of factors (principal components) proved to be of highly importance for a PLS chemometric calibration. Once the methods were developed, they were validated in terms of trueness, precision, and accuracy. The results obtained by NIRS methods were compared with those obtained by HPLC reference method, and no significant differences were found.

Currently in pharmaceutical industry, continuous <b>powder</b> <b>blending</b> has received more attention as an efficient alternative to the traditional batch <b>blending</b> of <b>powders</b> due to its ability in handling high-flux continuous tablet manufacturing. Numerous previous approaches have been performed focusing on investigating the applicability of continuous manufacturing system. However, the development of reliable industrial system is limited by the inaccuracy of mixing index, the complicated effects of operating conditions and the black-box characterization method, all of which result from the lack of a theoretical model that can quantitatively characterize the whole continuous powder mixing process. Therefore, the overall research objective of this work is to develop ii a general standard method for quantitative process design and control.

By increasing the mixing time above 10 minutes, particulate agglomeration which inhibit good packing of powdered particles occurs, thus, sintered density decreases and porosity increases. Therefore, high porosity in the powder bed hinders effective thermal conductivity between aluminium particles, thereby, leading to deterioration of the sintered density and microstructure of the SLS processed samples...|$|R

The {{effects of}} high energy milling on tin bronze with the {{composition}} Cu- 24. 6 wtSn {{have been examined}} using hardness testing, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. High energy milling has caused mechanical alloying of an elemental copper and tin <b>powder</b> <b>blend,</b> and mechanical milling of a cast powder and a melt quenched powder. Nanocrystalline grains with a size between 5 nm and 50 nm have been directly observed in the final milled powder. The powder consist of the a phase and 8 phase and is partially amorphous. An extension of the solid solution solubility has also been detected due to milling. The formation of the metastable tin-rich 11 phase has been observed in the intermediate stage of mechanical alloying of the elemental <b>powder</b> <b>blend</b> due to the higher diffusivity of tin in copper over copper in tin. The formation of the 11 phase during mechanical alloying of tin bronze with the composition Cu- 24. 6 wtSn has not been reported before. The morphological development of the three initial powders has proceeded by different mechanisms during milling due to the different hardness and toughness of the starting powders. Milling of the elemental <b>powder</b> <b>blend</b> and the cast powder proceeds via classic mechanisms for milling of ductile powders and brittle powders respectively, while milling of the tougher melt quenched powder proceeds via {{a combination of the}} two mechanisms. An attempt to process the milled powder into a bulk state using various thermomechanical techniques while still retaining a nanocrystalline grain size has not succeeded. The high diffusivity of the material at elevated temperatures has led to grain growth into the micrometer range even at relatively low thermo-mechanical processing temperatures.

40|$|Transferring {{processes}} {{between different}} scales {{and types of}} mixers is a common operation in industry. Challenges within this operation include the existence of considerable differences in blending conditions between mixer scales and types. Obtaining the correct blending conditions is crucial for the ability to break up agglomerates {{in order to achieve}} the desired blend uniformity. Agglomerate break up is often an abrasion process. In this study, the abrasion rate potential of agglomerates is described by the Stokes abrasion (StAbr) number of the system. The StAbrnumber equals the ratio between the kinetic energy density of the moving powder bed and the work of fracture of the agglomerate. In this study, the StAbrapproach demonstrates to be a useful tool to predict the abrasion of agglomerates during blending when technology is transferred between mixer scales/types.
