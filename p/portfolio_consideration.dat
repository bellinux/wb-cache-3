40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to study}} the effect of tenure on the {{structure}} of CEO compensation. The relation between CEO compensation and CEO tenure provides a good testing bed for many effects: the managerial power effect, the <b>portfolio</b> <b>consideration</b> effect, the learning effect, and the career concern effect. Design/methodology/approach – Tobit regressions were run of the percentage of equity-based compensation on CEO tenure and the effect of tenure compared between inside CEOs and outside CEOs. Findings – It was found that the percentage of equity-based compensation increases {{during the early years of}} tenure for outside CEOs, and decreases during the later years of tenure for inside CEOs. Before they are tenured, outside CEOs have significantly higher and faster growing percentage of equity-based compensation than inside CEOs. Furthermore, the <b>portfolio</b> <b>consideration</b> effect and the learning effect are the major effects in explaining the effect of tenure on the compensation structure. Practical implications – The evidence that boards of directors take into account the CEOs’ holdings of equity incentives, the types of CEOs, and their years on tenure to adjust the structure of CEO compensation indicates that firms should, and do, try to optimize their CEO compensation structure on the basis of firm-specific or CEO-specific characteristics. It is suggested that there is no simple formulaic approach to governance reform. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the literature by studying and explaining the different patterns of compensation structure over CEO tenure between inside CEOs and outside CEOs.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: South Africa has {{developed}} a significantly large number of highly successful global firms relative to its economy size – {{as evidenced by the}} market capitalisation of the South African stock exchange representing more than 180 % of the country’s gross domestic product, and its inclusion in the BRICS nations of leading emerging national economies. Whilst some of this success has been documented, the author found no evidence of the application of internationalisation theory to South African firms, whilst other emerging market research has yielded results that challenged early theoretical underpinnings and added value to a further understanding of internationalisation behaviour and motivation. SABMiller is the second largest brewer in the world and originated in South Africa. A great part of their success has been attributed to the culture and history of the organisation within its home market. The aim of this research report was therefore to uncover the drivers, strategies and critical success factors of SABMiller’s internationalisation move. Their motivations, enablers and modes of entry employed were further compared to extant literature in order to determine which, if any, theories are best suited to describe their process of internationalisation. This research report made use of a holistic, single, qualitative case study of SABMiller. Primary and secondary source data were collected in the form of semi-structured interviews conducted with 29 current and former senior managers of SABMiller or their investment partners, all of whom were involved in some degree with the organisation’s internationalisation. The individuals interviewed related experience pertaining to particular cross-sectional time-periods within SABMiller’s internationalisation process. Data were then examined using thematic analysis and compared to theories posited in literature on the subject. It was found that whilst extant literature on internationalisation provides useful, broad frameworks within which to analyse the paths followed by an organisation, a more holistic regard of the body of literature is recommended, particularly in analysing emerging-market multi-national enterprises (EM MNE) whose history and culture {{play a significant role in}} determining internationalisation behaviour. The role of SABMiller’s South African home culture as a differentiator, as well as the development of a deep talent pool in enabling rapid expansion, was telling in their success. Operating excellence was a competitive advantage in the majority of markets they entered, whilst their in-house mergers and acquisitions (M&A) competence, coupled with a distinctive partnering ability, demonstrated clearly the advantage of building and maintaining strong relationships and network positions when internationalising. SABMiller’s initial expansion sought to counter the threat of becoming a takeover target in their own right, as well as seeking new markets that were both affordable and could match the relative competitive advantages they had developed. As the company grew, their motivations expanded to a <b>portfolio</b> <b>consideration</b> of balancing risk and currency exposure in emerging markets, with more stable profit pool participation in developed markets. In entering new markets, SABMiller utilised a beachhead approach whereby their main aim was to secure entry to a desired market from which they would be able to expand further – through either organic market share gain, increased ownership of their joint ventures, or further acquisitions within the market. Firms engaging in foreign expansion for the first time need to understand clearly their relative advantages, to what they owe that endowment, and to what extent those advantages are sustainable in the face of global competition. Furthermore, locational advantages of a target country must be viewed relative to the competitive advantages they possess within the context of their product class, industry structure, nature of the knowledge to be transferred, and where the value generation lies within their structure. Global government priorities and political stability are varied and can have an overriding impact on a firm’s choices and ability to internationalise effectively. Investment into local communities and alignment to priorities of social development and environmental preservation are becoming increasingly important and internationalising firms need to factor this into consideration in order to increase their chances of success. The significant impact of governments on internationalisation is highlighted in the literature and is particularly evident in the case of SABMiller. With the added importance of investment towards societal goals, a study of the motivators and priorities of host governments may add value to firms in partnering effectively when internationalising, particularly within the realm of value chain development. The author further recommends research be conducted on the impact of South African culture on internationalisation success – particularly where expatriation forms part of a firm’s strategy, whilst the role of leadership as a differentiator in successful internationalisation is an area not explored extensively within this study, nor was significant reference found in the literature. It was uncovered as a significant theme in SABMiller’s expansion, however, and thus is an area that may warrant further exploration...|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} of investment by multinational enterprises has been investigated from many perspectives. It {{has been suggested that}} investment may be motivated by experience of a particular location represented by tenure of operations. In contrast, <b>portfolio</b> <b>considerations</b> suggest that increased investment in a given location increases risk exposure. In this paper, the question of whether a multinational with a longer duration of operations at a particular location is more likely to invest further is addressed after taking portfolio risk into account. A conceptual model of multinational investment strategy is developed and empirically tested using data from a survey of multinational enterprises operating in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom. Two innovative non-parametric tests for duration dependence are applied. After normalising for <b>portfolio</b> <b>considerations,</b> it is found that multinational investment is significantly duration dependent, i. e., firms with a longer tenure of operations are significantly more likely to invest in any given period. This finding has important implications for the strategy of inward investment agencies. In particular, an investment agency is short-sighted if it seeks to attract new investors if that is at the expense of neglecting multinationals with current operations in its jurisdiction. © 1998 JIBS.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} inspired by the seminal contribution of Marglin and Bhaduri (1988) has debated the distributional determinants of demand and growth.

The balance of payments constraint that results ensures that simply raising the wage does not yield a higher stock of real capital. A lower mark-up may increase the steady state stock of capital but only through the relative price channel. These results are much stronger than those derived by existing literature, and more importantly, emerge regardless of whether the demand regime is wage-led or profit-led in autarky...|$|R

The sample includes countries in which the parallel exchange rate is official (dual exchange rate systems) {{as well as those}} in which it is unofficial (black market). They base their empirical analysis on a portfolio macroeconomic model in which the parallel exchange rate is determined by expectations and equilibrium asset considerations in the short run, but depends on the evolution of key policy variables (such as stock of money, budget deficits, and trade policy) in the long run. The results indicate that macroeconomic variables explain more than 70 percent of the variation in the spread between the official and parallel exchange rates. The authors cannot reject the hypothesis that there are no differences in {{the determinants of}} the spread when the parallel rate is official and unofficial. Also, they cannot reject the hypothesis that restrictions on the capital account affect the spread. These results are consistent with prior findings that <b>portfolio</b> <b>considerations</b> dominate the determination of the parallel rate in the short run. There is evidence that the adoption of dual exchange rate systems only partly insulates domestic prices. This insulation may be limited by : 1) a leakage of transactions from the official to the parallel market; and 2) depreciation of the parallel exchange rate.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the link between}} portfolio diversification models of exchange risk and the macroeconomics of exchange rate determination. A first part sets out the mean-variance model of portfolio choice for the case of two nominal assets with random real returns. From there the model is made "international" by a specification of the world inflation process. The concept of exchange risk is {{discussed in terms of}} the variability of the real exchange rate. The paper shows that when all randomness in real returns derives from variability of the real exchange rate, rather than from inflation variability, full hedging is possible. Even for the case of no real exchange rate variability, it is shown, variability of the nominal rate of depreciation is a determinant of the portfolio composition. The risk premium is derived and discussed in terms of the deviation of the anticipated rate of depreciation from the interest differential. The actual rate of depreciation may exceed the interest differential either because of news or because of a risk premium that depends on the relative asset supplies compared to their shares in a minimum variance portfolio. An appendix investigates the implications of tastes and differences and shows that there is an additional component of the premium due to differences in consumption patterns. The portfolio model is integrated In a macro-model to show how the relative supplies of non-monetary assets, through yield and valuation effects, determine the impact and long run consequences of real and nominal monetary disturbances. The integration of the portfolio and macro models relies crucially on the properties of the demand for money. A demand for money that depend. on the average return on securities, rather than on the domestic interest rate, implies that <b>portfolio</b> <b>considerations</b> do not affect exchange rates. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} capital flight {{presents}} an interesting paradox towards capital accumulation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Though Africa has been labelled as "the rising continent" by various researchers, {{we continue to}} see capital flight and its adverse effects extend beyond the lack of domestic investment capital, to sluggish economic growth and disquieting poverty rates. This paradox {{highlights the importance of}} understanding the drivers of capital flight from Africa. Among the many postulated determinants, this study investigates the effect of the exchange rate on capital flight using 3 case studies from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia for the period 1970 to 2010. By employing Granger's (1969) causality test, we investigate the causal relation between capital flight and the exchange rate. We further use the Johansen (1988) Method of Cointegration to determine the existence of a long run relationship and estimate a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to determine the short run dynamics. Our granger causality test results suggest that the direction of causality between capital flight and the real exchange rate only holds in the period under analysis and therefore, it should not be assumed to hold in different time periods. Our main findings suggest that capital flight from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia is habitually motivated by <b>portfolio</b> <b>considerations.</b> We find that capital flight from Nigeria and South Africa is driven by expected currency depreciation while capital flight from Zambia is driven by expected currency appreciation in the long run. Our other findings suggest that other macroeconomic policy errors in the form of inflation unpredictability and foreign direct investment also increase capital flight from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia. We also find that political factors have a significant role in determining capital flight from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia. We however find inconclusive evidence of the short run effects in all three countries. It is recommended that the imposition of efficient exchange controls can curb capital flight when implemented concurrently with effective macroeconomic management practices by the fiscal authorities...|$|R
