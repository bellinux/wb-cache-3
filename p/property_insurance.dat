5|$|After the Machtergreifung (NSDAP {{seizure of}} power) in January 1933, the relief fund was {{repurposed}} to provide general accident and <b>property</b> <b>insurance,</b> so Bormann resigned from its administration. He {{applied for a}} transfer and was accepted {{as chief of staff}} in the office of Rudolf Hess, the Deputy Führer, on 1 July 1933. Bormann also served as personal secretary to Hess from 4 July 1933 until May 1941. Hess' department was responsible for settling disputes within the party and acted as an intermediary between the party and the state regarding policy decisions and legislation. Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involve himself in as much of the decision-making as possible. On 10 October 1933 Hitler named Bormann Reichsleiter (national leader – the highest party rank) of the NSDAP, and in November he was named Reichstag deputy. By June 1934, Bormann was gaining acceptance into Hitler's inner circle and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests.|$|E
