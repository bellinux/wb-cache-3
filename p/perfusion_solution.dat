40|$|AbstractPurpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) under the conditions of an isolated extracorporeal circuit. Methods: Plasma levels of tPA were measured in the <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution</b> and in central venous blood before, during, and after the perfusion in seven patients undergoing regional hyperthermic fibrinolytic perfusion with tPA in addition to surgical thrombectomy for extended deep venous thrombosis. Results: After 15 minutes of fibrinolytic perfusion, the level of tPA in the <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution</b> was 10, 427 ± 4432 ng/mL, and after 30 minutes the maximum level of 19, 726 ± 5630 ng/mL was reached. After 60 minutes when the perfusion was discontinued, tPA concentrations dropped to 15, 931 ± 4818 ng/mL. In central venous blood, tPA levels increased to a maximum of 230. 7 ± 89. 6 ng/mL after 60 minutes of perfusion, which represented 1. 4 % of the concentration measured in the <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution</b> at the same time. With disconnection of the extracorporeal circuit, the tPA levels in central venous blood decreased rapidly and reached a level of 24. 1 ± 8. 7 ng/mL after 120 minutes. Conclusion: The use of regional hyperthermic fibrinolytic perfusion in the treatment of extended deep venous thrombosis makes it possible to achieve extremely high concentrations of tPA in the <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution.</b> At the same time, the entry of the fibrinolytic agent into the systemic circulation is minimized.

40|$|We have {{performed}} microperfusion studies on distal tubules of normal and alkalotic rats {{in an attempt}} to demonstrate in vivo bicarbonate secretion. All <b>perfusion</b> <b>solutions</b> were free of phosphate and other nonbicarbonate buffers. In both normal and alkalotic rats, distal perfusions elicited significant tCO 2 entry only at high flow (24 nl/min). Even when perfusate tCO 2 concentration closely matched plasma tCO 2 concentration (30 mM tCO 2), significant tCO 2 entry again occurred at high flow. This was associated with a rise of the perfusate tCO 2 concentration, which indicated net entry of tCO 2 against a concentration gradient. In this "symmetrical" perfusion situation, acetazolamide blockade prevented tCO 2 entry. Accordingly: distal tubule tCO 2 entry is demonstrable in both alkalotic and normal rats at high flow rates; increasing perfusate tCO 2 concentration can suppress tCO 2 entry; and entry can occur {{in the absence of a}} gradient and this effect can be blocked by acetazolamide...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of reviewThis article {{summarizes}} novel {{developments in}} hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) as an organ preservation modality for kidneys recovered from deceased donors. Recent findingsHMP {{has undergone a}} renaissance in recent years. This renewed interest has arisen parallel to a shift in paradigms; not only optimal preservation of an often marginal quality graft is required, but also improved graft function and tools to predict the latter are expected from HMP. The focus of attention in this field is currently drawn {{to the protection of}} endothelial integrity by means of additives to the <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution,</b> improvement of the HMP solution, choice of temperature, duration of perfusion, and machine settings.

This phenomenon was observed both in air and under anoxia, and also in segments pretreated with methanol or pre-heated in a microwave oven. Therefore, the adjustment in pH does not depend on the respiratory metabolism but originates in the buffering action of the xylem wall apoplast. High concentrations of protons induced the release of other cations into the xylem exudate under anox-ia, and high concentrations of K+ or Ca 2 + ions induced the release of protons into the xylem under anoxia.

40|$|The lung is, {{more than}} other solid organs, {{susceptible}} for ischemia reperfusion injury after orthotopic transplantation. Corticosteroids are known to potently suppress pro-inflammatory processes when given in the post-operative setting or during rejection episodes. Whereas their use has been approved for these clinical indications, there is no study investigating its potential as a preservation additive in preventing vascular damage already in the phase of ischemia. To investigate these effects we performed orthotopic lung transplantations (LTX) in the rat. Prednisolone was either added to the <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution</b> for lung preservation or omitted and rats were followed for 48 hours after LTX. Prednisolone preconditioning significantly increased survival and diminished reperfusion edema. Hypoxia induced vasoactive cytokines such as VEGF were reduced. Markers of leukocyte invasiveness like matrix metalloprotease (MMP) - 2, or common pro-inflammatory molecules like the CXCR 4 receptor or the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) - 2 were downregulated by prednisolone. Neutrophil recruitment to the grafts was only increased in Perfadex treated lungs. Together with this, prednisolone treated animals displayed significantly reduced lung protein levels of neutrophil chemoattractants like CINC- 1, CINC- 2 α/β and LIX and upregulated tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 1. Interestingly, lung macrophage invasion was increased in both, Perfadex and prednisolone treated grafts, as measured by MMP- 12 or RM 4. Markers of anti-inflammatory macrophage transdifferentiation like MRC- 1, IL- 13, IL- 4 and CD 163, significantly correlated with prednisolone treatment.

40|$|Thin {{descending}} limb {{cells from}} Henle's loop (from the inner strip {{of the outer}} medulla of long loops) were studied with optical and video techniques to identify the mechanisms of ion transport and cell volume regulation. Increasing the K+ concentration in the basolateral solution from 5 to 90 mM caused the cells to swell. This K+-induced swelling was inhibited by exposure of the basolateral membrane to 9 mM Ba 2 + and was abolished by removing Cl- from the <b>perfusion</b> <b>solutions.</b> Decreasing the <b>perfusion</b> osmolality caused an increase in cell volume followed by {{a return to the}} preexposure volume.

These data suggest that the basolateral cell membrane of the thin descending limb has a Cl- -dependent K+ permeability, which is important in cell volume regulation.

No studies have been performed comparing different <b>perfusion</b> <b>solutions</b> for HP. The aim of this experimental study was to compare Ringer-lactate solution (RL) with Celsior solution (Cs) for HP in a pig model of 60 -min TVE.

The pH of solution 2 was 7. 56 - 7. 85, and 85 - 92 % of the phosphate was in the form of HPO 4 =. Solution 3 contained HCO 3 - and glucose and had a pH of 7. 50 - 7. 65. When the proximal tubules were perfused with solution 1, the 32 P concentration in the collected perfusate was found to be consistently lower than in the initial <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution.</b> In sharp contrast, when the tubules were perfused with solutions 2 or 3, 32 P concentration usually rose above that in the initial solution.

Administration of partially purified PTH clearly prevented the fall in phosphate concentration with the acid solution, but had a less discernible effect on phosphate reabsorption with the two alkaline solutions. Measurements of pH within the perfused segments with antimony microelectrodes demonstrated that PTH enhanced alkalinization of the acid <b>perfusion</b> <b>solution.</b> The findings are consistent with the view that H 2 PO 4 - is reabsorbed preferentially over HPO 4 =.

40|$|Using a double-lumen tube <b>perfusion</b> system, <b>solutions</b> of glucose (1 · 0, 2 · 5, and 5 · 0 g 100 ml− 1) {{have been}} perfused {{into the upper}} jejunum of 22 Zambian African {{subjects}} in order to study their glucose absorption kinetics. None of them had clinical evidence of malnutrition or intestinal disease. In 10 {{there was no evidence}} of an infective disease (`normal' group); seven had tuberculosis; five had acute bacterial infections. The mean serum albumin concentration was significantly lower in those with infections; the mean total and γ-globulin concentrations were significantly higher in the tuberculosis group...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{importance of}} pressure ulcers is reviewed confirming {{the need for}} continuous monitoring of skin blood perfusion at the patient – mattress interface. The design of a low profile (H≈ 1 mm) laser Doppler probe is then described together with the experimental setup used for evaluation. The {{results show that the}} performance of the new sensor does not vary significantly from that of currently available probes over a wide range of operating parameters. The authors conclude that the sensor design provides a low cost <b>perfusion</b> monitoring <b>solution</b> with potential to significantly reduce the risk of bed sores in hospital patients...|$|R
