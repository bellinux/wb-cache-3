40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop an {{innovative}} process for pickling and passivating tungsten inert gas welds on austenitic stainless steel {{in order to obtain}} complete removal of non-protective oxides and to passivate the metal surface. In particular, the treatment intends to increase both corrosion resistance and surface appearance of the steel without making use of traditional pickling solutions (which usually contain high concentrations of strong acids). The treatment, based on an electrochemical approach, uses specific electrolytes, and to evaluate their effect in terms of corrosion resistance and surface finish, different solutions were prepared and tested using low concentrations of weak organic acids, e. g. citric, oxalic, sulphamic, gluconic and lactic acids. This aspect is very important to reduce the hazardousness of the solution compared to the traditional <b>pickling</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|E

Acid solutions are used in various industries during <b>acid</b> <b>pickling,</b> <b>acid</b> descaling, industrial cleaning and oil-well acidization, etc. [2]. Acidic media results in a uniform corrosion of mild steel with pitting at high concentrations of acid [3, 4, 5, 6]. The use of inhibitors {{is one of the most}} proficient methods for protection of metals from corrosion in acid medium. Organic compounds containing N, O, S heteroatoms and π electrons in their molecules are considered as effective corrosion inhibitors [2, 3, 4, 5]. The inhibitor molecules form a protective film on metal surface that prevents corrosion [7]. Nowadays, researchers are mainly focusing on the use of non-toxic and “green” corrosion inhibitors, e.g., plant extracts and drugs to obviate the harmful effect of chemicals on environment [8, 9, 10]. Because of their non-toxic characteristics [18] and negligible negative impacts on the aquatic environment [19], drugs (chemical medicines) seem to be the ideal candidates to replace traditional toxic corrosion inhibitors [9]. A number of studies are available describing the application of drugs as efficient corrosion inhibitors [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].|$|R
