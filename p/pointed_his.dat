5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} Razor 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{when he came to}} the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E
5|$|Moltke and {{the other}} battlecruisers {{followed}} the move, which put them astern of König. Hipper's badly battered ships gained a temporary moment of respite, and uncertainty over the exact location and course of Scheer's ships led Admiral Jellicoe to turn his ships eastward, towards {{what he thought was}} the likely path of the German retreat. The German fleet was instead sailing west, but Scheer ordered a second 16-point turn, which reversed course and <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> ships {{at the center of the}} British fleet. The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent Moltke, Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and Derfflinger at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat. By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within 7,700yards (7,040m) of , at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line. However, three minutes later, the German battlecruisers turned in retreat, covered by a torpedo boat attack.|$|E

5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E

25|$|The next day, August 10, 1977, police {{investigated}} Berkowitz's {{car that}} was parked on the street outside his apartment building at 35 Pine Street in Yonkers. They saw a rifle in the backseat, searched the car, and found a duffel bag filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes, and a threatening letter addressed to Inspector Timothy Dowd of the Omega Task Force. Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to leave the apartment, rather than risk a violent encounter in the building's narrow hallway; they also waited to obtain a search warrant for the apartment, worried that their search might be challenged in court. The initial search of the vehicle {{was based on the}} rifle that was visible in the back seat, although possession of such a rifle was legal in New York State and required no special permit. The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00p.m. and entered his car. Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car. Falotico <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> gun inches from the temple of the person of interest, while Detective Sgt. William Gardella <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> gun from the passenger's side.|$|E

In Stepashin's place he {{appointed}} Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor. In late 1999 Yeltsin and President Clinton openly disagreed {{on the war in}} Chechnya.

25|$|Pukanić, an {{influential}} and controversial person in Croatian politics, was already targeted {{in a murder}} attempt on April 9, 2008 in western downtown Zagreb, near Franjo Tuđman Square. He was shot at with a silenced pistol at close range. Pukanić crouched as the perpetrator <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> gun at him and successfully dodged the bullet, which created {{a hole in the}} window of a nearby gift shop. The perpetrator's gun subsequently jammed, enabling Pukanić to pull his legally-owned Glock 17 out of his bag. Pukanić fired a warning shot, causing the perpetrator to flee the crime scene. A facial composite of the perpetrator, who was unmasked and wore a dark knitted cap, was publicly released five days after the attack.|$|E

25|$|Murphy, then {{faced with}} the {{charging}} gang members, raised the rifle toward them and took aim. Gang member W. H. Jackson <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> revolver at Tanner, who testified that Jackson was “possibly twenty or thirty feet” away. Tanner was unarmed and could do nothing. Jackson probably noticed Murphy was aiming his now-dead boss' rifle in his direction. This, coupled with the fast-approaching men from the Citizen's Committee, who prematurely ended their meeting {{with the sound of}} gun fire, perhaps convinced Jackson not fire his pistol at Tanner. Someone yelled out towards the men who were with Smith, “They have killed Soapy, and if you don’t clear out quick they will kill you too.” Not wanting to engage in a gun battle in which they were vastly outnumbered, the gang fled.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
25|$|Graeme Le Saux, an England {{international}} left-back, endured homophobic taunts {{despite being}} married with children. The rumours allegedly began {{because of his}} “unladdish hobbies” which included antique collecting, and his university background. He later admitted he had considered quitting the game because of the abuse and the humiliation he felt. One example of the public abuse he suffered came in a Premier League match between Chelsea and Liverpool on 27 February 1999, Le Saux became involved in a running series of taunts with Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler. With Le Saux preparing to take a free kick, Fowler repeatedly bent over and <b>pointed</b> <b>his</b> backside in the Chelsea player's direction. Despite the obvious taunts, Le Saux, who refused to take the free kick, was booked for delay of play. Unseen by the match officials, Le Saux later struck Fowler {{on the edge of}} the Chelsea penalty area. Both were later charged with misconduct by the FA.|$|E
