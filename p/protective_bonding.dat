40|$|Background The {{experience}} of being a grandparent of a grandchild with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a previously under-researched area. This study sets out to examine the grandparents' own perspective in an exploratory way using a qualitative approach to answer the question, 'What is the experience like?' Method A qualitative research project, using a purposive sampling technique and semi-structured interviews to examine the experiences of six grandparents of children with ASD diagnosed by a specialist team in a second opinion Tier 4 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. Results The experiences of the grandparents were characterized by three Key Themes which emerged from the interviews: (1) The Parental Bond (<b>protective</b> <b>bonding</b> towards grandchild and adult child); (2) Striving for Answers (searching for meaning); (3) Keeping Intact (holding the family together). Conclusion The study suggests some interesting insights and confirms {{the need for more}} attention to this area. A key question raised by the study is how a child-focused multidisciplinary team can embrace its role in delivering a family-centred service. The clinical implications of this project have led to a change of practice in the specialist team. Further research would be appropriate to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness and cost effectiveness of involving grandparents as part of the assessment process...|$|E

50|$|Transgender {{inmates in}} some prisons {{are able to}} form {{communities}} with each other or with cisgender inmates, and these relationships both help prevent violence and help support those who have experienced it.

These groups sometimes commit violent acts to defend or avenge a friend who has been hurt, as in the case in a New York men’s prison when a group of men killed another man who had attacked a young female transgender inmate; however, despite this violence, it is evident that transgender women sometimes form strong and <b>protective</b> <b>bonds</b> with other inmates that are taken away in solitary confinement.

40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to present the most {{important}} conflicts of interest between "agents and principals" {{as well as the}} mechanisms for limiting these conflicts. The reduction of free cash flow through the use of debt, and the use of <b>protective</b> <b>bond</b> covenants, are important means of reducing agency costs. It is pointed out that new equity dilutes the holdings of managers with equity interests, increasing their motive to waste resources, while debt reduces free cash flow, and the opportunity for managers to waste resources. Various types of protective covenants are presented in the paper. Because shareholders must pay higher interest rates as insurance against their own selfish strategies they frequently make agreements with bondholders in the hope of paying lower interest rates. These agreements are incorporated as part of the loan document between shareholders and bondholders. These protective covenants should reduce the costs of bankruptcy and ultimately increase the value of the firm. conflict, agency theory, covenants...|$|R

Those blades are often protected by a thermal barrier coating system (TBC) consisting of a metallic bond coat for corrosion and oxidation resistance and a ceramic top coat. Plasma-sprayed MCrAlY bond coats (M=Co,Ni) are commonly used for this application.

40|$|Background School {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} typified by diversity of provision, parental choice and publication of performance data. Schools shape their students' lifestyles and health, but {{the effects of}} 'marketisation' are under-researched. The authors use qualitative data to develop a logic model regarding such effects. Methods Case studies in seven English secondary schools, interviews with 103 students and 39 staff. Results 'Parental choice' was associated with dispersal of students' friendship groups on transition to secondary school, reduced social support and emotional harms. 'Choice' meant some schools were regarded as 'dumping grounds' for socially disadvantaged students, creating potentially violent environments where students engaged in risk behaviours such as substance use to facilitate <b>protective</b> <b>bonds</b> with peers. Schools focused strongly on academic attainment, reflecting external pressures from the school inspectorate and performance league tables. Some schools sought to improve their league table position by targeting resources on 'key marginal' students {{on the threshold of}} passing five exams, the key metric. Less-academic students commonly became disengaged, engaging in various health risk behaviours as alternative status markers. The exam-focused environment aroused anxiety among high and low attainers, some using substances as self-medication. Schools also de-prioritised health education and sport in this performance-driven context.

40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of extraneous conductive parts (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the main grounding terminal. There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between extraneous conductive parts and exposed conductive parts is zeroed and extraneous conductive parts {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all extraneous conductive parts to the <b>protective</b> equipotential <b>bonding</b> because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these extraneous conductive parts are present but not connected to the <b>protective</b> equipotential <b>bonding</b> is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety against indirect contacts. The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the main grounding terminal. Also in brick buildings, they provide a certain reduction of GPR, maximum and mean touch voltages...|$|R

3000|$|High {{leverage}} {{and a low}} {{present value}} of the firm may give rise to the following agency conflicts of debt, because under these conditions managers may have incentives to transfer wealth from bondholders to shareholders. First, managers may forego positive net present value projects if the expected project gains are required to satisfy fixed payment obligations to the bondholders (Myers 1977). Corporate hedging can relieve this problem, as a reduction of cash flow variability increases the probability that shareholders are residual owners after reimbursing the bondholders. Moreover, when external financing is more costly than internal financing (Myers and Majluf 1984), firms may forgo profitable investments {{due to a lack}} of internal funds. Froot et al. (1993) show that under this condition, corporate hedging may be used as instrument to coordinate the availability of internal funds. Secondly, managers acting in the best interest of shareholders may give rise to asset substitution by replacing low-risk assets with high-risk investments (Smith and Warner 1979). This is because shareholders’ equity positions are a call option on the company’s assets, and high variance projects enlarge option value (Mason and Merton 1985). However, for fixed payment receivers this exchange of assets raises additional risk. Hence, bondholders anticipating the opportunistic behavior of management claim higher returns or <b>protective</b> <b>bond</b> covenants, due to increasing risk and higher agency costs (Jensen and Meckling 1976). Corporate hedging adds value to the firm by lowering the project’s risk and accordingly diminishing agency costs which arise from the managerial incentive of asset substitution. Campbell and Kracaw (1990) additionally contribute that also credible commitments to hedge (for example, obligated hedging of interest rate risks via debt covenants) reduce agency costs of debt by lowering the incentive to asset substitution. Thus, we receive the following hypothesis H 4, which we test by capital expenditures, R&D expenses, and Tobin’s Q as proxy variables: [...]...|$|R

40|$|Materials for front stage {{blades and}} vanes of land based gas turbine and aero engines must be {{resistant}} to the extreme service conditions, which include thermal, chemical and mechanical effects. To ensure a sufficient service life time at continuous operating temperatures in excess of 1000 C the combined advantages of both metallic and ceramic materials are recently used by applying a ceramic thermal barrier coating (TBC) of partially yttria stabilised zirconia (P-YSZ) {{on top of the}} vacuum plasma sprayed <b>protective</b> <b>bond</b> coat (BC), which protects the underlying substrate material from oxidative attack. The main aim of this project was to develop a life time prediction model for the top coat of the APS-TBC systems for isothermal and cyclic oxidation conditions. This model should emphasize the oxidation induced failure mechanisms as well as take into account the appropriate thermal mechanical loading parameters as well as the relevant material properties and provide a reasonable description of the damage evolution process. Additionally, the model should quantify the relevant bond coat parameters that influence the spallation life time. The advancements that this project has made in ex-situ and in-situ measurement technology are still providing a large amount of insight with regard to the adhesion and the degradation of the top coat. Consequently it is now possible to propose life time prediction models that are based on semi-detailed information about the top coat and the thermally grown oxide degradation process. Two new measurement approaches have been developed and both have provided interesting results with regards to the thermal barrier coating system degradation. The first uses a four point bend test to measure critical strains of the APS top coat. The second uses in-situ acoustic emission analysis to measure the damage accumulation of the thermally grown oxide and top coat. The most recent advance made by this project was the classification of spallation into three cases, namely, case 1 thermal fatigue failure, case 2 thermal ageing failure and case 3 Al depletion failure. Cases 1 and 2 are considered to be, more or less, oxidation induced ''mechanical'' failures, where case 3 {{is considered to be a}} type of ''chemical'' failure. This classification produces a conceptual framework that separates ''mechanical'' and ''chemical'' spallation mechanisms, which can in turn be modeled separately when the appropriate measurement data is available.

40|$|This {{research}} project aims to explore service user {{and mental health}} social workers??? (MHSW) perspectives and experiences of practice {{in the area of}} personality disorder. It seeks to answer three research questions: how service users and MHSWs understand personality disorder, how they understand MHSW practice and how practice in this area might be better informed. The study???s attention to the experiences and perspectives of both groups sets the research within the interpretivist paradigm and relies on a relativist ontology, subjectivist epistemology and inductive, qualitative methodology. The involvement of both groups means that this project makes an original contribution to MHSW research and practice. Constructivist grounded theory (CGT) has been used to generate a conceptual, theoretical analysis. The research was divided into two phases. Phase 1 involved ten semi-structured interviews with ten service users from a community service for people with personality disorder. This data was analysed before Phase 2 began, comprising twelve semi-structured interviews with twelve MHSWs from three regions of England. NVivo 7 was used to analyse the data in and across case. The analysis identified participants??? understanding of personality disorder, mental health social work practice and how this practice might be better informed. The analysis was supplemented by documentary analysis of policies relevant to personality disorder and MHSW. The findings suggest that traumatic experience impacts on the lens through which the person views self and others. Distress can be overwhelming, lead to extreme and unsafe behaviours, which reinforce disconnection from self and others. In supporting a relationship between personality disorder and traumatic experience, this study suggests the relevance of mental health social work (MHSW) to personality disorder. The findings suggest that more humane, empathic responses are required. Practice founded on understanding the impact of traumatic experience {{and the ways in which}} the individual might be trying to cope with their distress. The findings reveal the importance of MHSWs??? relational skills and interventions that offer practical support, encouragement and effective liaison with others. Through more caring, <b>protective</b> <b>bonds</b> and broad social supports MHSW might empower individuals??? response to traumatic experience. The findings raise implications for MHSW and mental health professionals more generally. The findings also indicate that practice would be better informed by greater knowledge and understanding of the person and the diagnosis; the provision of feedback to the person; modelling; greater transparency and consistency; support for the person???s social and family network, and more practical support.

It remains unclear, however, whether these early unions 1) are associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization, 2) interrupt victim continuity or victim–offender overlap through <b>protective</b> and prosocial <b>bonds,</b> or 3) are inconsequential. By using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 11, 928; 18 – 34 years of age), we examine competing hypotheses for the effect of early union timing among victims of youth violence (n = 2, 479) —differentiating across victimization only, perpetration only, and mutually combative relationships and considering variation by gender. The results from multinomial logistic regression models indicate that YVV increases the risk of IPV victimization in first unions, regardless of union timing; the null effect of timing indicates that delaying union formation would not reduce youth victims’ increased risk of continued victimization. Gender-stratified analyses reveal that earlier unions can protect women against IPV perpetration, but this is partly the result of an increased risk of IPV victimization. The findings suggest that YVV has significant transformative consequences, leading to subsequent victimization by coresidential partners, and this association might be exacerbated among female victims who form early unions. We conclude by discussing directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Although {{previous}} research provides a compelling picture of social capital's role in predicting health outcomes, only {{a modicum of}} research has tested the more detailed roles of the dimensions of bonding and bridging social capital, with no research focusing exclusively on bonding and bridging neighborliness or ethnicity.

40|$|A novel PTFE-reinforced self-humidifying {{membrane}} {{based on}} low-cost sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) resin was fabricated. In the membrane a base layer {{and a thin}} <b>protective</b> layer were <b>bonded</b> by porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film. The base layer, which is composed of silicon oxide supported platinum catalyst (abbreviated as Pt-SiO 2) dispersed in SPEEK resin, can suppress reactant crossover and achieve good membrane hydration due to the imbedded hygroscopic Pt-SiO 2 catalysts. The thin protective layer, which constitutes of H 2 O 2 decomposition catalyst Pt-SiO 2 and high H 2 O 2 -tolerant Nafion resin, aims to prevent the SPEEK resin degradation by H 2 O 2 produced at the cathode side by incomplete reduction of oxygen. The porous PTFE film tightly bonds with the SPEEK and the Nation resins to form an integral membrane and accordingly to avoid delamination of the two different resins. The self-humidifying membrane was characterized by TEM, SEM and EDS, etc. The self-humidifying membrane exhibits higher open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0. 98 V and maximum power density value of 0. 8 W cm(- 2) than 0. 94 V, 0. 33 W cm(- 2) of SPEEK/PTFE membrane under dry condition, respectively.

This study draws on 54 qualitative interviews with 35 providers working in eight peripheral health units of Sierra Leone's Bo and Kenema Districts. Data collection started near the height of the outbreak in December 2014 and lasted 1 month. Providers recounted changes in their professional, personal and social lives as they became de facto first responders in the outbreak. A theme articulated across interviews was Ebola’s destruction of social connectedness and sense of trust within and across health facilities, communities and families. Providers described feeling lonely, ostracized, unloved, afraid, saddened and no longer respected. They also discussed restrictions on behaviors that enhance coping including attending burials and engaging in physical touch (hugging, handshaking, sitting near, or eating with colleagues, patients and family members). Providers described infection prevention measures as necessary but divisive because screening booths and <b>protective</b> equipment inhibited <b>bonding</b> or ‘suffering with’ patients.

Preliminary diffusion bonded Cr 2 AlC-superalloy hybrid couples have survived 1000 hr interrupted furnace tests at 800 C with no indication of cracking or debonding. Diffusion zones of -NiAl+Cr 7 C 3 were produced in these above 1000 C, but did not grow to any great extent after 1000 hr at 800 C. Processing as coatings presents challenges, however the basic properties of MAX phases provide novel opportunities for high temperature turbine components...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{presents the}} influence of <b>protective</b> coating on <b>bond</b> strength development of steel with concrete. Pull-out test was conducted in the 1000 kN capacity Universal Testing Machine as per procedure outlined in Indian Standards. The tested rebar includes rusted (uncoated) rebar as available in the site, acid pickled rebar (Rust free rebar) and cement polymer anticorrosive coated rebar obtained from a single source. Concrete of M 25 grade were used and totally 18 specimens were tested. The loads at the free end slip of 0. 025 mm, 0. 25 mm, loaded end slip of 0. 25 mm and ultimate pull out load were observed. The load-versus slip behaviour was studied at the free end and loaded end using precision dial gauges. The bond stress corresponding to the lowest load value of 0. 025 mm FE slip and 0. 25 mm LE slip was considered as the usable bond strength. The test results revealed that a well defined correlation exists between Load at 0. 025 mm Free end slip and 0. 25 mm Loaded end slip. It was found that presence of rust and cement polymer anticorrosive coating in the steel concrete interface appreciably increases the bond strength {{of the order of}} 16 %, 35 % respectively for 16 mm diameter bars as compared to rust free rebar. For 20 mm dia. bars, marginal reduction in bond strength for rusted rebars and significant increase in bond strength for coated bars as compared to uncoated bars were observed. It is concluded that presence of rust influences in reduction / increase in bond strength depending on the nature of rust at the interface in the initial ages. Application of cement polymer coating improves the bond strength of the order of 30 – 35 % due to excellent compatibility at the steel concrete interface, satisfies the codal requirements of Indian Standards...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Concrete cover thinkness of GFRP {{to ensure}} the safety, {{applicability}} and durability of the structure is of great significance. Based on studies to 30 the drawing specimens of concrete,get bond strength of same GFRP diameter,same concrete strength, different concrete cover thinkness. Through the analysis of test data,it is concluded {{the relationship of the}} bond strength and the concrete cover thinkness. And basis on the relationship,it is determine the suggestive values on concrete cover thinkness of GFRP. Experimental data and suggestion can provide reference and theoretical basis for the GFRP engineering application and the establishment of the relevant specification. Preface The concrete cover thinkness {{is one of the main}} reasons for GFRP and concrete bond strength[1]. Code f or design of concrete st ruct ures (GB 50010 — 2010) also puts forward the requirements of the minimum concrete cover thinkness of reinforced concrete structures[2]. GFRP compared with ordinary steel possesses the advantages of light weight, high strength, good corrosion resistance, electromagnetic by good insulation and closing to the temperature coefficient of linear expansion of concrete. In recent years at home and abroad, GFRP and concrete structure has been launched in the field of civil engineering applications[3]. At present, there is no concrete cover thickness requirements and Suggestions of GFRP and concrete structure are put forward at home. The author obtained through experiments the influence of different thickness of <b>protective</b> layer on <b>bond</b> strength, And combined with the relevant specification and the durability of concrete structure, puts forward Suggestions for the minimum concrete cover thinkness.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} post-implant {{infection in the}} medical field has prompted further investigation into possible protective coatings to alleviate this problem. This study explores {{the use of a}} "scaffold" system to carry antimicrobial substances and prevent such infections. Hydroxyapatite (HAP), a calcium phosphate mineral phase, was used as a <b>protective</b> coating to <b>bond</b> with bone and act as a delivery system. Two polymers were also explored as delivery systems. PMMA (polymethyl-methacrylate) is a non-resorbable polymer, while PLGA (poly-lactide-glycolide) is resorbable and was expected to dissolve to release antimicrobials. The two antimicrobial agents were analyzed in the coatings were chlorhexidine and silver nitrate. Chlorhexidine has antimicrobial effects {{on a wide range of}} both gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria, and exhibits low resistance prevalence. Similarly, silver nitrate has been shown to inhibit growth of a wide range of microorganisms. The surfaces of the titanium alloy and stainless steel substrates were coated with combinations of HAP-based systems via the surface induced mineralization (SIM) method, and with the polymers through a dip-coating method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the composition of the coatings and confirm their components. The efficacy of each type of coating in inhibiting microbial growth was tested in culture plates inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of the targeted infections. Metal rods coated with HAPlchlorhexidine and HAP/silver nitrate both showed inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the uncoated rods, HAP-only coated rods, and all polymer coated rods exhibited no antimicrobial effects. A coating containing both HAP and chlorhexidine has the most potential for reduction of infection rates due to its in vitro display of the largest zones of inhibition, and would be the best choice for use in medicine.

40|$|Wire bonding is {{the process}} of {{creating}} interconnects between the circuitry on a microchip and PCB boards or substrates so that the microchip can interact with the outside world. The materials and techniques used in this bonding process can cause a wide variation in bond quality, so wire bond reliability testing is very important in determining the quality and longevity of wire bonds. Due to the fact that microchips are encased in <b>protective</b> resins after <b>bonding</b> and their substrates attached to the larger device as a whole, once any single wire bond fails then it could jeapordize the entire device as the wire bonds cannot be individually replaced or fixed. Current methods of reliability testing are lengthy and often destroy the entire sample in the process of evaluation, so the availability of novel non-destructive, real-time monitoring methods as well as accelerated aging could reduce costs and provide realistically timed tests of novel wire bond materials which do not form Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) as rapidly as Au wire on Al substrates. In this thesis, five new chip designs for use in wire bond reliability testing are reported, focusing on the first joint made in a wire bond, called the ball bond. These chips are scaled either to test up to 55 test bonds simultaneously or just one at a time, introducing different requirements for microchip infrastructure capabilities, such as on-chip sensing/data bus, multiplexer, and switches able to operate under High Temperature Storage (HTS) which ranges from temperatures of 150 - 220 ºC. There are different heating requirements for each of these microchips, needing to be heated externally or containing on-chip microheaters to heat only the ball bond under test, and not the rest of the microchip or surrounding I/O pads. Of the five chip designs, sample chips were produced by an external company. Experimental studies were then carried out with two of these chip designs. They were specifically made to test novel methods of determining ball bond reliability using in-situ, non-destructive sensing, in real-time, while the ball bond undergoes thermal aging. Pad resistance as an analysis tool for ball bond reliability is proposed in this thesis as a new way of evaluating ball bond quality and allows for the testing of electrical connection without the need for specialized measurement probes or difficult bonding processes that contact resistance measurements require. Results are reported for pad resistance measurements of a ball bond under very high temperature storage (VHTS) at 250 ºC, a temperature exceeding typical HTS ranges to accelerate aging. Pad resistance measurements are taken using the four-wire measurement method from each corner of the bond pad, while reversing current direction every measurement to remove thermo-electric effects, and then calculating the average square resistance of the pad from this value. The test ball bond is aged using a novel on-chip microheater which is a N+ doped Si resistive heater located directly underneath the bond pad, and can achieve temperatures up to 300 ºC while not aging any of the I/O pads surrounding it, which are located ~ 180 µm away. A 50 Ω resistor is placed 60 µm away from the heater to monitor the temperature. The use of a microheater allows the aging of novel wire types at temperatures much higher than those permitted for microchip operation while thermally isolating the test bond from the sensing and power bonds, which {{do not need to be}} aged. Higher temperatures allow the aging process to be sped up considerably. The microheater is programmatically cycled between 250 ºC (for 45 min) and 25 ºC (for 15 min) for up to 200 h or until the pad resistance measurements fail due breakdown of the bonding pad. Intermetallic compounds forming between the ball bond and the pad first become visible after a few hours, and then the pad becomes almost completely consumed after a day. The pad resistance is measured every few seconds while the sample is at room temperature, and the increase in pad resistance agrees with the fact that Au/Al IMC products are known to have much higher resistance than both pure Au or Al. Also discussed are some aging results of Au wires and Pd coated Cu (PCC) wires bonded to Al bonding pads and aged at a temperature of 200 ºC in an oven for 670 h. The oven aged Au ball bonds also saw IMC formation on the surface of the bonding pad, much like the microheater tests. The PCC ball bonds became heavily oxidized due to lack of Pd on the surface of the ball, the wire portions did not oxidize much. In conclusion, the new structures have been demonstrated to age ball bonds faster than with conventional methods while obtaining non-destructive data. Specifically, the new microheater ages a test bond at an accelerated rate without having an observable effect on the I/O connections used to monitor the test bond. Pad resistance measurements correlate to the aging of the test bond and ensure the electrical integrity of the joint is checked. 1 yea...|$|R
