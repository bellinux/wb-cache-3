5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different <b>point</b> <b>from</b> the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces.
