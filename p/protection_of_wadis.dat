50|$|The {{centrality}} <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> {{to water}} — and human life — in desert environments {{gave birth to}} the distinct sub-field of wadi hydrology in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Its average {{course is}} forty {{kilometers}} {{even if the}} maximum length of its bed reaches 150 kilometers. It collects its water basin upstream by a series <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> draining the Nara region and Jebel Tazza, all being retained by the dam Sidi Saad, located about 45 kilometers southwest of Kairouan. Downstream of the dam, a series <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> flow into the Wadi Zeroud, flowing to a zone located about ten kilometers south-east of Kairouan where it ceases to be a single wadi and splits into several parts some of which joined the sebkha Kelbia.|$|R

5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and clay loam soils in the beds <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam soils are found in the bowls and beds <b>of</b> <b>wadis,</b> which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|R

30|$|Kuwait is an arid country characterised by long summers with {{extremely}} high temperatures and high humidity, short mild winters with low humidity, and high evaporation rates (Grealish et al. 1998). It has no fresh surface water supplies and very limited renewable groundwater. Rare and high intensity rainstorms are observed and can produce surface water runoff through the network <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> which provide recharge to groundwater aquifers.|$|R
30|$|The {{recorded}} assemblages contain two bicarbonate salts which {{reflect the}} dilution effect of rainwater and draining <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> on the groundwater. The chemical evolution starts with dominant HCO 3 − salts (assemblage 1) which change to dominant SO 42 − salts (assemblage 2) at the end. The dominance of sulphate salts is mainly {{attributed to the}} leaching of the terrestrial salts. This group indicates the meteoric origin of the groundwater.|$|R
25|$|Across the {{peninsula}} as a whole, the plateau slopes {{toward the east}} from an elevation of 1,360 meters {{in the west to}} 750 meters at its easternmost limit. A number <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> cross the region in an eastward direction from the Red Sea escarpment toward the Persian Gulf. There is little pattern to these remains of ancient riverbeds; the most important of them are Wadi Hanifa, Wadi ar Rummah, Wadi as Surr, and Wadi ad-Dawasir.|$|R
25|$|The {{fact that}} so many Gerzean sites are at the mouths <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> which lead to the Red Sea may {{indicate}} some amount of trade via the Red Sea (though Byblian trade potentially could have crossed the Sinai and then taken to the Red Sea). Also, it is considered unlikely that something as complicated as recessed panel architecture could have worked its way into Egypt by proxy, and at least a small contingent of migrants is often suspected.|$|R

Kurli is 33.6 km from its District Main City Oras. It is 307 km from its State Main City Mumbai. This is a culturally and historically important village. Kurli consists <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> like Temb Wadi, Khadakwadi, Bajarpeth. Also it is famous because of the newly made Kurli dam.|$|R
50|$|In the gueltas, {{vegetation}} is {{very diverse}} and hosts many animals. Trees {{may be found}} at lower elevations, while higher areas mostly host bushes. It is possible to find wild olive trees, or Olea lapperrini. Endemic and rare species include the Saharan Cypress (“tarout”) (Cupressus dupreziana) and Saharan Myrtle (Myrtus nivellei), {{both of which are}} relict Saharan-Mediterranean species. Olive and myrtle trees grow at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>wadis,</b> intermittent stream valleys, or beside gueltas and permanent or temporary waterholes.|$|R

Deeper aquifers offer larger quantities of water, but its quality is generally brackish. The wadis are generally dry, usually only inundated after rainfall.Vegetation is typical of the Sahara-Sahel region, and is mainly desert with thorny steppe land. Soil erosion is a problem, as many previously wooded areas have disappeared as the locals use wood for fuel, and inadequate farming practices have sometimes resulted in soil exhaustion.|$|R
500|$|Vulcanodon is {{the only}} named dinosaur from the Vulcanodon beds. Cooper (1984) noted that the habitat was desert-like, as {{indicated}} by aeolian (wind-blown) sands of the Forest Sandstone Formation, which underlies the [...] "Vulcanodon beds". The sediments in which Vulcanodon was found may represent distal alluvial fan deposits which levelled off into a desert landscape, which may have contained lakes during the wet season. The individual may have roamed the shores <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> that cut into the alluvial fan deposits, unless the carcass was transported to the locality it was found by flooding.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the method}} of {{distribution}} of the water, it can then be provided on different methods to the plants. A costly solution (used only on pipes) is drip irrigation. Other methods are the use <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> (basically V-shaped ponds dug in the earth) or by simply planting the trees in holes inside/over the water pipe itself. The tree's roots can then suck the water straight from the water pipe (used in qanāt, hydroponics, ...) A similar technique {{can be done with}} semi-open pipes (i.e. dug throughs in the Keita Project).|$|R
50|$|The human {{population}} of these regions is low, settled agriculture is only viable in valleys {{where there is}} a supply of water, such as dayas, depressions with good quality soil, and the beds <b>of</b> <b>wadis.</b> In these areas it is possible to cultivate fodder and food crops. Such agriculture may not be possible in every year and they farmers shift to follow the rainfall.. Poupulation densities are low and most of the population are somewhat nomadic, however, there are some permanent settlements in coastal towns where the main economic activity is fishing.|$|R
2500|$|This {{southern}} route via Naaur was {{the most}} difficult with a steep grade and the track was narrow, rocky and slippery being only wide enough for horses to move in single file and many camels, their hoofs better suited to sand, frequently slipped and fell. They continued marching through the night along roads marked on maps which were soon discovered to be little more than the beds <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> in which the heavy rain quickly made into muddy streams.

50|$|The UAE {{territory}} separating Ruus al Jibal {{from the}} rest of Oman extends almost as far south as the coastal town of Shinas. A narrow, well-populated coastal plain known as Al Batinah runs from {{the point at which the}} sultanate is reentered to the town of As Sib, about 140 kilometers to the southeast. Across the plains, a number <b>of</b> <b>wadis,</b> heavily populated in their upper courses, descend from the Al Hajar al Gharbi Mountains to the south. A ribbon of oases, watered by wells and underground channels (falaj), extends the length of the plain, about ten kilometers inland.|$|R

Avid trekkers will enjoy the walks through trails over mountains and into canyons, some which have running water all the year round. At {{the village of}} Mazara you will find rocky tracks fording the wadi, crystal clear pools of water ideal for a swim. You can hike 13 km into the canyon clear through the other side. Heading out of Mazara on the track to the coast {{will take you to}} unusual limestone formations and a track that leads to another scenic area <b>of</b> <b>Wadis</b> Arbien and Suwaih. Both <b>of</b> these <b>Wadis</b> have running water with spots ideal for picnicking and swimming. If you enjoy narrow slot canyons with sheer faces and crystalline pools of water, Wadi Shab, Snake Canyon and Wadi Hajir have just what you are looking for. The book [...] "Adventure Trekking in Oman" [...] covers a number of suitable routes. Oman Tourism Portal will soon make some trekking maps available online.|$|R
5000|$|Wadi el Melah( [...] وادي ملاح)is a wadi of Tunisia whose {{course is}} located on the {{territory}} of the governorates of Gafsa and Tozeur. Generally dry, except when it rains, the wadi has its mouth in Chott el-Gharsa. It is almost a river for a series <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> in the area between Gafsa and Tozeur, forming a right-of-way for a distance of 70 kilometers. The decrease in precipitation in the area means that it does not carry water any more, except in the case of rain, usually occurring during the fall and winter.The towns of Lalla, El Ksar and Guettaria are on the river.|$|R

50|$|Dukhan {{is in the}} {{municipality}} of Al Rayyan and is approximately 60 km from Doha. The southeasternmost section of the area lies at 60 m above sea level. Parts of Dukhan's sabkha zone in the north lie below sea level. A sequence of hillocks of Eocene limestone run in parallel throughout the coastal region. The top of the Rus Formation from the Lower Eocene period outcrops more than 25 meters in this area. The eastern portion comprises a lowland covered with rock fragments, consisting <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> and depressions. Wadi Diab {{is one of the}} major dry riverbeds which extend through Dukhan. Common flora in the area used for grazing include zygophyllum qatarense and vachellia tortilis.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Dead Sea is a {{terminal}} lake {{located in the}} seismically active zone of the Syro–African Rift Valley. The water level of the Dead Sea has been receding dramatically during the last decades, resulting in significant entrenchment <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> towards its shores. Exposed sections in fan deltas reveal abruptly changing facies of alluvial fan, beach, and shallow lacustrine environments. Our study focuses on soft sediment deformations of the load–structure type. Though of limited lat-eral extent, their field characteristics concur with the widely accepted criteria that define seismites. This paper demonstrates the potential of load–structures as seismic–chronological benchmarks through radiocarbon dating. We present the first evi-dence of 14 C correlation between two types of seismites in different locations: load structure and mixed layer...|$|R
50|$|Today, the cisterns are {{primarily}} {{a public park}} and a tourist attraction. They have not been filled for at least fifteen years and do not serve the city’s water needs. They may still help with flooding, although the presence of structures in the saila, or flood course, that leads from the Tanks to the sea, impedes the flow of water. No significant restoration work has been conducted on the Tanks since the British colonial era ended in 1967. Time, floods, and visitors have taken their toll on the structures. In addition, construction on the tableland above the Tanks may threaten the entire system <b>of</b> <b>wadis</b> and dams that help channel floodwaters into the Tanks. The future of the Tanks remains uncertain.|$|R
