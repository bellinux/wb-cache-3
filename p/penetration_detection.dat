In case the adversary knows the patrol scheme of the robots and the robots use a deterministic patrol algorithm, then in many cases it is possible to penetrate with probability 1. Therefore this paper considers a non-deterministic patrol scheme for the robots, such that their movement is characterized by a probability p. This allows computing the point with the minimal probability of <b>penetration</b> <b>detection,</b> therefore the strong adversary will choose to penetrate through this point.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} multi-robot patrolling along an open polyline, for example a fence, {{in the presence of}} an adversary trying to penetrate through the fence. In this case, the robots’ task is to maximize the probability of detecting penetrations. Previous work concerning multi-robot patrol in adversarial environments considered closed polygons. That situation is simpler to evaluate due to its symmetric nature. In contrast, if the robots patrol back and forth along a fence, then the frequency of their visits along the line is coherently non-uniform, making it easier to be exploited by an adversary. Moreover, previous work assumed perfect sensorial capabilities of the robots in the sense that if the adversary is in the sensorial range of the robot is will surely be detected. In this paper we address these two challenges. We first suggest a polynomial time algorithm for finding the probability of <b>penetration</b> <b>detection</b> in each point along the fence. We then show that by a small adjustment this algorithm can deal with the more realistic scenario, in which the robots have imperfect sensorial capabilities.

Indeed attackers focus their penetration efforts on breaking into critical modules, and on avoiding detection of the attack. As current security mechanisms are imperfect and existing systems often implement them poorly, {{it is well}} recognized that attacker are in fact able to penetrate. Security tools and procedures may cause the attackers to lose control over a specific module (computer, account), since the attacker would rather lose control than risk detection of the attack. However, while controlling the module, attacker may learn critical secret information or modify the module (plant trapdoors) that make it much easier for the attacker to regain control over that module later, or to defeat the overall security goal (even without regaining control of that module). Recent results in cryptography give some hope of improving this situation. These results show that many fundamental security tasks can be achieved with proactive security.

In this procedure, the surgeon needs to cut and drill some holes in the spine. This operation is very risky because there are some nerves beneath the target bones, and this procedure therefore requires a skilled and experienced surgeon. However, if the cutting tool could detect penetration of the bone autonomously, the safety of the procedure would be improved drastically. This study presents a hand-held bone cutting tool system that detects the penetration of the workpiece. The system learns the cutting states and motion states from demonstrations by a surgeon, and it autonomously detects the penetration of the workpiece and stops the actuation of the cutting tool immediately before total penetration.

40|$|Craniotomy is {{a common}} neurosurgical {{procedure}} in which the skull is opened to allow the surgeon access to the brain. The skull bone is to be cut without damaging underlying delicate tissues. A powered cutting instrument is used to cut the skull bone. In conventional methods, sometimes the safety of underlying tissues is compromised while cutting the skull bone. A new method of controlling the cutting tool penetration is introduced, {{which is based on}} vibrational analysis of the cutting process. Typically, amplitudes of vibrations are very sensitive to small changes in cutting parameters and this makes it difficult to rely on vibrational analysis methods in control systems. Alternatively, a method introduced in this work which relies on existence of a very specific frequency component, called corresponding frequency, in the frequency spectrum. The corresponding frequency is a function of known parameters such as rotational speed and number of the cutting edges of the cutting tool. The existence of this specific frequency component indicates that the tool tip has not penetrated under the skull bone. However, when this frequency component vanishes the control system realizes that the penetration depth of the cutting tool shall be reduced to eliminate the excessive penetration under the skull. The cutting vibrations for different cutting tool designs are measured. The FFT analysis results are studied and utilized for comparing the cutting tools. Based on the results cutting tools are categorized as cutters or vibrators. The design of the best cutter and vibrator tools are combined to design a new type of cutting tool, called hybrid tool.

While current techniques are not capable to visualize single mRNA transcript beyond the diffraction limit. In this thesis, two nonlinear technologies, second harmonic super-resolution microscopy (SHaSM) and transient absorption microscopy (TAM), are developed to detect and quantify single Human edimer receptor 2 (Her 2) mRNA transcripts. The SHaSM is used to detect single mRNA transcript beyond the diffraction limit, while the TAM is employed to detect mRNA without the interference of fluorescence background. The thesis presents the fundamental study on the probes used in SHaSM, the concept and instrumental layout of the two technologies, and the detection as well as quantification of mRNA transcript in cells and tissues by super resolution microscopy and background-free detection microscopy. The first part of my dissertation focuses on the introduction of available mRNA detection methods and nonlinear imaging techniques. In chapter 2, I mainly characterize the SHG emission behavior of individual BTO nanocrystals via time-resolved single molecule spectroscopy, correlation spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy. High-intensity stable emission is collected from individual BTO nanocrystals with a high signal-to-noise ratio; the polar-dependent emission behavior of individual BTO NCs was also investigated theoretically and experimentally; and the dynamics of individual BTO in turbid medium is studied by an improved autocorrelation spectroscopy. The third chapter develops a novel second harmonic super-resolution microscopy (SHaSM), which is capable of detecting individual BTO nanocrystals with the lateral resolution as high as 30 nm. Motivated by the capability of SHaSM to visualize single BTO nanocrystals beyond the diffraction limit, we develop a 2 ̆ 2 dimer 2 ̆ 2 configuration of BTO nanocrystals for detecting single mRNA transcript beyond the diffraction limit. We validate our SHaSM to resolve single mRNA transcript first in vitro. Preformed BTO dimers are detected and differentiated by the SHaSM and by the SEM as the control. Expression level and localization patterns of Her 2 mRNA transcript in single SKBR 3, MCF 7, and HeLa cell are investigated with the SHaSM. SHaSM can successfully differentiate the Her 2 mRNA from the nonspecific BTO monomers, and identify more than one transcript in a diffraction-limited spot for SKBR 3 cells. Quantification results agree well with the theoretical estimation and the RNA FISH results, and in addition {{it shows that the}} SHaSM has more accurate quantification when detecting over-expressed mRNA transcript. Furthermore we applied the SHG probes and SHaSM to study the heterogeneity of Her 2 mRNA transcript in breast cancer tissues. High-specific binding of the SHG probes is observed and high <b>penetration</b> <b>detection</b> can be realized. In addition to the SHaSM, I also develop a background-free method to detect and quantify mRNA transcript. A femto-second transient absorption microscopy (TAM) is developed in the lab. It starts with the theoretical description of the TAM process, and then introduce the fundamental optical properties of the gold nanoparticles in TAM. By chemically treating the gold nanoparticles and conjugating with ODN probes, the gold nanoparticles hybridize to the mRNA molecules and are visualized in the TAM, together with label-free images of cells obtained in the SRS microscopy. mRNA is quantified with single copy sensitivity and is validated by the FISH approach. Super resolution microscopy of Her 2 mRNA transcript in single cells will provide more accurate quantification in single cells; what 2 ̆ 7 s more, it can be potentially employed to investigate the dynamics of single mRNA transcript beyond the diffraction limit, which is extremely significant in basic biology. TAM microscopy promotes the detection of mRNA transcript at a high speed without fluorescence background, which can be further utilized to investigate the dynamics of RNA regulation. Both these two methods will promote our understandings of the expression level and localization patterns of mRNA transcript in single cells, provide a route to employ mRNA transcript as a marker or indicator for cancer diagnosis and therapy...|$|E

It differs from traditional fluorescence microscopy, in which the excitation wavelength is shorter than the emission wavelength, as the wavelengths of the two exciting photons are longer than the wavelength of the resulting emitted light. Two-photon excitation microscopy typically uses near-infrared excitation light which can also excite fluorescent dyes. However, for each excitation, two photons of infrared light are absorbed. Using infrared light minimizes scattering in the tissue. Due to the multiphoton absorption, the background signal is strongly suppressed.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose {{algorithms}} for solving a variety of geometric optimization problems on a stream of points in � 2 or � 3. These problems include various extent measures (e. g. diameter, width, smallest enclosing disk), collision <b>detection</b> (<b>penetration</b> depth and distance between polytopes), and shape fitting (minimum width annulus, circle/line fitting). The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a unified approach to solving all of the above problems efficiently using modern graphics hardware. All the above problems can be approximated using a constant number of passes over the data stream. Our algorithms are easily implemented, and our empirical study demonstrates that the running times of our programs are comparable to the best implementations for the above problems. Another significant property of our results is that although the best known implementations for the above problems are quite different from each other, our algorithms all draw upon the same set of tools, making their implementation significantly easier. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Tropical {{cyclones}} (TC) are {{the most}} damaging natural hazards for coastal residents because of the associated casualties and property losses. The difficulties of recognizing and locating the eyes of TCs in previous research are because of cloud obstructions in optical images, especially during the formation stage of a TC. The distinct advantage of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) lies in its capability of cloud <b>penetration</b> and hence <b>detection</b> of signal response from sea surface backscatters, {{which can be used}} for better detection the eyes of TCs. The aim of this project is to pinpoint the track of a TC by studying the characteristic pattern of its eye, in order to predict its behavior by applying remotely sensed MODIS and ASAR data. This paper uses morphological operators to analyze and extract the region covered by the eye of a TC for the purpose of determining the relative centre of a TC’s eye, and then derive the most probable path.
