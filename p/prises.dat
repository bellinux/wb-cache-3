5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of <b>prises,</b> excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
5|$|The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great {{financial}} {{demand on}} Edward's subjects. Whereas the King had only levied three lay subsidies until 1294, four such taxes were granted {{in the years}} 1294–97, raising over £200,000. Along with this came the burden of <b>prises</b> (appropriation of food), seizure of wool and hides, and the unpopular additional duty on wool, dubbed the maltolt. The fiscal demands on the King's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition. The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the King responded by threatening with outlawry, and the grant was eventually made. At the time, the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant, since Robert Winchelsey was in Italy to receive consecration. Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year. In 1296, however, his position changed when he received the papal bull Clericis laicos. This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to lay authorities without explicit consent from the Pope. When the clergy, {{with reference to the}} bull, refused to pay, Edward responded with outlawry. Winchelsey was presented with a dilemma between loyalty to the King and upholding the papal bull, and he responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit. By the end of the year, a solution was offered by the new papal bull Etsi de statu, which allowed clerical taxation in cases of pressing urgency.|$|E

500|$|The {{document}} {{containing the}} Ordinances is dated 5 October, and contains forty-one articles. In the preamble, the Ordainers voiced their concern {{over what they}} perceived as the evil councilors of the king, the precariousness of the military situation abroad, and the danger of rebellion at home over the oppressive <b>prises.</b> The articles {{can be divided into}} different groups, the largest of which deals with limitations on the powers of the king and his officials, and the [...] substitution of these powers with baronial control. It was ordained that the king should appoint his officers only [...] "by the counsel and assent of the baronage, and that in parliament." [...] Furthermore, the king could no longer go to war without the consent of the baronage, nor could he make reforms of the coinage. Additionally, it was decided that parliament should be held at least once a year. Parallel to these decisions were reforms of the royal finances. The Ordinances banned what was seen as extortionate <b>prises</b> and customs, {{and at the same time}} declared that revenues were to be paid directly into the exchequer. This was a reaction to the rising trend of receiving revenues directly into the royal household; making all royal finances accountable to the exchequer allowed greater public scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|When Edward II succeeded {{his father}} Edward I on 7 July 1307, the {{attitude}} of his subjects was generally one of goodwill toward their new king. However, discontent was brewing beneath the surface. Some of {{this was due to}} existing problems left behind by the late king, while much was due to the new king's inadequacies. The problems were threefold. First there was discontent with the royal [...] policy for financing wars. To finance the war in Scotland, Edward I had increasingly resorted to so-called <b>prises</b> [...] or purveyance [...] to provision the troops with victuals. Though a perfectly legitimate method of raising money, the peers felt that the purveyance had become far too burdensome and compensation was in many cases inadequate or missing entirely. In addition, they did not like the fact that Edward II took <b>prises</b> for his household without continuing the war effort against Scotland, causing the second problem. While Edward I had spent the last decade of his reign relentlessly campaigning against the Scots, his son abandoned the war almost entirely. In this situation, the Scottish king Robert Bruce soon took the opportunity to regain what had been lost. This not only exposed the north of England to Scottish attacks, but also jeopardized the possessions of the English baronage in Scotland.|$|E
500|$|Following his return, Gaveston's {{relationship}} with the major barons became increasingly difficult. He was considered arrogant, and he took to referring to the earls by offensive names, including calling one of their more powerful members the [...] "dog of Warwick". The Earl of Lancaster and Gaveston's enemies refused to attend parliament in 1310 because Gaveston would be present. Edward was facing increasing financial problems, owing £22,000 to his Frescobaldi Italian bankers, and facing protests {{about how he was}} using his right of <b>prises</b> to acquire supplies for the war in Scotland. His attempts to raise an army for Scotland collapsed and the earls suspended the collection of the new taxes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Identification of the {{residues}} in protein-protein interaction sites has {{a significant}} impact in problems such as drug discovery. Motivated by the observation that the set of interface residues of a protein tend to be conserved even among remote structural homologs, we introduce <b>PrISE,</b> a family of local structural similarity-based computational methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. Results We present a novel representation of the surface residues of a protein {{in the form of}} structural elements. Each structural element consists of a central residue and its surface neighbors. The <b>PrISE</b> family of interface prediction methods uses a representation of structural elements that captures the atomic composition and accessible surface area of the residues that make up each structural element. Each {{of the members of the}} <b>PrISE</b> methods identifies for each structural element in the query protein, a collection of similar structural elements in its repository of structural elements and weights them according to their similarity with the structural element of the query protein. <b>PrISE</b> L relies on the similarity between structural elements (i. e. local structural similarity). <b>PrISE</b> G relies on the similarity between protein surfaces (i. e. general structural similarity). <b>PrISE</b> C, combines local structural similarity and general structural similarity to predict interface residues. These predictors label the central residue of a structural element in a query protein as an interface residue if a weighted majority of the structural elements that are similar to it are interface residues, and as a non-interface residue otherwise. The results of our experiments using three representative benchmark datasets show that the <b>PrISE</b> C outperforms <b>PrISE</b> L and <b>PrISE</b> G; and that <b>PrISE</b> C is highly competitive with state-of-the-art structure-based methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. Our comparison of <b>PrISE</b> C with PredUs, a recently developed method for predicting interface residues of a query protein based on the known interface residues of its (global) structural homologs, shows that performance superior or comparable to that of PredUs can be obtained using only local surface structural similarity. <b>PrISE</b> C is available as a Web server at [URL] Conclusions Local surface structural similarity based methods offer a simple, efficient, and effective approach to predict protein-protein interface residues. </p...|$|R
