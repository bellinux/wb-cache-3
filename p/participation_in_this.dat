5|$|Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, KG (c.1530 – 21February 1590) was an English nobleman and general, and {{an elder}} brother of Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Their father was John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, {{who led the}} English {{government}} from 15501553 under Edward VI and unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King's death in July 1553. For his <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> venture Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London and condemned to death. Reprieved, his rehabilitation came after he fought for Philip II of Spain (then England's co-monarch) in the Battle of St. Quentin.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his {{followers}} of <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and other crimes, including an aborted plan in 1985 to assassinate a United States Attorney, and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E

While {{aboard a}} steamship in 1844, he was stabbed {{by a man}} who was later found to be insane. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe on a secret mission to report on British and French intents with regard to annexing Texas and to assess the feasibility of the United States undertaking such an action. Wickliffe's <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> endeavor further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E

5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to the end}} of the war on 15 August 1945, the Australian {{military}} was preparing to contribute forces to the invasion of Japan. Australia's <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> operation would have involved elements of all three services fighting as part of Commonwealth forces. It was planned to form a new 10thDivision from existing AIF personnel which would form part of the Commonwealth Corps with British, Canadian and New Zealand units. The corps' organisation was to be identical to that of a US Army corps, and it would have participated in the invasion of the Japanese home island of Honshū which was scheduled for March1946 under Operation Coronet. Planning for operations against Japan ceased in August1945 when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japanese field commanders subsequently surrendered to Allied forces across the Pacific Theatre and Australian forces accepted the surrender of their Japanese opponents at ceremonies conducted at Morotai, several locations in Borneo, Timor, Wewak, Rabaul, Bougainville and Nauru. Following the surrender the Australian Army faced a number of immediate operational and administrative issues, including the need to maintain security in the areas it occupied, the disarming and administration of surrendered Japanese forces in these areas, organising the return of approximately 177,000 soldiers (including prisoners of war) to Australia, the demobilisation and discharge of the bulk of the soldiers serving in the Army, and the raising of an occupation force for service in Japan.|$|E

MUF received victory in only 4 of the contested 43 electoral constituencies despite its high vote share of 31 per cent (this means that its official vote in the Valley was larger than one-third). The elections were widespreadly believed to have been rigged by the ruling party National Conference, allied with the Indian National Congress. In the absence of rigging, commentators believe that the MUF could have won fifteen to twenty seats, a contention admitted by the National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah. Scholar Sumantra Bose, on the other hand. opines that the MUF would have won most of the constituencies in the Kashmir Valley.|$|E

It's All Up to You features vocals by Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore, although Kyser's <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> recording is disputed, record label showing Axel Stordahl as conductor. Kyser {{had intended to}} retire {{following the end of}} the war, but performance and recording contracts kept him in show business for another half decade. During this time, Kyser made a cameo appearance in a Batman comic book. Kyser was first to introduce the new sonic audio process called the 'sonovox', a singing electronic voice triggered by music. The Sonovox would be used by Jingle Companies such as PAMS and JAM Creative Productions, and said jingles would be used in heavy rotation by rock radio stations such as WABC, WMEX, WXYZ, KONO, WKDA, and WHTZ.|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, an {{increasing}} call {{has risen from}} civil society groups demanding <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> peace negotiations. <b>This</b> call {{is supported by the}} non-state sector by means of a prescriptive policy discourse, which assumes that participation of civil society is inherently beneficial for peace negotiations. This assumption is challenged by scholars who argue that too {{little is known about the}} interaction between civil society groups and core parties at the negotiation table. In addition, they point at the lack of reliable evidence that supports the claimed positive impact of civil <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> negotiations. <b>This</b> thesis examines the participation and claimed influence of women's peace organisations in the negotiations between the Colombian government and armed actors from 1999 to 2006...|$|R

25|$|On March 3, 1789 Richard Bland Lee began {{service as}} the first {{representative}} of Northern Virginia in the United States House of Representatives. He served three terms as a Pro-Administration (federalist) member of congress from 1789 to 1795. He was {{a party to the}} Compromise of 1790 by which in exchange for support of southern delegates for federal assumption of state Revolutionary War debt, northern delegates voted to move the Federal City to a location in the south. His <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> compromise, as well as his adherence to federalist principles proved to be his downfall. He narrowly fended off a challenge from his more famous relative Arthur Lee in 1792, and finally lost his seat to Richard Brent in the election of 1794. Following this defeat, Richard was returned to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1795, and again from 1799 to 1806.|$|E
25|$|During the {{following}} years, the dichotomy {{between the government}} of Luis Muñoz Marín and the Nationalist Party was widened over the Commonwealth that was being negotiated in Congress. On October 30, 1950, these differences materialized in the Jayuya Uprising. The 295th Infantry Regiment was mobilized {{from the beginning of}} the insurrection until November 6, 1950. In the crossfire that took place at Utuado, Corporal José Rodríguez Alicea of H Unit in Arecibo was killed. The 296th's First Battalion was mobilized under Lt. Col. Rafael Sepúlveda, was moved to forts Brooke and Buchanan. This revolution was quelled after the Puerto Rico Air National Guard bombed the municipalities of Jayuya and Utuado, the first and so far only time that the United States military has bombed a locale under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Following the crossfire, the PRNG confiscated a flag of Puerto Rico that had been placed before the Jayuya Police Headquarters. For its <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> conflict, the entity received letters of gratification from the Police of Puerto Rico and other organizations affiliated to the government such as the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority. In turn, Esteves commended a number of officers for their coordination.|$|E
25|$|In this capacity, Harith {{fought on}} behalf of the Byzantines in all their {{numerous}} wars against Persia. Already in 528 {{he was one of the}} commanders sent in a punitive expedition against Mundhir. In 529, he helped suppress the wide-scale Samaritan revolt, capturing 20,000 boys and girls whom he sold as slaves. It was perhaps Harith's successful <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> conflict that led Justinian to promote him to supreme phylarch. It is possible that he took part with his men in the Byzantine victory at Daras in 530, although no source explicitly mentions him. In 531, he led a 5,000-strong Arab contingent in the Battle of Callinicum. Procopius, a source hostile to the Ghassanid ruler, states that the Arabs, stationed on the Byzantine right, betrayed the Byzantines and fled, costing them the battle. John Malalas, however, whose record is generally more reliable, reports that while some Arabs indeed fled, Harith stood firm. The charge of treason levelled by Procopius against Harith seems to be further undermined by the fact that, unlike Belisarius, he was retained in command and was active in operations around Martyropolis later in the year.|$|E
