40|$|Rhododendrons (Rhododendron ssp.) {{are among}} the most popular {{flowering}} shrubs grown in landscapes in the temperate zone. Despite this popularity, rhododendrons do not tolerate soils with a pH of greater than 6. 5 because in such soils they are unable to obtain iron for use in chlorophyll production. This makes rhododendrons especially difficult to grow in the neutral to high pH soils of the Midwest. My experiment tested recently released, reportedly elevated pH tolerant German rhododendron cultivars in the ‘Inkarho’ series for high pH tolerance. <b>Preliminary</b> assays of <b>leaf</b> chlorophyll levels and overall growth in elevated as compared to low pH soils support the hypothesis that the ‘Inkarho’ cultivars are resistant to elevated pH soils.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{we present a}} system for {{incremental}} induction of decision trees capable to detect and react {{in the presence of}} concept drift. The method of detection of concept change is based on two pessimistic error estimates for each node. The error estimate in this node and the sum of the error estimates in all the descending leaves of the node. If the first error estimate is less than the second one, then concept change is detected. To adapt the decision model to the new concept, a new method had been developed: SR (Sequencial Regularization). When the method detects a new concept in a node, the distributions of each node, in the sub-tree, are updated by adding the distribution of all the descending leaves of the node. If a change concept is again detected, in one of the nodes in that sub-tree, then this node is transformed in a <b>leaf.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> results in real and artificial data sets show good results of the system in detecting and answering the concept changes. ...|$|R

40|$|Plants of Senna occidentalis (sin. Cassia occidentalis) with mosaic {{symptoms}} were collected near a soybean (Glycine max) field where some plants exhibited symptoms of mosaic and blistering. A <b>preliminary</b> examination of <b>leaf</b> tissue from diseased S. occidentalis by electron microscopy revealed {{the presence of}} pinwheel inclusions as well as long flexuous particles, indicating {{the presence of a}} potyvirus. Host range, serology, and amino acid sequence from this potyvirus were similar to those from other Brazilian isolates of Soybean mosaic virus (SMV). The 3 '- terminal region of the genomic RNA was cloned and a cDNA sequence of 1. 9 kb upstream of the poly (A) tract was determined. The sequence contains a single open reading frame and a 3 '- non-translated region (NTR) of 259 bp. The nucleotide sequence of the CP gene of SMV-Soc was 98 % identical to that of Brazilian isolates SMV-B, SMV-L, and SMV-FT 10. The percentage of nucleotide identity of their 3 '-NTR's was 91, 98, and 99 % in relation to SMV-L, SMV-B, and SMV-FT 10, respectively. In contrast to other Brazilian SMV isolates studied, SMV-Soc was able to infect sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Based on these results, the S. occidentalis isolate was identified as a new strain of SMV belonging to the SMV strain, group G 5 and was named SMV-Soc. This is the first report of naturaly occurring SMV infecting plants of S. occidentalis in Brazil, adding this weed as a new source of SMV in the field...|$|R
40|$|Carbon-isotope {{analyses}} of fossil wood from the Middle Jurassic Ravenscar Group, Yorkshire, NE England, reveal a significant excursion toward light isotopic values (δ 13 C change of - 3 to - 4 ‰) {{at about the}} Aalenian-Bajocian boundary (∼ 174 Ma). A positive carbon isotopic excursion is also shown for the middle Bajocian (∼ 170 Ma) but is less clearly defined. These isotopic patterns {{are very similar to}} the few published marine carbonate records available for this time, in particular one based on belemnites from the Hebrides basin, NW Scotland, and others from pelagic limestones in Italy. The similarity of the terrestrial and marine isotope curves is an indication that the observed isotopic signal is a global phenomenon. Through parts of the Ravenscar Group (the Scarborough Formation), supplementary data from bulk organic carbon and palynofacies analysis confirm that isotopic curves based on bulk analyses may be strongly influenced by the balance of terrestrial versus marine organic matter present in the samples. The negative isotope excursion at the Aalenian-Bajocian boundary marks a change from charcoal to coal as the dominant preservational mode of the macroscopic wood fossils, which is interpreted here as a shift to a more continuously humid climate in the Early Bajocian. Upsection, charcoal once again becomes common, reflecting a return to more fireprone (presumably seasonally arid) environments in the middle Bajocian. Paradoxically, floral assemblages associated with the lithological unit in which the negative excursion occurs display characteristics that would normally be interpreted as adaptations to water stress brought about by relative aridity or salinity. <b>Preliminary</b> {{analyses of}} <b>leaf</b> stomatal densities show some evidence of raised pCO 2 relative to background values at about the level of the negative excursion...|$|R

We aimed to link anatomical traits with the underlying genetic map of F 2 Family 331, composed of 350 markers across 19 linkage groups. Leaf stomatal and epidermal cell traits showed pronounced differences between the original parents. We considered the following traits in the F 2 population: stomatal density (SD), stomatal index (SI), epidermal cell area (ECA) {{and the number of}} epidermal cells per leaf (ECN). In [eCO 2], adaxial SD and SI were reduced in the F 2 population, whereas ECA increased and ECN remained unchanged. In [aCO 2], four putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) with logarithm of the odds ratio (LOD) scores greater than 2. 9 were found for stomatal traits on linkage group B: adaxial SI (LOD scores of 5. 4 and 5. 2); abaxial SI (LOD score of 3. 3); and SD (LOD score of 3. 2). These results imply that QTL for SI and SD share linkage group B and are under genetic control. More moderate LOD scores (LOD scores >/= 2. 5) suggest QTL for SI on linkage groups A and B and for SD on linkage groups B, D and X with a probable co-locating quantitative trait locus for SI and SD on linkage group D (position 46. 3 cM).

30|$|Clinical changes {{recognizable}} as photoaging include wrinkle, inelasticity, telangiectasia and pigmentary change. Although not detrimental in nature, hyperpigmentation {{can be a}} big cosmetic concern, especially among Asian. The inhibition of melanogenesis is a critical target for skin-whitening cosmetic and treatment of abnormal pigmentation (Yokozawa and Kim [2007]). Since tyrosinase is a rate-limiting enzyme of melanogenesis, inhibition on its action is one major strategy to treat hyperpigmentation. The anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activity of natural substances have been studied extensively. Fruit extracts of bitter melon have been shown to exert significant inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase (Kamkaen et al. [2007]; Masuda et al. [2007]; Baurin et al. [2002]). Kamkaen et al. ([2007]) reported that methanolic extract of bitter melon fruit can exert a significant mushroom tyrosinase inhibition (78.9 % compared to positive control of kojic acid). Masuda et al. ([2007]) reported that ethanol extract of bitter melon fruit can show 21.7 % of mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity at a concentration of 0.5  mg/mL. Similar finding was reported in previous study that used propylene glycol/deionized water extract of bitter melon plants with 32 % inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase (Baurin et al. [2002]). In our <b>preliminary</b> study, WBM <b>leaf</b> extracts exhibited suppressive effect on mushroom tyrosinase activity at a concentration of 5  mg/mL. It is not yet known whether WBM leaf extract has anti-melanogenic activity in cellular assay. In the experiments reported here, HL- 1 showed more potent anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activities than others. Regarding the inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity, HL- 1 extract was similar to kojic acid at each tested concentration (Figure  4). Kojic acid shows its anti-tyrosinase activity by chelating the copper ion in the active site of tyrosinase (Kahn [1995]). However, the inhibitory mechanism or effective constituents of WBM leaf extract is still unclear. Kim et al. ([2008]), Yokozawa and Kim ([2007]), and Kim ([2007]) reported that the antimelanogenic action of some agents is related to their antioxidant activity. Concerning the action mechanism of anti-tyrosinase agents, blocking of oxidative pathway (Kim [2007]) and binding of enzyme activity sites (Curto et al. [1999]) may be involved in inhibiting the catalytic reaction of tyrosinase. Previous studies demonstrated that gallate and its derivatives (Kim [2007]; Tanford [1980]) and p-alkoxybenzoic acid derivatives (Chen et al. [2005]) can act as tyrosinase inhibitors. The bulky hydrophobic portions of gallate derivatives were considered to interact with tyrosinase’s hydrophobic protein bulk surrounding the binuclear copper active site and thus gallate derivatives exerted the anti-tyrosinase effect (Tanford [1980]). Since gallic acid was found in WBM leaf extracts, it speculated that gallic acid may contribute, at least partially, to anti-melanogenic activity of WBM leaf extracts. Other unknown active constituents present in WBM leaf extract could also play critical roles in the biological effects. The identification of these functional or bioactive ingredients in WBM leaf extract is an interesting topic for future study.|$|R

40|$|This {{final report}} {{provides}} technical {{information on the}} development of a near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) system for the analysis of alfalfa hay. The purpose of the system is to provide consistent quality for processing alfalfa stems for fuel and alfalfa leaf meal products for livestock feed. Project tasks were to: (1) develop an NIRS driven analytical system for analysis of alfalfa hay and processed alfalfa products; (2) assist in hiring a qualified NIRS technician and recommend changes in testing equipment necessary to provide accurate analysis; (3) calibrate the NIRS instrument for accurate analyses; and (4) develop prototype equipment and sampling procedures as a first step towards development of a totally automated sampling system that would rapidly sample and record incoming feedstock and outbound product. An accurate hay testing program was developed, along with calibration equations for analyzing alfalfa hay and sun-cured alfalfa pellets.
