5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the {{effectiveness}} {{shown by the}} Royal Navy during the bombardment, there were no further rebellions against British influence during the remaining 67 years of the protectorate.|$|E
5|$|The area to {{the east}} of the city drops away rapidly and lacks {{extensive}} settlement remains, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> periodic flooding by the Mopan and Salsipuedes rivers discouraging the occupation of the eastern zone.|$|E
5|$|Another {{unsuccessful}} {{assassination attempt}} {{took place on}} 25 October, when Lugovoy and Kovtun flew to London again. They left radioactive traces again in their hotel prior to meeting Litvinenko, but did not administer the poison, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> security cameras in the meeting room. They again disposed of the poison via their room's toilet, and left London.|$|E

50|$|Subsequent albums, such as Snakes and Ladders (1980), Sleepwalking (1982), and North and South (1988), fared less well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> partly <b>to</b> Rafferty's longstanding {{reluctance}} to perform live, which he felt uncomfortable with.|$|R
5|$|Monte Testaccio's {{use as an}} amphora dump {{seems to}} have ceased after about the 260s, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the city's quays being moved elsewhere. A new type of amphora was also {{introduced}} around this time to transport olive oil.|$|E
5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to)</b> its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} {{actively}} discussed for around half a year, {{but in the}} end never left the planning stages and finally died, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the unprecedented growth of the World Wide Web.|$|R
5000|$|Later derided as a {{facsimile}} of the bland, cookie-cutter [...] "multi-purpose stadia" [...] {{built in}} multiple {{locations of the}} United States in the 1960s, Busch Memorial achieved a measure of popularity among St. Louis fans {{in a way that}} its cousins in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati did not, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> in part <b>to</b> the success of the teams which played there, and <b>perhaps</b> also <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the distinctive roof arches added by architect Edward Durrell Stone — unique touches meant to echo the city's new iconic monument (completed at nearly the same time), the Gateway Arch.|$|R
60|$|The {{change in}} {{his point of view}} (if change there was) {{certainly}} was complete soon after his return from France, and was <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> in part <b>to</b> the influence of Burke.|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth Randles, {{also known}} as Bessy, was born on 1 August 1800 in Wrexham, north Wales. Her father, Edward Randles, the organist at the Holywell parish church of St. James, lost his sight {{at the age of}} three as a result of small pox. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his lack of sight, his parents placed him to be trained under the blind harpist John Parry, whom he excelled under. Randles was the {{youngest}} of Randles' several children including her brother Edward, who would become a subsequent organist at the parish church.|$|E
5|$|Regular races were {{organised}} until 1903, {{when two}} events were held; {{these were the}} last for 24years, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the closure of the}} summit observatory the following year. The first was from Achintee, {{at the foot of the}} Pony Track, and finished at the summit; It was won in just over an hour by Ewen MacKenzie, the observatory roadman. The second race ran from new Fort William post office, and MacKenzie lowered the record to 2hours 10minutes, a record he held for 34years.|$|E
5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.|$|E
50|$|By {{the sixteenth}} century, {{the quality of}} English wools was in decline, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a switch in focus to meat {{production}} for domestic urban markets, and European supremacy {{in the production of}} fine-wool passed to the Iberian peninsula and its merino sheep.|$|R
50|$|Comparatively {{little is}} known about Wilding, while Rossetti's other models, Siddall, Morris and Cornforth, are {{frequently}} written about. This is <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the lack of any romantic or sexual connection between the pair, which differentiates Rossetti's relationship with Wilding from those with his other muses.|$|R
50|$|The langeleik {{has had a}} renaissance, {{and while}} there are players in most part of Norway, there are not so many places -at least not well known- where the {{instrument}} is being played officially. This is <b>perhaps</b> mostly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{that it is a}} solo instrument.|$|R
5|$|The {{coronation}} of Æthelstan {{took place}} on 4 September 925 at Kingston upon Thames, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its symbolic location {{on the border between}} Wessex and Mercia. He was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Athelm, who probably designed or organised a new ordo (religious order of service) in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet. The new ordo was influenced by West Frankish liturgy and in turn became one of the sources of the medieval French ordo.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate {{for people who}} reach a hospital alive was estimated at 30% in 1966; more recent estimates place this number at 9%. The number of people reaching a hospital alive has increased, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> improved prehospital care or specialized treatment centers. Of those who reach the hospital alive but then die, most do so within the first two hours of arrival. The sooner a TBI is diagnosed, the higher the {{mortality rate}}; this is likely due to other accompanying injuries that prove fatal.|$|E
5|$|The stone {{bears no}} idiomatic Pictish symbols and, under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's {{classification}} system, it is a class III stone. Intact freestanding crosses {{of this age}} are comparatively rare, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their vulnerability to damage, and {{the only ones in}} Eastern Scotland are the Camus Cross and the Dupplin Cross in Strathearn. Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at Forteviot, St Vigeans and Strathmartine and shaft fragments found at Monifieth, Abernethy, Carpow and Invermay, as well as some socketed stones where crosses once stood.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{however, the}} {{contrabass}} saxophone {{has experienced a}} resurgence in interest. Although still quite rare, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its great expense, three manufacturers now produce contrabass saxophones: Benedikt Eppelsheim of Munich, Germany Romeo Orsi Wind Instruments of Milan, and J’Elle Stainer of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Kermode {{refers to}} the play as [...] "a poor {{relation}} of the major tragedies." [...] This is the majority view, but the play has many scholarly defenders as well. Nevertheless, and <b>perhaps</b> unsurprisingly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its subject matter, it has not proven to be among Shakespeare's popular works.|$|R
50|$|Playing to {{a smaller}} crowd than {{expected}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> lower ticket sales <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> in part <b>to</b> Snow Patrol performing two last minute shows in Manchester three weeks prior to the event and withholding {{permission to use the}} band's name for promotional purposes, until their own shows had been completed.|$|R
5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures {{were employed in}} the battlefield after the late 13th century, {{perhaps because of the}} prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many of {{the other}} British Orders, the stall plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a {{continuous}} record of the Knights of the Order. There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871, (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940), and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In the case of the stall plates this was <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their size, 30x36 cm (12x14 in).|$|E
5|$|Wright is {{currently}} rated {{as one of}} the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive realism in his portraiture. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the unusually cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign artists were usually preferred. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today.|$|E
50|$|Despite - {{or perhaps}} because of - the poor effects and editing, and all-round unprofessional feel, it became very popular with fans, <b>perhaps</b> also <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the {{carefree}} nature and fooling around of the band onscreen that {{can be attributed to the}} large amount of alcohol they consumed while filming.|$|R
5000|$|He did {{not stand}} for {{re-election}} in Boston in 1698, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> tensions with his father, who remained a Tory. However, after his father's death, he returned to Parliament in the December 1701 election {{with the support of}} his brother, now Earl of Lindsey. (Lindsey remained a Tory, however.) ...|$|R
25|$|Jacobo Arenas died on August 10, 1990, {{possibly}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> cancer, but <b>perhaps</b> also <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{diabetes or}} an ulcer, or even assassinated by a vindictive comrade (according to different versions). His death {{was considered a}} major blow to the FARC, as {{he was one of}} the persons responsible for transforming the FARC from a small guerilla force to a belligerent rebel army.|$|R
5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, {{in which one}} source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, to support a pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the population's association of him with his brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E
5|$|Gregory faced {{opposition}} to his reign in Nyssa, and, in 373 Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium had {{to visit the}} city to quell discontent. In 375 Desmothenes of Pontus convened a synod at Ancyra to try Gregory on charges of embezzlement of church funds and irregular ordination of bishops. He was arrested by imperial troops {{in the winter of}} the same year, but escaped to an unknown location. The synod of Nyssa, which was convened in the spring of 376, deposed him. However, Gregory regained his see in 378, <b>perhaps</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an amnesty promulgated by the new emperor Gratian. In the same year Basil died, and despite the relative unimportance of Nyssa, Gregory took over many of his brother's former responsibilities in Pontus.|$|E
50|$|He {{was asked}} by both the Royal and Russian Geographical Societies to mount another {{expedition}} to the Middle East, but declined, <b>perhaps</b> in part <b>due</b> <b>to</b> failing health.|$|R
50|$|She {{was criticized}} by some for copying too closely the exact style of Peggy Fleming, <b>perhaps</b> in part <b>due</b> <b>to</b> being coached {{by the same}} person- Carlo Fassi.|$|R
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the island is the former Augustinian Inchcolm Abbey (Historic Scotland), Scotland's most {{complete}} surviving monastic house. In former times, and <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its dedication to Columba, it was sometimes nicknamed 'Iona of the East'. The well-preserved abbey and ruins of the 9th-century hermit's cells attract visitors to the island.|$|R
