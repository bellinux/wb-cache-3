5|$|Though {{similar in}} their {{formation}} <b>process,</b> <b>oil</b> shales differ from coals in several distinct ways. The precursors {{of the organic}} matter in oil shale and coal differ {{in a sense that}} oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants that more commonly compose much of the organic matter in coal. The origin of some of the organic matter in oil shale is obscure {{because of the lack of}} recognizable biologic structures that would help identify the precursor organisms. Such materials may be of bacterial origin or the product of bacterial degradation of algae or other organic matter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bullwhip {{effect is}} a serious problem in supply chain management, it brings about {{production}} disorder, inventory imbalance, business process obstruction, waste of resources and market chaos. Our <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> supply chain is so a large complicated system that bullwhip effect of it is more serious. To deal this problem, this paper discussed China <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> supply chain, aim at maintaining <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> supply, analysed the strength of bullwhip effect in the chain, proved delay is the basic reason of bullwhip effect and pointed out reducing delay is the key point to weaken bullwhip effect. We used system dynamics analysis and Anylogic simulation software to get the conclusion. Finally, we put forward some effective strategies to deal with bullwhip effect in China <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> supply chain for improving the chain's operating efficiency...|$|R

500|$|By raw {{oil shale}} {{particle}} size: The various ex situ processing technologies may be differentiated {{by the size}} of the oil shale particles that are fed into the retorts. As a rule, gas heat carrier technologies <b>process</b> <b>oil</b> shale lumps varying in diameter from , while solid heat carrier and wall conduction technologies process fines which are particles less than [...] in diameter.|$|E
500|$|Internal {{combustion}} technologies burn materials (typically char and {{oil shale}} gas) within a vertical shaft retort to supply heat for pyrolysis. [...] Typically raw oil shale particles between [...] and [...] in size are {{fed into the}} top of the retort and are heated by the rising hot gases, which pass through the descending oil shale, thereby causing decomposition of the kerogen at about [...] Shale oil mist, evolved gases and cooled combustion gases are removed {{from the top of the}} retort then moved to separation equipment. Condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gas is recycled and used to carry heat up the retort. In the lower part of the retort, air is injected for the combustion which heats the spent oil shale and gases to between [...] and [...] Cold recycled gas may enter the bottom of the retort to cool the shale ash. The Union A and Superior Direct processes depart from this pattern. In the Union A <b>process,</b> <b>oil</b> shale is fed through the bottom of the retort and a pump moves it upward. [...] In the Superior Direct <b>process,</b> <b>oil</b> shale is processed in a horizontal, segmented, doughnut-shaped traveling-grate retort.|$|E
500|$|The {{oldest and}} the most common {{extraction}} method involves pyrolysis (also known as retorting or destructive distillation). [...] In this <b>process,</b> <b>oil</b> shale is heated {{in the absence of}} oxygen until its kerogen decomposes into condensable shale oil vapors and non-condensable combustible oil shale gas. [...] Oil vapors and oil shale gas are then collected and cooled, causing the shale oil to condense. [...] In addition, oil shale processing produces spent oil shale, which is a solid residue. Spent shale consists of inorganic compounds (minerals) and chara carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen. Burning the char off the spent shale produces oil shale ash. Spent shale and shale ash can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture. [...] The composition of the oil shale may lend added value to the extraction process through the recovery of by-products, including ammonia, sulfur, aromatic compounds, pitch, asphalt, and waxes.|$|E

500|$|In general, {{externally}} generated hot gas {{technologies are}} similar to internal combustion technologies in that they also <b>process</b> <b>oil</b> shale lumps in vertical shaft kilns. Significantly, though, the heat in these technologies is delivered by gases heated outside the retort vessel, and therefore the retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust. The Petrosix and Paraho Indirect employ this technology. In addition to not accepting fine particles as feed, these technologies do not utilize the potential heat of combusting the char on the spent shale and thus must burn more valuable fuels. [...] However, {{due to the lack}} of combustion of the spent shale, the oil shale does not exceed [...] and significant carbonate mineral decomposition and subsequent CO2 generation can be avoided for some oil shales. [...] Also, these technologies tend to be the more stable and easier to control than internal combustion or hot solid recycle technologies.|$|E
