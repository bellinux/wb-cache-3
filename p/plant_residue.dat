25|$|Archaeologists {{working at}} Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture {{settlement}} {{located near the}} modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle {{on one side and}} a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a <b>plant</b> <b>residue,</b> which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the Ilex vomitoria. The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.|$|E

Also, they are useful indicators of soil quality and life index in agricultural systems. The objectives {{of this study were}} the effect of nanozeolite and <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> on soil microbial communities and their characteristics and also, the assessment of incubation timing on soil microbial properties. Soil microorganisms are very important in the decomposition of <b>plant</b> <b>residues.</b> In this regard, the soil samples were treated by nanozeolite (0, 10 and 30 % Weight), Alfalfa and wheat straw (0 and 5 % Weight). The treated soil samples were incubated in lab condition for 90 days. The result of this study showed that Bacterial, Fungal, and Actinomycete populations increased by the addition of 30 % of nanozeolite and 5 % of <b>plant</b> <b>residues,</b> especially alfalfa straw. Also, the addition of nanozeolite and <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> treatments improved MBC, BR, and SIR as microbial characteristics. These parameters increased after 30 days of starting incubation, then decreased until the 75 th day and finally increased slightly on the 90 th day. In fact, the addition of nanozeolite and <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> into the soil had positive effects on improvement of carbon pools and increasing carbon sequestration in it. Applied nanozeolite and <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> in soil, improved carbon pools and increased carbon sequestration in soil.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} pesticides sprayed on crops may {{be returned to}} soils via <b>plant</b> <b>residues,</b> but its fate has been little documented. The objective of this work was to study the fate of glyphosate associated to <b>plants</b> <b>residues.</b> Oilseed rape was used as model plant using two lines: a glyphosate-tolerant (GT) line and a non-GT one, considered as a crucifer weed. The effects of different fragmentation degrees and placements in soil of <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> were tested. A control {{was set up by}} spraying glyphosate directly on the soil. The mineralization of glyphosate in soil was slower when incorporated into <b>plant</b> <b>residues,</b> and the amounts of extractable and non-extractable glyphosate residues increased. Glyphosate availability for mineralization increased when the size of <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> decreased, and as the distribution of <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> in soil was more homogeneous. After 80 days of soil incubation, extractable 14 C-residues mostly involved one metabolite of glyphosate (AMPA) but up to 2. 6 % of initial 14 C was still extracted from undecayed leaves as glyphosate. Thus, the trapping of herbicides in plant materials provided a protection against degradation, and crops residues returns may increase the persistence of glyphosate in soils. This pattern appeared more pronounced for GT crops, which accumulated more non-degraded glyphosate in their tissues...|$|R

The DAISY model was able to simulate soil mineral N and soil microbial biomass N after soil incorporation of catch crop <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> to some extend.

40|$|Keeping <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> on {{the field}} and {{incorporating}} them instead of removing or burning them, is a well-known practice in soil and water conservation. One of the objectives of this management is to reduce the susceptibility of the soil surface to slaking and hence sealing. The non-removal of <b>plant</b> <b>residues,</b> starting in 1965, decreased the slaking of the soil surface after 10 years, which was clearly visible in March, 1976. To check whether the removal of <b>plant</b> <b>residues</b> affects only the top layer of a soil, undisturbed and disturbed samples of 4 horizons per profile were taken and analyzed in spring, 1999. Texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, pore size distribution, and aggregate stability (by means of a percolation test) as well as a few soil chemical parameters were determined. Almost no improvement of soil structural parameters was detected by keeping residues {{on the field}}. The susceptibility to slaking was the only parameter being significantly reduced.

A study of one soil type found that contained within the drilosphere was 40 per cent of the aerobic (and 13 per cent of anaerobic) nitrogen-fixing bacteria and 16 per cent of the denitrifiers. The drilosphere is generally richer in nitrogen, phosphorus, and humified organic material than the surrounding soil.

50|$|Protection against soil loss is maximized with {{rotation}} {{methods that}} leave the greatest mass of crop stubble (<b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> left after harvest) {{on top of}} the soil. Stubble cover in contact with the soil minimizes erosion from water by reducing overland flow velocity, stream power, and thus the ability of the water to detach and transport sediment. Soil Erosion and Cill prevent the disruption and detachment of soil aggregates that cause macropores to block, infiltration to decline, and runoff to increase. This significantly improves the resilience of soils when subjected to periods of erosion and stress.|$|E

Thus, it is still an open question if composting constitutes a safe way of disposing of GM <b>plant</b> <b>residues.</b> Furthermore, these experiments give rise to other interesting questions, e. g., the behavior of GM plant materials decomposing in waste piles or manure yards under composting-like conditions and the possibility of horizontal gene transfer to indigenous bacteria at the comparably lower temperatures presentat these environments.

In first few days the amounts of added SO 4 - 2 -S immobilized were linearly correlated with the amounts of added S recovered in the soil microbial biomass. With further incubation the proportions of immobilized SO 4 - 2 -S remaining as biomass-S decreased. Decrease in biomass-S was thought to be due to the conversion of biomass-S into soil organic-S.

50|$|For {{crops that}} are not {{exclusively}} for biochar production, the residue-to-product ratio (RPR) and the collection factor (CF) the percent of the residue not used for other things, measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product. For instance, Brazil harvests approximately 460 million tons (MT) of sugarcane annually, with an RPR of 0.30, and a CF of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops, which normally are burned in the field. This translates into approximately 100 MT of residue annually, which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives. Adding in the bagasse (sugarcane waste) (RPR=0.29 CF=1.0), which is otherwise burned (inefficiently) in boilers, raises the total to 230 MT of pyrolysis feedstock. Some <b>plant</b> <b>residue,</b> however, must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} the black spore phase. Near the {{beginning}} of autumn, production of rust-colored urediospores is replaced by the formation of black over-wintering spores. These spores are designed to withstand the harsh winter conditions. The large, two-celled, thick-walled, black teliospores are formed either in existing uredia or newly formed pustules. Spores overwinter on host <b>plant</b> <b>residue,</b> germinate in early spring, and produce new infections on growing asparagus spears. The black-brown lesions are called telia and give a blackish hue {{to the top of}} the plants. The teliospores remain attached in the pustules on asparagus plant parts or plant debris for the remainder of the season and throughout winter.Around springtime when young asparagus shoots are emerging, the overwintering teliospores germinate on the old stems to produce sporidia. The sporidia (also called blasidiospores) infect nearby emerging shoots or spears. This infection results in pycnia, producing pyciniospores and repeating the disease cycle.|$|E
