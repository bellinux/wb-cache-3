60|$|Our old {{chambers}} {{had been}} left unchanged through the supervision of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. As I entered I saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old landmarks were all in their place. There were the chemical corner and the acid-stained, deal-topped table. There upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrap-books and books of reference which many of our fellow-citizens {{would have been so}} glad to burn. The diagrams, the violin-case, and the pipe-rack--even the Persian slipper which contained the tobacco--all met my eyes as I glanced round me. There were two occupants of the room--one, Mrs. Hudson, who beamed upon us both as we entered--the other, the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening's adventures. It was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a small <b>pedestal</b> <b>table</b> with an old dressing-gown of Holmes's so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect.|$|E

50|$|Tables {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of materials, shapes, and heights {{dependent}} upon their origin, style, intended use and cost. Many tables are made of wood or wood-based products; some are made of other materials including metal and glass. Most tables are composed of a flat surface and one or more supports (legs). A table with a single, central foot is a <b>pedestal</b> <b>table.</b> Long tables often have extra legs for support.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{location}} was at 11 East Grand Ave. and was formerly a tenement house. It {{was on the}} near north side, close to all transportation and near a parking lot. The club was just below street level as a step-down-and-into establishment. The avant-garde room was designed by artists Hugo Weber and Emerson Woelffer from the IIT Institute of Design in Chicago. The bandstand walls were made of spring steel to help resonate the band, which was on a small round carpeted deck in the back. Enlargements of recent albums adorned the other walls. Bill Reinhardt installed air-conditioning and customized acoustics in which [...] "The softest note makes itself heard {{all the way to}} the north wall." [...] Booths lined the walls along perimeter of the main room and while the middle was filled with small square <b>pedestal</b> <b>tables</b> having lacquered tops, surrounded by ladder-back wood chairs. Jazz, Ltd. seated 85 people and had 15 employees. Over the cash register was a sign, [...] "ASCAP salutes Jazz, Ltd. for providing its patrons with America's finest music..." [...] Due to Jazz, Ltd's small size, [...] "most tables have to be reserved. People are turned away by the dozens, but the ones in the know called ahead and tables were held for them. This procedure was heretofore unknown to Chicago, for a jazz spot." [...] "We are making money and pleasing hundreds of customers weekly." [...] One small spotlight shone on the bandstand that was situated just a foot from the tables. There was a small service bar in front. In the front window was Ziblid, a large statue ridiculing women in general. This was also used as part of the logo on Jazz Ltd. records.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{explicit}} visual depictions of ritual associated with an altar is evident in an altar unearthed {{in the ruins of}} El Cayo. This altar, commonly referred to as “Altar 4” portrays a man, seated before a table altar, scattering grains of incense. In the carved image, the altar supports an incense burner as well. This imagery is associated with underworld deities and rites of fire starting. Altar 4 is also important in part for the sense it communicates of the altar as the site of an assemblage of offerings and ritual items: the incense burner contains kindling sticks, as well as an arrangement of feathers all clustered around a cloth bundle. According to many archaeologists, [...] "the altar is seen as a locus of a piling on of ritual goods is a constant theme in the programs of iconographic decoration worked into Maya <b>pedestals</b> and <b>table</b> altars." ...|$|R
50|$|The magician {{places a}} large metal ball {{on a small}} <b>pedestal</b> on a <b>table.</b> The ball is then covered with a large silk cloth which the magician holds above the ball. The ball then begins to lift {{into the air and}} move about under the cloth, before {{appearing}} out from under cloth to roll along the upper edge of the stretched-out cloth, or along the magician's arms. The ball may also disappear and re-appear as it moves about. The ball is finally coaxed to return to its pedestal and the cloth is removed.|$|R

5000|$|During his decade-long {{relationship}} with the painter John Button in the 1960s, Burton {{was introduced to the}} social networks of the art, dance, and theater communities of New York. He came to meet, among others, Edward Albee, Jerome Robbins, Lincoln Kirstein, and Alex Katz. Throughout the 1960s, Burton attempted to be a playwright and librettist, but in 1965 started writing art criticism. In 1966, he began as an editorial associate at Artnews, eventually becoming an editor. He wrote a substantial amount of art criticism in the late 1960s in this role, including the introduction to the pivotal exhibition Live in Your Head: When Attitudes Become Form at the Kunsthalle Berne. [...] Starting in 1969, he began to make performance art, first contributing to the [...] "Street Works" [...] events held in 1969 (and featuring such artists as Vito Acconci and Eduardo Costa). Throughout the 1970s, Burton was known mostly as an art critic and performance artist. In 1972, he showed his Group Behavior Tableaux performance at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and went on to stage other tableaux performances at such venues as the Guggenheim, Documenta, and the Berkeley Art Museum. He began incorporating furniture into his work as early as 1970, and it would grow from being an active participant in his performances to his main area of output. He first realized his sculptures in 1975, culminating in his exhibition at Artists Space in New York, where he showed his Bronze Chair. Through the remaining 1970s, Burton would continue to create performance art pieces and, increasingly, sculpture and public art. It was public art that caught his imagination, and starting in 1979 he began to reconsider his role as an artist by making works of functional furniture-as-sculpture (pragmatic sculpture, he called it) that were meant to be largely anonymous, invisible, and woven into the fabric of the everyday. In the 1980s, he became known primarily as a sculptor of refined sculptural furniture and ambitious and useful interventions in public space. His [...] "tables" [...] and [...] "chairs" [...] challenge the distinction between furniture and sculpture. Copper <b>Pedestal</b> <b>Table</b> from 1981-83, {{in the collection of the}} Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of such a [...] "table". It is as much a minimalist sculpture as it is a table.|$|E
5000|$|The {{room was}} {{furnished}} with Federal style antiques. Twelve dining room chairs, crafted in the Sheraton style in Baltimore in 1785, were {{donated to the}} White House in 1961 by Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. The chairs were initially reupholstered in an off-white damask approximating mother-of-pearl, designed by Parish and woven by Bergamo Fabrics. The fabric stained too easily, and in early 1963 Mrs. Kennedy asked Boudin to recommend a new upholster. Boudin selected white leather, tooled to look like silk damask and manufactured by Maison Jansen (the design firm for which Boudin worked). The chairs surrounded a Sheraton <b>pedestal</b> dining <b>table.</b> The Engelhards also donated a Federalist hunt board crafted in the American South. [...] A side table, attributed to cabinetmaker John Shaw (cabinetmaker) of Annapolis, Maryland; a mahogany sideboard manufactured in New England and originally owned by Daniel Webster; a setee with caned seat; and a hunt table in the Hepplewhite style also adorned the room. Additional Federalist dining chairs were donated in 1962.|$|R

In the bedroom there is a 'Victorian' range of furniture: a bed made of brass look plastic with two sheets, a pillow and eiderdown in white nylon with pink roses all over, a dressing table with swivel mirror and working (battery) oil lamp, and a wardrobe. These items were originally in brown plastic to represent wood, and then went on to be manufactured in a rich green, the doors of the wardrobe papered in a tiny flower print.

5000|$|In December 1998, First Lady Hillary Clinton {{unveiled}} a renovated State Dining Room. She was advised by interior designer Kaki Hockersmith (a long-time {{friend of the}} Clintons), interior designer Mark Hampton of New York City (who had worked on the White House for President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush), and the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. The room's walls were repainted a light stone color, with architectural details lightly highlighted. The <b>pedestal</b> console <b>tables</b> were stripped of paint which mimicked white marble with gold veining, and their original mahogany finish was restored. The gilded chandelier and wall sconces were polished and brightened. The room's 66 chairs were reupholstered in a gold damask. New ivory silk draperies, manufactured by F. Schumacher & Co., with printed full-color baskets, flowers, and ribbons replicating a 1901 damask design used by the firm, replaced the solid gold fabric drapes of the 1980s. The drapes were designed to reflect the color pattern of the White House china. A $113,031 ($ in [...] dollars), 43 by 28 ft carpet with a floral medallion pattern was also installed. The Colonial Revival-style carpet was woven by Scott Group Custom Carpets in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The 1902 silver-plated chandelier and the wall sconces—last gilded in 1961—were refinished, repaired, rewired, and cleaned. Sources differ as to the cost, with one putting it at $270,507 ($ in [...] dollars) and another at $341,000 ($ in [...] dollars), but the cost was {{paid for by the}} White House Endowment Trust. The Clinton refurbishment was not as successful as hoped. White House Curator William G. Allman noted that at night, the lack of backlighting from outside tended to make the drapes fade into the walls.|$|R

Two panels between contain roundels with profile relief portraits within a circular moulding.The Christopher Turnor monument sits on a black-and-white marble-tiled raised level. Within this level is set a worn sculpted medieval monument, supposed the early 14th-century memorial to John de Neville and his wife, with two recumbent figures—the man in chain armour, the woman with a wimple—draped from elbow to ankle and set within a sunken field. A dog lies at the feet of each figure, and a shield with three Fleur-de-lis lies partly over the man. Set into the raised floor against the north wall is a recessed table tomb with inset panels with angels holding shields, above which is a curved and moulded canopy arch with embedded fleuron repeats and a crocketed top running to a cross-shaped floriate finial. The origin of the monument is unknown. Next to the de Neville monument and set into a marble tile is a lozenge-shaped metal plaque to Florence Amy Laura Neville (died 1934 aged 85 years), daughter of Henry Martin Turnor who was the son of antiquarian Edmund Turnor (1755-1829) and brother of Christopher Turnor (1809-1886).|$|R
