These {{were used in the}} six processes of intervention mapping: needs assessment, proximal <b>programme</b> <b>objective</b> matrices, theory-based methods and practical strategies, intervention design, adoption and implementation, and evaluation. Findings The six stages demonstrated that self-management behaviours are a critical component of asthma care and that childhood asthma care may be influenced through behaviour and environment.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{investigate}} whether households relocated to governmentbuilt village settlements, as part of Rwanda’s Villagisation programme (‘Imidugudu’), diversify into non-farm income-generating activities {{to a greater extent}} than other rural households in Rwanda, and if so, to what extent the variation can be explained by differences in micro-level asset and meso-level access factors. Despite the <b>programme</b> <b>objective</b> to stimulate non-farm activity, the results of empirical estimations drawing on household and community-level data suggest that Imidugudu households differ surprisingly little from other rural households in terms of diversification into non-farm income sources. The slightly greater participation in non-farm income-generating activities observed among the Imidugudu households can be attributed to regional variation and household characteristics mattering for selection into the programme rather than to asset endowments and improved service access.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using records for 158 conflicts mediated between 2007 and 2009. Involvement of youth, gangs, retaliation, weapons and other risk factors were described. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for data-reduction purposes before the relationship between conflict risk components and mediation success was assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Results Most conflicts involved 2 – 3 individuals. Youth, persons with a history of violence, gang members and weapons were commonly present. OWs reported immediate, nonviolent resolution for 65 % of mediated conflicts; an additional 23 % were at least temporarily resolved without violence. PCA identified four dimensions of conflict risk: the risk-level of individuals involved; whether the incident was related to retaliation; the number of people involved; and shooting likelihood. However, these factors were not related to the OW’s ability to resolve the conflict. Neighbourhoods with programme-associated reductions in homicides mediated more gang-related conflicts; neighbourhoods without programme-related homicide reductions encountered more retaliatory conflicts and more weapons...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the differences in the concept and measurement of efficiency between the private and public sectors, stressing that the lessons from the private sector can only be transferred to the public sector if there is a proper awareness of these issues and constrains imposed by considerations of equity. In evaluating policy initiatives, the governments method for all the talk of “rolling back the public sector” and opposition companies of “cuts,” the public expenditure/EDP ration went up steadily during Obasanjo’s first term. However deep the divisions over what ought to be in the public sector, it is of paramount importance to all concerned that the resources are managed effectively. The paper argued that an attempt to instill into the public sector the cost consciousness of the best parts of the private sector is wholly admirable. In conclusion, the severity of the impending budgetary crises will make the search for greater efficiency in the public sector of paramount importance.

Particular attention has been dedicated to coupling the one-equation turbulence model by Spalart & Allmaras to the TFC premixed combustion model, for two computed turbulence scales are needed to evaluate the turbulent flame velocity and one-equation models provide one turbulent scale only. For validating the correct models implementations, two simple cold test cases have been chosen, namely the turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate, and a well documented turbulent flow over a backward facing step. Finally the Moreau combustor test case have been used for the validation of the models for premixed combustion flow. The state-of-the-art turbulence models implemented should allow the combustion code Ares to increase its ability to correctly compute complex turbulent premixed reactive flows in real combustors, which is the objective of the next project tasks...|$|E

Managing sustainable intensification of livestock production systems could therefore soon become {{a key component of}} climate change mitigation efforts. Heifer International has been awarded additional funding to build on the existing work of the East Africa Dairy Development (EADD) programme that is working to create a robust dairy industry in a region where demand for fresh milk is close to outstripping supply. The World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) are partners in this programme, helping Heifer work with more than 200, 000 farmers to improve dairy production and provide access to markets over the next four years. EADD has now adopted climate smart agriculture as a <b>programme</b> <b>objective,</b> partly based on engagement with CCAFS scientists, and the mounting evidence that better feeding – by using fodder banks, improved pasture species, planted legumes and crop by-products – and manure management can contribute both to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved income for farmers.

40|$|The recent {{rapid growth}} of California's population, leading to {{competition}} for space between residential, industrial and agricultural interests, the development of its water resources and increasing water pollution provide the basic ingredients of its present vector problems. Within the past half-century, the original mosquito habitats provided by nature have gradually given place to even more numerous and productive habitats of man-made character. At the same time, emphasis in mosquito control has shifted from physical to chemical, with the more recent extension to biological approaches as well. The growing domestic fly problem, continuing despite the virtual disappearance of the horse, is attributable to an increasing amount of organic by-products, stemming from growing communities, expanding industries and changing agriculture. The programme for the control of disease vectors and pest insects and animals directs its major effort to the following broad areas: (1) water management (including land preparation), (2) solid organic wastes management (emphasizing utilization), (3) community management (including design, layout, and storage practices of buildings and grounds), and (4) recreational area management (related to wildlife management). It is apparent that vector control can often employ economics as an ally in securing its objectives. Effective organization of the environment to produce maximum economic benefits to industry, agriculture, and the community results generally in conditions unfavourable {{to the survival of}} vector and noxious animal species.

From 1984 to 2004, {{the city}} of Novi Sad participated in the {{international}} MONICA (Multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease) project, {{as one of the}} 38 research centres form 21 countries around the world and in CINDI (Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Disease Intervention Programme) <b>programme.</b> <b>Objective.</b> Objective was to indicate the advantages of the integrated approach to prevention and control of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) over mono-programmes and still present curative approach. Additional objective was the assessment of the vulnerability from the leading risk factors of the population of Novi Sad, based on the results and experience gained in realization of international projects. Methods. We analyzed the results obtained in the countries where MONICA project and CINDI programme have been applied. The results of their application in Novi Sad are analyzed (the trend of the prevalence of risk factors, the incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular events). Results. The prevalence of risk factors (except smoking), the incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular events are significantly increasing and are in positive correlation with the values of the linear trend. The decrease was only recorded in 1987 (the implementation of the intervention programme). Conclusion. The review of results and experiences in international projects and programs, clearly indicate the advantage of an integrated approach to prevention and control of CVD in relation to monoprograme. The great vulnerability of the population of Novi Sad of the risk factors of CVD points out the necessity of their reductions by the principles of integrated programmes of prevention and control...|$|E
40|$|In the UK {{and other}} major economies in the world there are {{concerns}} {{about the impact of}} poor diet on ill health and the main causes of mortality. Furthermore these impacts are not evenly distributed and widening inequalities in health are strongly correlated with socio-economic inequalities. The Welsh Assembly Government’s Food and Well Being Strategy has a stated commitment to tackling inequalities in health and the community food co-operatives pilot, funded by the Assembly’s Inequalities in Health Fund, fits with objectives that relate to reducing local barriers to the uptake of healthy diets particularly within low income groups. The model used for the co-ops originates from one developed by the Rural Regeneration Unit based in Cumbria that also managed the pilot in Wales, discussed here. The pilot funded two Food Development Workers who connected volunteers, in the pilot areas, to local suppliers of fruit and vegetables.

40|$|The {{paper will}} relate principally to the TLRP <b>Programme</b> <b>Objective</b> of {{assisting}} teachers to transform {{their knowledge of}} learning and learners into more effective teaching practices. It will draw upon the findings of two Oxford Brookes ' research projects to present a broad brush stroke image of what learners regard as effective teaching in English 16 - 19 education. It will then consider some {{of the implications of}} these findings; and attempt to situate this discussion of learning and teaching issues into a wider philosophical debate. First, however, I should like to briefly consider the nature of language use in education. In {{the best of all possible}} worlds educational researchers would be able to conduct such complex, longitudinal studies, taking account of all philosophical, social, political, economic, and pedagogical factors, that the nature of learning and teaching would be laid bare and education enabled to become a perfect experience, fitting the needs of individuals to those of society. We all know, however, that research will never be like that. At best, research is a mapping exercise, and some maps are more accurate and therefore more useful than others. Anyone who has been left confused by an Ordnance Survey map knows that even the best maps are not always accurate and that map readers may be incompetent. Furthermore, human beings, as distinct from terrain, metamorphose more quickly and less predictably. Extending the mapping metaphor, I think that we need some triangulation points to orientate our research into learning and teaching and how knowledge of one may inform the other. For me, those key points are: * The nature of the relationship between learners and teachers * The meaning of learner autonomy, linked to that of 'lifelong learning' * The practice of democracy in Western Europe These points are linked by a fundamental human attribute- language use.

40|$|BACKGROUND - The European IDEFICS (Identification and {{prevention}} of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) study {{was set up to}} determine the aetiology of overweight, obesity and related disorders in children, and to develop and evaluate a tailored primary prevention <b>programme.</b> <b>OBJECTIVE</b> - This paper focuses on the aetiological element of the multicentre study, the measures and examinations, sociodemographic characteristics of the study sample and proportions of participation. DESIGN - Prospective cohort study with an embedded intervention study that started with a baseline survey in eight countries in 2007 - 2008. SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS - Baseline participants of the prospective cohort study were 16, 224 children aged 2 - 9 years. Parents reported sociodemographic, behavioural, medical, nutritional and other lifestyle data for their children and families. Examinations of children included anthropometry, blood pressure, fitness, accelerometry, DNA from saliva and physiological markers in blood and urine. The built environment, sensory taste perception and other mechanisms of children's food choices and consumer behaviour were studied in subgroups. RESULTS - Between 1507 and 2567, children {{with a mean age of}} 6. 0 years and an even sex distribution were recruited from each country. Of them, 82 % lived in two-parent families. The distribution of standardised income levels differed by study sample, with low-income groups being strongly represented in Cyprus, Italy and Germany. At least one 24 -h dietary recall was obtained for two-thirds of the children. Blood pressure and anthropometry were assessed in more than 90 %. A 3 -day accelerometry was performed in 46 %, motor fitness was assessed in 41 %, cardiorespiratory fitness in 35 % and ∼ 11 % participated in taste perception tests. The proportion of children donating venous blood, urine and saliva was 57, 86 and 88 %, respectively. CONCLUSION - The IDEFICS cohort provides valuable data to investigate the interplay of social, environmental, genetic, physiological and behavioural factors in the development of major diet- and lifestyle-related disorders affecting children at present...|$|E
40|$|Health {{benefits}} {{of physical activity}} in children are well known. However, a drawback is the risk of physical activity-related injuries. Children are at particular risk for these injuries, because of {{a high level of}} exposure. Because of the high prevalence of physical activity injuries and the negative short-and long-term consequences, prevention of these injuries in children is important. This article describes how we systematically developed a school-based physical activity injury prevention programme using the intervention mapping (IM) protocol. IM describes a process for developing theory-and evidence-based health promotion programmes. The development can be described in six steps: (i) perform a needs assessment; (ii) identify programme and performance objectives; (iii) select methods and strategies; (iv) develop programme; (v) adopt and implement; and (vi) evaluate. First, the results of the needs assessment showed the injury problem in children and the different risk factors for physical activity injuries. Based on the results of the needs assessment the main focus of the injury prevention programme was described. Second, the overall <b>programme</b> <b>objective</b> of the injury prevention programme was defined as reducing the incidence of lower extremity physical activity injuries. Third, theoretical methods and practical strategies were selected to accomplish a decrease in injury incidence. The theoretical methods used were active learning, providing cues and scenariobased risk information, and active processing of information. The practical strategy of the injury prevention programme was an 8 -month course about injury prevention to be used in physical education classes in primary schools. Fourth, programme materials that were used in the injury prevention programme were developed, including newsletters for children and parents, posters, exercises to improve motor fitness, and an information website. Fifth, an implementation plan was designed {{in order to ensure that}} the prevention programme would be implemented, adopted and sustained over time. Finally, an evaluation plan was designed. The injury prevention programme is being evaluated in a cluster randomized controlled trial with more than 2200 children from 40 primary schools throughout the Netherlands. The IM process is a useful process for developing an injury prevention programme. Based on the steps of the IM we developed an 8 -month injury prevention programme to be used in physical education classes of primary schools. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.
