40|$|To qualify {{materials}} for specific applications comprehensive testing is necessary, and consequently the engineering materials community {{has developed an}} extensive collection of documentary testing standards to define test conditions, specimen configurations, and post processing and reporting procedures. Unfortunately, {{in the absence of}} corresponding data formats, test results are rarely conserved and their value diminishes as the material pedigree, test conditions, and results become disassociated. In an effort to address this issue, <b>prenormative</b> research has demonstrated the viability of deriving data formats from documentary testing standards and thus the possibility to realize a standards-based data infrastructure for the engineering materials community.

40|$|Two {{alternative}} {{seismic protection}} technologies, and relevant hypotheses of {{application to the}} retrofit of an Italian <b>prenormative</b> steel school building, are examined in this paper. The two technologies consist in a dissipative bracing system, and a damped cable system, both incorporating pressurized fluid viscous dampers as protecting devices. The essential characteristics and performance of the two systems, along with their analytical/computational modelling criteria, are recalled {{in the first part}} of this paper. The dimensions, layouts and locations selected for the constituting elements of the two rehabilitation solutions are then discussed. A synthesis of the nonlinear dynamic analyses and performance-based evaluations carried out on the case study building in original and protected conditions is finally proposed...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the SILENV project, funded by the E. U. within the 7 FP, was the {{development}} of <b>prenormative</b> requirements regarding the impact of shipradiated noise into three different environments: onboard the vessel and outside it, in air and in water. The paper describes the background of the new formulations which generally take into account the existing requirements, the technical know-how in the field of ship construction about the characterization of noise source and transmission paths and the actual knowledge of the way noise affects the various categories of receivers involved. On these bases, objectives of the noise control are defined in the various areas and the final choices in terms of limits are reported, also highlighting the motivations at the basis of the requirements. Possible future trends in the redefinition of objectives for the control of noise and in normative developments are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Communication {{presented}} at the 18 th International Congress on Acoustics (ICA 2004) : "Acoustical Science and Technology for Quality of Life", Kyoto, 4 - 9 April 2004. After a brief view of single number quantities and psychoacoustic fundamentals used in sound insulation, reference curves provided in the new standard ISO/DIS 140 - 16 : 2003 as a method for the global assessment of airborne sound insulation improvements of lightweight wall linings are dealt with. By using a numeric simulation model the properties of airborne sound insulation improvements of wall linings resulting from that single number ratings are discussed: among then the frequency intervals of higher efficiency and the insignificance of the incident noise spectrum are noteworthy. Another important conclusion concerns the variability of global improvement {{as a function of}} the reference curve, the two curves involved in the standard project represents a certain compromise of simplicity. Part of this work has been sponsored by programs <b>Prenormative</b> Research for Spanish Building Code (Production Ministry) and Spanish National Research Program (Science & Technology Ministry).

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{has been}} developed within the <b>Prenormative</b> Research in support of EuroCode 8 (PREC 8) programme of the European Commission. The EuroCode 8 (EC 8) are the provisional European standards {{for the design of}} civil engineering structures in seismic prone areas. This programme included experimental test on a series of bridge structures that have been tested under Pseudo-Dynamic conditions. Experimental tests were carried out to study the behaviour of bridge piers under cyclic loading. The results from these tests underlined the need to improve an existing fiber model to represent the non-linear behaviour of structures where the influence of the shear forces is not negligible. Thus, a strut-and-tie formulation coupled with the classic fibre model for flexural forces was developed. This formulation is based on the analogy of a R/C structure damaged with diagonal cracking with a truss made of concrete diagonals and steel ties. The model is applied to a set of bridge piers tested at the ELSA laboratory and the results are compared with the experimental response. JRC. DG.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of anthropogenic activities at sea is recently gaining {{more and more}} attention. As regards shipping, emissions from ships into the environment of various nature (engine exhaust gases, anti-fouling paints leaching, ballast exchange, releases at sea of oil and other noxious liquid or solid cargoes, of sewage and of garbage) have been recognized as sources of pollution and therefore controlled and limited since a long time. The subject of noise emission has been identified only recently. To study the problem, the EU has funded, among others, the FP 7 SILENV (Ship Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise and Vibrations) project that run from 2010 to 2012. In the present work, the holistic approach followed within the project to characterize and control the ship {{as a source of}} noise is presented. Three types of noise emissions (in air, in water and inside the ship) are analyzed highlighting peculiarities and different strategies adopted to characterize the source, the impact on the receiver and the possible solutions to set limits to the ship emissions. The project outcome included a socalled “Green Label”: a set of new <b>prenormative</b> requirements defined for the three main areas mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{extensive}} and expanding use of plastics in agriculture results in increased accumulation of plastic waste in rural areas. The majority of this waste is {{left on the}} field or burnt uncontrollably by the farmers releasing harmful substances affecting human health, {{the safety of the}} farming products and the environment. Materials and Methods Specific key scientific challenges have been set to be resolved in the framework of this project through integrated <b>prenormative</b> research activities that are associated with the characterization of the stream, meeting the specs, expanding the specs of the disposal processes by defining the technical requirements and limits for achieving technical and economically feasible solutions for each disposal option. Results A holistic environmentally sound waste management scheme that minimizes the costs and maximizes the revenues by transforming the agricultural plastic waste streams into labeled guaranteed quality commodities freely traded in an open market has been developed by the LabelAgriWaste project. Discussion Pilot tests have been run to optimise the scheme parameters and quantify the potential, the efficiency and the impact of the LabelAgriWaste scheme. The proposed solutions to the unresolved problems are expected to be achieved through the implementation of the LabelAgriWaste scheme. Conclusion The labeling management scheme proposed is designed to be technically feasible, economic and able to satisfy the geographic diversity and the various technical requirements of the major stakeholders throughout Europe, including farmers, plastics producers, recyclers and industrial facilities utilizing alternative fuels for energy production...|$|E
40|$|EU Directives 98 / 37 /EC (machinery directive) and 94 / 9 /EC (ATEX 100 a) have to {{be applied}} by {{manufacturers}} of equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. These Directives include Essential Safety Requirements and place an onus on manufacturers {{to carry out a}} risk assessment for the intended use of their equipment. In order to help manufacturers in this task, the European Standards organisation, CEN, TC 305 has mandated its WG 4 (terminology and methodology) to write a standard on the risk assessment of equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. The RASE project was set up as a <b>prenormative</b> research work to define the requirements for developing such a standard as specified in the dedicated call of the European Commission's Standards Measurement and Testing programme concerned with subjects relating to the standardisation activities of CEN- Explosive atmospheres-risk assessment of unit operations and equipment. The project (December 1997 -May 2000) was co-ordinated by INBUREX with the participation of FSA Germany, INERIS France, HSE England, NIRO Denmark and CMR Norway. Since March 2000, WG 4 (TC 305) is actively involved in preparing the final draft of this standard. This paper describes the objectives and the results obtained to date in RASE project and in WG 4. An outline is given of the contents of the standard being developed for the risk assessment of equipment and protection systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres...|$|E

40|$|With ICT Standards {{playing a}} key role in support of {{research}} and development in many disciplines, the European Commission Institute for Energy and Transport is keen to promote the development and adoption of ICT Standards for engineering data. In this respect, its MatDB Online facility is a Standards-based system for preserving, managing, and exchanging engineering materials test data. While MatDB Online has evolved over more than 30 years to incorporate the latest innovations in data preservation and exchange, such as XML-based data transfer and data citation using digital object identifiers, it continues to rely on a robust data model developed more than 30 years ago through the joint efforts of the National Research Institute for Metals (the predecessor to NIMS, the National Institute for Materials Science), the European Commission Joint Research Centre, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. While this data model has endured over many years, there is no corresponding Standard. Similarly, related efforts by the engineering materials community to deliver a Standard representation for engineering materials, such as MatML, have failed to be ratified. In consequence of the continued absence of a Standard representation for engineering materials data, there is no common mechanism for preserving and exchanging materials data and no formal means of maintaining a data model to support advances in materials technology, such as the emergence of nanomaterials. It is for these reasons that the European Commission Institute for Energy and Transport is supporting SERES, a CEN Workshop on Standards for Electronic Reporting in the Engineering Sector. As one of more than thirty organisations supporting the SERES Workshop, the Institute for Energy and Transport will make the MatDB XML schema available as one of several resources that will be taken into consideration when the <b>prenormative</b> Standard for representing engineering materials data is formulated. With the participation of the Institute for Energy and Transport in the SERES Workshop taking place in parallel with a related project with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, {{there is good reason to}} expect that a Standard representation for engineering materials, which has so far eluded the materials community, will be realised. This paper describes MatDB support for engineering materials Standards and related innovative features. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear Reactor Integrity Assessment and Knowledge Managemen...|$|E
