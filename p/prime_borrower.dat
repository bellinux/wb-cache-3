50|$|The term {{subprime}} {{refers to}} the credit quality of particular borrowers, who have weakened credit histories and {{a greater risk of}} loan default than <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers.</b> The value of U.S. subprime mortgages was estimated at $1.3 trillion as of March 2007, with over 7.5 million first-lien subprime mortgages outstanding.|$|R
50|$|Subprime borrowers {{typically}} have weakened credit histories and reduced repayment capacity. Subprime loans {{have a higher}} risk of default than loans to <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers.</b> If a borrower is delinquent in making timely mortgage payments to the loan servicer (a bank or other financial firm), the lender may take possession of the property, in a process called foreclosure.|$|R
40|$|Utilizing new panel micro {{data on the}} {{ownership}} sequences {{of all types of}} borrowers from 1997 - 2012 leads to a reinterpretation of the U.

Moreover, traditional mortgage default factors associated with the economic cycle, such as negative equity, completely account for the foreclosure propensity of <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers</b> relative to all-cash owners, and for three-quarters of the analogous subprime gap. Housing traits, race, initial income, and speculators did not play a meaningful role, and initial leverage only accounts for a small variation in outcomes of <b>prime</b> and subprime <b>borrowers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Alt-A {{mortgages}} are an ill-defined category, generally <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers</b> but non-conforming in some way, often lower documentation (or in {{some other}} way: vacation home, etc.) Alt-A mortgages tend to be larger in size than subprime loans and have significantly higher credit quality. For example, an Alt-A loan might be to an individual with multiple and varying sources of income; non-owner occupied, investment properties are often Alt-A loans. Because Alt-A loans are not conforming loans, they {{are not eligible for}} purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{subprime}} {{refers to}} the credit quality of particular borrowers, who have weakened credit histories and {{a greater risk of}} loan default than <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers.</b> As people become economically active, records are created relating to their borrowing, earning and lending history.

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} effects of the {{accounting}} scandals surrounding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) in the summer of 2003. The suddenness and unexpectedness of the scandals make this period a good natural experiment to examine how their market presence affects mortgage lending, both in terms of volume and underwriting standards. I present three novel findings. First, the scandal did have an immediate and dramatic effect on the number of mortgage loans privately securitized as opposed to sold to the GSEs. Second, I find that this {{had an impact on the}} mortgage characteristics of mortgages taken out by <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers.</b> Beginning almost simultaneously with the GSE pullback, there was a rapid increase in risky mortgages taken out by <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers,</b> measured by characteristics like poor documentation and the use of adjustable-rates and interest-only mortgages. Finally, I find that the GSE pullback did not appear to have a substantial effect on level of subprime mortgage lending or its underwriting characteristics. Rather, the level of subprime lending was steadily increasing during this period and does not seem to have been affected by the GSE scandal. * The views in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the view...|$|R

50|$|Members of US {{minority}} groups received {{a disproportionate number}} of subprime mortgages, and so have experienced a disproportionate level of the resulting foreclosures. Recent research shows that complex mortgages were chosen by <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers</b> with high income levels seeking to purchase expensive houses relative to their incomes. Borrowers with complex mortgages experienced substantially higher default rates than borrowers with traditional mortgages with similar characteristics. The crisis had a devastating effect on the U.S. auto industry. New vehicle sales, which peaked at 17 million in 2005, recovered to only 12 million by 2010.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the importance of middle-class and high-FICO borrowers for the mortgage crisis. Contrary to popular belief, which focuses on subprime and poor borrowers, we show that mortgage originations increased for borrowers across all income levels and FICO scores. The relation between mortgage growth and income growth at the individual level remained positive throughout the pre- 2007 period. Finally, middle-income, high-income, and <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers</b> all sharply increased their share of delinquencies in the crisis. These results are consistent with a demand-side view, where homebuyers and lenders bought into increasing house values and borrowers defaulted after prices dropped...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{mortgages}} {{became a}} popular borrowing instrument during the bullish housing market {{of the early}} 2000 s but vanished rapidly during the subsequent downturn. These non-traditional loans (interest only, negative amortization, and teaser mortgages) enable households to postpone loan repayment compared to traditional mortgages and hence relax borrowing constraints. At the same time, they increase household leverage and heighten dependence on mortgage refinancing to escape changes in contract terms. We document that complex mortgages were chosen by <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers</b> with high income levels seeking to purchase expensive houses relative to their incomes. Borrowers with complex mortgages experience substantially higher ex post default rates than borrowers with traditional mortgages with similar characteristics. Mortgages; Mortgage loans...|$|R

50|$|Peerform {{provides}} an online personal loan platform which {{acts as a}} marketplace between potential borrowers and investors who lend money. By matching borrowers with investors, Peerform offers its investors access to a personal loan asset class in a US market which {{is reported to have}} grown by 176.6% per year between 2008 and 2013. Peerform only accepts accredited investors under SEC Reg D Rule 506(c) or institutional investors to lend money on its platform. Borrowers are screened on a variety of factors so as to ascertain what Peerform defines as “creditworthiness”. Peerform accepts near-prime (see Subprime lending) and <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers</b> with Credit Scores as low as 600 (and above). Each borrower is presented a fixed APR (and fixed interest rate) with an equal repayment scheme that allows them to pay back the loan in automatic bank debits spread out over 3 years.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the behaviour of key bank level stability factors of liquidity, capital, risk-taking and consumer confidence in Islamic and conventional banks which {{operate in the}} same market. Using fixed effect sample of 194 banks of Gulf Cooperating Countries between 2000 and 2007, we found that liquidity is not determined by bank’s product mix but rather attributed to systematic factors. However, non performing assets (representing loans to sub <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers)</b> have positive and significant relationship with liquidity implying that during the crisis, Islamic banks tend to take stringent risk strategies compared to conventional banks. Furthermore, Islamic banks generally tend to provide higher consumer confidence levels as they were more capitalized than conventional banks, although conventional banks had carried higher averages of liquidity compared to Islamic banks. Consumer confidence levels or depositors’ discipline as proxied by deposits and customer funding over liabilities generally appear to be higher in Islamic banks than conventional banks. ...|$|R
40|$|Mortgage {{innovations}} and New Deal agencies facilitated lower priced {{loans for}} <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers</b> and minimum price disparities across US regions. In the 1980 s deregulation removed price restrictions on banks’ mortgages and also removed geographic distance restrictions on lending, opening the subprime industry. Global and local Moran indices identified interregional price disparities based upon proportions of subprime mortgage originations. A cluster of high-priced mortgage originations was found along the Gulf States {{both before and}} after the subprime collapse of 2007. Local banks, perceived to have special underwriting knowledge about their markets, and who were more likely to offer preferred prices, were compared with nonlocal banks and independent mortgage companies on their spatial distributions of mortgage pricing. During the boom and bust years from 2005 to 2008, the regional patterns of proportions of subprime mortgages for each mortgage institution type were similar, adversely impacting borrowers in the Southern Gulf region. These spatial patterns suggest that nonlocal banks and independents made the same underwriting conclusions about borrowers in regional markets as the local bank specialists. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the default}} option typical to American mortgages. House-holds borrow to buy durable housing, but future house prices are uncertain, and households find it advantageous to default on their debt if house prices fall suffi- ciently. A key {{assumption of the}} model is that households are relegated to the rental market upon default, {{and that there is}} a small pecuniary inefficiency (“iceberg cost”) in renting. This leads defaulters to substitute consumption of other goods for housing; that is, the demand for housing falls upon default. Consequently, when some households default, aggregate demand for housing is reduced, hence house prices fall more, possibly inciting other households to default. This complementarity is a source of multiple equilibria, and a price externality. Using a specific case for which an analytical solution can be derived, I show that contagion is possible: it may be that the default of a minority (interpretable as sub-prime borrowers) spreads to a majority (interpretable as <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers).</b> Housing demand; Mortgage market; Default risk; Multiple equilibria Contagion...|$|R
40|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{has become}} one of the most {{controversial}} international institutions in history. The IMF's crisis management responsibilities expanded via its involvement with a series of international economic crises during the last three decades, which led to widespread calls for radical reform of the organisation in the aftermath of the emerging market crises of the 1990 s. This article examines the IMF's initial response to managing the effects of the global credit crunch, focusing on the new round of large IMF loans approved in late 2008 and early 2009, to assess how much IMF lending policies have changed in practice compared with earlier international crisis episodes. While the organisation has continued to promote conventional loan policy targets aimed at achieving low inflation, low budget deficits, and sustainable public debt, the preliminary evidence also suggests the IMF is developing a more flexible approach to crisis management in borrowing member states. Changes include a greater tolerance for unorthodox policies such as short-term capital controls, greater differentiation in the treatment of borrowers based on their economic circumstances, easier access to precautionary IMF financing for <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers,</b> and more flexibility in the use of loan conditionality...|$|R
40|$|While a {{substantial}} literature {{has examined the}} causes of mortgage foreclosure, there has been relatively little work on the consequences of foreclosure for the borrowers themselves. Using a large sample of anonymous credit bureau records, observed quarterly from 1999 Q 1 through 2010 Q 1, we examine the credit experiences of almost 350, 000 borrowers before and after their mortgage foreclosure. Our analysis documents the substantial declines in credit scores that accompany foreclosure and examines {{the length of time}} it takes individuals to return their credit scores to pre-delinquency levels. The results suggest that, particularly for <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers,</b> credit score recovery comes slowly, if at all. This appears to be driven by persistently higher levels of delinquency on consumer credit (such as auto and credit card loans) in the years that follow foreclosure. Our results also indicate that the experiences of individuals whose mortgages entered foreclosure from 2007 to 2009 have followed a similar path to borrowers foreclosed earlier in the decade, though post-foreclosure delinquency rates for the recently foreclosed have been higher and, consequently, credit score recovery appears to be taking longer.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how some of the {{assumptions}} about the current financial crisis are wrong because they misunderstand what takes place in the mortgage market. Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses four wrong assumptions: one related to regulation, one to leveraging, one to subprime lending and one to predatory lending. It briefly discusses some policy implications. Findings - The role of the state in the mortgage market is more complex than suggested by those who blame the state for not doing anything. The concept of leveraging can explain, at least in part, why the losses in financial markets are bigger than the losses in the housing market. Many subprime loans were sold to <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers.</b> Subprime lending was not designed to increase homeownership rates, but to fuel profits by exploiting vulnerable borrowers. Practical implications - It is too easy to argue that everyone made mistakes; most borrowers cannot be blamed for being sold risky, overpriced loans. A rescue plan is needed for defaulting borrowers and those already in foreclosure. Originality/value - The paper does not present new research, but brings together research that demonstrates that the roots of the crisis in the mortgage market are in many ways different from what is suggested by professionals and journalists alike.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} large swings {{in the housing market}} on nonmortgage borrowing, including student, credit card, auto, and home equity debts. For this purpose, we use CoreLogic geographic house price variation, matched with rich data on consumer liabilities from the Equifax-sourced FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel. The length and timing of our panel allow us to study the consumer debt portfolio response to house price changes during a boom-and-bust cycle of historic magnitude as well as during more ordinary times. In first-differenced instrumental variables estimation, we find that during 1999 - 2001, homeowners substituted out of nonhousing (largely credit card) debt and into home equity-based debt at a nearly dollar-for-dollar rate in response to house price increases. During the housing boom of 2002 - 06, however, homeowners abandoned the practice of substituting into less costly debt as equity grew, and instead increased obligations across the board. From 2007 - 12, sample homeowners experienced a 23 percent average house price decline, and withdrew from home equity debt without adding to non-housing debt. We observe substantial heterogeneity in this pattern: Substitution in both 1999 - 2001 and 2007 - 12 ranges from 50 cents to more than dollar-for-dollar for older and <b>prime</b> <b>borrowers,</b> while the decidedly nonprime borrow more modestly, show less evidence of substitution, and shed large amounts of all types of debt from 2007 - 12. Finally, difference-in-differences and FD-IV estimates are consistent with both 1) a 2012 relative debt overhang of at least $ 1, 800 on average, despite little remaining home equity advantage, for homeowners who experienced a more pronounced boom-and-bust cycle and 2) little substitution out of home equity debt into student loans in response to recent house price declines...|$|R
40|$|Information {{advantage}} and entry deterrence incentives are investigated as they affect lending outcomes and competitive {{structure of the}} U. S. residential mortgage market. In the model, when assessing a loan applicant, the incumbent monopoly lender employs a proprietary screening technology to produce a privately observed estimate of loan credit quality. When faced with potential competitive entry, the incumbent signals poor credit quality by charging high prices to higher quality borrowers. Market structure and loan pricing strategy are derived endogenously, where the incumbent deters entry by first segmenting consumers into prime and sub-prime loan markets and second by charging <b>prime</b> market <b>borrowers</b> a uniform rate that {{is higher than the}} risk-based monopoly rate. Empirical implications of the model are identified, and evidence is presented that is consistent with predictions. 1 The U.
