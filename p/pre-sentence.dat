500|$|In December 2010 Hodgson was {{returned}} to prison awaiting trial over new and unconnected allegations of rape and sexual assault of a 22-year-old woman with learning difficulties at a care home in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in August 2010. On 3March 2011, Hodgson pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to sexual touching but denied rape. David Crook, prosecuting, {{said that he would}} offer no evidence on the rape charge, which was withdrawn. Hodgson's solicitor, Julian Young, said: [...] "The wrongful imprisonment for 27 years of my client has had a devastating effect on his life since he was cleared of the murder he did not commit [...] has been gripped by a number of personal difficulties, including a degree of alcohol abuse." [...] The judge, Mr.Justice Prince, requested the preparation of <b>pre-sentence</b> reports {{to address the issue of}} Hodgson's dangerousness, and Hodgson was remanded in custody. On 13May 2011 he was sentenced to a three-year community order. The judge said that the total of 156 days Hodgson had been remanded in custody prior to sentence would be taken into account, and told Hodgson he [...] "could walk free should he agree to complete a psychiatric order imposed by the court, but his barrister Martin Heslop QC, said his client 'clearly bears a great resentment against a criminal justice system which has deprived him of 27 years of liberty'" [...] and rejected the option.|$|E

He {{said it was}} [...] "ironic" [...] that Ravi's letter [...] "doesn't mention M.B. as if he doesn't exist", yet M.B. had in his letter offered {{to write a letter}} to help Ravi avoid deportation. Ravi declined the opportunity to speak at the sentencing hearing and was reprimanded by Judge Berman for not having publicly apologized: [...] "I heard this jury say guilty 288 times—24 questions, 12 jurors, that's the multiplication. And I haven't heard you apologize once." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} {{other forms of}} punishment which are commonly {{used in conjunction with}} or in place of prison terms. [...] Monetary fines are one of the oldest forms of punishment still used today. [...] These fines may be paid to the state or to the victims as a form of reparation. [...] Probation and house arrest are also sanctions which seek to limit a person's mobility and his or her opportunities to commit crimes without actually placing them in a prison setting. Furthermore, many jurisdictions may require some form of public or community service as a form of reparations for lesser offenses. [...] In Corrections, the Department ensures court-ordered, <b>pre-sentence</b> chemical dependency assessments, related Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative specific examinations and treatment will occur for offenders sentenced to Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative in compliance with RCW 9.94A.660.|$|E
50|$|That is {{justified}} by the quantitative and qualitative differences between pre-and post-sentencing incarceration. Most individuals who are incarcerated will not serve {{the full length of}} their sentence, and because time spent incarcerated <b>pre-sentence</b> does not count towards remission time, if a lengthy <b>pre-sentence</b> incarceration is credited equally to post-sentencing incarceration, the convicted individual will serve a longer sentence compared to an individual who is given the same sentence without a lengthy period of pre-sentencing incarceration. Arbour also points out that <b>pre-sentence</b> incarceration is typically served in detention, in harsher circumstances than the sentence will ultimately call for and without access to educational, rehabilitative and vocational programs.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, {{there were}} two {{assistant}} probation officers assigned to the adult division. They completed 334 <b>pre-sentence</b> reports, which included doing an entire social study on each case. They were responsible for 429 adult probationers by July 1943. Most of their time was spent preparing <b>pre-sentence</b> reports for the courts and collecting restitution from the probationers. Little time was left for supervision.|$|E

50|$|Where a {{court should}} {{normally}} obtain a <b>pre-sentence</b> report, it may dispense with this requirement if it considers it unnecessary to do so. In respect of offenders under 18, it may only dispense with the report if a current offence is triable on indictment or {{the court has}} had reference {{to the most recent}} previous <b>pre-sentence</b> report for the offender.|$|E
50|$|Before {{deciding}} on a sentence, a judge or magistrate may ask the London CRC {{to prepare a}} <b>pre-sentence</b> report to describe {{the circumstances of the}} crime and assess the risk the offender poses to the public. This report will propose a sentence but it is the court that makes the final decision. The London CRC prepares 34,000 <b>pre-sentence</b> reports for the courts every year.|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} of the court {{considering}} a community sentence or custody, it can order a <b>pre-sentence</b> report from the Probation Service. This will provide additional information about the defendant’s circumstances, the risk of re-offending and any personal issues likely to affect sentencing, e.g. a drug addiction. Psychiatric report may be ordered in appropriate cases. Short reports can be prepared on the day, otherwise the usual time for obtaining a <b>pre-sentence</b> report is three weeks.|$|E

50|$|Field Services is also {{responsible}} for conducting <b>Pre-Sentencing</b> Investigations. These investigations are requested by a court of law. It includes a thorough evaluation of the offender's criminal charge, a thorough review of the circumstances including interviews with affected parties, and a recommendation to sentencing judge.|$|R
50|$|Many {{districts have}} split their Probation Officers into <b>Pre-Sentence</b> Investigation Units and Supervision Units. <b>Pre-Sentence</b> Investigators conduct {{comprehensive}} {{investigations into the}} background of defendants convicted of federal crimes. Upon completion of their investigation, {{they are required to}} employ the sentencing guidelines and submit a sentencing recommendation to the presiding judge. Often, they are also asked to confer privately with judges regarding their recommendation. Officers assigned to Supervision Units supervise felons convicted of federal crimes who are released into society on either Supervised Release or Probation. Supervision Officers must enforce court ordered conditions and are mandated to use their discretion and skills to mitigate the offenders risk to society. Both Supervision Officers and <b>Pre-Sentence</b> Investigators deal {{with a wide range of}} offenders, many of whom have extensive criminal histories. Federal Probation Officers also represent the United States Department of Justice in the performance of duties connected with federal parole.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to managing offenders given community based sentences and offenders on parole, probation officers also provide information and reports to judges prior to sentencing - generally known as <b>pre-sentence</b> reports (or Provision of Information). PIO contain {{information about the}} offender's background, his history of compliance with previous sentences and recommendations for a particular sentence - although {{it is up to}} the judge to decide what sentence to impose. Probation provides the courts with about 260 such <b>pre-sentence</b> reports every month. Judges rarely comment on the quality of reports but in 2013, the Auckland Probation service was criticised by Judge Nevin Dawson for failing to follow his orders regarding a <b>pre-sentence</b> report. The judge said the report was [...] "extremely unhelpful" [...] because it recommended community service and ignored his order to consider home detention in the case of two young men who flashed a laser light at a police helicopter.|$|E
50|$|The {{work of the}} Board {{involves}} assessing convicted offenders, preparing <b>pre-sentence</b> {{reports for}} the courts, reports for parole commissioners and other justice-related bodies. The Board supervises over 4,000 court ordersat any given time.|$|E

50|$|Reports for {{sentencing}} {{hearings are}} used in more serious cases in order to assist in determining an appropriate sentence. The most frequently used report for sentencing hearings is the <b>pre-sentence</b> report which is outlined in section 40. The judge ultimately decides whether a report is necessary, though the crown may request the report and the defence counsel may argue against the issuing of a <b>pre-sentence</b> report. All custodial sentences require a pre-sentencing report. A pre-sentencing report is conducted by a government employee who interviews the youth and any significant influences including family members, peers and other important persons who may contribute to their report. This report is a historical outline which may include information regarding the youth’s family background, school history, attitude toward their offence, willingness to engage in available community services, interview with the victim and potentially a suggestive sentence. The <b>pre-sentence</b> report {{is given to the}} judge, prosecutor and defence lawyers as well as the youth and any involved parent or guardian before the sentencing hearing.|$|E
50|$|Other {{preconditions}} of a {{custodial sentence}} are that a <b>pre-sentence</b> report has been obtained (in most cases), and {{the defendant is}} legally represented or has been offered {{the opportunity to be}} represented and has refused.|$|E
