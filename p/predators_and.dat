5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against <b>predators</b> <b>and</b> as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against <b>predators</b> <b>and</b> nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|Frogs are primary <b>predators</b> <b>and</b> an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary <b>predators</b> <b>and</b> are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between <b>predators</b> <b>and</b> prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating <b>predators,</b> <b>and</b> where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E

40|$|Developing {{artificial}} behaviours {{to control}} artificial creatures or vehicles {{is a task}} that can be solved by means of Evolu-tionary Algorithms. The <b>Predator</b> <b>and</b> Prey is a problem where {{it is possible to}} evolve behaviours for both <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey, using artificial co-evolution: the predator must capture the prey and the prey must evade the <b>predator.</b> Both <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey have also different characteristics, the <b>predator</b> is faster <b>and</b> more agile and the prey is slower. This paper presents an alternative, using Genetic Program-ming with Decision Trees for evolving both <b>Predator</b> <b>and</b> Prey behaviours.

30|$|For {{developing}} the CML model, a two-dimensional rectangular lattice divided into n × n sites by space interval h is considered. Simultaneously, {{the time is}} divided {{into a series of}} slices with time interval τ. Parameters τ and h are the time scale and the space scale for describing the predator–prey dynamics, respectively. Since the growth, death, feeding, <b>and</b> migration of <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey individuals always occur periodically, the dynamics of a predator–prey system can be observed by a particular time scale, which can be defined by the generation span of the <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey populations and measures the regeneration time of both populations. On the other hand, the space scale on which spatial movements of <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey take place can be defined by maximum size of dwelling sites of <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey individuals.|$|R

40|$|In theory, predators should {{attempt to}} match the {{distribution}} of their prey, and prey to avoid areas of high predation risk. However, there is a scarcity of empirical knowledge on <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey spatial use when both are moving freely in their natural environment. In the current study, we use information collated on a predators' diet, its population structure, as well as <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey relative abundance, and track the movements of <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey simultaneously to compare habitat use and evaluate predation pressure. The {{study was conducted in}} elasmobranch protected areas of coastal Tasmania, Australia. The species considered were the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus, the apex predator in the area, and five chondrichthyan prey species. Notorynchus cepedianus and its prey show similar seasonality in the use of these coastal areas: more abundant in warmer months and absent in winter. <b>Predator</b> <b>and</b> prey also showed high spatial overlap and similar habitat use patterns. These similar movement patterns of <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey combined with the additional ecological information (diet, population structure of predator, relative abundance of <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey) suggests that N. cepedianus move into coastal areas to exploit seasonally abundant prey. Also, while in protected areas, chondrichthyans are subjected to high predation pressure. Overall, results illustrate the value of simultaneously recording and integrating multiple types of information to explore predator–prey relationships and predation pressure...|$|R

5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, <b>predators</b> <b>and</b> scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E

40|$|Predator–prey {{relationships}} are a central component of community dynamics. Classic approaches {{have tried to}} understand and predict these relationships in terms of consumptive interactions between <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey species, but characterizing the interaction this way is insufficient to predict the complexity and context dependency inherent in predator–prey relationships. Recent approaches have begun to explore predator–prey relationships {{in terms of an}} evolutionary-ecological game in which <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey adapt to each other through reciprocal interactions involving context-dependent expression of functional traits that influence their biomechanics. Functional traits are defined as any morphological, behavioral, or physiological trait of an organism associated with a biotic interaction. Such traits include <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey body size, <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey personality, <b>predator</b> hunting mode, prey mobility, prey anti-predator behavior, and prey physiological stress. Here, I discuss recent advances in this functional trait approach. Evidence shows that the nature and strength of many interactions are dependent upon the relative magnitude of <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey functional traits. Moreover, trait responses can be triggered by non-consumptive predator–prey interactions elicited by responses of prey to risk of predation. These interactions in turn can have dynamic feedbacks that can change the context of the predator–prey interaction, causing <b>predator</b> <b>and</b> prey to adapt their traits—through phenotypically plastic or rapid evolutionary responses—and the nature of their interaction. Research shows that examining predator–prey interactions through the lens of an adaptive evolutionary-ecological game offers a foundation to explain variety in the nature and strength of predator–prey interactions observed in different ecological contexts...|$|R

Theotima minutissima, a small spider species found in abundance in the Caribbean National Forest, is believed to be parthenogenetic, meaning that it reproduces without fertilization by a male.|$|E
