40|$|Interest {{in teacher}} {{evaluation}} is mainly {{motivated by a}} desire for selection. Given this motivation, {{it is unrealistic to}} think that an evaluation instrument will never result in others making summative decisions about teachers’ careers. This study applies the validity argument approach (Kane, 2006) to investigate the validity of <b>personal</b> <b>evaluations</b> obtained with a classroom observation instrument that presupposes sequential development in teaching skills. The study seeks support for two claims; (1) classroom observations of teaching acts show sequential ordering which may reflect sequential stages in teacher development; (2) implementation of this instrument within a pre-planned evaluation method, which prescribes three classroom observations by three different observers, can protect teachers against and inform teachers about bias in their <b>personal</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Using a cross-validation method, it is empirically shown that 26 of the 32 initial items fit all three Rasch assumptions. Results further indicate that most (i. e., 84. 2 %) of the <b>personal</b> <b>evaluations</b> have moderate fit with the theoretical sequential ordering, but that few (i. e., 36. 0 %) evaluations show good fit. Furthermore, increasing the number of classroom observations was found to considerably increase the validity of each <b>personal</b> <b>evaluation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To obtain {{feedback}} {{about the potential}} usefulness of a continuing professional development (CPD) portfolio for enhancing a faculty or practitioner’s scholarship {{of teaching and learning}} (SoTL). Method: A CPD portfolio approach to the SoTL was distributed in advance to registrants of the 2011 Annual AACP Teacher’s Seminar. In an interactive workshop, faculty facilitators described a model for a CPD process applied to the development of an individual’s SoTL. During the workshop, participants were asked to complete the initial sections of the portfolio to develop a personal plan for success in the SoTL. Post workshop, an <b>evaluation</b> <b>form</b> was distributed to the participants to obtain {{feedback about}} the CPD approach. Completed <b>evaluation</b> <b>forms</b> were collected, collated, and summarized. Results: A total of 53 (14. 1 %) workshop participants completed the <b>evaluation</b> <b>form</b> of the 375 attendees. In all, 25 assistant professors, 14 associate professors, 4 full professors, 10 residents/ students, 22 clinical, and 2 research faculty submitted evaluations. The proposed uses for the portfolio model selected most often by the responders were for <b>personal</b> development, faculty <b>evaluation,</b> increasing the SoTL, new faculty development, preceptor development, and residency training. Implications: A structured CPD portfolio model might be useful for the professional development of the SoTL...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to develop}} {{evaluation}} standards, indicators and criteria, and an <b>evaluation</b> <b>form</b> for professional experiential training of student teachers. It examines and incorporates related concepts, theories and studies as follows: 1) professional standards and indicators for Thai teachers, 2) professional standards and indicators for international teachers, 3) 21 st Century Skills, 4) concepts of formative assessment, and 5) concepts of professional learning communities. An <b>evaluation</b> <b>form</b> is then developed and validated, {{and according to}} the findings it is suggested that the evaluation standards for professional experiential training of student teachers consist of 3 standards, which are 1) teaching competency, 2) classroom action research competency, and 3) self-development for professional advancement, with a total of 32 indicators. This <b>evaluation</b> <b>form</b> is generated using 4 -level rubric scores for each indicator and 8 -level criteria for the evaluation. The content validity of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>form</b> is confirmed, and with the inclusion of 3 standards this <b>evaluation</b> <b>form</b> will be used by student teachers and supervisor/mentor teachers for professional experiential training...|$|R
