50|$|In {{spite of}} the other receptors cited as being {{responsive}} to CysLTs, CysLTR1 appears to be critical in mediating many of the pathological responses to CysLTs in humans. Montelukast, Zafirlukast, and <b>Pranlukast</b> are selective receptor antagonists for the CysLTR1 but not CysLTR2. These drugs are in use and/or shown to be effective as prophalaxis and chronic treatments for allergic and non-allergic diseases such as: allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma and rhinitis (see Aspirin-induced asthma); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see Acquired non-inflammatory myopathy#Diet and Trauma Induced Myopathy). However, responses to these lukast drugs vary greatly with the drugs showing fairly high rates of poor responses and ~20% of patients reporting no change in symptoms after treatment with these agents. It seems possible that the responses of CysLTR2, GPR99, or other receptors to CysLT's may be contributing to these diseases.|$|E
5000|$|The CysLT-induced {{activation}} of CysLTR2 induces {{many of the}} same in vitro responses of cells involved in allergic reactions as well as the in vivo allergic responses in animal models as that induced by CysLT-induced CysLTR1 (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Receptor. However, CysLT2 requires 10-fold higher concentrations of LTD4, the most potent cysLT for CysLTR1, to activate CysLTR2. Furthermore, the allergic and hypersensitivity responses of humans and animal models are significantly reduced by chronic treatment with Montelukast, Zafirlukast, and <b>Pranlukast,</b> drugs which are selective receptor antagonists of CysLTR1 but not CysLTR2. Models of allergic reactions in Cysltr2-deficient mice as well as in a human mast cell line indicate that mouse Cysltr2 and its human homolog CysLTR2 act to inhibit Cysltr1 and CysLTR1, respectively, and therefore suggest that CysLTR2 may similarly inhibit CysLTR1 in human allergic diseases. [...] The role of CysLTR2 in the allergic and hypersensitivity diseases of humans must await the development of selective CysLTR2 inhibitors.|$|E

In a comparative, randomized, double-blind, 4 -week multicenter trial, <b>pranlukast</b> dry syrup 7 mg/kg/day achieved significantly better final overall improvement (71. 4 %) versus oxatomide 1 mg/kg/day (37. 2 %) in pediatric patients older than one year with asthma. In two 12 -week, open-label trials and in a long-term open-label trial of treatment for up to 24 months, <b>pranlukast</b> dry syrup improved asthma control over baseline values. In a prospective post-marketing surveillance study and a long-term follow-up study, the safety and efficacy of <b>pranlukast</b> dry syrup was confirmed in infants younger than one year with bronchial asthma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Leukotriene {{receptor}} antagonists {{have been}} shown to protect against bronchoconstriction induced by antigens, exercise, and cold air. There are relatively few clinical studies reported in patients with asthma. The present study is the first clinical evaluation of <b>pranlukast</b> (SB 205312, ONO- 1078) outside Japan in patients with asthma. METHODS: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicentre four week study of the safety and tolerability of oral <b>pranlukast,</b> 225 or 337. 5 mg twice daily, was performed in patients with mild to moderate asthma. Preliminary efficacy data were obtained; the main efficacy variables evaluated were forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and morning domiciliary (home) peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR). Clinic PEFR and daytime and night-time asthma symptom scores were also recorded. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group the improvement in morning home PEFR was statistically significant at all time points for patients receiving <b>pranlukast</b> 337. 5 mg twice daily and at weeks 1 and 2 for those treated with <b>pranlukast</b> in a dose of 225 mg twice daily. Mean morning home PEFR increased by 10. 8 to 18. 61 /min (95 % CI 0. 2 to 29. 3 l/min) in patients treated with <b>pranlukast</b> compared with a slight deterioration in those given placebo. FEV 1 significantly increased within one hour after the first dose of <b>pranlukast</b> compared with baseline and this increase was maintained for eight hours. Improvements in trough FEV 1 -that is, {{at the end of the}} dosing interval- were statistically significant for the group treated with <b>pranlukast</b> 225 mg twice daily compared with placebo at week 4. Mean increases in FEV 1 ranged from 210 ml to 340 ml (95 % CI 60 to 500 ml) at trough in the <b>pranlukast</b> group. Patients treated with <b>pranlukast</b> also showed improvements in summary symptom and night-time asthma scores. <b>Pranlukast</b> was well tolerated, and no drug related changes in haematological and biochemical variables were observed. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pranlukast,</b> an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist, is well tolerated and is effective for the treatment of asthma. It increased FEV 1 within one hour of dosing, improved patient summary symptom and night-time asthma scores, and reduced the use of rescue bronchodilators, thus providing further evidence of a role for leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{increasing}} {{evidence to show}} that leukotrienes are important mediators in asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists protect against antigen and exercise challenges in patients with chronic asthma. A study was undertaken to investigate the activity of the leukotriene receptor antagonist <b>pranlukast</b> (SB 205312, ONO- 1078) in blocking bronchoconstriction induced by leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4) inhalation. The selectivity of <b>pranlukast</b> was evaluated using histamine challenge. METHODS: <b>Pranlukast,</b> 450 mg twice daily, was given to eight healthy non-smoking men for five days in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. The specific airways conductance (sGaw) was measured before and after bronchial provocation with inhaled LTD 4 at 3. 5 hours after the first dose and at 3. 5 and 9. 5 hours after the last dose of <b>pranlukast</b> on the morning of day 5. The concentration of LTD 4 required to produce a fall in sGaw of 35 % (PC 35) was calculated. Subjects also underwent a histamine challenge 3. 5 hours after a single dose of <b>pranlukast,</b> 450 mg, or placebo. RESULTS: A single dose of <b>pranlukast</b> produced a 10. 6 fold increase in PC 35 sGaw (95 % confidence interval (CI) 4. 4 to 25. 5; p < 0. 001) for LTD 4 at 3. 5 hours after dosing compared with placebo. Three and a half hours after the morning dose of <b>pranlukast</b> on day 5 the PC 35 sGaw for LTD 4 was increased 25. 9 fold (95 % CI 10. 8 to 62. 2; p < 0. 001) and was still increased sevenfold (95 % CI 2. 9 to 16. 7; p < 0. 001) relative to placebo 9. 5 hours after administration of the morning dose. No significant differences were noted for the PC 35 sGaw to histamine for <b>pranlukast</b> compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that <b>pranlukast</b> is a potent and selective LTD 4 receptor antagonist in humans which blocks LTD 4 challenge after initial and repeated administration when given twice daily for five days. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between the efficacy of 4 -weeks administration with <b>pranlukast,</b> leukotriene receptor antagonist, and LTs generation by peripheral leukocytes were evaluated in 18 patients with mild-persistent asthma. The efficacy of <b>pranlukast</b> administration was assessed by symptom, morning PEF and pulmonary function. <b>Pranlukast</b> were effective in 12 / 18 (67 %) patients. In those patients, LTC 4 generation before <b>pranlukast</b> administration was significantly high, compared with that in pranlukast-ineffective patients. LTC 4 generation decreased after 4 -weeks administration with <b>pranlukast</b> in effective patients. In ineffective patients, however, LTC 4 generation increased after 4 -weeks administration. LTB 4 had shown {{no significant difference between}} effective and ineffective patients before administration, and LTB 4 decreased after 4 -weeks in both groups. Proport ion of peripheral eosinophi Is in effective patients were higher than that in ineffective patients, however not significant. After 4 -weeks, proportion of eosinophi Is was decreased in effective patients and increased in ineffective patients. These findings suggest that <b>pranlukast</b> is effective for patients with high LTC 4 generation and has the effect to suppress the accumulation of eosinophils in such patients. 軽症気管支喘息 18 例にロイコトリエン受容体桔抗薬プランルカストを 4 週間投与し，その効果と末梢血白血球からのLTC 4 ，LTB 4 産生能の関係を検討した．プランルカストの効果は臨床症状，起床時ピークフロー値，肺機能の変化によって判定し，効果群，非効果群の 2 群に分類した． 18 例中 12 例（ 67 ％）の症例がプランルカスト投与により，臨床症状の軽減，ピークフロー値の増加，肺機能の改善が認められた．効果群におけるプランルカスト投与前のLTC 4 値は，非効果群のLTC 4 値に比較して有意に高値であった． 4 週間の投与後には 効果群ではLTC 4 値は減少し，非効果群では増加した．両群のLTB 4 値はプランルカスト投与前で有意な差は認められず，投与後には両群で減少した．投与前の好酸球分画は，効果群において非効果群に比べ高値であったが，有意な差は認められなかった． 4 週間の投与後，効果群においては好酸球は減少し，非効果群においては増加した．以上の結果より，プランルカストは末梢血白血球のLTC 4 産生能が高い症例において効果的であり，好酸球集積を抑制する作用を有すると考えられる...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background GPR 17 is {{a hybrid}} G-protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) activated by two unrelated ligand families, extracellular nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cysteinyl-LTs), {{and involved in}} brain damage and repair. Its exploitment as a target for novel neuro-reparative strategies depends on the elucidation of the molecular determinants driving binding of purinergic and leukotrienic ligands. Here, we applied docking and molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to analyse the binding and the forced unbinding of two GPR 17 ligands (the endogenous purinergic agonist UDP and the leukotriene receptor antagonist <b>pranlukast</b> from both the wild-type (WT) receptor and a mutant model, where a basic residue hypothesized to be crucial for nucleotide binding had been mutated (R 255 I) to Ile. Results MD suggested that GPR 17 nucleotide binding pocket is enclosed between the helical bundle and extracellular loop (EL) 2. The driving interaction involves R 255 and the UDP phosphate moiety. To support this hypothesis, steered MD experiments showed that the energy required to unbind UDP is higher for the WT receptor than for R 255 I. Three potential binding sites for <b>pranlukast</b> where instead found and analysed. In one of its preferential docking conformations, <b>pranlukast</b> tetrazole group is close to R 255 and phenyl rings are placed into a subpocket highly conserved among GPCRs. Pulling forces developed to break polar and aromatic interactions of <b>pranlukast</b> were comparable. No differences between the WT receptor and the R 255 I receptor were found for the unbinding of <b>pranlukast.</b> Conclusions These data thus suggest that, in contrast to which has been hypothesized for nucleotides, the lack of the R 255 residue doesn't affect the binding of <b>pranlukast</b> a crucial role for R 255 in binding of nucleotides to GPR 17.

40|$|SummaryBackgoundThe {{importance}} of airway inflammation has been highlighted in the pathophysiology of asthma. Even in controlled asthmatics treated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), residual airway inflammation is reported. Systemic therapy with oral leukotriene receptor antagonist, <b>pranlukast,</b> may have additive effects to improve asthma control. MethodsTwenty-five controlled asthmatics treated with ICS or ICS plus long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) were enrolled for a randomized crossover trial evaluating {{the effect of}} additional oral <b>pranlukast.</b> The patients were assigned to two groups receiving ICS (+LABA) or ICS (+LABA)  + pranlukast for 8 weeks. After washout period, two groups were switched over for another 8 weeks. Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), lung function tests, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and asthma control test (ACT) were evaluated {{at the beginning and}} end of each period. Central airway NO flux (J’awNO) and peripheral airway/alveolar NO concentration (CANO) were measured and adjusted for axial NO back-diffusion. ResultsFEV 1, % predicted, forced expired flow (FEF) 25 – 75, % predicted, morning PEF and ACT were significantly increased after the addition of <b>pranlukast.</b> Oral <b>pranlukast</b> administration significantly decreased both CANO and corrected CANO. ConclusionsThe addition of oral <b>pranlukast</b> to ICS or ICS + LABA therapy may improve asthma control with reducing distal airway inflammation. Trial registration: UMIN 000003781...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Pranlukast</b> and Montelukast are Cysteinyl {{leukotriene}} receptor antagonists {{with almost}} the same pharmacological activity. However, I will describe {{a case in which}} these drugs showed different therapeutic effects on clinical symptoms during the daytime and eosinophilic inflammation in the peripheral airway. Methods: A 70 -year-old male patient with non-atopic bronchial asthma who was treated with 400 μg/day of Budesonide Turbuhaler® (BUD-TH) changed from <b>Pranlukast</b> (225 mg, twice daily) to Montelukast (10 mg, one tablet before sleeping), resulting in worsening clinical symptoms consisting of sputum and cough in the daytime, mainly at lunch time. Due {{to the fact that the}} symptoms did not improve sufficiently, instead of increasing the dose of BUD-TH, we investigated the clinical symptoms and pulmonary functions as well as measured the mean eosinophil count, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eotaxin in the hypertonic saline-induced sputum prior to administration of <b>Pranlukast,</b> and 4 and 8 weeks after the re-administration of <b>Pranlukast</b> from Montelukast. Results: Following the re-administration of <b>Pranlukast,</b> the clinical symptoms disappeared within a few days and pulmonary function improved within 4 weeks. Eosinophils in the induced sputum almost completely disappeared for 4 weeks. The sputum ECP and eotaxin before and 4 weeks after the re-administration of <b>Pranlukast</b> changed from 700 μg/l to 192 μg/l, and 69. 9 pg/ml to 30. 6 pg/ml, respectively. After 8 weeks, no sputum induction was found. Conclusions: The clinical difference between these two similar antagonists may be caused by the time difference relating to when and how often each drug is administered, suggesting the existence of the lunchtime dip...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundThis is {{the first}} report about the {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) of <b>pranlukast</b> in children. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the PK parameters of <b>pranlukast</b> in children and to compare them with those in adults. MethodsSix healthy adult male volunteers and 22 children with bronchial asthma at 3 – 14 years of age were enrolled in the study. Both 225 and 112. 5 mg <b>pranlukast</b> hydrate dry syrup was administered orally to adults, whereas 3. 5 mg/kg <b>pranlukast</b> hydrate dry syrup was given to children. Blood samples were obtained at approximately 20 time points per adult (n= 121) and at two or three time points per child (n= 54). Population PK analysis was performed using NONMEM (Globomax, Hanover, MD, USA). The concentration-time-course of <b>pranlukast</b> was described by using a one-compartment model with first-order absorption. The robustness of the final model was evaluated using 200 bootstrap samples. ResultsApparent clearance (CL/F) was 1. 81 and 1. 14 L/h per kg in children and adults, respectively. According to subgrouping of children, no significant difference was observed in CL/F between infants (3 – 6 years of age) and schoolchildren (7 – 14 years of age). The interindividual variability of CL/F accounted for 48. 7 %. The additive and proportional residual variability was 7. 33 ng/mL and 73. 8 %, respectively. All fixed effect parameters fell within 10 % of the bootstrapped mean. ConclusionsCompared with adults, children showed a higher CL/F and more rapid elimination after ingestion of <b>pranlukast</b> hydrate dry syrup. However, no significant variation was seen in CL/F between infants and schoolchildren...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little is {{understood}} about the additive effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) on asthmatics currently medicated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta(2) -agonists (LABA). OBJECTIVES: The present study examines the anti-inflammatory {{effects of the}} LTRA <b>pranlukast</b> in addition to ICS and LABA, among asthmatic patients with normal pulmonary function and unremarkable clinical symptoms. METHODS: Fifteen adult asthmatics participated in a 2 -month, open-label, uncontrolled, prospective, multicenter, observational trial. Patients stabilized (predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s > 80 %) by medication with ICS and LABA were also given <b>pranlukast</b> (450 mg daily). Asthma-related symptoms, pulmonary function, blood eosinophil counts and several inflammatory markers in sputum were monitored at week 0, {{as well as at}} 4 and 8 weeks after starting therapy with <b>pranlukast.</b> RESULTS: Adding <b>pranlukast</b> did not further improve blood eosinophil counts, pulmonary function and symptoms, but significantly attenuated sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 5 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical relevance remains obscure, adding an LTRA attenuates allergic airway inflammation in some asthmatics undergoing treatment with ICS and LABA...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the inhibitory {{effects of the}} cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT 1) receptor antagonists, <b>pranlukast</b> and zafirlukast, on 35 SO 4 labelled mucus output, in vitro, in guinea-pig trachea, induced by leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4) or by antigen challenge of sensitized animals. Agonists and antagonists were administered mucosally, except in selected comparative experiments where drugs were administered both mucosally and serosally to assess {{the influence of the}} epithelium on evoked-secretion. LTD 4 increased 35 SO 4 output in a concentration-related manner with a maximal increase of 23 fold above controls at 100 [*]μM and an approximate EC 50 of 2 [*]μM. Combined mucosal and serosal addition of LTD 4 did not significantly affect the secretory response compared with mucosal addition alone. Neither LTC 4 nor LTE 4 (10 [*]μM each) affected 35 SO 4 output. <b>Pranlukast</b> or zafirlukast significantly inhibited 10 [*]μM LTD 4 -evoked 35 SO 4 output in a concentration-dependent fashion, with maximal inhibitions of 83 % at 10 [*]μM <b>pranlukast</b> and 78 % at 10 [*]μM zafirlukast, and IC 50 values of 0. 3 [*]μM for <b>pranlukast</b> and 0. 6 [*]μM for zafirlukast. Combined mucosal and serosal administration of the antagonists (5 [*]μM each) gave degrees of inhibition of mucosal-serosal 10 [*]μM LTD 4 -evoked 35 SO 4 output {{similar to those of the}} drugs given mucosally. <b>Pranlukast</b> (0. 5 [*]μM) caused a parallel rightward shift of the LTD 4 concentration-response curve with a pKB of 7. <b>Pranlukast</b> did not inhibit ATP-induced 35 SO 4 output. Ovalbumin (10 – 500 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) challenge of tracheae from guinea-pigs actively sensitized with ovalbumin caused a concentration-related increase in 35 SO 4 output with a maximal increase of 20 fold above vehicle controls at 200 [*]μg[*]ml− 1. The combination of the antihistamines pyrilamine and cimetidine (0. 1 [*]mM each) did not inhibit ovalbumin-induced 35 SO 4 output in sensitized guinea-pigs. Neither mucosal (10 [*]μM or 100 [*]μM) nor mucosal-serosal (100 [*]μM) histamine had any significant effect on 35 SO 4 output. <b>Pranlukast</b> or zafirlukast (5 [*]μM each) significantly suppressed ovalbumin-induced secretion in tracheae from sensitized guinea-pigs by 70 % and 65 %, respectively. We conclude that LTD 4 or ovalbumin challenge of sensitized animals provokes mucus secretion from guinea-pig trachea in vitro and this effect is inhibited by the CysLT 1 receptor antagonists <b>pranlukast</b> and zafirlukast. These antagonists may be beneficial in the treatment of allergic airway diseases in which mucus hypersecretion is a clinical symptom, for example asthma and allergic rhinitis...|$|E
40|$|Several {{cases of}} eosinophilic {{conditions}} including Churg-Strauss syndrome {{have been reported}} in association with the use of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists, including zafirlukast, montelukast, and <b>pranlukast,</b> in asthmatic patients.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies showed that}} cysteinyl leukotrienes receptor 1 (CysLT 1 R) is upregulated in amyloid-β (Aβ) -induced neurotoxicity and that administration of CysLT 1 R antagonists such as <b>pranlukast</b> or montelukast can ameliorate memory impairment in mice. In the current study, we sought to explore the role of CysLT 1 R in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ-ICV) -induced mouse model of memory impairment and neuroinflammation through shRNA-mediated knockdown of CysLT 1 R and also its pharmacological blockade by <b>pranlukast.</b> ICR mice were infused with STZ (3. 0  mg/kg) by a single bilateral stereotaxic ICV microinjection followed by administration of CysLT 1 R-shRNA (intra-hippocampal) or <b>pranlukast</b> (intragastric, IG). After 21  days, a set of behavioral and biochemical tests were performed {{in order to assess}} the degree of memory impairment and neuroinflammation in mice. STZ-infused mice spent less time in the target quadrant of Morris water maze test and took more time to find the shock-free arm in modified Y-maze test, which were rescued in the CysLT 1 R-knockdowned or pranlukast-treated mice. STZ-induced memory impairment was also accompanied by an elevated level of hippocampal CysLT 1 R, microglial activation, increased IL- 1 β, and TNF-α. Such elevation of these factors was found to be mediated through the classical NF-κB pathway and administration of CysLT 1 R-shRNA or <b>pranlukast</b> for 21  days reversed all these parameters, suggesting a role of CysLT 1 R in STZ-induced memory deficit and neuroinflammation.

40|$|Asthma is {{characterized}} by chronic airway inflammation and the recruitment of inflammatory cells, typically eosinophils and lymphocytes, into the airway. Although several chemical mediators are released during the inflammatory process of asthma, evidence strongly suggests that the cysteinyl leukotrienes (LT), LTC 4, LTD 4, and LTE 4, play key roles in asthma. The short-term clinical efficacy of an LT receptor antagonist, <b>pranlukast</b> hydrate, in symptomatic patients with asthma who had already been treated with moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids was therefore investigated. Treatment with <b>pranlukast</b> hydrate for 4 weeks significantly improved respiratory function and decreased asthma symptoms, the rescue use of inhaled β 2 -agonists, the number of peripheral blood eosinophils and serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein. Furthermore, airway inflammation, as evaluated by the percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum and airway responsiveness to histamine, decreased significantly after treatment. There were no significant changes in these parameters in control patients with asthma whose treatment was not changed over 4 weeks. These preliminary results suggest that <b>pranlukast</b> hydrate, an LT receptor antagonist, is an effective agent {{in the management of}} asthma in combination with moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids...|$|E
40|$|Airway {{smooth muscle}} {{thickening}} is a characteristic feature of airway wall remodelling in chronic asthma. We {{have investigated the}} role of the leukotrienes in airway smooth muscle (ASM) and epithelial cell DNA synthesis and ASM thickening following repeated allergen exposure in Brown Norway rats sensitized to ovalbumin. There was a 3 fold increase in ASM cell DNA synthesis, as measured by percentage bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, in repeatedly ovalbumin-exposed (4. 1 %, 3. 6 – 4. 6; mean, 95 % c. i.) compared to chronically saline-exposed rats (1. 3 %, 0. 6 – 2. 1; P< 0. 001). Treatment with a 5 -lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitor (SB 210661, 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.) and a specific cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT 1) receptor antagonist, <b>pranlukast</b> (SB 205312, 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.), both attenuated ASM cell DNA synthesis. Treatment with a specific leukotriene B 4 (BLT) receptor antagonist (SB 201146, 15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.) had no effect. There was also a significant, 2 fold {{increase in the number of}} epithelial cells incorporating BrdU per unit length of basement membrane after repeated allergen exposure. This response was not inhibited by treatment with SB 210661, <b>pranlukast</b> or SB 201146. A significant increase in ASM thickness was identified following repeated allergen exposure and this response was attenuated significantly by SB 210661, <b>pranlukast</b> and SB 201146. Rats exposed to chronic allergen exhibited bronchial hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine and had significant eosinophil recruitment into the lungs. Treatment with SB 210661, <b>pranlukast</b> or SB 201146 significantly attenuated eosinophil recruitment into the lungs, whilst having no significant effect on airway hyperresponsiveness.

40|$|Background: Cysteinyl {{leukotriene}} (CysLT) {{is one of}} the proinflammatory mediators {{released by}} the bronchi during inflammation. CysLTs exert their biological effects via specific G-protein-coupled receptors. CysLT 1 receptor antagonists are available for clinical use for the treatment of asthma. Recently, crosstalk between CysLT 1 and P 2 Y 6 receptors has been delineated. P 2 Y receptors are expressed in apical and/or basolateral membranes of virtually all polarized epithelia to control the transport of fluid and electrolytes. Previous research suggests that CysLT 1 receptor antagonists inhibit the effects of nucleotides acting at P 2 Y receptors. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition remains unresolved. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, western blot analysis confirmed that both CysLT 1 and P 2 Y 6 receptors were expressed in the human bronchial epithelial cell line 16 HBE 14 o-. All three CysLT 1 antagonists inhibited the uridine diphosphate (UDP) -evoked I SC, but only montelukast inhibited the UDP-evoked [Ca 2 +] i increase. In the presence of forskolin or 8 -bromoadenosine 3 ’ 5 ’ cyclic monophosphate (8 -Br-cAMP), the UDP-induced ISC was potentiated but was reduced by <b>pranlukast</b> and zafirlukast but not montelukast. <b>Pranlukast</b> inhibited the UDP-evoked ISC potentiated by an Epac activator, 8 -(4 -Chlorophenylthio) - 29 -O-methyladenosine- 39, 59 -cyclic monophosphate (8 -CPT- 29 -O-Me-cAMP), while montelukast and zafirlukast had no such effect. <b>Pranlukast</b> inhibited the real-time increase in cAMP changes activated by 8 -CPT- 29 -O-MecAM...|$|E

40|$|Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) are {{produced}} predominantly by {{cells of the}} innate immune system, especially basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and monocytes/macrophages. Notwithstanding potent bronchoconstrictor activity, cysLTs are also proinflammatory consequent to their autocrine and paracrine interactions with G-protein-coupled receptors expressed {{not only on the}} aforementioned cell types, but also on Th 2 lymphocytes, as well as structural cells, {{and to a lesser extent}} neutrophils and CD 8 + cells. Recognition of the involvement of cysLTs in the immunopathogenesis of various types of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, especially bronchial asthma, prompted the development of selective cysLT receptor- 1 (cysLTR 1) antagonists, specifically montelukast, <b>pranlukast,</b> and zafirlukast. More recently these agents have also been reported to possess secondary anti-inflammatory activities, distinct from cysLTR 1 antagonism, which appear to be particularly effective in targeting neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. Underlying mechanisms include interference with cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, 5 ′-lipoxygenase, and the proinflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B. These and other secondary anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the commonly used cysLTR 1 antagonists are the major focus of the current review, which also includes a comparison of the anti-inflammatory effects of montelukast, <b>pranlukast,</b> and zafirlukast on human neutrophils in vitro, as well as an overview of both the current clinical applications of these agents and potential future applications based on preclinical and early clinical studies.
