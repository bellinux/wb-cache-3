25|$|In animals, {{biosynthesis}} of melatonin occurs through hydroxylation, decarboxylation, acetylation and a methylation {{starting with}} L-tryptophan. L-tryptophan {{is produced in}} the shikimate pathway from chorismate or is acquired from <b>protein</b> <b>catabolism.</b> First L-tryptophan is hydroxylated on the indole ring by tryptophan hydroxylase to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan.

Serotonin is itself an important neurotransmitter, but is also converted into N-acetylserotonin by serotonin N-acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA. Hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine convert N-acetylserotonin into melatonin through methylation of the hydroxyl group.|$|E
25|$|Arginine is a conditionally {{essential}} amino acid in humans and rodents, {{as it may be}} required depending on the health status or life cycle of the individual. For example, while healthy adults can supply their own requirement for arginine, immature and rapidly growing individuals require arginine in their diet, and it is also essential under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury and sepsis, or when the small intestine and kidneys, which are the major sites of arginine biosynthesis have been damaged. It is, however, an {{essential amino acid}} for birds, as {{they do not have a}} urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient <b>protein</b> <b>catabolism</b> produces large quantities of ammonia which needs to be processed through the urea cycle, and if there is not enough arginine present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the biochemical alterations of the energetic metabolism of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes in vitro exposed to different concentrations of benzinidazole. Methods: Biochemical {{analyses were performed}} at 3, 6 (log phase), 9 and 12 (stationary phase) days of culture. Parasites were exposed to five concentrations of benzinidazole. Glycolysis, tricarboxilic acid cycle and fatty acids oxidation pathways were quantified through chromatography. Glucose, urea and creatinine were quantified through spectrophotometric analysis. Results: Anaerobic fermentation and fatty acids oxidation were increased in the stationary phase of the culture. Benzinidazole at high concentrations induced anaerobic metabolism in the log phase of the culture while the parasites exposed to the lower concentrations preferred the citric acid cycle as energy production pathway. Benzinidazole did not influence on the <b>proteins</b> <b>catabolism.</b> Conclusions: It is possible to conclude that there are metabolic differences between evolutive forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and the main drug used for its treatment induces the anaerobic metabolism in the parasite, possibly impairing the mitochondrial pathways. ...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{metabolism}} and excretion during fish {{development is a}} critical aspect of early physiology because the major fuel source in most species is obtained endogenously through absorption of yolk <b>proteins.</b> <b>Catabolism</b> of <b>proteins</b> and amino acids results {{in the formation of}} ammonia, a potentially toxic nitrogenous end-product that must be either eliminated or modified to prevent damage to the developing embryo. Alternatively, if ammonia is sequestered or retained, this may occur in a compartment separate from the developing organs (eg., yolk sac). Nitrogen excretion during early life stages is not static but is influenced by developmental stage, environmental conditions, and in some cases, maternal factors. The physical properties of the embryo influence the rate of nitrogen elimination to the external environment.

This requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop, and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb.

To understand its energy saving strategies to respond to food shortages, we assessed protein and energy metabolisms associated with wintering torpor expression or summering torpor avoidance. We investigated body composition, whole body protein turnover, and daily energy expenditure (DEE), during a graded (40 and 80 %) 35 -day CR in short-days (winter; SD 40 and SD 80, respectively) and long-days (summer; LD 40 and LD 80, respectively) acclimated animals.
