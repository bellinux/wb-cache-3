5|$|Having {{performed}} in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging <b>puppet</b> shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well received {{that she and}} her husband were invited to create a children's <b>puppet</b> theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She and her husband are known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving from place to place with their traveling <b>puppet</b> theater.|$|E

5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton <b>puppet</b> that took {{three months and}} {{half a million dollars}} to construct. While filming the movie, the <b>puppet</b> had its own makeup artist. The <b>puppet</b> {{required}} three puppeteers to operate, {{making it one of the}} largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the <b>puppet,</b> while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control.|$|E

The subject matter is derived mainly from children's stories and fables.|$|R

5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey <b>puppet</b> called Falzouille, in which the <b>puppet</b> never speaks. He talks about how the <b>puppet</b> is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E

40|$|The diploma paper titled "Children in co-existence with puppets" {{presents}} <b>puppets</b> as helpers, {{friends and}} stimulators; <b>puppets</b> that through different activities within a second age-group {{of children in}} {{a certain period of}} time made a significant contribution towards socialization and communication. The <b>puppets</b> helped children to meet their friends by enabling them to approach and connect with each other faster. Children defeated fears and obstacles excluding them from social integration. Since the <b>puppets</b> so easily became a part of our every day life I found the title "Children in co-existence with puppets" to be appropriate. It was the <b>puppets</b> that we were breathing with ever since the moment of their creation and animation - we gave life to them and took them for our own. The <b>puppets</b> helped us through every step of the way, encouraging us to undertake even greater challenges. The first part of the paper underlines the significance of games and <b>puppets</b> on one hand and elaborates on the issue of one <b>puppet's</b> influence on emotional, social and cognitive development of children on the other hand. The second part of the paper offers insight into project work with <b>puppets</b> - a "pet puppet" and other <b>puppets</b> helped children to socialize and communicate. ...|$|R
