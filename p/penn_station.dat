5|$|Newark <b>Penn</b> <b>Station,</b> {{situated}} {{just east}} of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served by the interurban PATH train (which links Newark to Jersey City and Manhattan), three NJ Transit (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak service. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark <b>Penn</b> <b>Station</b> to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built {{in the bed of}} the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark. Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, CoachUSA contract operators and DeCamp in North Newark.|$|E
5|$|To promote public transportation, NJT and PATH {{would offer}} more {{frequent}} peak hour train services to Newark, Hoboken and Jersey City on the Hudson Waterfront, and Manhattan. NJT would {{add a new}} bus route for peak hour service between Watchung and Newark <b>Penn</b> <b>Station,</b> along the US22 corridor, and their bus schedules would accommodate additional passengers on existing routes.|$|E
5|$|Tremors were felt {{to varying}} degrees {{throughout}} New York State, including by people in some buildings in Manhattan. Physical damage occurred in Brooklyn, where a chimney in Red Hook was toppled. There were some disruptions, including building evacuations and delays at airports. Amtrak train service at <b>Penn</b> <b>Station</b> was also delayed.|$|E
5000|$|Penns {{is located}} at [...] south of Artesia on U.S. Route 45. According to the United States Geological Survey, variant names are <b>Penns</b> <b>Station</b> and <b>Penn.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1879, <b>Penns</b> railway <b>station</b> was {{constructed}} by the Midland Railway Company and despite being located in Walmley, it was named after Penns.|$|R
5000|$|With the 1968 {{merger of}} the PRR into Penn Central, {{several of the}} Pennsylvania Stations were renamed on June 6 to <b>Penn</b> Central <b>Station.</b> Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Station-30th Street became Penn Central Station-30th Street, while Baltimore's Pennsylvania Station, Michigan Central Station in Detroit, Michigan, New York Central Railroad's (NYC) Buffalo Central Station, and Pittsburgh's Pennsylvania <b>Station</b> became simply <b>Penn</b> Central <b>Station.</b> The {{stations}} in New York City and Newark, New Jersey kept the old name, [...] "Penn Station", the former because Penn Central also operated Grand Central Terminal.|$|R
5|$|Amtrak's February 2011 {{announcement}} of the Gateway Project includes a proposal to extend the 7 service three blocks east of Eleventh Avenue to New York <b>Penn</b> <b>Station,</b> instead of five miles west to Secaucus. Gateway, under auspices of Amtrak, would include a high-speed rail right-of way from Newark Penn to New York Penn and provide more capacity on New Jersey Transit rail operations. Congress allocated $15 million for studies for the project in November 2011, with {{the likelihood that the}} two projects, Gateway and the subway extension, will be in competition for funding.|$|E
5|$|Newark {{is served}} by NJ Transit bus routes 1, 5, 11, 13, 21, 25, 27, 28, 29, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 59, 62, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 90, 92, 93, 94, 96, 99, 107, and 108. Bus route 308 is an express bus route to Six Flags Great Adventure from Newark <b>Penn</b> <b>Station</b> while 319 is an express service to Atlantic City.|$|E
5|$|Past US 40, {{the route}} heads {{away from the}} {{downtown}} area and passes more rowhomes. It comes to an interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway) and crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line adjacent to <b>Penn</b> <b>Station</b> serving Amtrak and MARC's Penn Line. Past the train station, MD 2 intersects the southern terminus of MD 25, which follows a one-way pair along eastbound Lanvale Street (carrying the southbound direction) and westbound Lafayette Avenue (carrying the northbound direction), before it comes to its northern terminus at US 1 and US 40 Truck (North Avenue).|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} NYCRR {{stations}} in New York City, the <b>station</b> became a <b>Penn</b> Central <b>station</b> once the NYC & Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. The New Haven Line and its branches would be acquired by Penn Central a year later, thus {{making it a}} full <b>Penn</b> Central <b>station.</b> <b>Penn</b> Central's continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. After the 138th Street in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx was closed by Penn Central in 1972, 125th Street Station was the northernmost station to be shared by the Hudson and Harlem Lines. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually {{became part of the}} MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983.|$|R
50|$|<b>Penns</b> railway <b>station</b> was {{a railway}} station, since demolished, that served {{the area of}} Walmley in Sutton Coldfield when {{it was in the}} {{historic}} county of Warwickshire, now the West Midlands.|$|R

5|$|Route 21 heads {{north from}} the Newark Airport Interchange with U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 22 in Newark near the Newark Liberty International Airport on the six-lane, divided McCarter Highway. This portion of Route 21 serves to connect Newark Liberty with {{downtown}} Newark. The route interchanges with Interstate 78 and then crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line on a viaduct, {{coming to an}} interchange with Broad Street that provides access to Route 27. The route continues north, paralleling the elevated Northeast Corridor tracks that lead up to Newark <b>Penn</b> <b>Station,</b> which serves Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. At the Emmet Street intersection, Route 21 becomes a four-lane, undivided road and intersects Murray Street, which provides access to the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark. This section of Route 21 through {{the southern part of}} Newark has a high accident rate due to the heavy concentration of businesses and traffic lights along this portion of road. The road widens to six lanes and the route intersects County Route 510 (Market Street) near Newark <b>Penn</b> <b>Station</b> and continues north into downtown Newark, splitting from the Northeast Corridor rail line. It crosses Raymond Boulevard and the route meets County Route 508 (Center Street), with which it forms a concurrency.|$|E
5|$|This {{extension}} {{extended service}} {{to the end of}} Lower Manhattan and into Brooklyn, relieving crowding on the East Side Line, while opening up service to new areas. The Pennsylvania Railroad's new hub in Manhattan, <b>Penn</b> <b>Station,</b> could now be accessed by the subway. Additionally, Manhattan's West Side was rebuilt {{with the arrival of the}} line. To allow the wide four-track line to go through the area, new streets had to be mapped and built, and new buildings were constructed as a result. And finally, capacity on the IRT's subway system doubled, increasing its usage.|$|E
5|$|Foundation {{construction}} {{began in}} May 1896. However, work was stopped when Roberts took ill in August; he died the next January. The Panic of 1896 led Roberts' successor, Frank Thomson, not to continue work. When Thomson died in 1899, Alexander Cassatt was recalled to the PRR {{to serve as}} president. Cassatt immediately began a major capital improvement program, which included both adding capacity to mainlines and constructing large stations including Washington Union Station and New York <b>Penn</b> <b>Station.</b> Work resumed in 1900 with an enlarged floor plan, and the new station was complete in April 1901.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 {{transformed}} the <b>station</b> into a <b>Penn</b> Central Railroad <b>station.</b> <b>Penn</b> Central's continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which made it part of Metro-North in 1983.|$|R

5|$|In January 1983, Consolidated Rail Corporation {{handed over}} {{operation}} of the commuter railroads to New Jersey Transit Rail Operations. On September 20, 2002, {{as part of the}} Montclair Connection, merging the Montclair Branch and Boonton Line, the Arlington station in Kearny was closed, resulting in the lack of a station in Kearny. As a result, a rail shuttle bus was created by the town of Kearny to bus passengers from Arlington station up to Kingsland via Route 76 bus route, giving rail passenger service to New York <b>Penn</b> <b>Station</b> and Hoboken Terminal. Shuttle buses were aligned at that time with the 5:02 AM, 6:03 PM and 7:08 PM. Services were adjusted for the timetable services on September 30, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Jack and Liz {{decide to}} {{exchange}} gifts for Christmas. Meanwhile, Jack reconnects {{with a friend}} from high school, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), and ponders the possibility of romance as Nancy's marriage is falling apart. When Liz ends up buying an expensive necktie that Jack already owns, they agree to spend zero dollars on their gifts. Jack gets Liz a program from her performance of The Crucible framed in wood from her high school stage — and does not reimburse his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) for fuel costs. In return, Liz calls in a bomb threat to <b>Penn</b> <b>Station,</b> keeping Nancy in New York, and finally Jack arranges for Liz to fulfill her dream of meeting Larry Wilcox as Officer Jon Baker from the show CHiPs.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} no passenger train operation in Teaneck, train service is available across the Hackensack River at the New Bridge Landing station in River Edge and at the Anderson Street station in Hackensack. NJTransit's Pascack Valley Line runs north-south to Hoboken Terminal, with connections to the PATH train from the Hoboken PATH station, and with NJT connecting service to <b>Penn</b> <b>Station</b> in Midtown Manhattan via the Secaucus Junction transfer station. At Hoboken Terminal, connections are also available to NY Waterway ferry service (to the World Financial Center and other destinations) and to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system (serving locations along the Hudson River in Hudson County).|$|E

Gothic architecture {{can be found at}} the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart by Branch Brook Park, which is one of the largest gothic cathedrals in the United States. It is rumored to have as much stained glass as the Cathedral of Chartres. Newark also has two public sculpture works by Gutzon Borglum—Wars of America in Military Park and Seated Lincoln in front of the Essex County Courthouse. Moorish Revival buildings include Newark Symphony Hall and the Prince Street Synagogue, one of the oldest synagogue buildings in New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|In July 1764 a ferry began {{operating}} from Paulus Hook to Mesier's dock which was {{located at the}} foot of Courtland Street (where Cortland Street Ferry Depot would be built) and where Battery Park City Ferry Terminal is located today. Paulus Hook subsequently became a major road and rail head for traffic along the Northeast Corridor and in 1836 a railroad station linking the area to Newark was opened. The Jersey City Ferry, as the original ferry became known, and later the Desbrosses Street Ferry and a ferry to West 34th Street in Manhattan would open and serve the Pennsylvania Railroad's Exchange Place Station. During the mid-20th century the Pennsylvania Railroad's operations shifted to Newark and New York <b>Penn</b> <b>stations</b> and ferry services to Manhattan were discontinued.|$|R
