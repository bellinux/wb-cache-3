The subject matter of this research report is inextricably intertwined with the biographical details <b>provided</b> <b>hereunder,</b> because the author’s argument about culture are inextricably intertwined with his experience.

The thesis analyses the inherent weaknesses of the established regime focusing inter alia on the common principle of aut dedere aut judicaré, the imperfection of the obligation to extradite, the normative status of the political offence exception and the influence of human rights principles. The study illustrates that although in formal terms the international accomplishments are considerable the analysed treaties have been inefficacious in obtaining their expressed aims of preventing and punishing international terrorism, and that their practical application has been negligible. The thesis, nevertheless, concludes that the established system represents the highest attainable level of international criminal co-operation since the lack of common values prevent more effective transnational co-operation...|$|E
