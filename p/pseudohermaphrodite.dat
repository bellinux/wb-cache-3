50|$|Through {{questioning}} science Anne Fausto-Sterling {{came up with}} {{alternatives to}} the concept of having only two sexes, male and female.

40|$|Gonadally intact pseudohermaphrodiric {{female and}} normal female and neonatally {{castrated}} male rhesus monkeys were given estrogen treatment as adults and evaluated for attractivity, pro-ceptivity, and receptivity during rests with a tethered stud male. <b>Pseudohermaphrodites</b> were produced by injecting their mothers during pregnancy with either testosterone propionate (TP) or dihydrotestosterone propionate (DHTP). Castrated males had reliably lower attractivity than normal females on all indicator responses {{shown by the}} tethered males. Additionally, castrated males showed reliably fewer proceptive responses on 4 of 5 measures than normal females. Receptivity could not be assessed in this situa-tion for castrated males, because tethered males never contacted them unless the castrated males were displaying presentation. No reliable differences were observed between <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> produced by prenatal treatments with TP or DHTP. Pseudohermaphrodires generally showed reliably less attractivity and proceptivity than normal females and reliably more of these traits than castrated males. Attractiv-ity scores for <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> were not different from those for normal females until proximity to the tethered male was established. Receptivity was not different in pseudohermaph-rodites compared with normal females. Results indicate prenatal androgenization and its developmental sequelae lead to a defeminiza-tion in adulthood which, in this testing situation, was principally manifested by a deficiency {{in the performance of}} proceptive behaviors.

50|$|Another work of Ann Fausto-Sterling’s {{in which}} she {{discusses}} gender is The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough. In this article, Fausto-Sterling states that Western culture has only two sexes and that even their language restricts the presence {{of more than two}} sexes. She argues that instead of having a binomial nomenclature for organizing humans into two distinct sexes (male and female), there are at least five sexes in the broad spectrum of gender. These five sexes include male, female, hermaphrodite, female <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> (individuals who have ovaries and some male genitalia but lack testes), and male <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> (individuals who have testes and some female genitalia but lack ovaries). Fausto-Sterling additionally adds that in the category of hermaphrodites, there are additional degrees and levels in which the genitalia are developed; this means that there may be more intersexes that exist in this continuum of gender.|$|R

40|$|Proper gender {{assignment}} to a neonate born with ambiguous genitalia {{is a social}} emergency of the newborn period. Once an appropriate sex assignment has been made, the next critical step is performance, if needed, of a reconstructive procedure in a timely fashion. In an attempt to evaluate our experience with this unique group of patients, we have retrospectively reviewed the course of 69 children with ambiguous genitalia managed surgically at this institution between 1974 and 1989. This series consists of 32 genotypic females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 10 children with mixed gonadal dysgenesis (MGD), 10 male <b>pseudohermaphrodites,</b> 3 true hermaphrodites, 8 genotypic females with urogenital sinus anomalies (UGS), and 6 genotypic males with bilateral undescended testes and penoscrotal hypospadius. All newborns initially seen at this institution received proper sex assignment within {{the first week of}} life. Prior to 1980, 17 of the children with CAH underwent clitorectomy and vaginoplasty and three underwent clitoral recession and vaginoplasty. After 1980, 10 patients with CAH were managed with clitoral recession and vaginoplasty and 2 with vaginoplasty alone. Eight of 10 cases of MGD were given a female sex assignment and all 8 underwent gonadectomy due to the high risk of gonadoblastoma; the other 2 children were raised as males. There were 3 true hermaphrodites of which 2 were assigned female gender roles and were managed with a clitoral recession and vaginoplasty. All 10 male <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> were raised as females and all underwent bilateral orchidectomy. The 8 children with UGS were raised as females and underwent vaginal reconstruction. Six genotypic males with penoscrotal hypospadius and bilateral undescended testes were raised as males and underwent hypospadius repair and bilateral orchidopexy. This retrospective review underscores the complexities of assessment and management of ambiguous genitalia in infants and children.

40|$|Historically, {{in female}} <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> a staged {{procedure}} with early clitoral reduction and delayed vaginoplasty {{was often the}} treatment of choice.

Because of the emotional aspects of the family in intersex cases, neonatal reconstruction offers advantages to the child and parents. Furthermore, the perinatal genital hyperstimulation by maternal and placental estrogens that persists into the first 3 to 4 weeks of life produces vaginal enlargement by mucous secretion and vaginal wall hypertrophy, facilitating identification of the cleavage planes and vaginal pull-through. These arguments have led us to treat these patients by neonatal 1 stage clitorovaginoplasty.

40|$|The {{differentiation}} of the reproductive organs {{is an essential}} developmental process required for the proper transmission of the genetic material. Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) is produced by testes and {{is necessary for the}} regression of the Müllerian ducts: the anlagen of the uterus, fallopian tubes and cervix. In vitro and standard transgenic mouse studies indicate that the nuclear hormone receptor Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF- 1) and the transcription factor SOX 9 play an essential role in the regulation of Mis. To test this hypothesis, mutations in the endogenous SF- 1 and SOX 9 binding sites in the mouse Mis promoter were introduced by gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells. In disagreement with cell culture and transgenic mouse studies, male mice homozygous for the mutant SF- 1 binding site correctly initiated Mis transcription in the fetal testes, although at significantly reduced levels. Surprisingly, sufficient Mis was produced for complete elimination of the Müllerian duct system. However, when the SF- 1 binding site mutation was combined with an Mis -null allele, the further decrease in Mis levels led to a partial retention of uterine tissue, but only at a distance from the testes. In contrast, males homozygous for the mutant SOX 9 binding site did not initiate Mis transcription, resulting in <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> with a uterus and oviducts. These studies suggest an essential role for SOX 9 in the initiation of Mis transcription, whereas SF- 1 appears to act as a quantitative regulator of Mis transcript levels perhaps for influencing non-Müllerian duct tissues. ^ The Mis type II receptor, a member of the TGF- b superfamily, is also required for the proper regression of the Müllerian ducts. Mis type II receptor-deficient human males and their murine counterparts develop as <b>pseudohermaphrodites.</b> A lacZ reporter cassette was introduced into the mouse Mis type II receptor gene, by homologous recombination in ES cells. Expression studies, based on b -galactosidase activity, show marked expression of the MIS type II receptor in the postnatal Sertoli cells of the testis {{as well as in the}} prenatal and postnatal granulosa cells of the ovary. Expression is also seen in the mesenchymal cells surrounding the Müllerian duct and in the longitudinal muscle layer of the uterus. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Sex {{determination}} {{in infants}} and children with ambiguous genitalia usually necessitates time-consuming and costly karyotyping. We have evaluated a simple,rapid and reliable method of postnatal sex determination by amplification of X and Y specific microsatellite markers DXS 6797 and SRY respectively by polymerase chain reaction(PCR).

40|$|Two {{siblings}} of Pakistani origin, karyotype 46 XY, {{were born}} with predominantly female external genitalia with minute phallus, bifid scrotum, urogenital sinus, and palpable gonads. The older sibling {{at the age of}} 8 days showed an adequate testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation. The diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was made at age 6 years when no 5 alpha-reduced glucocorticoid metabolites were detectable in urine even after tetracosactrin (Synacthen) stimulation. In the younger sibling the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was provisionally made at the early age of 3 days on the basis of high urinary tetrahydrocortisol (THF) /allotetrahydrocortisol (5 alpha-THF) ratio and this ratio increased with age confirming the diagnosis. Plasma testosterone: dihydrotestosterone (DHT) ratio before and after hCG stimulation was within normal limits at age 3 days but was raised at age 9 months. Topical DHT cream application to the external genitalia promoted significant phallic growth in both siblings and in the older sibling corrective surgery was facilitated.

40|$|Introduction: Assignment of {{a proper}} gender to a neonate born with {{ambiguous}} genitalia {{is a social}} emer-gency. Once a sex has been assigned the next critical step is performance, if needed, of a reconstructive procedure in a timely fashion. In an attempt to evaluate our experi-ence with this unique group of patients, we have retro-spectively reviewed the course of 31 children managed surgically at our institute between 1989 and 2000. Patients and Methods: This series consists of 16 geno-type females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 7 male <b>pseudohermaphrodites,</b> 5 children with mixed go-nadal dysgenesis (MGD), and 3 true hermaphrodites. All the 16 patients with CAH underwent vaginoplasty, and clitoral recession. Five of the male <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> were raised as females. All of them underwent B/L gona-dectomy, and clitoral recession. Perineal vaginoplasty was done in 4 of these patients and I patient who was due for colo-vaginoplasty was lost to follow-up. 2 male pseudoher-maphrodites were raised as males. Both of them under-went B/L orchiopexy and hypospadias repair. Four of the 5 cases of MGD were given a female sex assignment and all 4 underwent gonadectomy due to high risk of gonado-blastoma. In the 5 th patient a male gender assignment was given. There were 3 true hermaphrodites, 2 of whom were managed by clitoral recession and vaginoplasty. One pa-tient was diagnosed {{at the age of}} 15 years. This patient had been brought up as a male child and presented to us with the complaint of pain in the lower abdomen. Investigations revealed haematometra and haematocolpos and the patient had to undergo B/L salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy. Results: The postoperative period in most of the pa-tients was uneventful except for 2 minor complications. The cosmetic results have been excellent. 2 patients were lost to follow-up. Follow-up {{in the rest of the}} patients ranged from 9 months to 6. 3 years and all the patients were found well adjusted to the society as far as their gen-der assignment is concerned. However the functional re-sults are yet to be evaluated, as most of the patients have not yet achieved full sexual maturity. Conclusion: This retrospective review emphasizes the complexities of assessment and management of ambigu-ous genitalia in infants and children. It also confirms the data from other series that the vast majority of infants born with the 4 most common forms of ambiguous genitalia (CAH, MGD, male pseudohermaphroditism, and true hermaphroditism) may be raised as females as phallic in-adequacy usually makes it difficult to achieve a cosmeti-cally acceptable appearance.

40|$|Inadequate {{androgen}} {{action in}} genetic and gonadal males causes an intersex phenotype. We have analyzed the androgen receptor (AR) gene in male <b>pseudohermaphrodites</b> with normal specific binding of dihydrotestosterone in their genital skin fibroblasts. In five patients with Reifenstein syndrome we have detected a point mutation in the DNA binding domain. They are from two unrelated families and presented with perineoscrotal hypospadias and undescended testes. After puberty they showed small testes, no palpable prostate, micropenis, azoospermia, and gynecomastia. The mutation was discovered when cDNA fragments from three brothers were sequenced. For rapid detection of the mutation in heterozygous and hemizygous carriers, allele-specific PCRs and restriction-analysis techniques have been developed. Relatives of the patients, {{a group of}} normal blood donors, and other patients were screened with these methods. Among 41 intersex patients with incomplete virilization, another two brothers presenting with this mutation were identified. The mutation is a guanine-to-adenine transition at nucleotide 2314, which changes the alanine codon (GCC) immediately after the first cysteine of the second zinc finger motif of the AR into a threonine codon (ACC). The mutation was recreated in an AR expression vector, and wild-type as well as mutant ARs were expressed in COS- 7 cells. Cotransfection experiments were made using a mouse mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The ability of the mutant receptor to stimulate transcription of the reporter gene was reduced by about two-thirds, {{as compared with the}} wild-type receptor...|$|R

Case Report The patient was a Chinese baby born at full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery weighing 2. 67 Kg. The antenatal and postnatal course was uneventful. She was the first child born to the parents. There was no consanguinity nor any significant family history, in particular there was no abnormal puberty nor infertility on the maternal side. Physical examination during the neonatal period revealed a normal female external genitalia. She did well until day 3 of life, when her parents noted a swelling over the groin. Physical examination revealed bilateral inguinal hernias. Hormonal blood results were luteinising hormone (LH) 9. 8 U/l (normal range, < 1. 9 U/l), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) 3. 2 U/l (normal range, < 3. 0 U/l), and testosterone 14. 8 nmol/l (normal range, < 7 nmol/l). Ultrasonography showed the presence of an infantile vagina with uterus, a structure suspected to be an ovary over the left side and the absence of fallopian tubes.
