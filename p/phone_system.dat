5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held Palo Alto, California IP-telephony network switch {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E
5|$|By early April 1999, TouchWave had {{upgraded}} their WebSwitch 1608 {{local area}} network distributed <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> to a product called WebSwitch 2000. On April 13, 1999, Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson announced that it had purchased TouchWave for $46 million. In exchange for the $46M, TouchWave provided Ericsson with Internet Protocol centric network products such as business phone and private business exchanges. The acquisition of TouchWave {{came at a time}} when multibillion-dollar companies were acquiring other relatively small Internet-connected companies, such as WebLine, Selsius, GeoTel, NBX, Dialogic, and Summa Four. Some employees from TouchWave eventually followed serial entrepreneur and former TouchWave president and CEO Samir Lehaff to Adomo, Inc., a provider of voicemail majordomo services. TouchWave co-founder Jeff Snider would go on to be vice president of enterprise sales at Ericsson and then a CEO co-founder of Adomo in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Text {{telephone}} {{devices are}} text-based terminals {{that allow the}} users to communicate by text via fixed-line telephone networks. Since cellular <b>phone</b> <b>systems</b> are sometime subject to severe radio channel impairments and the modem signals of these text telephones are therefore not always transmitted reliably, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has required a solution to guarantee a reliable transmission of text telephone data for emergency calls via cellular <b>phone</b> <b>systems.</b> For the North American PCS- 1900 cellular <b>phone</b> <b>systems</b> recently the Standards Committee T 1 has standardized a solution for this requirement, {{which is based on}} a new modem protocol, the Cellular Text Telephone Modem (CTM), whose signals can be reliably transmitted via the speech channel of cellular <b>phone</b> <b>systems.</b> After a short introduction into text telephony, this contribution provides a description of this solution for PCS- 1900 systems using CTM signals. The solution is indeed independent of the cellular system and works on de-facto all speech channels...|$|R

25|$|The {{victims were}} three Britons: Peter Kennedy (46) of Hereford, Darren Hickey (27) from Surrey, Rudi Petschi (42) of Devon, and New Zealand-born Stan Shaw (58). The four {{men had been}} working for Granger Telecom, a British {{telecommunication}} company which had won a £183m contract for the separatist government-run company Chechentelekom to install telephone lines, satellite links and a mobile <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> throughout the war-ravaged republic; the work was suspended after the four men were kidnapped.|$|E

25|$|As the {{precursor}} tropical low to Cyclone Fletcher produced heavy rains {{across much of}} the Top End region in late January and early February, the BOM issued flood advisories for the Darwin-Daly Districts. Squalls associated with the low raised concerns over abnormally high tides, namely the potential for beach erosion and coastal flooding. The Northern Territory Government launched a trial run of an early-warning <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> during this event. Residents in the Rapid Creek catchment were notified via mobile device about the possibility of flooding from the storm.|$|E
25|$|On May 18, 2008, Weigman {{and others}} {{drove to the}} {{residence}} of the Verizon investigator who was investigating Weigman’s activity, and attempted to intimidate and frighten him. Weigman had {{admitted that he had}} already placed intimidating and harassing messages and calls to the investigator. When Weigman's phone line was disconnected by Verizon because the phone line he was using was illegitimate, he infiltrated the Verizon <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> and used this information to harass the employee and to gain information about the status of the investigation that Verizon was conducting.|$|E
25|$|Prestel was a British information-retrieval {{system based}} on {{teletext}} protocols. However, it was essentially a different system, using a modem and the <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> to transmit and receive the data, comparable to systems such as France's Minitel. The modem was asymmetric, with data sent at 75-bit/s, and received at 1200-bit/s. This two-way nature allowed pages to be served on request, {{in contrast to the}} TV-based systems' sequential rolling method. It also meant that a limited number of extra services were available such as booking event or train tickets and a limited amount of online banking.|$|E

25|$|As the new {{voting system}} gives equal weight to jury and televoting results, a {{national}} jury result {{cannot be used}} as backup result for the televoting or vice versa. Therefore, if a country cannot deliver a valid televoting/jury result, a substitute result is calculated by the jury/televoting result of a pre-selected group of countries approved by the contest's Reference Group. The Director General of Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino (SMRTV), Carlo Romeo, stated on 23 February {{that the use of}} a substitute televoting result discriminated against microstates like San Marino, which only used a professional jury due to their use of the Italian <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> and would therefore have its voting representation diminished under the new system, and criticised the EBU for not contacting its members before making the decision.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg Businessweek {{reported}} in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps {{have dominated the}} largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market. At {{the time of the}} Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows <b>Phone</b> <b>system,</b> making market share a secondary issue. The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.|$|E

500|$|By 26days {{after the}} storm, {{more than half}} of the island had power restored, and the cell <b>phone</b> <b>system</b> was fixed. In the weeks and months after the passage of Sudal, water {{temperatures}} around Yap decreased from [...] to , due to significant upwelling. The drastic decrease caused unusual amounts of fog over the island, as well as significantly lower tides. By September 2004, rebuilding was still underway, and half of the schools, which had previously been used as shelters, reopened to students. Power and water lines were completely restored. The hospital remained damaged with a temporary roof, and although private businesses quickly re-opened, government buildings took longer to be rebuilt; this was due to the lengthy process of receiving aid from FEMA. Additionally, officials required a land survey to determine where structures were safe to be rebuilt.|$|E
