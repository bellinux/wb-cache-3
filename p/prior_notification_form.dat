40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was to {{find the}} effect of <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> of product {{placement}} on Norwegian television series and film viewers’ attitude towards product placed brands. We put forward three research questions concerning the relationship between <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> and brand attitude, a research area that had not previously been studied. The first question {{is concerned with the}} relationship between <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> and brand attitude, whereas the other questions apprehended how the effect would change for different levels of product placement prominence and program liking. In order to answer the research questions, we proposed nine hypotheses, which were based on literature concerning product placement, persuasion knowledge and psychological reactance. Based on our results, the most important implication for Norwegian television channel and film concept and sponsor managers is that <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> seems to have little influence on the effectiveness of the product placement on brand attitude. Thus, the value of product placements should be considered equal {{regardless of whether or not}} <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> is existent. Different levels of product placement prominence and program liking also seem to yield the same results with regards to outcome on brand attitude. However, we found a significant effect of the independent variable Brand on brand attitude, in addition to interaction effects for Brand in combination with both product placement prominence and program liking. This indicates that decisions regarding the appropriate level of product placement prominence and choice of media channel for conducting product placements should be adjusted to each individual brand...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{discharge}} planning {{is important to}} ensuring a high quality of patient care and operational efficiency. The general internal medicine (GIM) environment is very complex and fluid, with multiple health professions providing care for patients. This makes coordination of discharges difficult, even with structured daily interprofessional rounds. The purpose of this case-control study was to evaluate a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> that predicts next-day discharges. The main measures of the study, {{which took place in}} GIM wards at two academic teaching hospitals, were the completion and accuracy of the discharge forms, length of stay, discharge times, post-discharge admissions, and emergency department visits. Seventy-six of 200 patients studied had information completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> The overall effect appeared to move discharges earlier in the day, while having no effect on length of stay. Patients whose information was completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> were less likely to have an emergency department visit within 30 days post-discharge. The use of a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> appears to move discharges earlier in the day, without increasing length of stay. Further refinement and evaluation is necessary to increase usage and assess the impact on outcomes of care...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{edition of the}} Journal of Media Law, Professor Gavin Phillipson {{considered}} whether the United Kingdom must impose a <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> obligation on the media in respect of stories that concern the private conduct of individuals. Such a notification requirement would allow time for the subjects of such stories to seek interim relief to prevent publication. Max Mosley has asked the European Court of Human Rights to oblige the UK to introduce such a rule. Professor Phillipson concluded that Mosley should win his case. This paper proceeds, first, by questioning the fundamental premise of the Phillipson / Mosley argument: that damages are inadequate to compensate harms done through publication of private information. Secondly, it considers the practical ramifications of {{the imposition of a}} <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> requirement, both in terms of the ‘workability’ of a legal obligation and the impact it would have on media freedom. Thirdly, it airs the question of whether – in light of the margin of appreciation afforded to contracting states – it would be legitimate for the Strasbourg court to compel the introduction of a specific measure to assist the protection of privacy. The paper concludes that the European Court should not find the United Kingdom in breach of its obligations. Nevertheless, it closes with reflections on the desirability of <b>prior</b> <b>notification,</b> and the availability of other means to encourage the practice...|$|R

40|$|Research has {{established}} that pre-trial publicity increases potential jurors’ awareness to {{factors that may}} or may not become evidence at trial. The purpose of the present study was to examine how variations in <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> of a civil settlement would influence juror decision-making. A sample of jury eligible students (N = 123) read one of three news summaries in which the settlement amount ($ 14. 75 M v. $ 4. 25 M v. $ 800, 000 v. Control) and <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> (3 Day v. 3 Week Delay) were manipulated. Results indicated that similar to pre-trial publicity, jurors utilized prior information as a basis for determining award. In addition, participants who experienced a 3 -day delay were significantly more likely to award a greater amount in compensatory damages compared to those who experienced a 3 -week delay...|$|R
