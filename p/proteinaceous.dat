5|$|Ibicella lutea {{is another}} flypaper protocarnivore {{that has been}} the subject of several studies. Early studies {{concluded}} that the plant digested <b>proteinaceous</b> offerings, though the methods were crude. Subsequent studies done more carefully tested for the presence of protease activity and found none, though it was noted that the plant has a great capacity for capturing and killing prey.|$|E
5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a <b>proteinaceous</b> membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|A diurnal species (active mainly {{during the}} day), the meat ant shows minimal {{interaction}} with nocturnal ant species when their territories overlap. The meat ant {{and other members}} of the I. purpureus species group are regarded as a dominant group of diurnal species in Australia, as they are highly active, aggressive, and have an enormous geographical range. During the day, the bulk of the workers attend and feed on honeydew secreted by insects that live on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees. These trees are connected by foraging trails formed by meat ants, which also connect to satellite nests that are a part of a single colony; these trails are easily visible due to the absence of vegetation and lead to important food and water sources. Other workers in smaller numbers will often scavenge around the nest area for dead insects, or other <b>proteinaceous</b> foods to bring back to their colony. Their dominance is clear when meat ants are capable of finding food sources more successfully than most ants, capable of displacing many ants and other insects. Food sources are also discovered more rapidly and greatly reduces the foraging efficiency of other ants, including those of Iridomyrmex. However, some ants such as the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) are not affected by the presence of meat ants and are still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are general predators and forage singularly and cannot recruit other nestmates, they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They heavily rely on any food source and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to its peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants. This means green-head ants avoid conflict with meat ants. Certain myrmicines, which are highly competitive, are capable of defending themselves from foraging workers; the rapid recruitment of nestmates and the use of chemicals for defence allows them to withstand attacks from meat ants. In particular, Monomorium ants have been observed occupying baits regardless of the presence or absence of the meat ant. This is not the case with mealworms, but they have moderate success with honey baits. In foraging areas where meat ants are excluded or not present, the number of other ants observed is far greater and activity dramatically increases. However, the presence of meats ants does not affect abundant species, and most of the time it is only Iridomyrmex ants that increase their foraging rate.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{alternative is}} a yeast-based coproduct of bioethanol production, <b>proteinaceous</b> fermentation biomass. Substituting such products for engineered feed {{can result in}} equal (sometimes enhanced) growth in fish.

25|$|Bacteriocins are <b>proteinaceous</b> or peptidic toxins {{produced}} by bacteria to inhibit {{the growth of}} similar or closely related bacterial strain(s). They are similar to yeast and paramecium killing factors, and are structurally, functionally, and ecologically diverse.

25|$|It {{results in}} a {{classification}} of 15 families for <b>proteinaceous</b> MTs. Family 15 contains the plant MTs, which in 2002 have been further classified by Cobbet and Goldsbrough into 4 Types (1, 2, 3 and 4) depending {{on the distribution of}} their Cys residues and a Cys-devoid regions (called spacers) characteristic of plant MTs.|$|E
25|$|By {{analogy to}} Coats disease, the exudative {{retinopathy}} {{is thought to}} result from breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier {{at the level of}} the vascular endothelial cell, resulting in leakage of blood plasma and lipid. Macrophages then migrate into the retina and subretinal space and digest the lipid. The accumulation of the <b>proteinaceous</b> exudate and macrophages thickens the retina, leading to exudative retinal detachment.|$|E
25|$|Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have wine {{labeling}} {{laws that}} {{require the use of}} fining agents that may be an allergenic substance to appear on the wine label. A study conducted by the University of California, Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, however, found that no detectable amount of inorganic fining agents, and only trace quantities of <b>proteinaceous</b> agents, are left in the wine.|$|E
25|$|The pupal form of {{the beetle}} is similar in {{appearance}} to the adult form. They have outer cells produced in the larval stages that are reinforced with <b>proteinaceous</b> cement. This makes their outer shell harder and protects them during this vulnerable stage. While they pupate they breathe through spiracles on the abdomen. The beetle is non-feeding and immobile in this stage, as their internal structure is breaking down and rebuilding to its adult form. Under good temperature conditions the Hister beetle will stay in the pupal stage for about a week.|$|E
25|$|The surgery {{most often}} used in such cases is called {{transurethral}} resection of the prostate (TURP or TUR). In TURP, an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate tissue that is pressing against {{the upper part of}} the urethra and restricting the flow of urine. TURP results in the removal of mostly transitional zone tissue in a patient with BPH. Older men often have corpora amylacea (amyloid), dense accumulations of calcified <b>proteinaceous</b> material, in the ducts of their prostates. The corpora amylacea may obstruct the lumens of the prostatic ducts, and may underlie some cases of BPH.|$|E
25|$|Several moths in {{the family}} Tineidae are {{commonly}} regarded as pests because their larvae eat fabric such as clothes and blankets made from natural <b>proteinaceous</b> fibers such as wool or silk. They {{are less likely to}} eat mixed materials containing some artificial fibers. There are some reports that they may be repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar, by lavender, or by other natural oils; however, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation. Naphthalene (the chemical used in mothballs) is considered more effective, but there are concerns over its effects on human health.|$|E
25|$|Carboxysomes are {{bacterial}} microcompartments {{found in}} many autotrophic bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, Knallgasbacteria, Nitroso- and Nitrobacteria. They are <b>proteinaceous</b> structures resembling phage heads in their morphology and contain the enzymes of carbon dioxide fixation in these organisms (especially ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, RuBisCO, and carbonic anhydrase). It is thought that the high local concentration of the enzymes along with the fast conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide by carbonic anhydrase allows faster and more efficient carbon dioxide fixation than possible inside the cytoplasm. Similar structures are known to harbor the coenzyme B12-containing glycerol dehydratase, the key enzyme of glycerol fermentation to 1,3-propanediol, in some Enterobacteriaceae (e. g. Salmonella).|$|E
25|$|The cyprid larva is {{the last}} larval stage before adulthood. It is not a feeding stage; its role {{is to find a}} {{suitable}} place to settle, since the adults are sessile. The cyprid stage lasts from days to weeks. It explores potential surfaces with modified antennules; once it has found a potentially suitable spot, it attaches head-first using its antennules, and a secreted glycoproteinous substance. Larvae assess surfaces based upon their surface texture, chemistry, relative wettability, colour, and the presence/absence and composition of a surface biofilm; swarming species {{are also more likely to}} attach near other barnacles. As the larva exhausts its finite energy reserves, it becomes less selective in the sites it selects. It cements itself permanently to the substrate with another <b>proteinaceous</b> compound, and then undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile barnacle.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominantly}} blue-green iridescent {{shell of}} abalone (or paua; genus Haliotis) is one last possible imitation. Abalone shell is inexpensive and plentiful {{owing to the}} commercial mariculture of these gastropods for their meat. The shell's structure is distinctive: sinuous bands of blue, green, and rose iridescence are delineated by dark brown lines of conchiolin, a <b>proteinaceous</b> material that holds the shell together. The luster of abalone shell is silky rather than the near vitreous luster of polished ammolite, and {{the colors of the}} two materials do not closely approximate. However, some abalone shell has been dyed and given a transparent cap of synthetic quartz, forming a doublet in the same fashion as ammolite. These doublets are perhaps the most deceptive, and have also been used to imitate opal. Under magnification most abalone doublets will show dye concentrated along certain areas and air bubbles trapped at the shell-quartz interface.|$|E
25|$|For subduing large live prey and defense, workers {{possess a}} sting {{that has been}} known to cause severe pain lasting up to 48 hours. Lymphaedenopathy, edema, {{tachycardia}} and fresh blood appearing in human victim feces are common symptoms. In gamergates the venom sac is empty. Workers may have 60–75 unique <b>proteinaceous</b> components in the venom. The convoluted gland within the venom system of Dinoponera australis has been found to possess close similarities to those of vespine wasps. The contents of Dinoponera australis venom {{have been found to be}} similar to those of Pachycondyla spp. Due to the high diversity of compounds and systemic effects, venom of Dinoponera could be of use to the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, Sousa et al. (2012) demonstrated in mice that venom from Dinoponera quadriceps had antinociceptive properties. The authors note that the local population of northeast Brazil uses dry crushed Dinoponera quadriceps ants to treat earaches, and the stings of live ants are administered for back pain and rheumatism.|$|E
25|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers; the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin, waxy, {{water-resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and the layer under it called the procuticle. This is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers, the outer is the exocuticle while the inner is the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and sclerotized. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects, especially the larval stages (e.g., caterpillars). Chemically, chitin is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose. In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient and quite tough. In arthropods, however, it is often modified, becoming embedded in a hardened <b>proteinaceous</b> matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton. In its pure form, it is leathery, but when encrusted in calcium carbonate, it becomes much harder. The difference between the unmodified and modified forms can be seen by comparing the body wall of a caterpillar (unmodified) to a beetle (modified).|$|E
2500|$|These {{proteins}} localize to two {{regions of}} the nuclear compartment, the nuclear lamina—a <b>proteinaceous</b> structure layer subjacent to the inner surface of the nuclear envelope and throughout the nucleoplasm in the nucleoplasmic [...] "veil".|$|E
2500|$|Elimia virginica {{belongs to}} the family Pleuroceridae, a group of snails that have thick, {{elongated}} shells. The operculum in this species is <b>proteinaceous,</b> corneous, and paucispiral and is withdrawn when the snail [...] is active.|$|E
2500|$|A spider web, spiderweb, spider's web, or cobweb (from the archaic word , meaning [...] "spider") is {{a device}} {{created by a}} spider out of <b>proteinaceous</b> spider silk {{extruded}} from its spinnerets, generally meant to catch its prey.|$|E
2500|$|Within the seed, there {{usually is}} a store of {{nutrients}} for the seedling that will grow from the embryo. [...] The {{form of the}} stored nutrition varies depending {{on the kind of}} plant. In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the endosperm, which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via double fertilization. It is usually triploid, and is rich in oil or starch, and protein. In gymnosperms, such as conifers, the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid tissue. The endosperm is surrounded by the aleurone layer (peripheral endosperm), filled with <b>proteinaceous</b> aleurone grains.|$|E
2500|$|All calliphorid flies are all large, robust, strong day-time fliers. Their {{antennae}} are {{as described}} above for house-flies {{and others in the}} Family Muscidae. Adult flies in family Calliphoridae feed as adults of both sexes mostly on <b>proteinaceous</b> liquids found on surface of decaying animal carcasses and similar material. These liquids are taken in using sponging mouthparts (see photograph of Calliphora). [...] In genera such as Calliphora and Lucilia the females lay their eggs on the same dead animal material and the larvae feed their by rasping at the muscle and other tissues with their mouthparts. However, species of Lucilia and some other genera may opportunistically invade the tissues of live hosts, such as sheep or cattle and feed there parasitically. Other genera such as Chrysomya, Cochliomyia and Wohlfahrtia are specifically adapted for this type of feeding by the larvae.|$|E
2500|$|During purification, Haemophilus haemolyticus methyltransferase was overexpressed and {{purified}} using a high salt back-extraction step to selectively solubilize M.HhaI, {{followed by}} fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) as done previously by Kumar and colleagues. Authors utilized a Mono-Q anion exchange column {{to remove the}} small quantity of <b>proteinaceous</b> materials and unwanted DNA prior to the crystallization step. Once M.HhaI was successfully purified, the sample was then grown using a method that mixes the solution containing the complex at a temperature of 16°C and the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique to obtain the crystals. Authors were then able to collect the x-ray data according to a technique used by Cheng and colleagues in 1993. This technique involved the measurement of the diffraction intensities on a FAST detector, where the exposure times for 0.1° rotation were 5 or 10 seconds. For the structure determination and refinement, Klimasaukas and colleagues used the molecular replacement of the refined apo structure described by Cheng and colleagues in 1993 where the search models [...] X-PLOR, MERLOT, and TRNSUM were used to solve the rotation and translation functions. This {{part of the study}} involves the use of a variety of software and computer algorithms to solve the structures and characteristics of the crystal of interest.|$|E
2500|$|Eggs {{are tiny}} and oval-shaped, {{remaining}} {{the same size}} for around a week. After one week, the egg assumes {{the shape of an}} embryo and forms as a larva when the egg shell is removed. Larvae measure [...] They show a similar appearance to S. geminata larvae, but they can be distinguished by the integument with spinules on top of the dorsal portion of the posterior somites. The body hairs measure [...] with a denticulate tip. The antennae both have two or three sensilla. The labrum is smaller with two hairs on the anterior surface that are [...] The maxilla has a sclerotised band between the cardo and stipes. The [...] also has a small sclerotised band. The tubes of the labial glands are known to produce or secrete a <b>proteinaceous</b> substance that has a rich level of digestive enzymes, which includes proteases and amylases that function as an extraintestinal digestion of solid food. The midgut also contains amylases, roteases and upases. The narrow cells in its reservoir have little to no function in secretion. The pupae resemble adults of any caste, except that their legs and antennae are held tightly against the body. They appear white, but over time, the pupae turns darker when they are almost ready to mature.|$|E
2500|$|The slime glands {{themselves}} are {{deep inside the}} body cavity, each {{at the end of}} a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre, but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres, or even nearly a foot, although accuracy drops with range. It is not clear to what extent the range varies with the species and other factors. One squirt usually suffices to snare a prey item, although larger prey may be further immobilised by smaller squirts targeted at the limbs; additionally, the fangs of spiders are sometimes targeted. The slime, which can account for up to 11% of the organism's dry weight, is 90% water; its dry residue consists mainly of proteins — primarily a collagen-type protein. 1.3% of the slime's dry weight consists of sugars, mainly galactosamine. The slime also contains lipids and the surfactant nonylphenol. Onychophora are the only organisms known to produce this latter substance. It tastes [...] "slightly bitter and at the same time somewhat astringent". The <b>proteinaceous</b> composition accounts for the slime's high tensile strength and stretchiness. Upon ejection, it forms a net of threads about twenty microns in diameter, with evenly spaced droplets of viscous adhesive fluid along their length. It subsequently dries, shrinking, losing its stickiness, and becoming brittle. Onychophora eat their dried slime when they can, which is appropriate, because it takes an onychophoran about 24 days to replenish an exhausted slime repository. The lipid and nonylphenol constituents may serve one of two purposes. They may line the ejection channel, stopping the slime from sticking to the organism when it is secreted; or they may slow the drying process long enough for the slime to reach its target.|$|E
2500|$|Asbestosis is the {{scarring}} of {{lung tissue}} (beginning around terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts and extending into the alveolar walls) {{resulting from the}} inhalation of asbestos fibers. There {{are two types of}} fibers: amphibole (thin and straight) and serpentine (curly). All forms of asbestos fibers are responsible for human disease as they are able to penetrate deeply into the lungs. [...] When such fibers reach the alveoli (air sacs) in the lung, where oxygen is transferred into the blood, the foreign bodies (asbestos fibers) cause the activation of the lungs' local immune system and provoke an inflammatory reaction dominated by lung macrophages that respond to chemotactic factors activated by the fibers. This inflammatory reaction can be described as chronic rather than acute, with a slow ongoing progression of the immune system attempting to eliminate the foreign fibers. Macrophages phagocytose (ingest) the fibers and stimulate fibroblasts to deposit connective tissue. Due to the asbestos fibers' natural resistance to digestion, some macrophages are killed and others release inflammatory chemical signals, attracting further lung macrophages and fibrolastic cells that synthesize fibrous scar tissue, which eventually becomes diffuse and can progress in heavily exposed individuals. This tissue can be seen microscopically soon after exposure in animal models. [...] Some asbestos fibers become layered by an iron-containing <b>proteinaceous</b> material (ferruginous body) in cases of heavy exposure where about 10% of the fibers become coated. [...] Most inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated. [...] About 20% of the inhaled fibers are transported by cytoskeletal components of the alveolar epithelium to the interstitial compartment of the lung where they interact with macrophages and mesenchymal cells. The cytokines, transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, appear to play major roles in the development of [...] scarring inasmuch as the process can be blocked in animal models by preventing the expression of the growth factors. The result is fibrosis in the interstitial space, thus asbestosis. This fibrotic scarring causes alveolar walls to thicken, which reduces elasticity and gas diffusion, reducing oxygen transfer to the blood as well as the removal of carbon dioxide. [...] This can result in shortness of breath, a common symptom exhibited by individuals with asbestosis.|$|E
2500|$|Test {{articles}} passing muster {{in vitro}} can be evaluated {{in a number}} of in vivo models (usually in mice) of ALI including chlorine inhalation, intratracheal instillation of bleomycin and in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) overexpressing transgenic mice exposed to high dose doxycycline. Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a <b>proteinaceous</b> exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E
60|$|One fact, at any rate, is out {{of reach}} of such refinements, and this is, that all the forms of {{protoplasm}} which have yet been examined contain the four elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, in very complex union, and that they behave similarly towards several reagents. To this complex combination, the nature of which has never been determined with exactness, the name of Protein has been applied. And if we use this term with such caution as may properly arise out of our comparative ignorance of the things for which it stands, it may be truly said, that all protoplasm is <b>proteinaceous,</b> or, as the white, or albumen, of an egg is one of the commonest examples of a nearly pure proteine matter, we may say that all living matter is more or less albuminoid.|$|E

50|$|Food {{collection}} is very costly to the foundress of a colony and carries {{a high risk}} of mortality. However, it is a necessary activity for colony survival. Most collected <b>proteinaceous</b> material is consumed by larvae. A significant amount, fourteen percent, is allocated to oral secretions. P. chinensis, like many social wasps, uses a <b>proteinaceous</b> oral secretion to glue nest material to maintain and build the nest. The oral secretion of P. chinensis is 73% <b>proteinaceous</b> materials. The queen will augment this investment in response to the environment. Oral secretions increase during rainy seasons, because the foundress must smear oral secretion frequently over the nest surfaces to avoid risk of destruction. Nests in exposed sites vs. sheltered sites show no significant difference in dry weight of secretions produced by the foundress. However, foundresses that nest in sheltered sites bring in more prey then those at exposed sites. Therefore, the relative amount of <b>proteinaceous</b> resources allocated to oral secretions is greater, at 22%.|$|E
