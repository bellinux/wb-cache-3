50|$|The {{work was}} done as follows: <b>Photographic</b> <b>facsimiles</b> {{of each of the}} ancient manuscripts were {{compared}} with a copy of the text of Weymouth's THE RESULTANT GREEK TESTAMENT, and every variation was noted in it. Then another copy of Weymouth’s text was cut up and pasted, line for line, on large sheets of paper which were bound together as a book. Space was left between each line, so that all the variations could be entered in place, above the words. If another reading was preferred instead of Weymouth’s, the notation above the line was changed accordingly. The principles on which this text was constructed are explained in the Introduction to the CONCORDANT GREEK TEXT. This volume of the Concordant Library contains every word and letter of A, B, s, Codex Vaticanus 2066 (046) for the Apocalypse, and some recently discovered fragments of Papyri. Variant readings in these manuscripts are shown in the Greek text, referred to as the super-linear. A uniform, hyper-literal word-for-word English sub-linear translation is given below the Greek text. The Greek text is printed in the ancient uncial letters as found in the most ancient manuscripts.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 July 2008 the [...] "Australian Newspapers Beta" [...] {{service was}} {{released}} to the public as a standalone website and a year later became a fully integrated part of the newly launched Trove. The service contains over 3 million articles from 1803 onwards, with more content being added regularly. The website was the public face of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Project, a coordination of major libraries in Australia to convert historic newspapers to text-searchable digital files. The Australian Newspapers website allowed users to search the database of digitised newspapers from 1803 to 1954 which are now in the public domain. The newspapers (frequently microfiche or other <b>photographic</b> <b>facsimiles)</b> were scanned and the text from the articles has been captured by optical character recognition (OCR) to facilitate easy searching, but it contains many OCR errors, often due to poor quality facsimiles. Since August 2008 the system has incorporated crowdsourced text-correction as a major feature, allowing the public to change the searchable text. Many users have contributed tens of thousands of corrected lines, and some have contributed millions. This collaborative participation allows users to give back to the service and over time will improve the database's searchability. The text-correcting community and other Trove users have been referred to as [...] "Trovites".|$|R

We began by reading one of the standard works on paleography, by E. M.

Utilizing our paleographic knowledge, and conferring with the standard transcription of the Historia Scholastica from the Patrologia Latina, volume 198, we established our own group transcription from the BSU text, noting the instances where our text differed from the PL 198 version. Next, we each translated our transcribed and expanded Latin, and then came together to produce one group translation, emphasizing accuracy and readability. To date, we have transcribed and translated 107 of the 205 lines in the Book of Ruth.
