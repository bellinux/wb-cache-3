5000|$|The best {{method for}} {{modeling}} {{that is to}} divide the trunk into adjacent segments no more than 3 to 5 feet in height/length and then apply either the cone, paraboloid, or neiloid frustum form to each. [...] This is a labor-intensive process. To gain efficiency, longer sections can be chosen that appear to the eye to have uniform curvature. However, the longer the segment, the more {{important it is to}} choose the optimum solid. Over longer frustums, the greater volume contribution of the paraboloid or the lesser volume of the neiloid becomes apparent when compared to the basic conical form. Therefore, when modeling longer frustums the measurer needs to perform independent checks to insure that the right solid has been chosen. One way to check is to take a diameter measurement at an intermediate point and then project what the diameter would be for the chosen model at the point. If the <b>projected</b> <b>diameter</b> is substantially greater or lesser than the measured diameter, then the selected solid is not the right choice. In this case, an intermediate form that combines the two forms through weighting may be appropriate. The measurer selects weights and applies them to each solid formula to arrive at an intermediate result. Each frustum can represent a different parent cone, paraboloid, or neiloid so {{that there is not a}} need to impose a single form on the entire tree.|$|E

We also present a velocity field of the ionised gas. The filaments appear to connect seamlessly in velocity space to the kinematical disturbances caused by the shell. Similar to high-z star-forming galaxies, the ionised gas in this galaxy is dispersion dominated. We argue that the filaments were created via feedback from the starburst and that these ionised structures in the halo may act as escape channels for Lyman continuum radiation in this gas-rich system.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop a stand-class growth and yield model based on the diameter growth dynamics of Pinus spp. and Quercus spp. of Mexico’s mixed temperate forests. Using a total of 2663 temporary, circular-sampling plots of 1000 m 2 each, nine Weibull distribution techniques of parameter estimation were fitted to the diameter structures of pines and oaks. Statistical equations using stand attributes and the first three moments of the diameter distribution predicted and recovered the Weibull parameters. Using nearly 1200 and 100 harvested trees for pines and oaks, respectively, I developed the total height versus diameter at breast height relationship by fitting three non-linear functions. The Newnham model predicted stem taper and numerical integration was done to estimate merchantable timber volume for all trees in the stand for each diameter class. The independence of the diameter structures of pines and oaks was tested by regressing the Weibull parameters and <b>projecting</b> <b>diameter</b> structures. The model predicts diameter distributions transition from exponential (J inverse), logarithmic to well-balanced distributions with increasing mean stand diameter at breast height. Pine diameter distributions transition faster and the model predicts independent growth rates between pines and oaks.

40|$|A recent stellar {{occultation}} by dwarf planet Makemake {{provided an}} excellent opportunity to measure {{the size and shape}} of one of the largest objects in the Kuiper belt. The analysis of these results provided what were reported to be precise measurements of the lengths of the projected axes, the albedo, and even the density of Makemake, but these results were, in part, derived from qualitative arguments. We reanalyzed the occultation timing data using a quantitative statistical description, and, in general, find the previously reported results on the shape of Makemake to be unjustified. In our solution, in which we use our inference from photometric data that Makemake is being viewed nearly pole-on, we find a 1 sigma upper limit to the projected elongation of Makemake of 1. 02, with measured equatorial diameter of 1434 +/- 14 km and a <b>projected</b> polar <b>diameter</b> of 1422 +/- 14 km, yielding an albedo of 0. 81 + 0. 01 /- 0. 02 $.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Typically, when {{different}} forms of growth and yield models are considered, they are grouped into convenient discrete classes. As a heuristic device, I chose to use a contrasting perspective, that all growth and yield models are diameter distribution models that merely differ in regard to which diameter distribution is employed and how the distribution is projected to future conditions. I describe different diameter distributions, whether they are the classical contmuous diameter distributions, the implied distributions of whole-stand models, or the discrete diameter distributions of size-class or individual tree models. There are also intermediates between these types of diameter distributions. Aggregation vs. disaggregation describes the alternate poles for how diameter distributions can be projected to future conditions. There are intermediates between these extremes, as well. There are several alternatives that vary from the classical paradigms. One alternative is a continuous analog to stand table projection that employs a “distribution modifying function ” to <b>project</b> <b>diameter</b> distributions in time. One discrete variant of stand table projection is termed “non-naWe ” size class models, as they relax {{one or more of}} the assumptions of size class models. An “individual tree kernel ” model is one that uses a simple kernel function to distribute probability around an individual tree, rather than concentrate the probability at the measured diameter, as in typical individual tree models. Other variants are mentioned. These variants suggest that there is an infiite universe of alternative growth and yield models, and the classic labels for types of growth and yield models do not embrace these alternatives...|$|R

No doubt that control over the materials {{consumption rate}} is of particular importance. However, we believe that it represents one of several constituents of the overall cost of a gas network piping project. Labour expenditures and earth works that are, to some extent, dependent on the diameter of a pipeline, should also be taken into account. Presently, metal and polyethylene pipes of standard diameters are used in gas network development <b>projects.</b> <b>Diameters</b> of pipes of external gas distribution networks are rounded up to the closest standard diameter of pipes as a result of a hydraulic calculation. The cost of construction of a gas pipeline has multiple constituents that may be clustered into three principle groups: 1) earth works, 2) piping; 3) cost of materials. Calculation of the cost of construction of low and medium pressure pipelines to be made of steel and cross-linked polyethylene was performed to find out the cost of a pipeline. The calculations were made in the basic prices of the year 2000 adjusted to the figures of April 2011, given the standard piping conditions in a settlement within central Russia. The data were interpolated by means of a quadratic function. On the basis of the above data, a comparative analysis of capital expenditures in respect of steel and polyethylene piping may be performed. The research also contemplates the structure of expenses associated with the piping of gas distribution networks. Mathematical equations have been derived to perform sufficiently accurate calculations of costs of construction of various types and various lengths of gas pipelines.

Observing ROSAT {{sources in}} an area {{covering}} ∼ 30 % of the Southern Hemisphere, including the RCrA Association, we found evidences that this nearby association may be much larger than previously thought. Although in the survey we found many young stars near the RCrA, there are 20 young stars with properties that characterize them as possibly belonging to the RCrA association. From the nine known members with measured proper motions and radial velocities, we obtain the mean space velocity components for the Association relative to the Sun: (U, V, W) = (− 3. 8 ± 1. 2, − 14. 3 ± 1. 7, − 8. 3 ± 2. 0) km/s.

At 0. 4 " resolution, the emission is separated into two components, a stronger, extended one to the northeast (46 +/- 5 mJy) and a weaker, compact one to the southwest (15 +/- 2 mJy). We have carried out simulations of the gravitational lensing effect responsible for the two submm components in order to constrain the intrinsic size of the submm continuum emission. Using an elliptical lens potential, the best fit lensing model yields an intrinsic (<b>projected)</b> <b>diameter</b> of ~ 80 pc, which is not as compact as the optical/near-infrared (NIR) emission and agrees with previous size estimates of the gas and dust emission in APM 08279 + 5255.

40|$|Airborne {{engineered}} nanomaterials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), functionalized MWCNT, graphene, fullerene, {{silver and}} gold nanorods were characterized using a tandem system of a differential mobility analyzer and an aerosol particle mass analyzer to obtain their airborne transport properties and understand their relationship to morphological characteristics. These nanomaterials were aerosolized using different generation methods such as electrospray, pneumatic atomization, and dry aerosolization techniques, and their airborne transport properties such as mobility and aerodynamic diameters, mass scaling exponent, dynamic shape factor, and effective density were obtained. Laboratory experiments were conducted to directly measure mobility diameter and mass of the airborne nanomaterials using tandem mobility-mass measurements. Mass scaling exponents, aerodynamic diameters, dynamic shape factors and effective densities of mobility-classified particles were obtained from particle mass and the mobility diameter. Microscopy analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed to obtain morphological descriptors such as envelop diameter, open area, aspect ratio, and <b>projected</b> area <b>diameter.</b> The morphological information from the TEM was compared with measured aerodynamic and mobility diameters of the particles. The results showed that aerodynamic diameter is smaller than mobility diameter below 500 nm {{by a factor of}} 2 to 4 for all nanomaterials except {{silver and gold}} nanorods. Morphologies of MWCNTs generated by liquid-based method, such as pneumatic atomization, are more compact than those of dry dispersed MWCNTs, indicating that the morphology depends on particle generation method. TEM analysis showed that <b>projected</b> area <b>diameter</b> of MWCNTs appears to be in reasonable agreement with mobility diameter in the size range from 100 - 400 nm. Principal component analysis of the obtained airborne particle properties also showed that the mobility diameter-based effective density and aerodynamic diameter are eigenvectors and can be used to represent key transport properties of interest.
