40|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century, {{the rapid growth}} of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) have brought remarkable societal changes. Nowadays, ICT is becoming increasingly important both in the everyday life and in the education system. It therefore makes sense to examine the impact of ICT <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> the conduct of academic activities. The aim of this paper is precisely to examine the perceived impact of ICT <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> academic workload and on academic productivity. This aim is achieved within a theoretical framework on the factors affecting academic productivity. This research was conducted as a questionnaire based survey of 103 academic staff drawn from four Higher Education Institutions in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The survey data was analyzed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software using a quantitative approach. The results of this survey indicate that ICT adoption has no impact on teaching workload, or on research workload, or on administration workload. No evidence was found on the impact of ICT <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> academic productivity. This research contributes to new evidence on the possible impact of ICT <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> academic workload and on academic productivity...|$|R

Subsequently we analyze whether the influence of an ERPS <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> these information characteristics {{has an impact on}} the perceived value of information available for performance measurement (PM) purposes.

By collecting questionnaire survey data, we proceeded statistical analysis and Structural Equation Modeling analysis with SPSS and AMOS, and tested the theoretical model and further made a discussion on the results of data analysis. The results shown that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use posed a significant positive impact <b>on</b> user <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> mobile securities services but perceived risk posed a significant negative impact; the impact of perceived cost <b>on</b> user <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> mobile securities services was not significant. We also verified the impacts of usability of mobile device and usability of mobile communication network. Ultimately, we proposed suggestions to all participants of mobile securities and pointed out the direction of future work...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} stock market reaction {{and the impact}} of IFRS <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> the Nigerian stock market. The paper also evaluates the effect of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) reforms on earnings management of Nigerian banks. The result indicates no evidence of any significant effect on the market but a negative stock reaction in the medium term. Our finding highlights mixed impact of IFRS <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> earnings management; but a significant decrease in earnings management in the post CBN reforms. Our study shows that adoption of IFRS was wrongly timed in Nigeria as the fragile investors' sentiment which was just recovering from the shock of the global financial crisis could have been weakened by the negative market returns. These results have signal effect on investors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study investigates how the {{mandatory}} adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) affects the contractual benefits of using accounting information to determine executive compensation in China. After controlling for firm and corporate governance characteristics, we find strong evidence supporting the positive role of mandatory IFRS <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> the accounting-based performance sensitivity of executive compensation. Subsample analysis suggests that improvements in accounting-based performance sensitivity after IFRS adoption differ across regions with {{various levels of}} institutional quality and across firms that are affected to a different extent by the adoption. Additional analysis supports {{the argument that the}} positive effects of IFRS <b>adoption</b> <b>on</b> the use of accounting performance in executive compensation are driven by the reduction in accounting conservatism associated with IFRS adoption...|$|R
