5|$|Robert A. Holton, a {{professor}} of chemistry at Florida State, developed the first total synthesis of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel, which had previously been obtainable only from the bark of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> tree. Florida State University signed a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb to license this and future patents. In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew,</b> Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants are harvested {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could be addressed by cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E
5000|$|Illahee State Park is a 75 acre Washington {{state park}} {{located in the}} hamlet of Illahee, just north of East Bremerton, on Port Orchard Bay, part of Puget Sound. The word [...] "Illahee" [...] means earth or country in the Native {{language}} Chinuk Wawa. The park harbors one of the country's oldest <b>Pacific</b> <b>yews,</b> which has been standing for approximately 400 years. The park was acquired in seven parcels between 1934 and 1954. Park activities include picnicking, camping, hiking, boating, and shellfish harvesting.|$|R
50|$|The {{natural area}} {{is to the}} west of the {{developed}} portion and includes a wooded area traversed by a small creek, a tributary of McKay Creek. There are also wetlands, a ravine, and a pond in this section of the park. The area includes several bridges and trails covered with barkdust. Trees in the park include lodgepole pines, blue spruce, <b>Pacific</b> <b>yews,</b> <b>Pacific</b> dogwoods, western red cedars, old-growth Douglas-fir, oak, vine maple, and sequoia trees. Other flora include red huckleberry, Oregon grape, pink star flowers, stinging nettles, and other native plants. Birds at the park are Bewick's wrens, dark-eyed juncos, song sparrows, black-capped chickadees, scrub jays, and ducks among others. Animals include possums, bats, and raccoons. There is a half-mile trail through the natural section that leads to a slough.|$|R

5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|RTI {{scientists}} Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, {{from the}} bark of the Camptotheca tree, and Taxol in 1971, from a <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> tree. These two drugs account for $3 {{billion a year in}} sales by pharmaceutical companies. In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. Two years later, RTI began a $4.4 million program to coordinate AIDS drug trials for the National Institutes of Health. This had grown to $26 million by 1988.|$|E
40|$|A phytogeographic {{analysis}} of 845 Taxus specimens is presented based on leaf anatomical characters {{for the number}} of stomata rows in a stomata band and the number of epidermal cells that lack papillae between the leaf margin and stomata band. The specimens are arranged by continent, country, state or province, and species, and represented geographically on three maps: (1) North America, (2) the Euro-Mediterranean, and (3) Asia. Taxus is least diverse and most distinct taxonomically in North America, and most diverse and least distinct taxonomically in southwest China. Stomata data show several clines in North America, an obvious south to north decrease for the Mesoamerican yew (T. globosa) and <b>Pacific</b> NW <b>yew</b> (T. brevifolia) populations combined, and a less obvious reverse cline for the Canada yew (T. canadensis). The results are discussed in review of other paleobotanical data. It is suggested that Taxus immigrated to North America from Asia across a Pacific land connection during the Cretaceous, and from Europe to North America across North Atlantic land bridges during the Tertiary. The low diversity of Taxus in North America is suggested {{to be the result of}} the K/T extinction event. In the Euro-Mediterranean, evolution of Taxus is suggested to have been impacted more by extinction as a result of climatic changes during the Tertiary, and by hybridization during the Pleistocene. The greater diversity in SW China is indicated to be the result of less extinction there and more frequent hybridization during the Pleistocene, not only among authochtonous species, but also allochtonous species as a result of the Himalayan uplift...|$|R
5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew,</b> Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew,</b> Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew,</b> Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> {{grows in}} varying types of environments; however, in drier environments {{it is mostly}} limited to stream side habitats, whereas in moist environments it will grow up onto slopes and ridgetops. <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> is shade tolerant; however it can also grow in sun. The tree's shade {{tolerance}} allows it to form an understory, which means that it can grow along streams providing shade to maintain water temperature.|$|E

25|$|Taxus brevifolia, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> or western yew, is a conifer {{native to}} the Pacific Northwest of North America. It ranges from southernmost Alaska south to central California, mostly in the Pacific Coast Ranges, but with {{isolated}} disjunct populations in southeast British Columbia (most notably occurring on Zuckerberg Island near Castlegar) and in north to central Idaho.|$|E
25|$|Conifer species include Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. menziesii), Lawson's Cypress (also {{known as}} Port Orford Cedar, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa), Sugar Pine (Pinus lambertiana), Mountain Hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), White Fir (Abies concolor subsp. lowiana), Red Fir (A. magnifica subsp. shastensis), Weeping Spruce (Picea breweriana), Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), and <b>Pacific</b> <b>Yew</b> (Taxus brevifolia). These forests mark the {{northern}} {{extent of the}} range for California Buckeye.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel {{is of the}} {{chemotherapy}} drug class; taxane, and is a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel (Taxol), {{an extract}} from the bark of the rare <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> tree Taxus brevifolia. Due to scarcity of paclitaxel, extensive research was carried out leading to the formulation of docetaxel – an esterified product of 10-deacetyl baccatin III, which is extracted from the renewable and more readily available leaves of the European yew tree.|$|E
25|$|Paclitaxel {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1971 from the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> and approved {{for medical use}} in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 7.06 to 13.48 USD per 100mg vial. This amount in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 66.85 pounds. It is now manufactured by cell culture.|$|E
25|$|Paclitaxel total {{synthesis}} {{in organic}} chemistry {{is a major}} ongoing research effort in the total synthesis of paclitaxel (Taxol). This diterpenoid is an important drug {{in the treatment of}} cancer but, also expensive because the compound is harvested from a scarce resource, namely the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> (Taxus brevifolia). Not only is the synthetic reproduction of the compound itself of great commercial and scientific importance, but it also opens the way to paclitaxel derivatives not found in nature but with greater potential.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} evergreen tree, growing 10–15m tall and with a trunk up to 50cm diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of 20m occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a squat, multiple leader form.|$|E

Nez Perce textiles were made primarily from dogbane or ″qeemu″ (Apocynum cannabinum or Indian hemp), tules or ″to'ko″ (Schoenoplectus acutus var. acutus), and western redcedar or ″tala'tat″ (Thuja plicata). The most important industrial woods were redcedar, ponderosa pine or ″la'qa″ (Pinus ponderosa), Douglas fir or ″pa'ps″ (Pseudotsuga menziesii), sandbar willow or ″tax's″ (Salix exigua), and hard woods such as <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> or ″ta'mqay″ (Taxus brevifolia) and syringa or ″sise'qiy″ (Philadelphus lewisii or Indian arrowwood).|$|E
25|$|Paclitaxel (Taxol) was a novel {{antimitotic agent}} that {{promoted}} microtubule assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and {{could only be}} obtained from the bark of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Yew</b> tree, which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in ovarian cancer therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb, was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from Taxol.|$|E
25|$|The {{view of the}} NCI, however, {{was even}} this route was not {{practical}}. The group of Robert A. Holton had also pursued a practical semisynthetic production route; by late 1989, Holton's group had developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel with twice the yield of the Potier process. Florida State University, where Holton worked, signed a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb to license their semisynthesis and future patents. In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield, and BMS took the process in-house and started to manufacture paclitaxel in Ireland from 10-deacetylbaccatin isolated from the needles of the European yew. In early 1993, BMS {{announced that it would}} cease reliance on <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> bark by the end of 1995, effectively terminating ecological controversy over its use. This announcement also made good their commitment to develop an alternative supply route, made to the NCI in their CRADA application of 1989.|$|E
25|$|From 1967 to 1993, {{almost all}} {{paclitaxel}} produced {{was derived from}} bark from the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew,</b> the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process. The processes used were descendants of the original isolation method of Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani; by 1987, the NCI had contracted Hauser Chemical Research of Boulder, Colorado, to handle bark on the scale needed for Phase II and III trials. While both {{the size of the}} wild population of Taxus brevifola and the magnitude of the eventual demand for taxol were uncertain, it was clear for many years that an alternative, sustainable source of supply of the natural product would be needed. Initial attempts to broaden its sourcing used needles from the tree, or material from other related Taxus species, including cultivated ones, but these attempts were challenged by the relatively low and often highly variable yields obtained. Early in the 1990s, coincident with increased sensitivity to the ecology of the forests of the Pacific Northwest, paclitaxel was successfully extracted on a clinically useful scale from these sources.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of paclitaxel began in 1962 {{as a result}} of a U.S. National Cancer Institute-funded screening program. A number of years later it was isolated from the bark of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew,</b> Taxus brevifolia, hence its name [...] "taxol." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} {{was made by}} Monroe E. Wall and Mansukh C. Wani at the Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, in 1971.

The compound was then developed commercially by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), who had the generic name assigned as [...] "paclitaxel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{natural product}} drugs target tubulin, {{which is a}} {{component}} of the cytoskeleton. [...] These include the tubulin polymerization inhibitor colchicine isolated from the Colchicum autumnale (autumn crocus flowering plant), which is used to treat gout. [...] Colchicine is biosynthesized from the amino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan. Paclitaxel, in contrast, is a tubulin polymerization stabilizer and is used as a chemotherapeutic drug. [...] Paclitaxel is based on the terpenoid natural product taxol, which is isolated from [...] Taxus brevifolia (the <b>pacific</b> <b>yew</b> tree).|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemotherapy}} drug paclitaxel (taxol), used in breast, ovarian, {{and lung}} cancer treatment, {{is derived from}} Taxus brevifolia. [...] As it was already becoming scarce when its chemotherapeutic potential was realized, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> was never commercially harvested from its habitat at a large scale; {{the widespread use of}} the paclitaxel (taxol) was enabled when a semi-synthetic pathway was developed from extracts of cultivated yews of other species. Unlicensed pharmaceutical production use of closely related wild yew species in India and China may be threatening some of those species.|$|E
2500|$|Taxanes {{are natural}} and semi-synthetic drugs. The first drug of their class, paclitaxel, was {{originally}} {{extracted from the}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>Yew</b> tree, Taxus brevifolia. [...] Now this drug and another in this class, docetaxel, are produced semi-synthetically from a chemical found in the bark of another Yew tree; Taxus baccata. These drugs promote microtubule stability, preventing their disassembly. Paclitaxel prevents the cell cycle at the boundary of G2-M, whereas docetaxel exerts its effect during S-phase. Taxanes present difficulties in formulation as medicines because they are poorly soluble in water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{paclitaxel}} {{drug development}} process took over 40 years. The anti-tumor activity of a bark extract of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>yew</b> tree {{was discovered in}} 1963 as a follow up of a US government plant screening program already in existence 20 years before that.
