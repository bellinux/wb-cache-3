40|$|An intense pulsed {{diagnostic}} {{neutral beam}} (IDNB) is proposed to enable active spectroscopic diagnostics on ITER. The proposed intense neutral beam source will employ a magnetically insulated diode (MID) ion source, {{consisting of a}} plasma anode and a virtual cathode. Clean, intense (~ 25 A/cm 2) hydrogen or deuterium neutral beams will be generated with an energy up to 125 keV/amu. A short pulse (1 µs) operation provides a better S/N ratio because the short gating time minimizes the bremsstrahlung background, compared to conventional CW diagnostic neutral beam. Though the injector has a peak neutral beam power of 500 MW, the cost and the footprint {{of the system is}} much less than CW diagnostic neutral beam systems because its average power is only 100 kW. Measurements every ~ 30 ms can be obtained by a repetitive operation up to 33 Hz. Preliminary calculations indicate that this IDNB system can maintain a necessary S/N ratio of charge-exchange recombination spectroscopy (CHERS) signals even {{at the center of the}} <b>burning</b> <b>plasma.</b> This is encouraging since core CHERS will be critical to understand the physics of <b>burning</b> <b>plasmas</b> by providing ion temperature profile, impurity and helium ash measurements, and fast alpha distribution.

They cause anomalous heat and particle transport which significantly degrades the plasma confinement quality, thus preventing self-sustaining <b>plasma</b> <b>burning</b> in present-day experiments.

Here, the multitude of involved space and time scales may cause problems since the parameters required for a numerical treatment – e. g., the grid resolutions – often turn out to be infeasible for computations. However, if scales are clearly separated – as it is the case in magnetically confined fusion plasmas – multiscale approaches allow for a reduction of the problem under investigation to the relevant domain of interest.
