5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of <b>people</b> <b>work</b> in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|Simonsohn {{also raised}} the {{possibility}} of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many <b>people</b> <b>work</b> for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1943, it {{had become}} clear that the initial {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the town had been too low, and a second phase of construction was required. Plans now called for a town of 42,000 <b>people.</b> <b>Work</b> began in the fall of 1943, and continued into the late summer of 1944. Hospitals were expanded, as were the police and fire services, and the telephone system. Only 4,793 of a planned total of 6,000 family houses were built, mostly on the East Town area and the undeveloped stretch along State Route 61. They were supplemented by 55 new dormitories, 2,089 trailers, 391 hutments, a cantonment area of 84 hutments and 42 barracks. Some 2,823 of the family units were prefabricated off-site. The high school was expanded to cater for 1,000 students. Two additional primary schools were built, and existing ones were expanded so that they could accommodate 7,000 students.|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{more than}} 5 million <b>people</b> <b>work</b> in Switzerland; about 25% of {{employees}} {{belonged to a}} trade union in 2004. Switzerland has a more flexible job market than neighbouring countries and {{the unemployment rate is}} very low. The unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in June 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in December 2009. The unemployment rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 without further decrease in 2015 and 2016. Population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004. The foreign citizen population was 21.8% in 2004, about the same as in Australia. GDP per hour worked is the world's 16th highest, at 49.46 international dollars in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 <b>people</b> <b>work</b> in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E

5|$|The 1601 Act {{sought to}} deal with 'settled' poor who had found {{themselves}} temporarily out of work—it was assumed they would accept indoor relief or outdoor relief. Neither method of relief was {{at this time in}} history seen as harsh. The act was supposed {{to deal with}} beggars who were considered a threat to civil order. The Act was passed at a time when poverty was considered necessary as fear of poverty made <b>people</b> <b>work.</b> In 1607 a House of Correction was set up in each county. However, this system was separate from the 1601 system which distinguished between the settled poor and 'vagrants'. There was much variation in the application of the law and there was a tendency for the destitute to migrate towards the more generous parishes, usually situated in the towns. This led to the Settlement Act 1662 also known as the Poor Relief Act 1662, this allowed relief only to established residents of a parish; mainly through birth, marriage and apprenticeship. Unfortunately the laws reduced the mobility of labour and discouraged paupers from leaving their parish to find work. They also encouraged industry to create short contracts (e.g. 364 days) so that an employee could not become eligible for poor relief.|$|E
