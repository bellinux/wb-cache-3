40|$|Herbicide sod {{suppression}} during <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> by legume sod-seeding {{often results}} {{in the loss of}} potentially usable forage, weed encroachment, and inadequate glass-legume ratios. A study was conducted to investigate the viability of sod suppression by sheep grazing or mowing, as alternatives to herbicide, during <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> with no-till seeding of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) or white clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Sod suppression methods evaluated were: strategically timed mowing or sheep grazing to 5 or 10 cm at seeding and during legume establishment, or similarly managed mowing or sheep grazing with an additional defoliation to 5 cm the previous fall. Additional treatments included suppression by herbicide and, unsuppressed and unseeded controls. Treatments were evaluated by determining clover plant population, botanical composition, forage yield and quality. Physical (mowing or grazing) and herbicide sod suppression resulted in similar clover plant populations; clover yields tended to be higher with herbicide suppression. However, increasing the intensity of physical suppression increased clover yields. Forage quality was increased only with sod suppression by grazing or herbicide when compared with the unimproved control. Although, for grazing this was attributed to a more frequent defoliation regime and not to the renovation itself. Unlike suppression with herbicide, physical suppression did not decrease total seasonal forage yields in the renovation year when compared with controls...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Data {{from the}} Cicerone farmlet study {{were used to}} {{quantify}} the balance between pasture feed supply and the demand fromgrazing livestock, in termsofmetabolisable energy (ME), on three differentlymanaged farmlets (eachof 53 ha) on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. Farmlet A had {{a high level of}} <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> and higher soil fertility than the other two farmlets and employed flexible grazing management over eight paddocks. Farmlet B was designed to represent management ‘typical ’ of the region and had the same grazing management and number of paddocks as farmlet A but moderate levels of <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> and soil fertility. The third farmlet (C) had the same level of inputs as farmlet B but practised intensive rotational grazing over 37 paddocks. Regular measurements of the feed supply, namely herbage mass and quality, pasture growth and supplement fed and of feed demand were assembled to provide monthly estimates of the balance between feed supply and animal demand of all classes of livestock run on the experiment over its duration of 6. 5 years. The significantly greater stocking rate, liveweight and reproductive rate of sheep reached on the higher input system (farmlet A) meant higher levels of ME were required to satisfy the nutritional demands of these animals. As only limited measurements were taken of animal intake, it was assumed that the supply of ME was derived from pasture growth and supplement fed. Using key livestock management dates and measurements of liveweights, the changes in the energy requirements of each class of animal were calculated and aggregated to provide an estimate of overall livestock energy demand over time. Subtracting the energy demand fro...|$|E
40|$|Pasture land {{represents}} an important {{portion of the}} total land in southern Iowa. One opportunity for increasing resource productivity and farm incomes {{in this part of}} the state is to invest capital in pasture improvement. Experiments show that capital invested in <b>pasture</b> improvement and <b>renovation,</b> and the livestock to utilize the increased forage production, can greatly increase the value of products produced on land unadapted to continuous cropping; yields of forage and livestock products can be increased as much as threefold. However, the practices of improving and renovating pastures are proceeding at a slow rate. One reason suggested is capital limitations. Most farmers operate with limited funds. Accordingly, if they are to make greatest profits, they must use each dollar, acre and labor hour where it will bring the greatest return. The question is not so much whether <b>pasture</b> improvement and <b>renovation</b> is profitable; but whether it is more profitable than alternative uses of scarce capital and labor. For example, pasture improvement may cost $ 5 per year and return $ 8 In the same period. It is profitable in this sense: Each $ 1 In costs returns $ 1. 60 in sales. However, if the same $ 1 invested in fertilizer for crops or in hogs returns $ 1. 80, pasture improvement should not be included in the farming plan until these more profitable opportunities have been fully exploited. It should, of course, be included before other investments which return less than $ 1. 60...|$|R
40|$|Eastern Nebraska and {{neighboring}} areas have {{large amounts of}} depleted pastures which consist of annual bromegrasses (Bromus spp.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poapratensis L.), and numerous broadleaf weeds. Such <b>pastures</b> need <b>renovation</b> but complete seedbed preparation is expensive and may enhance erosion.

Three weedy pastures in southeast Nebraska on a Hastings silty clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Udic Argiustoll), a Lamo silty clay loam [fine-silty, mixed (calcareous), mesic Cumulic Haplaquoll], and a Geary silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Udic Argiustoll) were sprayed with sod suppressing herbicides and sod-seeded with intermediate wheatgrass [Agropyron intermedium (Host) Beauv. ] or switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Spring herbicide treatments consisted of atrazine [2 -chloro- 4 -(ethyl-amino) - 6 -(isopropylamino) - s-triazine] plus paraquat (1, 12 ̆ 7 dimethyl- 4, 42 ̆ 7 bypyridinium ion) broadcast and banded at 0. 3 + 2. 2 kg/ha, respectively, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] broadcast and banded at 1. 1 and 2. 2 kg/ha, and paraquat broadcast at 0. 3 or 0. 6 kg/ha.

40|$|Precision irrigation, by definition, reduces {{water losses}} and {{increases}} water productivity from irrigated land. This is required as global freshwater scarcity continues to escalate. The concept of precision irrigation {{can be applied}} simply and without technology in lower income regions. However, research shows that significant benefits are gained when precision sensor mapping is used to define soil spatial variability, derive management classes, guide placement of sensors for monitoring, and provide timely information for precision irrigation scheduling. Results from research trials on commercial farms using variable-rate sprinkler irrigation systems with individual nozzle and speed control, used with sensor mapping and monitoring technologies indicate water savings (typically 5 – 30 %, depending {{on the degree of}} variability), a major reduction of irrigation-related drainage events, and positive or neutral impact on crop yield. The systems are also used innovatively by farmers for flexible management (e. g. multiple crops under one system; <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> of small irregular areas, precision grazing).

The Cicerone Project {{began as}} a producer-led {{partnership}} that sought, {{over a period of}} 8 years, to enhance the profitability and sustainability of livestock enterprises by improving the connection between those producers, research and extension. Following a detailed survey, the research and extension needs of livestock producers were identified and several applied investigations were conducted to meet those needs and delivered through a range of extension activities. This final paper of the Cicerone Special Issue reflects on the entire Project from a wide array of perspectives, including livestock producers, researchers, extension specialists and staff employed by the Project, all of whom are authors of this paper.

40|$|International audienceForest {{ecosystems}} of Brazilian Amazonia are {{cleared to}} allow livestock production. Deforestation contributes significantly {{to climate change}} and losses of biodiversity. Degradation by scrubs reduces pasture productivity after a few years, thus leading farmers to deforest new areas. For this reason, sustaining cultivated pastures is of major importance for cattle farms. Intensive pasture management techniques have been proposed to the farmers, with little success so far. Our hypothesis is that these techniques are not implemented by farmers due to weak work organisation. Here, we assessed the diversity of forage system work of dairy farms in a municipality on the Transamazon Highway. We analysed factors explaining the adoption of intensive pasture management techniques. We monitored seven dairy farms, with a specific work assessment approach to build synthetic qualification variables and an interview of 29 dairy farmers to characterise the diversity of forage system work. Our results show four tasks related to their technical content: <b>pasture</b> maintenance, <b>renovation,</b> land maintenance and exceptional work. The total duration of work is variable, from 17 to 278 days per year, depending on the technical management choices. Some farmers are autonomous in carrying out the work, but in several cases, wage workers may contribute significantly, from 33 to 100 %. We identified five types of forage system work. They oppose very simplified technical management carried out in autonomy by the family workforce to intensive techniques based on {{a high level of}} delegation to permanent wage workers. The results show that forage system work is related to the technical management choices and distribution of work between farmers and permanent wage workers. Forage system work also depends on the amount of work dedicated to the dairy herd, the role of milk in the farm, and the weight of other farming and non-farming activities. Finally, intensive pasture management techniques are linked to a high quantity of work with pasture maintenance, hired permanent workers and specialised dairy farms...|$|R

The experiment was conducted in a randomized block with 4 replications, with treatments being 8 coexistence periods: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 days after emergence. A phytosociological assessment of the weed community was carried {{out at the end}} of the coexistence periods, and weeds were eliminated from the appropriate treatment using herbicide. Key morphogenic parameters of the forages were assessed at the end of the experimental period and dry matter production was determined. Results indicated that the presence of weeds had negative impacts on the main morphogenic components, such as plant height, number of tillers and production of leaf and stem dry matter. The presence of weeds reduced productivity in Marandu, with 15 days competition being sufficient to reduce forage production by approximately 50 %, suggesting that weed control measures should be adopted within 15 days following emergence of seedlings of Marandu and weeds.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 50 th New Zealand Grassland Association Conference, 1 - 3 November 1988, Balclutha. Hill <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> methods have been restricted {{in the past to}} surface oversowing of unaltered, trampled or burnt pastures. Unfortunately the old pasture recovers and may compete vigorously with the establishing new species, slowing pasture improvement. The availability of suitable herbicides has opened up a new opportunity for hill pasture development. Herbicide applied before oversowing can minimise the competition and allow the new species to establish more easily. The benefits include reduced time to attain optimal stocking rates and improved establishment control, but these are offset by higher initial costs. The technical aspects of the herbicide establishment methods are overshadowed by the economic factors which control the profitability of the programme, however successfully applied. As the cash flow patterns differ between the traditional renovation and the herbicide based techniques, changes in interest rates and prices have differential effects. Real interest rates below 7 % make both methods profitable but are more favourable to the herbicide technique at 1987 prices, Also, price increases favour the herbicide method. Among other issues affecting the speed and profitability of development and ultimate gain, management skill is found to be crucial and dominates both establishment methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract approved: No-till <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> can {{increase}} the quality and forage yield of underproductive pastures. Decreased erosion, lower costs, and less lost grazing time are advantages of no-till renovation compared to conventional renovation. Unwanted vegetation is first controlled with herbicides to decrease competition for introduced orchardgrass. Two field trials were conducted using a split-plot design to compare three seeding methods and two herbicides. An Aerway no-till drill, a Tye double disk drill, and broadcast followed by harrowing were the seeding methods. Paraquat and glyphosate {{were used to determine}} herbicide effect on vegetation control. Orchardgrass did not adequately survive at either trial site. However, where some orchardgrass did survive, vegetation control was more important than seeding method. Competition from annual grasses, many germinating after herbicides were applied, was the reason for renovation failure. Herbicide Redacted for Privacy and initial growth for best control. Yield was doubled in the first harvest by the addition of fertilizer. Early spring forage production from poor pastures is usually more than adequate, so the increase from fertilizer is of marginal value unless it is stored for later use. Yield increase did not carry over to the second harvest when it could be better utilized. Later application dates would extend yield increases from certain species if water is available...|$|E

A board of {{directors}} operates the farm {{for the purpose of}} demonstrating different production practices and management strategies. From 1996 to 1998 management intensive grazing practices and the grazing of stockers on a combination of permanent and tillable pasture have been demonstrated. Grazing strategies or practices demonstrated during these years included establishment of Eastern Gamagrass and Big Bluestem, variable density grazing, measuring forage on-offer, estimating dry matter intake, grazing corn, <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation,</b> and fencing and water systems. Production performance data were gathered for the three years stockers that were grazed. During this time the stockers averaged 121 animal days of grazing, a 1. 1 head per acre stocking rate, a 1. 85 pound average daily gain, and 228 pounds of gain per acre. The financial measures evaluated the value of gain on pasture and the pasture cost of the gain. The value of gain per pound was positive for 1996 and 1997 at $. 58 and $. 52 whereas in 1998 it was a -$. 04. Pasture costs per pound of gain ranged from $. 12 to $. 16.

40|$|No- tillage {{and reduced}} tillage {{have been used}} since ancient times by {{indigenous}} cultures, simply because man has not the muscle force to till any significant area of land to a significant depth by hand. The ancient Egyptians and the Incas in the Andes of South America for example, used a stick to make {{a hole in the}} ground and put seeds by hand into unprepared soil. In modern, mechanised agriculture, no- tillage cultivation of crops was attempted long time ago, but it was not until the advent of modern herbicides that the technique could be put into practice. Back in the 1940 s Edward Faulkner induced a change to eliminate tillage by the plough and reduce tillage in his famous book "Plowman's Folly " (1943). According to Phillips and Phillips (1984) attention was diverted to reduced tillage in the late 1940 s with the introduction of plant growth regulators developed during World War II. Klingman, in North Carolina in the late 1940 s reported on no-tillage practice. In 1951, K. C. Barrons, J. H. Davidson and C. D.

40|$|Land {{clearing}} {{has been}} the traditional tool for creating greater agricultural production since time began. All who consume {{the products of the}} land, in whatever form, are part of the sacrifice, willing or not, of biodiversity to generate sustenance and wealth (Declaration of Madrid, 2001). The farmer is omnipresent in areas which produce food and fibre and in many where timber is a product; he should be encouraged to become a “steward of the land”, receiving environmental services payments for this responsibility. These are not subsidies, first because the off-farm benefits to society of ZT adoption (achieved, overwhelmingly, at the farmer´s expense) generate huge social transfers and, second, the WTO regulations do not classify these payments as such. The mitigation potential of land use intensification with integrated ZT crop x livestock systems (ICLZT), can vary between 0. 8 and 2. 5 ha of reduced demand for land clearing for each hectare in the system. By using a ZT crop ley for two to four years, the cost of <b>pasture</b> <b>renovation</b> is defrayed and pasture carrying capacity is trebled, from an average of about 0. 7 animal units (AU) /ha to over 2 AU/ha.

The study also shows higher net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) values accompanying this new technology. Brazil has now established a national programme for ICLZT. Financial and other incentives, such as farmer and technician training, good technical backstopping from on-farm-research and preferential access to credit, are required to overcome the initial risk of change and incremental investments required to adopt the new technology. Recommendations are made for a fiscal package which emphasizes the “carrot” approach, but which sharpens the “stick”, when necessary. Also proposed are international credit projects for large-scale adoption of ICLZT systems...|$|E
