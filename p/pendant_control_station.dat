40|$|The {{function}} of the Automatic Telephone Dialling System is to detect any sort of alarm such as fire, equipment failure, burglary. It then has to transmit the alarm information over the switched telephone network to a <b>Control</b> <b>Station,</b> where the alarm information is displayed. The attending personnel can then take the appropriate action. The Dialling system designed and constructed in this thesis consists of two parts: the Alarm Unit and the <b>Control</b> <b>Station.</b> As soon as an alarm occurs, the Alarm Unit selects the first available telephone number of the <b>Control</b> <b>Station</b> and dials the number. Using Frequency Shift Keying method, the Alarm Unit transmits the information identifying itself and the alarm to the <b>Control</b> <b>Station.</b> Initiate and Acknowledge Signalling as well as error checking ensure correct data transmission. Data re-transmissions and rediallings take place until successful transmission is acknowledged. A micro-program rather than a hardwired control logic is used in each the Alarm Unit and the <b>Control</b> <b>Station</b> for <b>controlling</b> their operations. The Central Processing Unit has been designed using MSI components. A microprocessor was not used because, {{at the time of}} the commencement of the project, its cost was high. Nevertheless the design was microprocessor - oriented, so that a microprocessor can be adopted in the future. A prototype was implemented using CMOS technology. This offers the advantages of lower power dissipation and higher noise immunity when compared with existing technologies such as TTL. Automatic gain control amplifiers and filters are used in the system to compensate for transmission line losses and reduce noise influence on information reception. Provision has been made so that, if a number of alarms occur at the same time at the Alarm Unit, they will be transmitted sequentially. At the <b>Control</b> <b>Station,</b> apart from displaying current alarm, memory space is provided for queueing the received alarms. System testing can be carried out at the push of a button from either the Alarm Unit or the <b>Control</b> <b>Station.</b> The test routine involves the same sequence of operations as in the case of an alarm, thus enhancing the thoroughness of the test. The system is expandable to any desired number of Alarm Units and <b>Control</b> <b>Stations.</b> With a system of this type, if one <b>Control</b> <b>Station</b> is busy, an a Alarm Unit can be programmed to attempt communicating with another <b>Control</b> <b>Station...</b>|$|R
