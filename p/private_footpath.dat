Within the estate borders are a mixture of public and <b>private</b> roads, <b>footpaths</b> and open areas. [...] It adjoins along a long border the long row of its village's shops, restaurants and other amenities, which {{is laid out}} upon similar lines but has many 21st century converted mansion and newly built apartments.|$|R

The {{homes of the}} community are nestled amongst the steep, narrow <b>private</b> roads and <b>footpaths</b> that extend from the redwood groves and ferns along the creek, through the mixed live oak, bay, and madrone forests on the steep hillsides, up to the chaparral and knobcone pines that grow along the ridge.|$|R
50|$|Two Coves is {{the name}} given to the new {{residential}} development at Duporth. It comprises two, three, four and five bedroom houses and apartments in the traditional Cornish style. Estate access is being maintained to Duporth beach via a lockable gate with security coding. However, there is also direct public access from the South West Coast Path. Both from Charlestown {{to the north and}} Porthpean in the south; many steps are involved in either direction. Residents on the Duporth Bay residential development now also have their own <b>private</b> (gated) <b>footpath</b> access via numerous steps to the northern beach end. This affords pedestrian access to Charlestown (over boulders) but only safely around low tide times.|$|R

Jepson's Farm and Jepson's Gate are waypoints en route to Pikestones. The last occupants of Old Rachel's were the Evans family in the 1880s. Simms is located on a <b>private</b> track and <b>footpath.</b> The property which got its water from Green Withins Brook, {{a tributary of the}} River Yarrow, was occupied by the Chairman of Horwich Urban District Council in 1928-29.|$|R
50|$|The ‘D House’ {{built in}} New Farm, Queensland in 2000 for an {{unpublished}} client attempts {{to address the}} concept of the urban subdivision’s isolation through its design. It aims to show that individuality can still be obtained thought objective design solutions to re-parameterise the concept of urban living.To address this is a large ‘public’ room that faces and opens to a <b>private,</b> fence-less <b>footpath</b> and then to the streetscape via long window in conjunction with transitional common areas and open terraces. Concurrent with some other Donovan Hill Houses is the apparent illusion and subsequent realization of the capacity and program within the building. For example, some mistake the D House for a café due to the large opening from the ‘public’ room - in this way it directly responds to its vernacular (Vernacular architecture)and its design objectives. The design is more concerned with the streetscape and its position relative to add to the public life instead of focusing on picturesque qualities so that people may find it an enriching experience for the public domain.|$|R
