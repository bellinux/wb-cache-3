50|$|Polished <b>plaster</b> is a {{term for}} the finish of some <b>plasters</b> and for the {{description}} of new and updated forms of traditional Italian <b>plaster</b> finishes. The term covers {{a whole range of}} decorative <b>plaster</b> finishes—from the very highly polished Venetian <b>plaster</b> and Marmorino to the rugged look of textured polished <b>plasters.</b> Polished <b>plaster</b> itself tends to consist of slaked lime, marble dust, and/or marble chips, which give each <b>plaster</b> its distinctive look. A lime-based polished <b>plaster</b> may contain over 40% of marble powder.|$|R

This injury sidelined him until August.|$|E
5|$|Most urban {{apartment}} buildings and villas {{continued to be}} built in the classical tradition, with <b>plastered</b> brick walls. The repertoire of historic styles was expanded in Homansbyen, Oslo's first residential development of detached villas, planned by Georg Andreas Bull. He designed most of the early villas built from 1858 until 1862 in a variety of styles, ranging from medieval to classicist and exotic.|$|E

5|$|The {{limestone}} {{used for}} construction was local and quarried on-site. The depressions {{formed by the}} extraction of stone for building were <b>plastered</b> to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs, together with some waterproofed natural depressions. The main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|The nests, built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud <b>plastered</b> to cave entrances or rocky {{outcrops}} in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E
5|$|Work {{planned for}} 1985 {{included}} {{the replacement of}} the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails.

50|$|Forms of <b>plaster</b> {{have several}} other uses. In {{medicine}} <b>plaster</b> orthopedic casts are still {{often used for}} supporting set broken bones. In dentistry <b>plaster</b> is used to make dental models. Various types of models and moulds are made with <b>plaster.</b> In art, lime <b>plaster</b> is the traditional matrix for fresco painting; the pigments are applied to a thin wet top layer of <b>plaster</b> and fuse with {{it so that the}} painting is actually in coloured <b>plaster.</b> In the ancient world, as well as the sort of ornamental designs in <b>plaster</b> relief that are still used, <b>plaster</b> was also widely used to create large figurative reliefs for walls, though few of these have survived.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plaster</b> {{spraying}} {{allows a}} plasterer to skim a drywall {{more than five}} times faster than using a hand float to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based <b>plaster</b> can be sprayed if it is [...] "spray grade," [...] most <b>plaster</b> sprayers prefer the organic-based pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> packaged in a plastic bag because the <b>plaster</b> spraying machine {{does not need to be}} cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that <b>plaster</b> is kept moist. The pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the <b>plaster</b> from powder. A drywall skimmed with pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.|$|R
5|$|Excavations {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were <b>plastered</b> roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the outside was made from a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was <b>plastered</b> by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and <b>plastered</b> with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the capital}} Halab {{has not been}} excavated, the {{architecture}} of the kingdom is archaeologically best represented by the city of Alalakh, which was subordinate to Halab and ruled by a king belonging to the Yamhadite royal house. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian-era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and <b>plastered</b> walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor. Evidence exists for the presence of Minoan Aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes {{on the walls of the}} palaces in Alalakh.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} of the tel {{has revealed}} a small settlement, {{the only one}} of that period in eastern Arabia, on its northern side. It has been inferred that the village was settled by people who developed agriculture near the oasis, planted palm trees, tended cattle, sheep and goats and also ventured into fishing in the Arabian Sea. The small houses they built were made of rough stone with clay or mortar as binding material. The <b>plastered</b> floors in the houses were said to have been spacious. Excavations also hinted that the village had streets which separated the housing complexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{main entry}} {{gate to the}} tomb is two-storied and its façade has very {{elaborate}} ornamentation over <b>plastered</b> surfaces and is in ornate purple colour.

The rear side of the façade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and the library. To the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three-domed structure marked with stripes.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} best-understood mansio {{was built on}} a stone base about 130CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a {{colonnade}} with a tiled roof, probably supported on wooden columns. In {{the centre of the}} colonnade, a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a <b>plastered</b> floor, the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden. Timber posts resting on these foundations {{around the edges of the}} colonnade supported a balcony above.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied {{structure}} is rectangular in plan. The portico has four Ionic columns with fluted stems and cabbage leaf capitals. The front gables {{of the building}} have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The {{lower part of the}} exterior walls are made of <b>plastered</b> brick. The upper windows have semi-circular French windows, with pilasters on both sides. In 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace's walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer's club.|$|E
5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling. The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or <b>plastered,</b> as slots in the {{principals}} show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476–1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete sapwood. The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof).|$|E
