40|$|Preforming is {{required}} for complex shaped profiles manufactured in liquid composite moulding (LCM) processes. The stacking is made of dry fiber fabrics, which are infiltrated in a later process step. The complete stacking is called preform. The fixing of the textile layers can be realised through stitching or binder technology. The main disadvantage is the immense rate of manual work within the <b>preform</b> <b>process.</b> In consequence, the manufacturing is costly {{in terms of time}} and high effort for quality control. Automated preforming can reduce the costs by increasing the output and production rate while minimising waste. Preform profiles with variable outlines and non-extrudable sections are of particular interest for the aviation and automotive industry.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} decade, {{hydroformed}} structural components {{have been widely}} used in industrial areas in North American and Europe and there is a large potential market in Asia with the development of automotive industry. An extraordinary feature of tube hydroforming is that a hollow component with a three dimension axis and variable closed-sections can be integrally formed, so that the number of component parts is minimized, weight is reduced and stiffness of the part is increased. The section shapes in many automotive hollow components are complex and it is usually difficult or impossible to hydroform these typical sections directly from circular section tube, so that satisfactory preforms are necessary. In this paper, a method to reduce the friction and calibration pressure through a petal-like cross-section shape preform is presented and its mechanism is analyzed. Preforms for rectangular, trapezoidal and polygonal sections used in hollow components are investigated and satisfactory preforms are obtained. Taking an engine cradle as example, satisfactory preform section shapes have been designed, by which the thickness distribution was controlled and the flash generated from the die-parting surface in the final forming was avoided. So a carefully selected <b>preform</b> <b>process</b> can contribute significantly to the reduction of friction and calibration pressure and it is a dominant factor for successful hydroforming...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{finite element}} code, in modular form, has been {{developed}} to model the complete three-dimensional resin film infusion (RFI) process. The problem formulation and its analysis incorporate compaction of the anisotropic elastic porous preform, elastic deformations of the tooling components, heat transfer in the resin, flow of resin through the preform, cure kinetics of the resin, and the heat transfer between the tools and the surrounding environment in the autoclave. The inertia effects and the transfer of heat by convection have been neglected. Two techniques, namely the slideline algorithm and a compliant layer interface, are used to model the possible sliding of the tool over the preform at their common interfaces. Weak forms are derived for (a) the initial-boundary-value problem corresponding to the transient thermal problem, (b) the boundary-value problem for the fluid through an elastic porous medium, and (c) the boundary-value problems for the quasistatic deformations of the tooling components and for a partially or fully saturated porous elastic preform. The finite element method is used to solve these equations, and the flow front is located by using a control volume technique. Computed results are presented for a stiffened T-panel and a two-stiffener panel. KEY WORDS: resin film infusion, composite manufacturing, textile <b>preform,</b> <b>process</b> modeling...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{improvements}} in the photosensitivity of undoped POFs, {{where there was a}} welldefined pre-annealing of both preforms in two-step process, were reported. We have noticed that when the primary and secondary preforms are annealed, the fiber photosensitivity is higher; otherwise, if any preform (primary or secondary) is not annealed, the fiber photosensitivity is lower. Two PMMA mPOFs are used where the primary and secondary preforms, during the two-step drawing process, have a different thermal treatment. The PMMA POFs drawn where the primary or secondary preform is not specifically pre-treat need longer inscription time than the fibres drawn where both preforms have been pre-annealed at 80 °C for 2 weeks. Using two different UV lasers, for the latter fibre much less inscription time is needed compared to another homemade POF. The properties of a POF fabricated where there are both <b>preform</b> <b>process</b> with thermal treatment is different from those where just one preform step process is thermal treated, as previously shown in the literature, where these POFs are much less sensitive to thermal treatment.

Lightweight design {{can be reached}} by the use of composite materials, which have low specific weight. Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) are especially suited for air frame production. Full exploitation of the composite’s potential requires a specialized design. One aspect of such a design is a fiber orientation that accounts for the dimensioning load case. Regarding cost efficient manufacturing processes, resin transfer moulding (RTM) using low-cost non-crimp fabrics (NCF) is a very promising option.

On the ncf a powder binder is applied. During the process of binder activation the binder powder is heated under pressure until it melts and then cooled down. As a result plies can be fixed to each other respectivly consolidated. Consolidation {{with the help of a}} membrane press is energy inefficient and time consuming, since membrane and tool are heated as well. In this paper it is investigated whether a roll electrode has the ability to replace a conventional consolidation press. Since a roll electrode applies heat and pressure at the same time a consolidation is possible. In this process the carbon fibers are heated by an electric current. In contrast to state of the art electrical resistance heating, the voltage is applied in through-thickness direction. In order to have a homogeneous temperature distribution the parameters pressure, roll width, number of fiber layers and activation speed was varied in a full-factorial experimental plan. Ultrasonic fine-trimming of roll-electrode consolidated preforms was investigated. Also the fiber volume content of the preform was measured with the help of a laser light sheet sensor and compared to specimen of a consolidation press...|$|R
40|$|With {{regard to}} {{cost-efficient}} lightweight design {{there is an}} obvious trend to join different materials resulting in hybrid structures, such as joining metal with CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) structures. In {{order to reduce the}} gap in stiffness between the metal and CFRP structure a thermoplastic polymer component can be inserted, which is capable to fulfil additional functional properties. To characterise the used materials and defects in the hybrid, nondestructive testing (NDT) approaches in combination with mechanical testing are shown. Especially the interface between the metal structure and the thermoplastic polymer component as well as the interface between the thermoplastic polymer component and the CFRP structure are investigated because previous works have shown for adhesively joints that cracks initialising within the adhesive zone lead to ultimate failure by fracture of the CFRP ply adjacent to the adhesive. Thus ultimate failure of the hybrid joint is significantly determinated by the crack resistance of the CFRP. Therefore investigations will be presented with active thermography and ultrasonic (US) testing on CFRP samples with defined defects, which are artificially implanted within the <b>preforming</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore passive thermography during mechanical testing will be applied to characterise the effect of the artificial defects in the CFRP samples whilst loading. By combining different NDT methods, the characterisation of defects shall be improved. Additionally electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT) are used to evaluate the quality of the adhesive bonding of the metal and the thermoplastic polymer component...|$|R
