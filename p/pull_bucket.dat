50|$|Reiko realises {{that the}} phone did not ring when Ryuji and Yoichi watched the tape, {{but it did}} when she watched it. After {{threading}} everything together, Reiko and Ryuji return to the holiday resort and discover a well, {{as seen in the}} video, under the cabin Reiko and Tomoko had both stayed at. Ryuji climbs down the well and they try to empty the well enough to look for Sadako's body, believing that if they find Sadako's body and lay her to rest, they will break the curse and save Yoichi. However, Reiko's deadline approaches, and she becomes too tired to <b>pull</b> up the <b>buckets</b> of water from the well. Ryuji decides it's time to trade places, so he tells her to go down the well and he can <b>pull</b> the <b>buckets</b> up instead. Reiko goes down the well but decides to look for Sadako rather than help empty the well. She feels around the bottom and discovers a chunk of Sadako's hair, and rather than her finding Sadako, Sadako finds her, as her hand grabs her wrist as she had in the vision. However, Reiko does not panic and finds that it is merely the skeleton remains of Sadako's body. The deadline passes and Reiko appears to be saved.|$|R

He parked {{in full view of}} many high-end, top-dollar customs and proceeded to <b>pull</b> out a <b>bucket</b> of paint and some brushes. Many spectators stopped to watch, and a few even joined Jake as he painted the car.|$|R
2500|$|The tub {{boats were}} hauled {{up and let}} down the {{inclined}} planes by chains which were operated in most cases by waterwheels; the transit took five minutes or so. There were standby steam engines {{at some of the}} inclined planes. However the Hobbacott Inclined Plane (both the steepest and that allowing the greatest height difference) used a different system of harnessing water power: water filled a very large bucket and it was simply the weight of the water that pulled the ascending tub boat up the incline. The bucket operated in a deep vertical shaft, and at the bottom a plug was opened and the water ran to waste along an adit which connected to the lower level of the canal; the descending <b>bucket</b> <b>pulled</b> an empty <b>bucket</b> up in the same operation. The full bucket had to be heavy enough to pull a loaded tub boat up the 1 in 4½ gradient as well as overcoming friction, and Green calculated that a weight of about fifteen tons was necessary. This was successful, and the bucket raised a boat up the plane in about four minutes, which was about one half of the time taken when the [...] standby steam engine was used.|$|R
2500|$|On Wednesday, June 18, 1873, a crewman on Fannie Patton, Norman Warner, aged 16, was drowned when he {{had tried}} to draw water from the river using a bucket.

5000|$|This time, {{the team}} took turns for each match, {{and the team}} had 60 seconds to find all seven matches. The first four matches were worth $100 apiece; the other three matches awarded prizes, with the grand prize being awarded for all seven matches (on this version, {{it was not always}} a trip). The {{unpaired}} locker contained the [...] "Red Herring", which was simply a character with no match. At some point during the run (after any of the first six matches), the Red Herring would be opened. At that point, the contestant had to [...] "yank on the Herring Handle", a cord suspended {{in the center of the}} room; the team did not get credit for a match, but they were then able to continue to the next character. When this handle was <b>pulled,</b> a <b>bucket</b> of red plastic fish toys (ostensibly [...] "herrings") was dropped on the character while his/her door was being closed. The lockers that were still able to open had the lights on (located on the buttons).|$|R

Later on, Donald yells at his nephews from a snow battleship, that he created, while his nephews simply mock him from their snow fortress. Donald starts a small barrage of snowballs, which results the nephews into becoming like bowling pins, waiting for Donald to strike them out. Donald then <b>pulls</b> out a <b>bucket</b> of water, dips a snow chunk in it, and creates an ice ammunition (called [...] "Big Bertha" [...] by Donald.) He launches it and it splits his nephews' flagpole in three spots, [...] "spanking" [...] all three of them.|$|R
25|$|Thirty-seven of {{the wells}} were built {{on or near}} {{existing}} Aboriginal waters and were constructed in the European tradition, which made many of them inaccessible to Aboriginal people. <b>Pulling</b> the heavy <b>buckets</b> {{up from the bottom}} of the wells required the strength of three men or use of a camel. Consequentially, many Aboriginal people were injured or died while trying to access the water, either falling in and drowning or breaking bones on the windlass handle. In reprisal, buckets were cut off or timber set on fire, and by 1917 Aboriginal people had vandalised or dismantled approximately half of the wells in a bid to reclaim access to the water or to prevent drovers from using the wells. Canning's party had constructed the wells with the forced help of one of the Aboriginal peoples whose land the route traversed, the Martu.|$|R
50|$|The shadoof {{consists}} of an upright frame on which is suspended a long pole or branch, {{at a distance of}} about one-fifth of its length from one end. At the long end of this pole hangs a bucket, skin bag, or bitumen-coated reed basket. The bucket can be made in many different styles, sometimes having an uneven base or a part {{at the top of the}} skin that can be untied. This allows the water to be immediately distributed rather than manually emptied. The short end carries a weight (clay, stone, or similar) which serves as the counterpoise of a lever. When correctly balanced, the counterweight will support a half-filled bucket, so some effort is used to <b>pull</b> an empty <b>bucket</b> down to the water, but only the same effort is needed to lift a full bucket.|$|R
5000|$|At the prom, Desjardin {{talks with}} Carrie {{about her own}} prom night and later, congratulates her for being voted Prom Queen.

When Chris <b>pulls</b> it both <b>buckets</b> tip over, drenching them with pigs' blood. Desjardin reflexively responds to the prank by laughing. However, she later tries to help Carrie, who pushes her aside with her telekinesis, because she telepathically sees that deep down Miss Desjardin is still laughing at her. Once outside, Carrie uses her gift to wreak havoc on the school {{with the intention of}} killing everyone in the gymnasium. She then destroys the entire town on the way home. Desjardin {{is one of the few}} survivors of the [...] "Black Prom".|$|R

50|$|After the {{shooting}} Frylock and Carl take Lambert {{to see a}} magic show by Unbelievable Ron, to help alleviate his boredom, {{which he had been}} expressing throughout the episode. During Ron's performance he accidentally kills his assistant by cutting her in half. Ron uses his powers to turn witnesses in the audience into birds, including Lambert. During the commotion the two police officers return and arrest Frylock and Carl for the murder of Lambert. 35 years in the future Meatwad is visiting Frylock in prison. Frylock explains that Meatwad needs to track down Lambert (in the form of five white birds) to get him and Carl exonerated. Meatwad responds by <b>pulling</b> out a <b>bucket</b> of fried chicken, which annoys Frylock. As the on-screen closing credits start Frylock explains that Meatwad can use the remaining shampoo to become immortal himself. Meatwad asks if they would be on TV forever and Frylock confidently answers yes, before the screen abruptly cuts to the Williams Street production card.|$|R
5000|$|Homer {{receives}} {{a letter from}} Springfield University inviting him to an upcoming reunion party, where Dean Bobby Peterson reveals it is actually a fundraiser for the college's football team and forcibly takes all of the attendees' money. As revenge, Homer decides to pull a prank on Dean Peterson with his old nerd friends, Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. He tries to put a bucket filled with glue on the Dean's head, but another fraternity had already hung another bucket full of glue over the door; it falls on Homer's head, and he cannot get it off. He tries to drive with holes cut in the bucket over his eyes, but he drives the family off course [...] - [...] to a religious revival, hosted by a faith healer named Brother Faith, where Bart <b>pulls</b> the <b>bucket</b> off Homer's head. Brother Faith considers this act a sign that Bart has [...] "the power" [...] of healing. Lisa is skeptical and attempts to use reason to explain that the hot stage lights heated the metal bucket, causing the glue to liquefy and thus loosen, {{while at the same}} time expanding the bucket and allowing Bart to pull it off. Undaunted, Bart becomes a faith healer, pulls miracles of his own, and even forms his own church which massively outdraws Reverend Lovejoy's congregation on its first day of operation. There, Bart heals Springfield's residents (when in fact, his demonstrations for the day consist of punching Grandpa in his paining artificial hip, Professor Frink where he had been suffering a cramp in his back, and slapping Patty's cigarette out of her mouth).|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} corvids {{have been trained}} to use tools in {{controlled}} experiments. One species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the New Caledonian crow. One individual called “Betty” spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to <b>pull</b> a little <b>bucket</b> of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it {{at the bottom of the}} well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and unsticking it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the straight wire first.|$|R

NkMa and NkMaDa are discussing who out of the two is going to climb the tree to get the honey out of the bee hive. Then, the two string the smoking branches together using part of a vine as rope. Eventually, NkMaDa climbs the tree, equipped with another vine attached to his arm which he will use to <b>pull</b> up the <b>bucket</b> {{that is used to}} transport the honey. NkMa follows him; NkDoRe makes sure the smoking branches are well tied to be transported up the tree. NkMaDa pulls the branches up and smokes the bees out of their hive. In the meantime, NkNaMa is squabbling with her grandchildren who are teasing her and making fun of her. Eventually, a bucket and a machete are transported ip the tree to get the honeycombs out of the hive and transport them down the tree. When the first parts of the honeycombs fall down, NkAdJo explains that the Bagyeli make candles from the wax. He then picks up the first edible honeycombs that have fallen down and begins to eat...|$|R
60|$|When {{they had}} been at work about five weeks there was a pole stuck into their heap of dirt, and {{on the top of}} the pole there was a little red flag flying. At about thirty feet from the surface, when they had already been obliged to insert {{transverse}} logs in the shaft to prevent the sides from falling in, they had come upon a kind of soil altogether different from the ordinary clay through which {{they had been}} working. There was a stratum of loose shingle or gravelly earth, running apparently in a sloping direction, taking the decline of the very slight hill on which their claim was situated. Mick, as soon as this was brought to light, became an altered man. The first bucket of this stuff that was pulled up was deposited by him separately, and he at once sat down to wash it. This he did in an open tin pan. Handful after handful he washed, shifting and teasing it about in the pan, and then he cast it out, always leaving some very small residuum. He was intent upon his business to a degree that Caldigate would have thought to be beyond the man's nature. With extreme patience he went on washing handful after handful all the day, while the other two <b>pulled</b> up fresh <b>buckets</b> of the same stuff. He would not pause to eat, or hardly to talk. At last there came a loud exclamation. 'By------, we've got it!' Then Dick and Caldigate, stooping down, were shown four or five little specks in the angle of the pan's bottom. Before the sun had set they had stuck up their little red flag, and a crowd of neighbours was standing round them asking questions as to their success.|$|R
6000|$|While Tip {{was still}} in his prime the family of {{children}} was further enriched by the possession of a goat; but this did not belong to the whole family, or it was, at least nominally, the property of that eldest brother they all looked up to. I do not know how they came by the goat, any more than I know how they came by Tip; I only know that there came {{a time when it was}} already in the family, and that before it was got rid of it was a presence there was no mistaking. Nobody who has not kept a goat can have any notion of how many different kinds of mischief a goat can get into, without seeming to try, either, but merely by following the impulses of its own goatishness. This one was a nanny-goat, and it answered to the name of Nanny with an intelligence that was otherwise wholly employed in making trouble. It went up and down stairs, from cellar to garret, and in and out of all the rooms, like anybody, with a faint, cynical indifference in the glance of its cold gray eyes that gave no hint of its purposes or performances. In the chambers it chewed the sheets and pillow-cases on the beds, and in the dining-room, if it found nothing else, it would do its best to eat the table-cloth. Washing-day was a perfect feast for it, for then it would banquet on the shirt-sleeves and stockings that dangled from the clothes-line, and simply glut itself with the family linen and cotton. In default of these dainties, Nanny would gladly eat a chip-hat; she was not proud; she would eat a split-basket, if there was nothing else at hand. Once she got up on the kitchen table, and had a perfect orgy with a lot of fresh-baked pumpkin-pies she found there; she cleaned all the pumpkin so neatly out of the pastry shells that, if there had been any more pumpkin left, they could have been filled up again, and nobody could have told the difference. The grandmother, who was visiting in the house at the time, declared to the mother that it would serve the father and the boys just right if she did fill these very shells up and give them to the father and the boys to eat. But I believe this was not done, and it was only suggested in a moment of awful exasperation, and because it was the father who was to blame for letting the boys keep the goat. The mother was always saying that the goat should not stay in the house another day, but she had not the heart to insist on its banishment, the children were so fond of it. I do not know why they were fond of it, for it never showed them the least affection, but was always taking the most unfair advantages of them, and it would butt them over whenever it got the chance. It would try to butt them into the well when they leaned down to <b>pull</b> up the <b>bucket</b> from the curb; and if it came out of the house, and saw a boy cracking nuts at the low flat stone the children had in the back-yard to crack nuts on, it would pretend that the boy was making motions to insult it, and before he knew what he was about it would fly at him and send him spinning head over heels. It was not of the least use in the world, and could not be, but the children were allowed to keep it till, one fatal day, when the mother had a number of other ladies to tea, as the fashion used to be in small towns, when they sat down to a comfortable gossip over dainty dishes of stewed chicken, hot biscuit, peach-preserves, sweet tomato-pickles, and pound-cake. That day they all laid off their bonnets on the hall table, and the goat, after demurely waiting and watching with its faded eyes, which saw everything and seemed to see nothing, discerned a golden opportunity, and began to make such a supper of bonnet-ribbons as perhaps never fell to a goat's lot in life before. It was detected in its stolen joys just as it had chewed the ribbon of a best bonnet up to the bonnet, and was chased into the back-yard; but, as it had swallowed the ribbon without being able to swallow the bonnet, it carried that with it. The boy who specially owned the goat ran it down in a frenzy of horror and apprehension, and managed to unravel the ribbon from its throat, and get back the bonnet. Then he took the bonnet in and laid it carefully down on the table again, and decided that it would be best not to say anything about the affair. But such a thing as that could not be kept. The goat was known at once to have done the mischief; and this time it was really sent away. All the children mourned it, and the boy who owned it the most used to go to the house of the people who took it, and who had a high board fence round their yard, and try to catch sight of it through the cracks. When he called [...] "Nanny!" [...] it answered him instantly with a plaintive [...] "Baa!" [...] and then, after a vain interchange of lamentations, he had to come away, and console himself as he could with the pets that were left him.|$|R
