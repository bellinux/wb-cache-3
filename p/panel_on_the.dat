5|$|Prior to the 1981 season, Greer {{underwent}} {{a number of}} renovations including the addition of over 1,200box seats and over 1,000new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel cable system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling {{the size of the}} reader <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315people watched the Sounds play against the Columbus Astros.|$|E
5|$|Several {{variations}} of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid malachite green liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War, {{members of the class}} under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green, with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos.782 and 800, Sir Brian and Sir Persant) did not receive this livery.|$|E
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{legacy of}} the early 18th century is the refectory of the monastery, decorated by painted wooden <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and tile (azulejo) <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 Kennedy {{offered to}} install solar <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{roof of the}} White House. He also {{installed}} 48 solar <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof of the residence {{of the president of}} The Maldives.|$|R
50|$|The {{unit had}} two {{cut-outs}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roofline <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof access ladder side, but an unbroken roofline <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite side. The Series 3, 4 and 5 units could be visually distinguished from earlier series by their three small square access <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower sides above the battery box {{instead of the}} two larger rectangular access <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Series 1 and 2 units. Series 4 and 5 units could be distinguished from all earlier series by their one small square and one larger rectangular access <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower sides above the second axle from the left instead of <b>the</b> sole rectangular <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> earlier series.|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} very similar in {{appearance}} to the Fea's petrel, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be obvious in the most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but {{can be difficult to}} determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underwing. The wing panel is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but P. feae deserti sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.|$|E
5|$|While he had {{no desire}} to be a manager, Liddell, as a shareholder, had wanted to become a Liverpool director; however, his {{repeated}} applications to board elections were unsuccessful. He continued to play football for a magistrates' team until he decided to focus on tennis after breaking a cheek bone. In 1967, Liddell and other footballing personalities appeared in a charity match to generate funds for Bankfield House Community Centre. More than 10,000 people watched Liddell play opposite retired Hungarian international Ferenc Puskás at South Liverpool's Holly Park ground, raising £1,100 in the process. He later became chairman of Littlewoods' Spot the Ball panel and president of the Liverpool FC Supporters Club. After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the early 1990s, Liddell resigned from the <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> insistence of Phyllis. His wife had first noticed atypical behaviour on a visit to Anfield following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, when he did not appear able to register what had happened in Sheffield. When his condition worsened, Liddell moved to a nursing home in Mossley Hill. He died on 3 July 2001, within a week of the deaths of former Liverpool manager Joe Fagan and director Tom Saunders.|$|E
50|$|The {{first three}} sets delivered, sets 31601, 31401, and 31402, had flat <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat ends and no centre stanchions.

Sets 31607 and 31407 onward had higher light blue <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat ends.|$|R

25|$|The UN General Assembly {{set up an}} Interactive <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Global Financial Crisis {{which held}} its first meeting in New York on 30 October 2008, led by Professor Joseph Stiglitz.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} had no {{fire detection}} or warning devices. But it had two built-in CO2 fire extinguishers to fight engine fires. The extinguishers were not automatic. There was a control <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> starboard {{side of the}} cockpit, from which the co-pilot would operate the extinguishers when instructed by the pilot. Investigators found that both of the extinguishers had been discharged. This suggested that {{a member of the}} crew, presumably the co-pilot, Warrant Officer Brož, had tried to extinguish the engine fire.|$|E
