The influence of steel fibres and aggregate types on modulus of elasticity, compressive and tensile strength and post-peak behaviour is evaluated. Test results show that compressive strength does not change for <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> aggregates, while an increase is observed for expanded clay; tensile strength and fracture toughness are significantly improved for both <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> and expanded clay.

Due to its continue discharge, its potential chronic effect on exposed aquatic organisms and the limitation of removal in conventional wastewater treatments, it is {{of great interest to}} develop methodologies that contribute to its removal. This research studies the use of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> as an adsorbent to remove atenolol from wastewater. The adsorption capacity of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was characterized by isotherms and kinetics adsorption, including its dependence on pH, using atenolol solutions of 8 mg/L in batch experiments, with <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> of 0, 85 - 1, 18 mm granulometry and 4, 24 m 2 /g of superficial area. The adsorption isotherm results were adjusted to Langmuir model, with an adsorption capacity of 0, 1131 mg/g in water type II and 0. 0439 mg/g in wastewater, both at pH 7, 2.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} a broad audience of rural populations affected by drinking arsenic-contaminated water. Exposure to arsenic in the drinking water {{has been associated with}} the development of skin and internal cancers and non-carcinogenic effects such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (Abernathy et al., 593 – 597). Traditional technologies to remove arsenic from water include: coagulation and filtration, activate alumina, ion-exchange, reverse osmosis, and electro-dialysis. These methods are very expensive to build and operate in rural areas with scattered populations. The focus of this research was to remove the arsenic from drinking water by a sorption process. Batch studies were conducted on twelve adsorbent materials with water containing 100 μg/L arsenic (V). The outcome of the research indicates that iron-oxide-coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> (IOCPS) removes both arsenic (III) and arsenic (V). The arsenic (V) appears to be more easily removed than arsenic (III). In a laboratory column test, the breakthrough volume of the iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was 4000 bed volumes. The concentration of arsenic in the feed water was 100 μg/L and the effluent concentration was below detection limit (3 ̆c 2 μg/L). Optimum empty bed contact time for arsenic (V) removal by the iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was 8 to 10 minutes. The optimum pH for arsenic removal by IOCPS was found to be in the range of 5. 5 to 6. 0. The presence of sulfate, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate in the water reduces the arsenic removal capacity of iron-oxide-coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone.</b> Presence of calcium, magnesium in the water does not effect the arsenic removal by iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone.</b> The residual waste is non-hazardous and can be disposed in landfills. ...|$|R

Fly ash {{was replaced by}} Lime <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> in various proportions (10 % and 15 %) where Fly ash was used as source material for {{synthesis of}} geopolymer. Sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions were mixed maintaining a silicate modulus (Na 2 O / SiO 2) at 1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry was carried out to characterize the geopolymer specimens.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process that relates to the removal of ventilation air methane using <b>stone</b> <b>dust.</b> The working principle behind the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process is incredibly simple which involves the catalytic oxidation of methane followed by carbonation and calcination reactions. In the current work, laboratory scale fluidized bed experiments and process simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process. The experimental work concluded that oxidation of ventilation air methane in the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process can be successfully achieved at temperatures between 500 and 650 °C. The experimental results indicated that oxidation of methane was found to increase at higher temperatures while carbon dioxide capture efficiency showed a declining trend with increasing temperature. Furthermore, higher methane conversion and optimum (thermodynamic) carbon dioxide capture efficiency were observed for lower ventilation air methane flow rates and higher bed inventory. The concentration of methane in ventilation air methane and <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> particle size did not {{have a significant effect on}} methane conversion or carbon dioxide capture. Also, comparison with synthetically prepared CuO and Fe 2 O 3 catalysts has been made with CaO for VAM oxidation. CaO was found to be comparable to Fe 2 O 3 and superior to CuO. From the process simulations, it was concluded that thermal energy generation in the carbonator was increased with higher methane and carbon dioxide concentrations. However, at the same time for higher methane and carbon dioxide concentrations, a greater CaO flux was required in the carbonator and hence a larger amount of goaf gas was required for the calcination reaction. The higher thermal energy generation in the carbonator was expected to improve the autothermicity of the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process at concentrations of methane in the ventilation stream < 0. 2 vol. % (thermodynamic limit) ...|$|R
