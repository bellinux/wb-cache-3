Several population models have demonstrated that lateral dimorphism is maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, resulting from interactions between predator and prey species. However, other mechanisms for the maintenance of lateral dimorphism have not yet been tested. Here, we found that the scale-eating cichlid fish Perissodus microlepis exhibited <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating,</b> in which reproductive pairings between lefties and righties occurred at higher than expected frequency (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Evolution {{to reduce}} {{inbreeding}} can favor disassortative (inter-morph) over assortative (intramorph) mating in hermaphroditic sexually polymorphic plant species. Heterostyly enhances disassortative pollination through reciprocal placement of stigmas and anthers of morphs and appropriate pollinators. Stylar dimorphism {{in which there}} is not reciprocal anther placement may compromise <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating,</b> particularly when there is not intra-morph incompatibility. Variable rates of <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> along with differential female fecundity or siring success among floral morphs could lead to variation in morph ratio. We investigated mating patterns, female fecundity and siring success of style-length morphs in Narcissus papyraceus, a self-incompatible but morph-compatible species with dimorphic (long- and short-styled) and monomorphic (long-styled) populations in central and north regions of its range respectively. We established experimental populations in both regions and exposed them to ambient pollinators. Using paternity analysis, we found similar siring success of morphs and high <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> in most populations. Female fecundity of morphs was similar in all populations. Although these results could not completely explain the loss of dimorphism in the species’ northern range, they provided evidence for the evolutionary stability of stylar dimorphism in N. papyraceus in at least some populations. Our findings support the hypothesis that prevailing inter-morph mating is key for the maintenance of stylar dimorphism. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Assortative mating is a {{mating pattern}} and {{a form of}} sexual {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. Assortative mating, also referred to as positive assortative mating or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. Assortative mating can be contrasted with <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> (also known as negative assortative mating or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random <b>mating.</b> <b>Disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative mating occurs more frequently than negative assortative mating.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, mating between {{individuals}} of genotypes {{that are too}} similar allows for the accumulation of harmful recessive alleles, which can decrease fitness. Such mating between genetically similar individuals is termed inbreeding which can result {{in the emergence of}} autosomal recessive diseases. Moreover, assortative mating for aggression in birds can lead to inadequate parental care. An alternate strategy can be <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating,</b> in which one individual is aggressive and guards the nest site while the other individual is more nurturing and fosters the young. This division of labor increases the chances of survival of the offspring. A classic example of this is {{in the case of the}} white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). This bird exhibits two color morphs - white striped and tan striped. In both genders, the white striped birds are more aggressive and territorial whereas tan striped birds are more engaged in providing parental care to their offspring.

We demonstrate that the protogynous morph is maintained by frequency-dependent selection, but that maintenance of males versus protandrous individuals depends on their relative siring success, which changes yearly. Seeds produced later in the reproductive season were smaller than those produced earlier; this should compromise reproduction through ovules in protandrous individuals, rendering them male biased in gender. Time-dependent gender and paternity analyses indicate that the sexual morphs are specialized in their earlier sexual functions, mediated by the seasonal decrease in seed size. Our results confirm that mating patterns are context-dependent and change seasonally, suggesting that sexual specialization can be driven by seasonal effects on fitness gained through one of the two sexual functions...|$|R

An extensive survey of {{populations of the}} two species in SW France revealed {{a wide range of}} style-morph frequencies, particularly populations with significantly more long-styled than short-styled plants. Here we employ experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate potential selective mechanisms governing the variation in style-morph frequencies. Controlled pollination of both species demonstrated that N. assoanus is moderately self-sterile whereas N. dubius is highly self-compatible. Both intra- and intermorph crosses of N. assoanus were equally fertile, indicating that the species does not exhibit heteromorphic incompatibility. Estimates of female fertility (fruit- and seed-set) and multilocus estimates of outcrossing using allozyme markers provided no evidence of morph-specific dierences in maternal components of reproductive success in natural populations of the two species. This result suggested that dierences between the morphs in male fertility may be largely responsible for the observed morph-ratio variation. To investigate this hypothesis we developed a mating model that incorporates the genetics of stigma-height dimorphism and contrasting rates of assortative and <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> in the style morphs. Simulation results demonstrated that stigma-height dimorphism will always be maintained when levels of <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> are greater than assortative mating, and that the observed L-biased populations in Narcissus spp. probably result from greater levels of assortative mating in this morph in comparison with the S-morph...|$|R

Cloning and sequencing of the DRß 1 gene showed that Magellanic penguins had higher levels of genetic variation than Galapagos and Humboldt penguins. Sequence analysis revealed 45 alleles with 3. 6 % average proportion of nucleotide differences, nucleotide diversity of 0. 030, and observed heterozygosity of 0. 770. A gene phylogeny showed 9 allelic lineages with interspersed DRß 1 sequences from Humboldt and Galapagos penguins, indicating ancestral polymorphisms. dN/dS ratios revealed evidence for positive selection. Analysis of breeding pairs showed no <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> preferences. Significant MHC genotype/fitness associations in females suggest, however, that selection for pathogen resistance plays a more important role than mate choice in maintaining diversity at the MHC in the Magellanic penguin. The differential effect of MHC heterozygosity on fitness between the sexes is likely associated with the relative role of hatching and fledging rates as reliable indicators of overall fit-ness in males and females.

40|$|Aims In stylar polymorphous species, the morph ratios are {{maintained}} by negative frequency-dependent selection hrough <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating.</b> The spatial {{context of a}} population is of crucial importance to maintain this stylar polymorphism. Under particular circumstances, <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> in such species may promote {{the evolution of a}} dimorphism by gender specialization. We asked whether flexistyly can promote sufficient <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating,</b> whether the female fitness of focal plant is affected by negative frequency-dependent selection at local level, and whether the two morphs in flexistylous plants differ in gender specialization. Methods We used open-pollinated flexistylous Alpinia mutica to compare fertility in anaflexistylous, cataflexistylous and dimorphic arrays. Second, we used neighborhood models to investigate spatial distribution of morphs at local level within the population on reproductive output in the flexistylous, A. blepharaocalyx. We quantified the distribution of the morphs in terms of neighborhood morph bias. We then measured the effect of neighborhood morph bias on open-pollinated reproductive output. Third, the reproductive characters were examined in anaflexistylous and cataflexistylous morphs of A. blepharaocalyx. We assessed functional genders of two morphs based on their allocations associated with times-dependent mating opportunities and the mean number of seeds produced by anaflexistylous and cataflexistylous plants with morph frequency in the population. Important findings Dimorphic arrays have higher female fertility than monomorphic arrays, demonstrating the flexistyly promotes inter-morph pollen transfer. Results from A. blepharaocalyx indicate that at the neighborhood scale, the two morphs have an aggregate distribution due to clonal growth. At this scale, focal plants showed no evidence of frequency-dependent total fruits and seeds per plant or seeds per flower. These results do not support frequency-dependent selection as a major mechanism affecting morph frequencies in A. blepharaocalyx within the context of this study. There are no significant differences between two morphs in flower and fruit characters. Functional gender analyses indicate that when illegitimate fertilization is negligible, the morphs are specialized in their later sexual functions, mediated by anaflexistylous morph through male fitness gained; however, when selffertilization is included, the two morphs are both specialized in their female functions {{due to the lack of}} inbreeding depression in the formulas...|$|R
40|$|In {{species with}} {{discrete}} morphs exhibiting alternative behavioral strategies, individuals may vary their aggressive behavior in competitive encounters {{according to the}} phenotype of their opponent. Such aggression bias has been documented in multiple polymorphic species evolving under negative frequency-dependent selection, {{but it has not}} been well-studied under other selection regimes. We investigated this phenomenon in white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), a passerine with plumage polychromatism maintained by <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating.</b> The two distinct color morphs differ with respect to reproductive strategy in that white-striped birds invest more in territorial aggression than tan-striped birds. Whether territorial aggression in this species is biased according to the morph of an intruder is less understood. We found that during peak territorial and mating activity, both color morphs and sexes can exhibit aggression bias, but whether they do so depends on the strategy (morph) of the intruder. During simulated territorial intrusions, resident white-striped males and tan-striped females, which represent the opposite ends of a continuum from high to low territorial aggression, altered their territorial responses according to intruder morph. Tan-striped males and white-striped females, which represent the middle of the continuum, did not show a bias. We propose that because of the <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> system and morph differences in reproductive strategy, the fitness risks of intrusions vary according to the morphs of the resident and the intruder, and that aggression bias is an attuned response to varying threats to fitness...|$|R
40|$|Background: Organisms are {{predicted}} to behave more favourably towards relatives, and kin-biased cooperation {{has been found}} in all domains of life from bacteria to vertebrates. Cooperation based on genetic recognition cues is paradoxical because it disproportionately benefits individuals with common phenotypes, which should erode the required cue polymorphism. Theoretical models suggest that many recognition loci likely have some secondary function that is subject to diversifying selection, keeping them variable. Results: Here, we use individual-based simulations to investigate the hypothesis that the dual use of recognition cues to facilitate social behaviour and <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> (e. g. for inbreeding avoidance) can maintain cue diversity over evolutionary time. Our model shows that when organisms mate disassortatively with respect to their recognition cues, cooperation and recognition locus diversity can persist at high values, especially when outcrossed matings produce more surviving offspring. Mating system affects cue diversity via at least four distinct mechanisms, and its effects interact with other parameters such as population structure. Also, the attrition of cue diversity is less rapid when cooperation does not require an exact cue match. Using a literature review, we show that there is abundant empirical evidence that heritable recognition cues are simultaneously used in social and sexual behaviour. Conclusions: Our models show that mate choice is one possible resolution of the paradox of genetic kin recognition, and the literature review suggests that genetic recognition cues simultaneously inform assortative cooperation and <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> in a large range of taxa.

40|$|Females express mate {{preferences}} for genetically dissimilar males, especially {{with respect to}} the major histocompatibility complex, MHC, and for males whose sexually selected signals indicate high genetic quality.

When women take the contraceptive pill this has been found to demolish the cycle attractiveness of odours than men find attractive in normally ovulating women. Therefore, the contraceptive pill affects both women’s preferences for scent and also affects their own scents, making their scents less attractive to males than the scent of normally cycling women.|$|R

All loci were in Hardy-Weinberg proportions. A novel likelihood-based approach was developed to analyse mating patterns using paternity data. No evidence for non-random mating with respect to MHC markers was found using this technique.

The observed lack of genetic divergence between the different morphs allowed for the exclusion of the possibility of assortative mating between same morph types.

40|$|Introduction: Allelic {{incompatibility}} {{between individuals}} {{of the same}} species should select for mate choice based on the genetic make-up of both partners at loci that influence offspring fitness. As a consequence, mate choice may be an important driver of allelic diversity. A complementary sex determination (CSD) system is responsible for intraspecific allelic incompatibility in many species of ants, bees, and wasps. CSD may thus favour <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> and in this, resembles the MHC of the vertebrate immune system, or the self-incompatibility (SI) system of higher plants. Results: Here we show that in the monogamous parasitic wasp Bracon brevicornis (Wesmael), females are able to reject partners with incompatible alleles. Forcing females to accept initially rejected partners resulted in sex ratio distortion and partial infertility of offspring. Conclusions: CSD-disassortative mating occurred independent of kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance in our experiment. The fitness consequences of mate choice are directly observable, not influenced by environmental effects, and more severe than in comparable systems (SI or MHC), on individuals {{as well as at the}} population level. Our results thus demonstrate the strong potential of female mate choice for maintaining high offspring fitness in this species. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract House mice are {{apparently}} {{more likely to}} mate with individuals dissimilar to themselves at MHC (major histocompatibility complex) loci than with similar individuals. Such negative assortative mating {{is thought to be}} mediated by olfaction. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} human mate choice may be affected by HLA (human leukocyte antigen; MHC in humans), based on the finding that women prefer the odor of men dissimilar to themselves at HLA loci to that of HLA-similar men. If these odor preferences are indeed an important criterion of mate choice in humans, actual marriages may show negative assortment with respect to HLA. In this paper, we compared the observed similarity between spouses at HLA loci with the expected similarity under random mating, for about 150 couples from 6 prefectures in the Tohoku region of Japan, and for about 300 couples from 16 prefectures all over Japan. For statistical tests, we used empirical distributions of goodness-of-fit statistics, X 2 and G, obtained by Monte Carlo methods, because these statistics may not follow the chi-square distribution.

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{maintenance}} of polymorphism in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in natural populations is still unresolved(1). Sexual selection, frequency-dependent selection by parasites and pathogens, and heterozygote advantage have been suggested to explain the maintenance of high allele diversity at MHC genes(2 - 4). Here we argue {{that there are two}} (non-exclusive) strategies for MHC-related sexual selection, representing solutions to two different problems: inbreeding avoidance and parasite resistance. In species prone to inadvertent inbreeding, partners should prefer dissimilar MHC genotypes to similar ones. But if the goal is to maximize the resistance of offspring towards potential infections, the choosing sex should prefer mates with a higher diversity of MHC alleles. This latter strategy should apply when there are several MHC loci, {{as is the case in}} most vertebrates(2, 5). We tested the relative importance of an 'allele counting' strategy compared to a <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> strategy using wild-caught three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from an interconnected system of lakes.

We found that the offspring of artificially bred salmon had higher parasite loads and were almost four {{times more likely to be}} infected than free-mating salmon, despite having similar levels of MHC diversity. Moreover, the offspring of wild salmon were more MHC dissimilar than the offspring of artificially crossed salmon, and uninfected fish were more dissimilar for MHC than infected fish. Thus, our results suggest a link between <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> and offspring benefits and indicate that MHC-mediated mate choice and natural (parasite-driven) selection act in combination to maintain MHC diversity, and hence fitness. Therefore, artificial breeding programmes that negate the potential genetic benefits of mate choice may result in inherently inferior offspring, regardless of population size, rearing conditions or genetic diversity...|$|R

Women using oral hormonal contraceptives {{have been reported to}} have the opposite preference, raising the possibility that oral contraceptives alter female preference towards MHC similarity, with possible fertility costs. Here we test directly whether contraceptive pill use alters odour preferences using a longitudinal design in which women were tested before and after initiating pill use; a control group of non-users were tested with a comparable interval between test sessions. In contrast to some previous studies, {{there was no significant difference}} in ratings between odours of MHC-dissimilar and MHC-similar men among women during the follicular cycle phase. However, single women preferred odours of MHC-similar men, while women in relationships preferred odours of MHC-dissimilar men, a result consistent with studies in other species, suggesting that paired females may seek to improve offspring quality through extra-pair partnerships. Across tests, we found a significant preference shift towards MHC similarity associated with pill use, which was not evident in the control group. If odour plays a role in human mate choice, our results suggest that contraceptive pill use could disrupt <b>disassortative</b> <b>mate</b> preferences...|$|R
40|$|Theory has {{identified}} {{a variety of}} evolutionary processes {{that may lead to}} speciation. Our study includes selection experiments using different host plants and test key predictions concerning models of speciation based on host plant choice, such as the evolution of host use (preference and performance) and assortative mating. This study shows that after only ten generations of selection on different resources/hosts in allopatry, strains of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus develop new resource preferences and show resource-dependent assortative mating when given the possibility to choose mates and resources during secondary contact. The resulting reduced gene flow between the different strains remained for two generations after contact before being overrun by <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating.</b> We show that reduced gene flow can evolve in a population due to a link between host preference and assortative mating, although this result was not found in all lines. However, consistent with models of speciation, assortative mating alone is not sufficient to maintain reproductive isolation when individuals disperse freely between hosts. We conclude that the evolution of reproductive isolation in this system cannot proceed without selection against hybrids. Other possible factors facilitating the evolution of isolation would be longer periods of allopatry, the build up of local adaptation or reduced migration upon secondary contact...|$|R
40|$|Disruptive {{selection}} for sternopleural bristle number with opportunity for random mating {{was done in}} the four treatment combinations of two population sizes (40 pairs and 8 pairs of selected parents) and two selection intensities (1 in 40 and 1 in 2). In each generation, matings among selected parents were observed in a mating chamber, and progeny collected separately from each female parent. In the high number, high selection intensity treatment, divergence between the high and low parts ceased about generation 11. The isolation index increased rapidly to generation 3, but then fluctuated to termination of the population at generation 17. The overall isolation index was significant, indicating a real tendency to assortative mating. The failure of the isolation index to increase after generation 3 was attributed to lower average mating fitness of high males (due to inbreeding) and reduced receptivity of low females (due to a homozygous lethal gene with a large effect on sternopleural bristle number in heterozygotes). In the two low number treatments, isolation indices fluctuated from generation to generation with no obvious trends, and none of the overall isolation indices were significantly different from zero. The high number, low selection intensity treatment showed very little divergence, and one of the replicates showed, in contrast with expectation and the high number, high selection intensity treatment, a significant tendency to <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating.</b> Intense disruptive selection may lead to assortative mating...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSimilarity or dissimilarity between 2 {{individuals}} that {{have formed a}} pair to breed canoccur in morphology, behaviour and diet. Such patterns influence partners’ cooperation whenrearing their offspring, consequently influencing reproductive success. They may confer differentbenefits, depending on species and contexts. However, {{the extent to which}} breeding partners aremore similar in morphology, behaviour, and diet is poorly documented. Furthermore, the relationshipbetween behavioural consistency and mate choice is particularly poorly understood. Toinvestigate these issues, Kerguelen shags Phalacrocorax verrucosus, which are monogamous withhigh mate fidelity across years, were studied. Partners were equipped with GPS and divingbehaviour loggers. Feather and blood samples were analysed for stable isotopes (δ 13 C, a proxy offoraging habitat, and δ 15 N, a proxy of diet/trophic position). Generalized linear mixed effects modelsand permutation tests were used to investigate pair similarity in morphology, foraging behaviour,behavioural consistency, overlap in foraging areas, and diets/foraging habitats. Mates werefound not to exhibit size-assortative mating, but were more similar in foraging behaviour. Theydid not show assortative or <b>disassortative</b> <b>mating</b> based on foraging behavioural consistency. Furthermore,they followed more similar bearings and overlapped more in foraging areas. In accordancewith this, partners were more similar in δ 15 N. Given the lack of assortative mating by morphology,the similarity in behaviour could be due to individuals selecting mates with similarforaging abilities, linked with individual quality, and/or subsequently using information gainedfrom their partners’ foraging strategies (e. g. local enhancement). This could help breeding pairsincrease their foraging efficiency and reproductive success...|$|R
