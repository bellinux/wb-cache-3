P-Tex is a brand name that has become synonymous with base material. It is important that the base be [...] "slippery", with respect to the snow surface and board interaction. Bases are made to have amorphous areas that are porous to wax. Wax is an important finishing product for all base materials. Not only does it allow the snowboard to have a smoother glide, but it also allows the rider to change the characteristics of the base and adjust the board to the snow conditions. Different base waxes are available for different temperatures. The base, when maintained, will have a designed base structure that not only channels snow, air and water, but leaves it open enough for wax to penetrate deep inside it. This pattern is created with a stonegrind machine at the factory or a local ski shop. If the base is damaged, it is common to have it repaired {{in order to protect the}} core from exposure as well as reducing friction.|$|E

Attached to the unit are a number of diffusers. These diffusers come in the shape of discs, plates, tubes or hoses constructed from glass-bonded silica, <b>porous</b> ceramic <b>plastic,</b> PVC or perforated membranes made from EPDM (ethylene propylene diene Monomer) rubber. [...] Air pumped through the diffuser membranes is released into the water. These bubbles are known as fine bubbles. The EPA defines a fine bubble as anything smaller than 2mm in diameter. This type of aeration has a very high oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE), sometimes as high as 15 pounds of oxygen / (horsepower * hour) (9.1 kilograms of oxygen / (kilowatt * hour)). On average, diffused air aeration diffuses approximately 2-4 cfm (cubic feet of air per minute) (56.6-113.3 liters of air per minute), but some operate at levels as low as 1 cfm (28.3 L/min) or as high as 10 cfm (283 L/min).|$|R

30|$|Intensive {{row crop}} {{agriculture}} in the Upper Midwest has altered drainage patterns and influenced the concentration and stoichiometry of nutrient inputs to surface waters (Raymond et al. 2012). Many Midwestern agricultural fields, particularly in Illinois, have been drained with <b>porous</b> corrugated <b>plastic</b> and clay pipe that drains water from the field directly to the streams, bypassing many land surface mitigation structures (Lemke et al. 2011). Tile water can be directed from the streams to wetlands to reduce nitrate loading to streams, but this water has high NO 3 âN concentrations and low C and P concentrations (Royer and David 2005; Bernot et al. 2006; Vidon et al. 2008; Tank et al. 2010). In contrast, natural wetlands receive overland flow from the surrounding watershed and this water can maintain higher concentrations of DOC and lower NO 3 âN and P (Kaplan and Newbold 1993). The difference in nutrient stoichiometry is due to differential removal of DOC and P relative to nitrate as overland flow has shortened residence times relative to water slowly percolating through upper soil profiles like that of tile drained fields (Dahm et al. 1998). Therefore, surface water typically has elevated labile DOC due to limited reduction through soil and microbial processes (Chambers et al. 2010; Griffiths et al. 2009).|$|R

Analysis of a rigid-ideal plastic spheroidal unit cell, containing a confocal spheroidal cavity, and subjected to arbitrary mechanical loadings is made.

Again, however, the equations proposed are not attached to this specific model and could be used in conjunction with any similar criterion accounting for void shape effects. In the definition of the evolution equations looked for, a central role is played by " elastic " expressions for the strain and rotation rates of the voids proposed by Ponte-Castaneda and Zaidman (1994) and Kailasam and Ponte-Castaneda (1998) from homogenization theory.

Also, the convergence of the elasto-plastic iterations is accelerated by suitably adjusting the elastic properties of the material.

This is done by performing numerical limit-analyses of elementary cells made of a Hill material and containing confocal spheroidal voids, subjected to classical conditions of homogeneous boundary strain rate.
