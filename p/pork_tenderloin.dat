40|$|Aims The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the fundamental investigation of the antimicrobial efficiency of various hop extracts against selected foodborne pathogens in vitro, as well as their activity against Listeria monocytogenes in a model meat marinade and on marinated <b>pork</b> <b>tenderloins.</b> Methods and Results In a first step, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of three hop extracts containing either α- or β-acids or xanthohumol were determined against test bacteria including L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli by a colorimetric method based on the measurement of bacterial metabolic activity. Moreover, the influence of either lactic or citric acid on the antimicrobial activity of the hop extracts was evaluated. The efficiency of hop extracts as a natural food preservative was then tested in a model meat marinade at 2 and 8 °C, respectively, and finally on marinated pork. The experiments showed that Gram-positive bacteria were strongly inhibited by hop extracts containing β-acids and xanthohumol (MIC values of 6 • 3 and 12 • 5 ppm, respectively), whereas the antimicrobial activity of the investigated α-acid extract was significantly lower (MIC values of 200 ppm). Gram-negative bacteria were highly resistant against all tested hop extracts. Acidification of the test media led to a decrease of the MIC values. The inhibitory activity of the hop extracts against L. monocytogenes was strongly reduced in a fat-containing model meat marinade, but the efficiency of β-acids in this matrix could be increased by lowering pH and storage temperatures. By applying 0 • 5 % β-acids at pH = 5 in a model marinade, the total aerobic count of <b>pork</b> <b>tenderloins</b> was reduced up to 0 • 9 log 10 compared with marinated pork without hop extract after 2 weeks of storage at 5 °C. Conclusions β-acid containing hop extracts have proven to possess a high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in a practice-related application for food preservation. Significance and Impact of the Study Antimicrobial hop extracts could be used as natural preservatives in food applications to extend the shelf life and to increase the safety of fresh products...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 100 years, the {{exponential}} development of microbiological knowledge {{has been used}} in food industry providing the market with different food products. Thermal processing, refreezing, filtration, radiation and chemical preservation have remarkably reduced the number of traditional diseases transmitted with food. The aim of the actual work is to evaluate the microbiological rates of the meat that has been processed using different production technologies. The evaluation of microbiological rates in raw pork and beef determined that the average APC in raw pork was marginally higher than in beef (4, 62 KFU/g and 4, 53 KFU/g respectively). The rate of koliformian bacteria in raw pork meat was 1, 5 times lower than in raw beef (1, 69 KFU/g and 2, 6 KFU/g. respectively). It was also determined that the amount of microorganisms in the production under examination did not exceed HN 26 : 1998 - the highest allowed level of microbiological food contamination. The results of tests of different parts of raw <b>pork</b> carcass (ham, <b>tenderloin</b> and neck) indicate that APC in the pork neck was relatively bigger than in ham and tenderloin. The results of comparison of coliformian bacteria contamination in hot-smoked sausages show that the average of coliformian bacteria range marginally (from 0, 28 KFU/g to 0, 33 KFU/g). However, the amount of nitrate in the production of hot-smoked sausages in plant “E” was twice bigger than in production of the other plants. Whereas the average level of coliformian bacteria contamination in cold-smoked sausages produced in different plants varied marginally (from 0, 5 KFU/g to 1 KFU/g respectively). The examination of general amount of microorganisms in hot and cold-smoked sausages and comparison of the poles of coloformian bacteria prove that bacteriological contamination is lower in hot-smoked sausages. The analysis of boiled meat products such as bangers shows that the amounts of the APC and food salt in them differ marginally. The average of APC ranged from 3, 52 KFU/g to 3, 9 KFU/g and the average of food salt ranged from 1, 77 g/kg to 2, 1 g/kg. The poles of bacterial contamination do not exceed the highest levels of contamination determined in the Lithuanian Standard of Hygiene HN 26 : 1998...|$|R
