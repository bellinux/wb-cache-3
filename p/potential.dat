40|$|Background and Aim: It is {{not known}} how {{electrocochleography}} components of action <b>potentials</b> (AP) and summating <b>potentials</b> (SP) are changed in response to CE-chirp stimulus using extra-tympanic electrodes. This study was done for comparing summating <b>potentials</b> and action <b>potentials</b> specifications in response to CE-chirp and click stimuli. Methods: Electrocochleography components of action <b>potentials</b> and summating <b>potentials</b> were recorded in 16 normal hearing subjects (8 men and 8 women) aged 22 - 30 years (mean: 26. 7 with SD 2. 5 years) with audiometric (250 - 8000 Hz) hearing thresholds of 15 dB HL or better in response to click and CE-chirp stimulus at 90 dB nHL. Amplitude, duration, latency and area of summating <b>potentials</b> and action <b>potentials</b> and SP/AP amplitude and area ratios were compared. Results: Among the measured parameters, action <b>potentials</b> amplitude in response to CE-chirp stimulus (0. 41 with SD 0. 26 µV) was significantly smaller than action <b>potentials</b> amplitude in response to click (0. 61 with SD 0. 29 µV) stimulus (p< 0. 005). Relative frequency of detecting summating <b>potentials</b> in response to CE-chirp (68. 7 %) was lower than (100 %) click (p< 0. 005). Conclusion: Recording electrocochleography component of summating <b>potentials</b> and action <b>potentials</b> with CE-chirp stimulus at high intensity level in normal hearing individuals shows no advantage over click stimulus. Small amplitude of summating <b>potentials</b> as a major problem of extra-tympanic electrocochleography cannot be solved using CE-chirp stimulus...|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} <b>potential</b> is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric <b>potential</b> at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the <b>potential</b> for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of <b>potential,</b> while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric <b>potential</b> difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for <b>potential</b> difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric <b>potential</b> difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

40|$|The {{embedded}} atom method (EAM) <b>potentials</b> {{are probably}} the most widely used interatomic <b>potentials</b> for metals and alloys. However, the EAM <b>potentials</b> impose three constraints on elastic constants that are inconsistent with experiments. At a more subtle (but more important) level, the EAM <b>potentials</b> often incorrectly describe the outward/inward relaxation of surface layers, and therefore will not reliably describe nanostructures. This Letter reports a response EAM (R-EAM) that addresses both issues. Conceptually, the electron distribution from each atom does not respond to the atoms environment within the EAM. In reality, the electron distribution from each atom depends on the atoms environment, and this dependence is explicitly incorporated in the R-EAM. Analytical derivation shows that the R-EAM <b>potentials</b> do not impose these three constraints on elastic constants that EAM <b>potentials</b> do. Further, taking hexagonal close packed (HCP) metals Ti, Mg, and Zn as the prototypes, the authors show that the R-EAM <b>potentials</b> correctly describe surfaces, in terms of interlayer spacing and surface reconstruction, in agreement with quantum mechanics calculations, while EAM <b>potentials</b> are not in agreement.
