5|$|Small <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> foil {{featuring}} engravings {{dating from}} the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E

Colors are then applied to the body of the design, contrasting with the darker base.|$|E

25|$|In Galle at Ceylon, Admiral Zheng He {{set up a}} trilingual {{inscription}} dated 15 February 1409. The Galle Trilingual Inscription is {{in three}} languages: Chinese, Tamil, and Persian. For protecting the treasure fleet during the voyages, the Chinese section praised the Buddha, the Tamil section praised a local god who was an incarnation of Vishnu, and the Persian section praised Allah. The three sections each contained the same lists of offerings: 1000 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> 5000 pieces of silver, 100 rolls of silk, 2500 catties of perfumed oil, {{and a variety of}} bronze ornaments. Thus, the inscription paid respect to the three religions that were dominant in Ceylon. The noted date could refer to when it was erected in Galle, which would indicate that it was put up during the homeward journey of the second voyage. The inscription could also have been prepared beforehand in China and erected at Galle between 1410 to 1411 during the third voyage.|$|E

25|$|Naaman, the {{commander}} of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, and she told Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the girl said, and the king of Aram sent Naaman on his way with a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> and ten changes of clothes. Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God with power over life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel.|$|E

Further successes followed: in 541 Lazica {{defected}} to the Persian side, and in 542 a major Byzantine offensive in Armenia was defeated at Anglon. In the same year of 541, upon requests of the Lazic king, king Khosrau I, entered Lazica, captured the Byzantine main stronghold of Petra, and established another protectorate over the country, commencing the Lazic War. A five-year truce agreed to in 545 was interrupted in 547 when Lazica again switched sides and eventually expelled its Persian garrison with Byzantine help; the war resumed but remained confined to Lazica, which was retained by the Byzantines when peace was concluded in 562.|$|E
2500|$|Robin Hood disguises {{himself as}} a friar in the forest and {{encounters}} two [...] "lusty" [...] priests on horseback (4.4). He begs the priests for a silver groat, saying he hasn't {{been able to get}} anything to eat or drink all day. The priests explain that they have no money because they have been robbed that morning. Robin tells them he thinks they're lying, and at that they speed away on their horses, but Robin soon catches up with them. He pulls them off of their horses, whereupon the priests fall on their knees and promise to pray for money. After they've prayed for an hour, Robin says they will all search themselves for the money heaven has given them. The priests pretend to search themselves and still find no money, but when Robin searches them he finds five hundred <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> which he lays out on the ground. He gives them each fifty pounds for praying so earnestly and keeps the rest for himself. Relieved to get away physically unharmed, the priests rise from their knees to go, but Robin commands them to stay until they have taken three oaths by the forest's [...] "holy grass": that they never again will lie, that they will never try to persuade maidens to sin or lie with other men's wives, and that they will be charitable to the poor (21.3). The priests go on their way and Robin returns to the forest.|$|E
