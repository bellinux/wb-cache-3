40|$|Objective To {{determine}} why {{physicians and}} midlevel providers join, leave, or stay in Navajo Area Indian Health Service (IHS). Design Cross-sectional {{analysis of data}} obtained from questionnaires. Setting Navajo Area IHS hospitals. Subjects Navajo Area health care physicians and midlevel health care providers. Main outcome measures The prevalence of physicians and midlevel providers who <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Navajo Area IHS, the demographic characteristics of these physicians and midlevel providers, and the most common reasons for staying or leaving. Results A total of 221 (64 %) physicians and midlevel providers responded. Of these, 58 % <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> eventually, and 47 % of all physicians and midlevel providers <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> in the next 3 years. Physicians and midlevel providers <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> tended <b>to</b> be younger than those <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> stay (P = 0. 009). The most common reason to join the IHS was a desire {{to work in the}} Southwest, to stay was the quality of the medical staff, and <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> was lack of administrative support. Conclusions A high turnover rate of physicians and midlevel providers may occur in the next 3 years. A combination of factors specific to the provider, the institution, and the environment attracts physicians to the Navajo IHS and encourages them to stay. Factors that push physicians and midlevel providers <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> tend <b>to</b> be specific to the institution and are potentially amenable...|$|R
