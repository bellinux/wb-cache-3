40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the basic {{experimental}} results on the mechanical signal generator, which is applicable as the signal source in the <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> or the end apparatus of data transmission. 　As the signal source of the equipment shown in this paper, the tuning forks are used, and the reed vibrators can be also used. 　The largest problem in the equipment using the mechanical vibrator is {{the rise and fall}} time of signal. The equipment described here has the quick rise time by giving an initial displacement to the mechanical vibrator. 　When the signal generator is set into operation, the magnetic binding force to the vibrator disappears and then the vibrator begins to vibrate in the free damped vibration. The signal generated with the free damped vibration is picked up piezo-electrically or magnetically. 　Two kinds of the construction of the signal generator are described in this paper, one is the electromagnetic drive and piezo-electric pick up type, and the other is the electromagnetic drive and electromagnetic pich up one. 　This equipment has wide application and will be used widely...|$|E
50|$|Although DTMF was {{the driving}} {{technology}} implemented in <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones,</b> some <b>telephone</b> manufacturers used <b>push-button</b> keypads to generate pulse dial signaling. Before {{the introduction of}} touch-tone <b>telephone</b> <b>sets,</b> the Bell System sometimes used the term <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> to refer to key system telephones, which were rotary dial telephones that also had a set of push-buttons to select one of multiple telephone circuits, or to activate other features.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were {{developed}} that combined the bell and induction coil with the desk set, obviating a separate ringer box. The rotary dial becoming commonplace in the 1930s {{in many areas}} enabled customer-dialed service, but some magneto systems remained even into the 1960s. After World-War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient <b>telephone</b> <b>sets,</b> such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, {{were developed}} that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1963.|$|R

50|$|As {{telephone}} companies continued to levy surcharges for touch-tone service long after any technical justification ceased to exist, a <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> with pulse dialing capability represented {{a means for}} a user to obtain the convenience of push-button dialing without incurring the touch-tone surcharge.|$|R
50|$|The <b>push-button</b> <b>{{telephone}}</b> is {{a telephone}} that has electronic buttons or keys for dialing a telephone number. This phone was easier and quicker to use than the rotary dial phone because the caller pressed buttons {{rather than having}} to turn a dial.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>push-button</b> {{touch-tone}} <b>telephones</b> {{made their}} debut {{to the general}} public in 1963, the rotary dial telephone still was common for many years. In the 1970s the majority of telephone subscribers still had rotary phones, which in the Bell System of that era were leased from telephone companies instead of being owned outright. Adoption of the push-button phone was steady, but {{it took a long time}} for them to appear in some areas. At first it was primarily businesses that adopted push-button phones. By 1979, the touch-tone phone was gaining popularity, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the majority of customers owned <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> in their homes; by the 1990s, it was the overwhelming majority.|$|R
5000|$|A keypad {{is a set}} {{of buttons}} {{arranged}} in a block or [...] "pad" [...] which bear digits, symbols or alphabetical letters. Pads mostly containing numbers are called a numeric keypad. Numeric keypads are found on alphanumeric keyboards and on other devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones,</b> vending machines, ATMs, Point of Sale devices, combination locks, and digital door locks. Many devices follow the E.161 standard for their arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Dual-tone {{multi-frequency}} signaling (DTMF) is an in-band telecommunication {{signaling system}} using the voice-frequency band over telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications devices and switching centers. DTMF was first {{developed in the}} Bell System in the United States, and became known under the trademark Touch-Tone for use in <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> supplied to telephone customers, starting in 1963. [...] DTMF is standardized as ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. It is also known in the UK as MF4.|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} keypad is the keypad {{installed on}} a <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> or similar telecommunication device for dialing a telephone number. It was standardized when the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) system {{was developed in}} the Bell System in the United States in the 1960s that replaced rotary dialing originally developed in electromechanical switching systems. Because of the installed abundance of rotary dial equipment well into the 1990s, many telephone keypads were also designed to produce loop-disconnect pulses electronically, and some could be optionally switched to produce either DTMF or pulses.|$|R
50|$|Historically, not all <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> used DTMF dialing technology. Some {{manufacturers}} implemented {{pulse dialing}} with push-button keypads and even Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional dial pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} <b>telephone.</b> Pulse-mode <b>push-button</b> keypads typically stored the dialed number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid dialing for the user. Some push button pulse dial phones allow for double-speed pulse dialing. These allow even faster pulse dialing in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse dialing.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, a brief {{excursion}} from standards, GPO telecoms {{introduced in}} 1967 their first <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone,</b> the GPO 726 (Ericsson N2000 series [...] ), that used neither pulse dialing nor DTMF tones. It used a DC signalling system comprising {{a number of}} rectifier diodes arranged in different polarity configuration according to the button pressed. The 726 also required an ground wire {{as well as the}} usual A and B wires. The irony was that the dial signal still had to be converted to pulses in the host PABX.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "push-button" [...] {{has been}} {{utilized}} in calculators, <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones,</b> kitchen appliances, {{and various other}} mechanical and electronic devices, home and commercial.In industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be connected together by a mechanical linkage so {{that the act of}} pushing one button causes the other button to be released.

This method of linkage is used in simple manual operations in which the machine or process has no electrical circuits for control.|$|R
40|$|Memory for {{the layout}} of the ten digits 0 to 9 on the keypads of <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> and calculators was {{investigated}} in five experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that, despite frequent usage of these devices, free recall of the numerical layouts is quite poor; and that the layout on calculators is even harder to recall than the telephone layout. Experiment 4 showed that {{the same is true for}} recognition of the layouts. Experiment 3 revealed that part of the recall advantage of the telephone layout can be attributed to its being more plausible and more similar to a schematic or prototypical layout of digits. Experiment 5 indicated that a single case of directing attention to the layouts can enhance recall significantly. The results are integrated into earlier research on memory for everyday objects, and concepts used in laboratory memory research such as interference, inference, and attention are used to explain memory for these everyday objects.

50|$|It was {{recognized}} {{as early as the}} 1940s that faster, more accurate dialing could be done with push buttons, but this was too unreliable in customer trials until transistors transformed the industry. In 1963, the Bell System introduced to the public its dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology under the name Touch-Tone, which was a trademark in the U.S. until 1984. The Touch-Tone system used <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones.</b> In the decades after 1963, pulse dialing was gradually phased out as the primary dialing method to the central office, but many systems still support rotary telephones today. Some keypad telephones have a switch for the selection of tone or pulse dialing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>Push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> keypad is attributed to John E. Karlin, an industrial psychologist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ. On a telephone keypad, the numbers 1 through 9 are arranged from left to right, top to bottom with 0 in a row below 789 and in the center. Telephone keypads also have the special buttons labelled * (star) and # (octothorpe, number sign, [...] "pound", [...] "hex" [...] or [...] "hash") {{on either side of}} the zero key. The keys on a telephone may also bear letters which have had several auxiliary uses, such as remembering area codes or whole telephone numbers.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{designed}} {{along with}} the panel type telephone office, PCI was intended to allow subscribers in fully automated exchanges to dial numbers in manual offices {{the same way they}} dialed numbers in their own exchange. For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the requested number to the manual office, where the number was lit on an operator's display. The switchboard operator at a PCI-aware manual office reads the number from the call indicator display and completes the call in the usual way. As a format of interoffice signaling, PCI is one of multiple options retained for compatibility in the #5 Crossbar switch, a later system which served as the platform for the initial DTMF <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> services.|$|R
