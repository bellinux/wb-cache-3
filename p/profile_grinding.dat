40|$|Abstract. Generally in the {{grinding}} of modern aviation {{materials such as}} nickel-based superalloys, problems frequently occur in terms of burr formation, profile loss of the wheel, high heat generation in the contact zone, high grinding forces as well as low process reliability.

This paper presents the design of an ultrasonically vibrated block sonotrode and the experimental investigation of ultrasonically assisted <b>profile</b> <b>grinding</b> of Inconel 718.

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} temperatures {{generated in the}} workpiece during profile and cylindrical traverse grinding in the High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) regime. The HEDG regime takes large depths of cut at high wheel and workpiece speeds to create a highly efficient material removal process. This aggressive processing generates high temperatures in the contact zone between the wheel and workpiece. However, the beneficial contact angle and the rapid removal of the heated wheel – workpiece contact zone results in low temperatures in the finished surface. Temperatures in the ground surface can be predicted {{with knowledge of the}} specific grinding energy and the grinding parameters used. Specific grinding energies recorded at high specific material removal rates demonstrated a constant value of specific grinding energy dependent on cutting and contact conditions, improving accuracy of the predictive model. This was combined with a new approach to burn threshold modelling, which demonstrated an improved division of damaged and undamaged surfaces. Cutting and contact conditions in the <b>grinding</b> <b>profile</b> vary dependent on their position. This thesis shows how temperatures vary with location and estimates the partitioning of the heat flux to the regions of the <b>grinding</b> <b>profile.</b> This suggested a constant partitioning of energy to each of the three surfaces considered independently of specific material removal rates. Further a potential link was shown between the surface and the sidewall of the <b>grinding</b> <b>profile,</b> which allows temperatures in a secondary surface to be predicted given knowledge of that in the primary. Finally, the work has demonstrated the feasibility of the Superabrasive Turning process. Using small values of feed per turn and high workpiece feedrates promoted high values of removal rate with low depths of thermal penetration in the as ground surface. Thus the process has become viable for high speed cylindrical traverse grinding. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} how to {{determine}} the chloride content in concrete structures exposed to marine environment in an accurate way. When analyzing dust from dry drilling in concrete, it is very often {{a fact that the}} chloride profiles show extensive variations even if the sampling has been performed within a very concentrated area with the sampling points close to each other. Several authors have observed this phenomenon in earlier research and some of these are referred to in this thesis. The aim of this project has been to find reasons to these extensive variations and to find inspection methods that decrease the variations. Both laboratory studies and field studies have been performed within the line of this work. The laboratory study has consisted of concrete sampling by dry drilling and by <b>profile</b> <b>grinding</b> 100 mm cores on a concrete slab that had been submerged in saline water in the laboratory. The chloride profiles from the cores have been used as a reference to all other samples collected on the slab. The study shows that <b>profile</b> <b>grinding</b> of cores is the most accurate method to perform sampling on concrete with the purpose of analyzing the chloride content, and that when using small bore diameters the sampling should be performed as mixed samples from several bore holes. In all cases, samples should not only be analyzed for chloride but also for binder content. The results from the dry drilling in laboratory shows that the binder content becomes over estimated in the dust samples compared to the analyzed cores on the same concrete slab. This means that the analyzed dust samples seams to contain a higher chloride content than the cores analyzed by <b>profile</b> <b>grinding.</b> This phenomenon became obvious when simulating chloride profiles using data from EPMA. Most probably the drilling follows an easy path between the large aggregate particles. One field study has been performed in the port of Trelleborg in southern Sweden and another one in the port of Malmö, also in southern Sweden within some 50 km distance but facing the open sea in different directions. The field study in Trelleborg has consisted of an inventory of existing concrete structures in the harbour and climate studies of the wind and temperature in the area followed by a more detailed inspection including sampling on selected parts of a quay. This study shows that the exposure to open sea clearly influences the chloride content in concrete structures exposed to marine environment more than the main wind direction. The field study in the port of Malmö also confirms this finding. The conclusions of this work is that when sampling concrete on structures in marine environment it is important not only to study the surrounding environmental loads such as the dominating wind direction, but also the exposure of the structure to the open sea which has shown to be of great importance in the field studies. If it is possible, the sampling should be performed by <b>profile</b> <b>grinding</b> cores. The studies in the laboratory have shown that sampling cores gives small variations in the analyzed chloride content. If dry drilling is used, the diameter of the drill bit should not be smaller than 20 mm. In all cases the analyzes should include the binder content, since it is the binder who contains chlorides. Presenting the chloride content in % by binder content has been shown to give the smallest variations in this study...|$|E

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for normal and quasi-tangential pulsed laser <b>profiling</b> of <b>grinding</b> wheels is proposed, with laser path planning calculated {{according to a}} pre-specified angle of incidence and radial laser progression or predicted single-pass incision depth. Though tangential laser profiling has previously been investigated, few works have {{addressed the issue of}} negligible laser absorption under these conditions other than to apply a focal offset that effectively reduces the angle of incidence below 90 ∘. In the present work, the angle of incidence is specified explicitly, with normal and quasi-tangential profiling experiments performed on rotating bronze-bonded diamond and porous aluminum oxide grinding wheels with a 1064 nm nanosecond pulsed fiber laser source with 20 W average power. Triangular incisions are cut into each sample, following which analyses are performed with an optical profiler operating in confocal mode and x-ray computed tomography to determine the material removal rate and profile accuracy under all tested conditions. The angle of laser incidence is found to be of particular relevance to profiling operations, with more than one order of magnitude difference in material removal rates observed between 70 ∘ and 80 ∘ incidence, with improved profile accuracy in the latter case. Specifically, material removal rates of 0. 12 − 0. 14 mm 3 /s, 0. 075 − 0. 1 mm 3 /s and 0. 002 mm 3 /s are achieved at normal, 70 ∘ and 80 ∘ laser incidence, respectively, for bronze-bonded diamond, and 0. 1 mm 3 /s is achieved at 70 ∘ incidence for porous aluminum oxide. For both materials, profile accuracy of 50 − 70 μm is achieved under optimum conditions. The presented results highlight the necessity for precise specification and control of the angle of incidence during laser profiling operations. They furthermore confirm that laser <b>profiling</b> of <b>grinding</b> wheels is a viable alternative to electrical discharge machining for bronze-bonded diamond grinding wheels and a potential complementary process to hard-on-hard abrasion for ceramics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{localized}} wear on {{grinding wheel}} edges {{is a common}} phenomenon on <b>profile</b> <b>grinding</b> since the abrasive grains are less attached to the bond. The grinding wheel wear depends heavily on the process parameters, workpiece and wheel composition, causing changes on the process and profile deviation behaviors. In order to cope with these uncertainties, many natural and synthetic materials {{have been used in}} different grinding processes. However, the influence of mixed compositions of different types of abrasive grains on external cylindrical grinding is not well known. In order to assess this relation, a methodology procedure was developed providing an overview of the cinematic edges behavior on a progressive wheel wear. The methodology procedure is based on the acoustic emission technology, using a transducer with a 50 µm radius diamond tip. The tip, when in contact with a rotating grinding wheel, enables the evaluation of the cinematic cutting edges. The abrasive grain density was evaluated for different grinding wheel compositions and specific wear removal values. Furthermore, these results were compared to the profile deviation observed on the same tool, allowing the assessment of the influence of different microcrystalline corundum grains on the overall grinding wheel wear behavior...|$|E

40|$|Robotic {{machining}} {{has certain}} advantages over conventional CNC machining: high flexibility, capability of integration with peripherals such as sensors and external actuators, and lower cost. Attempts {{have been made}} to apply robotic machining to advanced material processing. As far as practical applications are concerned, robotic machining has been mostly restricted to simple operations under welldefined conditions, such as deburring, polishing and chamfering of new parts As compared with manufacturing new parts, one of the major difficulties in overhauling aerospace components is that the part geometry is severely distorted after service in the high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. As a result, the intended automation system cannot rely on the teach-and-play or programmingand-cut methods used for conventional robotic or machining applications. Another challenge is to overcome the process dynamics that is very much empirical and largely knowledge-based. Despite extensive research work and laboratory prototyping and implementation by researchers all over the world, an automated system for blending and polishing of 3 D distorted profiles, such as refurbishment High-Pressure Turbine (HPT) vanes, does not exist in today’s factories.

The ADI grinding with conventional grinding wheels can produce work results comparable to the superabrasive grinding wheels, followed by lower costs and flexibility in <b>profile</b> <b>grinding,</b> since these wheels can be easily re-profiled.

In the case {{on the condition of}} little movement deviation of table in z direction by repeated feed operations, compensating grinding method using personal computer and actuating table is effective. From the experiments 0. 2 μm of straightness along 250 mm length at 6 mm width is obtained on the condition of work speed v= 50 mm/s. and depth of cut 1 μm.

Output voltage from the sensor on template is put into feedback circuit. Then actuating table is controlled to move along same height as template profile. So the work is ground to the similar profile as template. From the experiments 0. 1 μm of differential error between ground work and template profiles is obtained on the condition of work speed v= 12, 5 mm/s. and depth of cut 0. 5 μm.

Specimens have also been exposed in marine tidal conditions and along a thaw-salted road. Parallel with the field exposure specimens have been exposed in salt-solutions, with different chloride concentrations and temperatures, in the laboratory. Four or five specimens have been exposed on each site to get a measure of the scatter in chloride ingress. The duration of all exposures has been approximately one year. After finalised exposure the specimens have been analysed for chloride and calcium content (acid-soluble) in depth intervals from the surface. The analyses have been made on dust-samples achieved by means of <b>profile</b> <b>grinding</b> of cores drilled from the specimens. The chloride ingress has been measured as chloride ingress profiles, where the quotient between chloride and binder content is given in depth-intervals. The binder content has been estimated from the analysed calcium content, since the content of acid soluble calcium in the aggregates in the exposed concrete composition is negligible. Additionally chloride-binding isotherms (as free-bound and free-total chloride content) have been determined for the concrete composition used in the exposure programme. The measured chloride ingress profiles have been evaluated with the error-function solution of Ficks second law to derive apparent chloride diffusion coefficients, DF 2, and surface chloride contents, Csa.
