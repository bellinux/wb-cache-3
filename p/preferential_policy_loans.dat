40|$|Background and problem: It is {{important}} for a policy aiming at overcoming discrimination to be justifiable as just or as creating justice. When a policy is implemented lacking such qualities it is argued to be unjust, which creates a problem. During the last decades there has been massive immigration to the Western countries from countries marked by war and disaster. This has created problems of integration into the “new” society, {{and the use of}} <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> has become increasingly topical. Whether or not the use of <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> is a just method is the basis of this thesis. Aim : The aim of this thesis is to study the concept of <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> in an impartial perspective of fairness. By impartial it is meant to present facts speaking both for and against <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> as being just. The main question of this thesis is whether or not preferential treatment is a just method to create equality within the society. Method : A research method of textual analysis has been used combined with an analysis of structure of arguments. Theoretical framework : First, definitions of discrimination and <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> as such are focused upon in the third chapter. Second, the concept of social justice and its connection to <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> is treated. The question if <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> should be directed towards individuals or groups is a central question in the debate and it will demand its space in this thesis. Here the importance of merit will be discussed. The section about individuals and groups will be followed by a section discussing the importance of ethnic diversity which will be followed by a comparison of the development of <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> in the USA and Sweden. Last, there will be a section where an attempt to generalize between arguments is made. Conclusions and Discussion : In this part a conclusion and a discussion will be presented. Here conclusions will be drawn from the gathered material. Finally there will be a discussion on the subject and of how the research procedure has proceeded...|$|R

The thesis concludes by stating that the <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> both work and do not work. There is an increase in the literacy rate of minorities that can be contributed to the policies.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> and political stability in three developing polities [...] Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Fiji. After a discussion of the socioeconomic environment and institutional legacies in each case, the types of <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> adopted by each were examined. The ethnic configuration; geographic distribution; the economic factors; 2 ̆ 2 exit 2 ̆ 2 alternatives; the political system; and external variables in each country were then analysed to assess their impact on political stability in the countries. The findings of this study suggest that political stability in ethnically plural societies that adopt <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> depends largely on two factors: the extent to which the politically disadvantaged group is accommodated in the political system; and the degree of hegemony exercised by the politically advantaged group, itself unified. In Malaysia and in pre- 1987 Fiji, <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> in favour of the Malays and Fijians have been accompanied by significant accommodation of Chinese and Indian interests. In Sri Lanka, the Tamils, who were a much smaller minority, were largely excluded from the political system by the Sinhalese and hence, the <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> led to their political alienation and demands for a separate state. In Malaysia and Fiji, political stability is very much dependent on the dominant ethnic groups [...] the Malays and Fijians [...] maintaining their political hegemony. The Sri Lankan case however, suggests that such hegemonic control can become excessive, and conducive to political instability unless it is balanced by some genuine accommodation of minority interests.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology {{that can be}} used by insurers to construct predictive models for their own insurance cash flows. The insurance cash flow components evaluated include premium flows, <b>policy</b> <b>loans,</b> and cash value surrenders. Also, the paper evaluates several hypotheses in the insurance literature that attempt to explain insurance cash flows. Though the results are theoretically consistent, they produce some interesting contrasts to findings of similar studies for whole life policies. For example, these results confirm that: (i) the credited rate strategy is important to policy performance; (ii) the emergency fund hypothesis appears to apply to <b>policy</b> <b>loan</b> utilization, premium payments, and total insurance cash flows; (iii) the arbitrage potential with regard to <b>policy</b> <b>loans</b> is reduced; and (iv) direct recognition of <b>policy</b> <b>loans</b> seems to be effective in reducing the disintermediation risk of traditional whole life insurance policies with fixed <b>policy</b> <b>loan</b> rates. Although policyholders do increase their use of <b>policy</b> <b>loans</b> as inflation increases, the overall results suggest that they tend to increase contributions to their universal life policies in order to maintain levels of protection in real terms. Finally, interest rate risk does exist for companies issuing universal life because changes in market interest rates lead to decreases in premiums and in total insurance cash flows. This lends support to the alternative funds hypothesis...|$|R

Results also suggest that World Bank resources are more productive -in terms of reform success- in the design of policy operations than in their supervision.
