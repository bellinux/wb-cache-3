5|$|Construction on the Croton Expressway, {{the only}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failed Hudson River Expressway project that was ever built, {{began in the}} mid-1960s. It became part of a realigned US9 when it was {{completed}} by 1967. The former surface routing of US9 along Albany Post Road between Croton-on-Hudson and Buchanan became a northward extension of NY9A, which reached the old alignment by way of an overlap with US9 from {{the north end of}} the Briarcliff–Peekskill Parkway to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E

A series of tubes led from the lamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation. The smoke rising from the turban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other candelabra in the area where the game was played.|$|E

5|$|On 19 December 1983, {{the wooden}} {{rear of the}} cabinet was pried open with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in {{absentia}} for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and {{it is widely believed}} to have been melted down and sold.

5|$|On the surface, Ambrose thanks the Doctor for {{not letting}} the Silurians execute her for killing Alaya, and the Doctor asks {{her to help}} prepare {{humanity}} for their next encounter with the Silurians. The Doctor and Amy return to the TARDIS, where Amy sights her future self on the hillside without Rory. The Doctor takes out the object he pulled from the crack: a burnt <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS's sign. He worriedly compares it to the real thing. Aside from the damage, they appear identical.|$|E

Scully and Briggs visit a chemical plant where a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victim's liver was found, ultimately discovering a skeleton encased in concrete. Meanwhile, Mulder harasses Tooms at work as he stalks a would-be victim. Later that night, Mulder follows him when he tries to break into a man's house. Tooms flees without attacking anyone.|$|E
5|$|Six {{victims of}} the {{shooting}} were carried to {{the porch of the}} Brewer house, which was shaded by a tall oak tree. The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak.

5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was resting {{on the bottom of}} a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|The wreath on {{the reverse}} is also derivative, having been {{previously}} used on Longacre's Type II gold dollar of 1854, and the three-dollar <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same year. It is composed of leaves of wheat, corn, cotton and tobacco, thus including produce associated with both the North and the South. The cotton leaves are sometimes said to be maple leaves; the two types are not dissimilar, and maple leaves are more widely known than cotton leaves. An ear of corn is also visible.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} of the aircraft was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 and was taken to Oxford to be stored.

50|$|<b>Pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> True Cross {{were one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most highly sought after such relics; many churches claimed {{to possess a}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> it, so many that John Calvin famously remarked that there were enough <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> True Cross to build a ship from.

5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E
5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{progress}} on the project has been stalled by disagreements between the Wolkoffs {{and the town of}} Islip over the amount the Wolkoffs will spend for the transportation <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, and between the family and labor unions over wages and health care. The town of Islip has stated that the Wolkoffs agreed to spend $75million (2011USD) for the infrastructure improvements; however, the family stated in a September 2011 letter that they would only commit to $27million (2011USD) and that they never agreed to the original figure. Gerald Wolkoff thought that the discrepancy stemmed from his belief that transportation should be funded by the government, not from private sources, as his project would generate tax revenue for the government. Despite the issues surrounding the project, the Heartland project received $2.5million from the State of New York for roadway improvements in December 2011. The funding was part of a $101million (2011USD) package given to Long Island for various economic improvements.|$|E
