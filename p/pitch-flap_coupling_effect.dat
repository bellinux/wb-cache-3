40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on the Mod-O 100 kW experimental wind turbine to provide data on yaw alignment characteristics of a large {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} with its yaw restraint removed (i. e., in free yaw). The wind turbine consisted of a downwind horizontal axis rotor mounted on a tubular tower. Three rotor configurations were tested. Each rotor was teetered, coned 3 deg and tip-controlled. Two of the rotors had <b>pitch-flap</b> <b>coupling</b> or Delta- 3, and one rotor had none. The two rotors with Delta- 3 differed in the airfoil used in the tip sections.

The rotor blade design was modified to increase the stability speed margin for the thin-wing design. Modest amounts of blade sweep starting at 80 % radius created large increases in the stability boundary. Increased control-system pitch stiff-ness also improved stability. Appropriate combinations of sweep and pitch stiffness completely eliminated whirl flutter within the speed range examined; alternatively, they allowed large increases in <b>pitch-flap</b> <b>coupling</b> (delta-three) for a given stability margin.

Rotor control in autorotation for teetering and articulated hub types is examined in more detail for a compound helicopter (rotor and fixed wing) using the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II.

Stability predictions obtained using the analytical rigid flapping blade analysis and a rigid blade CAMRAD II model compare favorably. For the flapping blade analysis, the teetering rotor is found to be the most stable hub type, showing no instabilities up to an advance ratio of 3 and a Lock number of 18.

40|$|A 1. 62 -m-diameter rotor {{model was}} tested in hover {{to examine the}} effects of {{structural}} flap-lag and pitch-lag coupling on isolated rotor blade lead-lag stability. Flap-lag coupling was introduced by inclining the principal axes of the blade structure up to 60 degrees. Pitch-lag coupling was obtained either alone or in combination with flap-lag coupling through the use of skewed flexural hinges. The principal results confirm the predictions of theory, and show that both structural flap-lag and pitch-lag coupling when used separately are beneficial to blade stability. Moreover, when the couplings are combined, the lead-lag damping is significantly greater than it would be if the individual contributions were superimposed. <b>Pitch-flap</b> <b>coupling</b> is shown to have only a minor effect on blade lead-lag damping.

To provide the necessary data base, the parametric study included variation in the pylon pitch and yaw stiffnesses, flapping hinge offset, and blade kinematic <b>pitch-flap</b> <b>coupling</b> over a large range of advance ratios. Cases of forward whirl flutter and of backward whirl flutter are documented.

40|$|Further {{increases}} in tiltrotor speeds {{are limited by}} coupled wing/rotor whirl-mode aeroelastic instability. Increased power, thrust, and rotor efficiency are not enough: the whirl-mode stability boundary must also be improved. With current technology, very stiff, thick wings of limited aspect ratio are essential to meet the stability requirements, which severely limits cruise efficiency and maximum speed. Larger and more efficient tiltrotors will need longer and lighter wings, for which whirl-mode flutter is a serious design issue. Numerous approaches to improving the whirl-mode airspeed boundary have been investigated, including tailored stiffness wings, active stability augmentation, variable geometry rotors, highly swept tips, and at one extreme, folding rotors.

A dual cantilevered spring system was used to increasingly null the passive stiffness of the root actuator along the feathering axis of the rotor blade.

The research shows that urbanization and eco-environment interactive coupling theories include the Kuznets curve theory, telecoupling theory, planetary boundaries theory, footprint family theory and urban metabolism theory; most research on interactive coupling relationships is concerned with single-element coupling relationships, such as those between urbanization and water, land, atmosphere, climate change, ecosystems and biodiversity; the majority of research on interactive coupling mechanisms and laws focuses on five research paradigms, including coupled human and nature systems, complex social-ecological systems, urban ecosystems, social-economic-natural complex ecosystems, and urbanization development and eco-environment constraint ring; the majority of interactive coupling simulations use STIRPAT models, coupling degree models, multi-agent system models and big data urban computer models; and research has been carried out on urbanization and eco-environment coupling thresholds, coercing risk and optimal decision support systems. An objective evaluation of progress in international research on interactive coupling between urbanization and the eco-environment suggests that there are six main research focal points and six areas lacking research: a lot of research exists on macroscopic <b>coupling</b> <b>effects,</b> with little research on urban agglomeration and scale coupling effects; considerable research exists on single-dimension <b>coupling</b> <b>effects,</b> with little on multiple-dimension coupling effects; a great deal exists on "one-to-one" dual-element <b>coupling</b> <b>effects,</b> with little on "many-to-many" multiple-element coupling effects; a lot exists on positive feedback <b>coupling</b> <b>effects,</b> and little on negative feedback coupling effects; a great deal exists on empirical <b>coupling</b> <b>effects,</b> and little on theoretical coupling effects; a great deal exists on the use of simple quantitative methods, and little on using integrated simulation methods.

40|$|The {{nexus of}} {{advanced}} manufacturing methods, computer-aided design tools, and modern structural-analysis software has enabled {{the design and}} fabrication of structurally complex wing structures with unique features. This is particularly true for small unmanned aircraft, in which discrete structural hinges can easily {{be integrated into the}} overall vehicle design. This paper examines the use of discrete structural hinges for tailoring the low-frequency flight dynamics of the vehicle. For sufficiently soft discrete structural hinges, substantial couplingbetween flexible and rigid modes occurs, leading to the potential to modify the flight dynamic behavior through structural flexibility. Using a multibody flight dynamics simulation tool with a nonlinear lifting-line aerodynamic representation, different structural-hinge elastic properties, orientation, and location on the aircraft are examined. The results for a small unmanned aircraft indicate that flexibility mostly affects the longitudinal modes and associated handling qualities of the vehicle. Changes in the short-period and phugoid modes due to flexibility caused by a set of discrete structural hinges are often antagonistic. A structural-hinge stiffness above a certain critical value tends to improve short-period flying qualities; below this value, the short-period flying qualities degrade. In addition to the stiffness characteristics of the discrete structural hinge, orientation of the hinge has a significant effect on flight dynamics. Orienting the structural hinge to produce <b>pitch–flap</b> <b>coupling</b> can triple the short-period-mode damping, which could improve a nominally Level 3 rated aircraft to a Level 1 rated aircraft...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} of inertial high-latitude ionospheric interchange instabilities, including magnetospheric <b>coupling</b> <b>effects</b> is presented. It is {{shown that the}} primary magnetosphere-ionosphere <b>coupling</b> <b>effect</b> is to incorporate the inertia of the magnetospheric plasma in the analysis. The following conclusions are drawn from the simulation: (1) magnetospheric <b>coupling</b> <b>effects</b> reduce {{the growth rate of}} the interchange instability, (2) striations produced by the inertial interchange instability develop in a different manner than in the noninertial regime, and (3) striations produced in the inertial regime are more isotropic and spread out, resulting in irregularities oriented perpendicular to those produced in the noninertial case...|$|R
