The number and kinds of annotations are so diverse and unpredictable that any attempt at developing non-adaptive automatic annotation systems is usually less effective. The {{trend in the}} literature has been to develop models that work for average users and for average scenarios. This approach has three main disadvantages. First, {{it is impossible to}} know beforehand all the patterns that could be of interest to all researchers. Second, it is practically impossible to find enough training examples for all patterns. Third, it is currently impossible to learn a model that is robustly applicable across all video quality-recording variations...|$|E
40|$|The {{laser beams}} sliced through the wafts of smoke as the {{subwoofer}} pumped bass {{deep into the}} bodies of the crowd. The atmosphere was ripe with a heady mix of synths and dancing. However something wasn't quite right in this nightclub. Projected in bright colours above the DJ booth was futuristic text, moving, dancing, flashing. This wasn't fancy visuals, it was merely a projection of Sonic Pi running on a Raspberry Pi. The occupant of the DJ booth wasn't spinning disks or playing MP 3 s, she was writing, editing and evaluating code. She was live coding and this was an Algorave. This release is codenamed Algorave to celebrate that Sonic Pi is now ready to be performed within nightclubs as well as still being a fantastic tool for learning how to code creatively. There are many improvements as detailed below. However, let's just take a brief {{look at some of the}} most fun. Firstly we have the new error reporting system to make it easier to find and debug your errors. Syntax errors are now blue and runtime errors pink. We also have a new look and feel including a new dark mode for performing in dark places. We also have some fantastic new synths, FX and have even improved the standard synths. For example, sample now lets you stretch to match the beat with the beat_stretch: opt and change pitch with pitch:. The slicer FX now sports a fantastic deterministic probability: opt for creating and manipulating rhythmic structures with ease. Finally there's the new thread local tick/look system which will revolutionise the way you work with rings within live_loops. Of course there's so much more too! Enjoy this release and happy Algoraving! Breaking Changes The res: opt for all synths and FX now has range 0 -> 1 rather than 1 -> 0. This means that a higher res value results in more resonance. This will hopefully be more intuitive to beginners less surprising for people with existing synth knowledge. The fn stop has been renamed to kill for killing specific synths. In its place a new fn stop has been added to stop a given thread or live_loop. invert_wave opts are now inverted. The default is now 0 which has the same behaviour as the old 1. This means that it's more intuitive to use the opt as to invert the current wave, you now specify: invert_wave: true, rather than invert_wave: false. This shouldn't affect any code which doesn't explicitly set the invert_wave: opt. Pieces which have explicit inversion need to swap all 0 s for 1 s and visa versa. The res: opt for rrand and rdist has been renamed to step: to avoid confusion with the resonance opt for cutoff filters. Rename pitch_ratio to pitch_to_ratio to keep in line with other similar fns such as midi_to_hz. New New thread-local (i. e. live_loop local) counter system via fns tick and look. New fn vector which creates a new kind of Array - an immutable vector (SPVector) which is now the default base class for all rings. New fns use_sample_defaults and with_sample_defaults which act similarly as their *_synth_defaults counterparts but for samples not synths. New fns use_tuning and with_tuning for exploring other tuning systems such as :just, :pythagorean, and :meantone. New fn invert_chord for chord inversions. New fn current_beat_duration for returning the duration of the current beat in seconds. New fn note_range for returning a range of notes between two notes with a pitches: opt for constraining the choice of filler notes. New fns scale_names and chord_names for returning a ring of all chords and scales. New example rerezzed - strongly influenced by Daft Punk's track derezzed. New example reich phase - a nice way of combining live_loops and tick to create sophisticated polyrhythms. New fns use_cue_logging and with_cue_logging for enabling and disabling the logging of cue messages. It is now possible to set the block type in the Minecraft API. GUI New visual look and feel including a new Dark Mode for live coding in night clubs. New preferences for hiding/showing aspects of the GUI such as the buttons, log, tabs etc. New preference for full screen mode. Improve error message reporting. Syntax errors are now made distinct from runtime errors with colour-coded messages. Also, the line number of the error is much more visible, and the line of the error is highlighted with an arrow in the left-hand margin. Workspaces are now named buffers. This is a smaller word which works better on lower res screens and is also a lovely term used by a number of wonderful programming editors such as Emacs. <b>Print</b> <b>friendly</b> messages to the log on boot. Add pref option to check for updates now. Synths & FX New FX - krush for krushing the sound. New FX - panslicer similar to slicer and wobble but modulates the stereo panning of the audio. New synth subpulse for a full range pulse with extra bass. New synth blade - a moody Blade Runner-esque synth violin New synth piano - a basic piano emulation. Only capable of whole notes. FXs slicer and wobble now have a wonderful new probability: opt which will only slice on (or off depending on wave inversion) with the specified probability. The behaviour is deterministic, so repeated calls with the same seed: and probability: opts will result in the same behaviour. Great for adding interesting rhythmic variation to sound. FXs slicer and wobble now have smoothing opts for even more control over the resulting wave form. Teach sample the opt beat_stretch: for modifying the rate of the sample to make sure the duration of the sample is n beats long (with respect to the current bpm). Note: stretching the beat does change the pitch. Teach sample the opt pitch to enable pitch shifting on any sample. FX flanger's feedback mixing is now more fair and is less likely to hike up the amplitude. Improvements Teach note_info to also handle a number as its param. Teach factor? to handle division by 0. Teach load_sample to throw exception when passed an empty path. Now throws an exception when you attempt to create an empty ring. Rings are now immutable (in the Clojure sense) which means they can be safely passed to multiple threads/live_loops without any issues. Teach use_sample_bpm the opt num_beats: to indicate that a given sample consists of a specific number of beats. Teach comment and uncomment to require blocks. Teach synth chord groups to allow their notes to be controlled individually to allow transitions between chords. Throw nicer exception when unable to normalise synth args Teach chord the new opt invert: as a shortcut to the new invert_chord fn. Teach sample_duration about the opts start: and finish: and envelope opts such as attack: and release:. This allows you to replace any call to sample with sample_duration to get the exact duration of that call. Teach chord the opt num_octaves to enable the easy creation of arpeggios. Bug Fixes Fix bug in with_sample_pack_as to now correctly accept a block. mx_surface_teleport no longer throws an error. Array#shuffle now works correctly with the random seeds for deterministic behaviour. Fix broken behaviour with multiple nested calls to *_sample_bpm...|$|E

(# 680) Added corpus_trim() and char_trim() functions for selecting documents or subsets of documents based on sentence, paragraph, or document lengths. Conversion of a dfm to an stm object now passes docvars through in the $meta of the return object. New dfm_group(x, groups =) command, a convenience wrapper around dfm. dfm(x, groups =) (# 725). Methods for extending quanteda functions to readtext objects updated to match CRAN release of readtext package. Corpus constructor methods for data. frame objects now conform to the "text interchange format" for corpus data. frames, automatically recognizing doc_id and text fields, which also provides interoperability with the readtext package. corpus construction methods are now more explicitly tailored to input object classes. Bug fixes and stability enhancements dfm_lookup() behaves more robustly on different platforms, especially for keys whose values match no features (# 704). textstat_simil() and textstat_dist() no longer take the n argument, as this was not sorting features in correct order. Fixed failure of tokens(x, what = "character") when x included Twitter characters @ and # (# 637). Fixed bug # 707 where ntype. dfm() produced an incorrect result. Fixed bug # 706 where textstat_readability() and textstat_lexdiv() for single-document returns when drop = TRUE. Improved the robustness of corpus_reshape(). print, and head, and tail methods for dfm are more robust (# 684). Fixed bug in convert(x, to = "stm") caused by zero-count documents and zero-count features in a dfm (# 699, # 700, # 701). This also removes docvar rows from $meta when this is passed through the dfm, for zero-count documents. Corrected broken handling of nested Yoshikoder dictionaries in dictionary().

40|$|ABSTRACT: Solar cell {{substrates}} require high optical transparency {{but also}} prefer high optical haze {{to increase the}} light scattering and consequently the absorption in the active materials. Unfortunately, there is a trade-off between these optical properties, which is exemplified by common trans-parent paper substrates exhibiting a transparency of about 90 % yet a low optical haze (< 20 %). In this work, we introduce a novel transparent paper made of wood fibers that displays both ultrahigh optical transparency (∼ 96 %) and ultrahigh haze (∼ 60 %), thus delivering an optimal substrate design for solar cell devices. Compared to previously demonstrated nanopaper composed of wood-based cellulose nanofibers, our novel transparent paper has better dual performance in transmittance and haze but also is fabricated {{at a much lower}} cost. This high-performance, low-cost transparent paper is a potentially revolutionary material that may influence a new generation of environmentally <b>friendly</b> <b>printed</b> electronics...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEnvironmental {{concerns}} {{have been growing}} in the recent past, as a major issue worldwide. Sophisticated instruments and methods for sampling and analyzing are able to quantify a large spectrum of compounds at low concentrations. Among them, pollutants or disease biomarkers are of particular interest, like Volatile Organic Compounds, Heavy metals, specific biomarkers such as some proteins, endocrine disruptors have been the pollutants of major concern. They {{can be in the}} environment or in biological samples, in gaseous or liquid state: indoor/outdoor air, breath, biofluids like blood, serum, urine, etc. To complement the methodologies employed currently, we urgently need chemical and biological microsensors as dedicated solutions for on-site and real-time monitoring or early warning systems. Work done in our group, WAVES, at IMS Bordeaux, is geared to the development of such solutions. In this Talk, we will focus on highly sensitive Surface Acoustic Wave-based devices (SAW), incorporating versatile resonant electronic component, combined with sensitive films based on carbon nanomaterials, which offer excellent surface specific as well as other advantages, including their mechanical properties, as well as the ease of deposition by <b>friendly</b> <b>printing</b> technologies. There is a growing interest on the use of such nanomaterials for sensing applications by incorporating them in SAW sensors.,,, We will present the results of our several studies made with Carbon NanoTube-based and Graphene or Graphene Oxide-based thin films, deposited on guided Shear-Horizontal SAW devices, also called Love wave devices, by using various methods such as inkjet printing or drop-casting. Experiments conducted in our labs to detect vapors such as ethanol or toluene, as well as the moisture, demonstrate the great potential of such structures for sensing applications at ambient temperature. For instance, we obtained a sensitivity of 15 Hz. ppm– 1 with ethanol in nitrogen as inert carrier gas, from tests conducted with steps at fixed concentrations in the range from 30 to 1000 ppm. Fast response and good reversibility were observed in most cases. Such characteristics make C-based nanomaterials highly promising, compared to results previously obtained with other porous materials. Further chemical functionalization of CNTs or G-based materials is described to increase the sensitivity and, above all, to control the specificity and finally the selectivity of the microsensors. Interestingly, C-based films can be used with other types of microsensors, such as electromagnetic ones, that may offer a complementary signal, compared to the SAW device which is mainly based on mechanical effects only.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{determine}} the potential of lessening the high energy cost in the hospitality industry so that the industry could stay alive after a three decades of civil war in Sri Lanka. The hospitality industry is a significant contributor to the country’s economic growth. Tourism industry has much hope of recovering in the year 2010. Improved tourism would also benefit larger part of Sri Lankan population as they are directly and indirectly employed to serve the tourism industry. Sri Lanka has a high electricity production cost as it depends heavily on the imported fossil fuel. Survival of hospitality industry would depend on {{the manner in which the}} energy cost - the second highest overhead in hotels is managed. If the industry survives, Sri Lanka would receive more foreign exchange and thereby improve country’s foreign currency reserve which could contribute to high growth rate. As electricity production is mainly depending on thermal, the volatility of world crude oil prices is directly affecting the country’s electricity prices. However, low dependence on the grid would help the hospitality industry to mitigate the energy cost. As the electricity and diesel costs -the highest and the next - are considerable portions in energy cost in hospitality industry, the study aims to discuss the possible ways of mitigating such costs. Measurements done by the presenters found that the usage of electricity for air conditioning system does constitute most of the electricity consumption for a hotel whilst most of the diesel consumption is for thermal applications. If Air Conditioning (AC) can be operated without electricity and thermal applications could be operated using abundantly available alternative energy sources then the overall energy costs of hospitality industry could be reduced thereby making higher profits. This would ensure industry survives and country gets more foreign exchange.   Study and calculations done by the presenters proved that operating of generators only for electricity production is not viable, due to high fossil fuel cost, however if its high exhaust temperature which is wasted otherwise, could be utilized for operation of absorption chillier then the dependence of grid electricity for air conditioning could be minimized. Further studies also revealed that if water cooled generator is used for such purpose instead of air cooled, and then the hot water requirement of hotel also could be fulfilled, thus mitigating the dependence of fossil fuel which is used otherwise for hot water production. Study also revealed that if thermal energy could be fed with biomass- Sri Lanka being a tropical country is blessed with abundantly available biomass - then the dependency on the fossil fuel for thermal applications could be avoided. This would not only mitigate the second highest energy cost for hotels but also create less carbon foot <b>print,</b> more environmental <b>friendly</b> and produce less noxious exhaust gases thereby creating an advertisement to attract tourists who longing to support green hotel...|$|R
