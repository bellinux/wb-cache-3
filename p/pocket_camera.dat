2500|$|The most {{remarkable}} finding was {{the corpse of}} George Leigh Mallory at a height of [...] The lack of extreme injuries indicated he had not tumbled very far. His waist showed severe rope-jerk mottling, showing the two had been roped when they fell. Mallory's injuries were such that a walking descent was impossible: his right foot was nearly broken off {{and there was a}} golf ball-sized puncture wound in his forehead. Even though his unbroken leg was on top of the broken one, as if to protect it, Mass. General Hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Elliot Schwamm believes it not possible that he would have been conscious after the forehead injury. There was no oxygen equipment near the body, but the oxygen bottles would have been empty by that time and discarded at a higher altitude to relinquish the heavy load. Mallory was not wearing snow goggles, although a pair was stored in his vest, which may indicate that he was on the way back by night. However, a contemporary photograph shows he had two sets of goggles when he started his summit climb. The image of his wife Ruth which he intended to put on the summit was not in his vest. He carried the picture throughout the whole expedition—a sign that he might have reached the top. Since his Kodak <b>pocket</b> <b>camera</b> was not found, there is no proof of a successful climb to the summit.|$|E

50|$|Between 1977 and 1979, Rollei {{commissioned}} a little known Japanese company to manufacture {{a range of}} three, basic <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras.</b> These were sold under the brand name Pocketline by Rollei. However, sales were poor, although precise sales figures are unavailable.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{consumer}} market favors ease of use, portability and price, most consumer-grade camcorders emphasize handling and automation over {{audio and video}} performance. Most devices with camcorder capability are camera phones or compact digital cameras, in which video is a secondary capability. Some <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras,</b> mobile phones and camcorders are shock-, dust- and waterproof.|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of films enabled the existing designs for plate cameras {{to be made}} much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged {{so that it could}} be folded up compressing the bellows. These designs were very compact and small models were dubbed vest <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras.</b> Folding rollfilm cameras were preceded by folding plate cameras, more compact than other designs.|$|R

Mobile phone <b>cameras,</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras,</b> and entry level handycams, however, are typically allowed, {{and there is no}} regulation banning railway photography or filming in stations. For commercial use, a permit must be obtained from the rail office or station's head.|$|R

5000|$|The Kodak United Company {{opened a}} factory and {{storefront}} at 41-43 Clerkenwell and {{took advantage of}} the surplus of unemployed Jewelers and Watch makers to build their Stereoscopic and Folding <b>Pocket</b> <b>Cameras</b> that they produced and repaired. The location also allowed them easy access to the chemicals required for their Bromide based papers and negatives. During the war they were relocated for security reasons because of the fear that Axis bombs would destroy the photographic equipment used for the war effort.|$|R
50|$|An active-pixel sensor (APS) is {{an image}} sensor {{consisting}} of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. There are many types of active pixel sensors including the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) APS used most commonly in cell phone cameras, web <b>cameras,</b> most digital <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras</b> since 2010, and in most digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs). Such an image sensor is produced using CMOS technology (and is hence {{also known as a}} CMOS sensor), and has emerged as an alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors.|$|R

50|$|The Minolta 110 Zoom SLR was a 110 format single-lens reflex (SLR) camera {{produced}} by Minolta of Japan between 1976 and 1979. It {{was the first}} SLR in 110 format. It had an unusual, flattened shape. Other 110 SLRs were shaped like SLRs in larger formats, but the 110 Zoom SLR took the flat format of the typical 110 <b>pocket</b> <b>camera</b> and added a larger lens and prism hump to it. 1979's replacement, the Minolta 110 Zoom SLR Mark II, had a more conventional shape.|$|E
50|$|For its time, the Rollei 35 was the {{smallest}} camera that used standard 35 mm film cartridges, {{which made it}} an ideal second camera for amateur photographers. Initially, it came with a Zeiss Tessar lens with an aperture of f/3.5 and focal length of 40 mm. In contrast to 16 mm cameras (especially pocket cameras that came along later), {{there was no need}} to work with two different film formats, which was especially convenient for showing slides. Equally important, image quality was not compromised, despite the <b>pocket</b> <b>camera</b> format. Over time, several Rollei 35 models were released; especially notable was the 35S which had a 5-element Zeiss Sonnar f/2.8, 40 mm lens.|$|E
50|$|He {{participated in}} Jamie McGuinness' {{international}} expedition. He {{was also on}} the mountain and shot film for two documentaries. One of these documentaries was shown on TV4 in March 2007 and was called Fredrik Sträng och mysteriet på Everest (Fredrik Sträng and the Everest mystery) and was about the theory that George Mallory theoretically could have climbed the mountain as early as June 8, 1924. The other documentary was called 7 Summits and was about Fredrik Sträng's climb of the tallest mountains on each continent on the planet. Fredrik Sträng was even on Mount Everest {{to look for a}} Kodak Vest <b>pocket</b> <b>camera</b> which George Mallory's climbing partner Andrew Irvine would have carried and which hypothetically could contain a photograph of Mallory and Irvine on the summit.|$|E
5000|$|... 1895: The first <b>pocket</b> Kodak <b>camera,</b> the $5 <b>Pocket</b> Kodak, was introduced. It {{was of the}} box form type, {{slipping}} {{easily into}} an ordinary coat pocket, and producing negatives 1½ x 2 inches.|$|R
50|$|More models followed, Le Merveilleux, Le Meritoire and the Instantograph in 1882, and the <b>pocket</b> watch <b>camera</b> in 1886. In 1898 it {{claimed to}} be the worlds largest camera {{manufacturer}} having sold over 200,000 cameras.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to increased resolution, larger image sensors are becoming available; Kodak {{has produced a}} 50-megapixel CCD which is 49.1×36.85 mm (1.93×1.45&Prime;), approaching {{the size of a}} frame of 120 film (60×45 mm) and is twice the area of a 35 mm frame (36×24 mm), and over seventy times the area of the typical 1/1.8&Prime; (7.2×5.3 mm) sensor size used in point-and-shoot <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras.</b> Large-area CCDs are used by the several manufacturers of high-resolution photographic equipment. Other recent innovations are built-in LCD viewing screens and the inclusion of all processing within the camera back, with output in open DNG file format, as in the Sinar 65.|$|R
5000|$|The Game Boy Camera and Game Boy Printer (<b>Pocket</b> <b>Camera</b> and Pocket Printer in Japan) are {{accessories}} for the Game Boy handheld gaming {{system and}} were released in 1998. The camera can take basic, often grainy, black-and-white digital images using the four-color palette of the Game Boy system. The printer utilizes heat-sensitive paper to [...] "burn" [...] saved images, making a hard copy. There are also several minigames {{built into the}} camera itself. A picture of the player's face is used as an avatar in the minigames. Both accessories were marketed by Nintendo as light-hearted entertainment devices in all three major video game regions of the world: Japan, North America, and Europe.

50|$|The Game Boy Camera (GBC), {{released}} as <b>Pocket</b> <b>Camera</b> (ポケットカメラ) in Japan, is an official Nintendo accessory for the handheld Game Boy gaming console {{and was released}} on September 17, 1998 in Japan, which ceased manufacture in late 2002. It is compatible {{with all of the}} Game Boy platforms (with the exception of Game Boy Micro). The camera has a 128×128 pixel CMOS sensor, and can store 128×112, black & white digital images using the 4-color palette of the Game Boy system. It interfaced with the Game Boy Printer, which utilized thermal paper to print any saved images, making a hardcopy. Both the camera and the printer were marketed by Nintendo as light-hearted entertainment devices aimed mainly at children in all three major video game regions of the world: Japan, North America, and Europe. N64 Magazine (which has since been superseded by NGamer) dedicated a monthly section to the device.|$|E
50|$|Julius Shulman {{was born}} in Brooklyn on October 10, 1910, and {{grew up on a}} small farm in Connecticut before moving to Los Angeles while still a boy. He briefly {{attended}} the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of California, Berkeley, and earned pocket money by selling his photographs to fellow students. In 1936 he returned to Los Angeles, where he was enlisted by a friend, working as a draftsman for Neutra, to take photographs of a new, Neutra-designed Kun Residence in Hollywood with his amateur Kodak Vest <b>Pocket</b> <b>camera.</b> When Neutra saw the pictures, he asked to meet the photographer and proceeded to give him his first assignments which assisted Shulman in launching his career in architectural photography. Shulman opened a studio in Los Angeles in 1950, by that time drawing much of his work from magazines based in New York. He remained in business full-time until the late 1980s. In 2000, Shulman gave up retirement to begin working with business partner Juergen Nogai.|$|E
5000|$|Rollei {{made other}} {{viewfinder}} cameras besides the Rollei 16 and the Rollei 35, the best-known {{of which were}} the A26 and the A110 / E110. The A26 was the smallest camera that used Instamatic film. It was cleverly designed, folding together to protect the lens and the viewfinder. The A110, a successor to the Rollei 16, was a pocket-sized camera that used 110 film cartridges; it was compact, stylish and highly regarded. Later on, Rollei released a cheaper alternative in silver, the E110. Both models sold extremely well - the A26 achieved sales of almost 140,000 units, while over 240,000 <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras</b> were sold.|$|R

40|$|Background] Flowers, {{flowering}} {{and fruit}} set are key determinants of grapevine yield. Currently, practical methods {{to assess the}} flower number per inflorescence, necessary for fruit set estimation, are time and labour demanding. This work aims at developing a simple, cheap, fast, accurate and robust machine vision methodology {{to be applied to}} RGB images taken under field conditions, to estimate the number of flowers per inflorescence automatically. [Results] Ninety images of individual inflorescences of Vitis vinifera L. cultivars Tempranillo, Graciano and Carignan were acquired in the vineyard with a <b>pocket</b> RGB <b>camera</b> prior to flowering, and used to develop and test the 'flower counting' algorithm. Strong and significant relationships, with R 2 above 80 % for the three cultivars were observed between actual and automated estimation of inflorescence flower numbers, with a precision exceeding 90 % for all cultivars. [Conclusion] The developed algorithm proved that the analysis of digital images captured by <b>pocket</b> <b>cameras</b> under uncontrolled outdoors conditions was able to automatically provide a useful estimation of the number of flowers per inflorescence of grapevines at early stages of flowering. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.
