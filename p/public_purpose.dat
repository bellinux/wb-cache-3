With {{a growing concern}} that society’s needs are not being met, there are heightened expectations for accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes.</b> At the same time higher education institutions are experiencing increasing competition, as well as decreasing state support for public higher education. The concern is that competition for resources is overtaking accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes.</b> Using an observational correlational research design, this study explored the relationships between institutional competition for resources and accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes</b> at the undergraduate level among 428 U. S. public four-year institutions. The study examined institutional competition organized around the four key markets that generate institutional revenues (student enrollment, research funding, public fiscal support, and private giving) and institutional accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes</b> defined by accountability measures most frequently included in state-level performance accountability systems (access, affordability, and completion). The relationship between institutional competition for resources and accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes</b> was also examined considering institutional fiscal health and market segment. The accountability triangle, resource dependency theory, and postsecondary market taxonomy provided a conceptual framework for the study. The {{results of the study}} indicate a statistically significant relationship between institutional competition for resources and institutional accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes.</b> In particular, a negative relationship was observed between institutional competition and accountability for access (R 2 =. 16) and affordability (R 2 =. 05), and a positive relationship was observed between institutional competition and accountability for completion (R 2 =. 09). Institutional fiscal health was a statistically significant factor in only the relationship between institutional competition and accountability for access producing an increase in the predictive power of the model (R 2 =. 16 to R 2 =. 18). In addition, no differences were found {{in the nature of the}} relationship between institutional competition and institutional accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes</b> across the market segments of higher education. Most importantly, this study provides empirical evidence of a relationship between the complicated constructs of institutional competition for resources and institutional accountability for <b>public</b> <b>purposes</b> at the undergraduate level within U. S. public four-year institutions. With the force of institutional competition likely to increase and the necessity for higher education to serve <b>public</b> <b>purposes</b> critical, additional research further exploring the relationships between institutional competition and institutional accountability at the undergraduate level is crucial...|$|R

500|$|In equal {{protection}} cases, {{the purpose of}} the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged. When {{the purpose of the}} law is not explicitly stated, the court may conclude that there is no legitimate <b>public</b> <b>purpose,</b> assume that there is a legitimate <b>public</b> <b>purpose</b> but refuse to look for it, or draw some inferences as to what it is. When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated, the court may either accept it at face value; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration, looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose. In the latter situation, what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation. The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the [...] "thornier aspects of judicial review", because it must either [...] "uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value" [...] or [...] "challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference". The court must then [...] "make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end".|$|E

In Galstaun v. Attorney-General (1980), the applicant alleged that the Collector of Land Revenue had compulsorily acquired more of his land that was required for public purposes pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act. The High Court held that the argument had to be rejected in the light of section 5(3) of the Act, which provided that the President's declaration that land was needed for a <b>public</b> <b>purpose</b> [...] "shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for the purpose specified therein". The Court said: [...] "When the Government declares that a certain purpose is a <b>public</b> <b>purpose</b> it must be presumed that the Government is in possession of facts which induce the Government to declare that the purpose is a public purpose". However, in Teng Fuh Holdings Pte. Ltd. v. Collector of Land Revenue (2006), the Court clarified that section 5(3) cannot prevent judicial intervention if there is evidence that the Government exercised its power of compulsory acquisition in bad faith.|$|E
