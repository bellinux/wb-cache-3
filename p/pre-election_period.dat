40|$|Abstract: We {{construct}} an otherwise standard {{general equilibrium model}} of economic growth and endogenously chosen fiscal policy, in which individuals {{compete with each other}} for extra fiscal transfers and two political parties compete with each other for staying in power. The main prediction is that relatively large public sectors in <b>pre-election</b> <b>periods</b> distort incentives by pushing individuals away from productive work to rent seeking activities. In turn, distorted incentives hurt growth. We test this prediction by using a panel data set of a group of 25 OECD countries over the period 1982 - 1996, as well as a cross-section of 108 industrial and developing countries over the decade 1990 - 2000. There is evidence that electoral and/or political instability cause relatively large public sectors, which in turn increase rent seeking (as measured by the ICRG index), and this is bad for economic growth...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an intertemporal utility model that determines {{the effects of}} elections on the public expenditure composition. Conventional political budget cycle models describe incumbents as concerned only with the conditions that guarantee re-appointment. Aiming at achieving re-election, incumbents behave opportunistically in order to seduce voters about their political performance. The paper introduces another motivation for the manipulation of the public expenditure mix near elections: the incumbent 2 ̆ 019 s concern with her future utility {{in the case of}} defeat. We provide data to suggest that both central and local governments in the European Union do manipulate the budget composition around election moments. In order to rationalise this observation, the paper proposes a model where voters and incumbent are rational, have complete information and no bias towards any category of public expenditure, namely consumption expenditure or investment expenditure. The paper shows that even under these extreme conditions, an electorally induced cycle on public expenditure mix is still expected, one where consumption expenditure raises relative to investment expenditure in <b>pre-election</b> <b>periods.</b> This opportunistic budget manipulation follows from two facts. First, any decision an incumbent makes on consumption expenditure pays back political dividends during the same period the expenditure is incurred, while any investment expenditure only becomes visible to voters with a one-period delay. Second, re-election is an uncertain event, which makes the second state of nature valuable. Outside politics, the incumbents 2 ̆ 019 pay back is a direct function of the voters 2 ̆ 019 assessment of the incumbents 2 ̆ 019 job while in office. The model is then extended to accommodate the scenario where voters and society at large do not share preferences. When voters or society evidence a preference prone to one of the public expenditure categories, a bias towards such category emerges in post-election <b>periods.</b> In <b>pre-election</b> <b>periods</b> two cases are found. Consumption expenditures exceed investment expenditures if either voters or society prefer the former category at the margin. The cycle 2 ̆ 019 s nature is ambiguous if the marginal preferences of voters or society are biased towards investment expenditures. JEL classification: H 50, E 62.

40|$|The {{efforts of}} {{politicians}} in power {{to affect the}} decisions of voters through expansive fiscal policies in <b>pre-election</b> <b>periods</b> are still topical. This article determines whether governments in European Union countries initiate the political-budget cycle. We analyse 23 EU member states in the period 1995 – 2008. We pay attention to four institutional factors that {{can contribute to the}} creation of the political-budget cycle: length of democracy, type of parliamentary election, term of election and ideology. We find that the political-budget cycle was present throughout European Union countries in this period. The factor of the length of democracy had a small impact on the statistical significance of the results. However, ideology turned out to be the most important factor in our analysis. Current revenues were used as a tool of fiscal policy in the years of elections predominantly by ideologically mixed governments. Left-wing governments used rather the expenditure side of the budget to win the favour of the electorate. The type of election (regular or early) became relevant only in specific cases and in combination with other institutional factors. Finally, the new EU member governments consider the spring or autumn term of the election as a criterion co-determining their pre-election fiscal policies...|$|R

The paper represents an introductory examination of to date well known topics concerning geographical data and software but with the focus of using them for teaching geographical issues and introducing them for the use of (online) Geographic Information tools. In particular it will be pointed out how geographical questions can be raised and tackled by means of data and features spread over the web and containing geographical data. There is also an analysis of how they can be elaborated cartographically. The paper opens with a short introduction to the geographical “revolutions” that took place in the late XX and early XXI centuries in the digital age, with the advent of GIS and the so-called neogeography. A brief review on how GIS and geospatial technologies in general can be effectively used to disseminate geographical issues follows. The attention is then focused on an exercise, that can be proposed to geography students, or that is, the analysis of the Italian 2013 general election. The exercise foresees the use of geocoded tweets from Twitter, the popular social media, and some of the hashtags used in the <b>pre-election</b> <b>periods</b> (#elezioni 2013) to observe their concentrations. The exercise also implies working with a free web GIS service such as GeoCommons, which together with other families of similar online software, make it possible to produce maps showing some thematic representations of the results obtained as well as analyzing the data with more than basic visualization functions...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} private {{television}} in Europe heralded {{a new age}} of broadcasting. No longer would monopolies control {{the flow of information}} in democracies, no longer would only one source of information reign. Private television has contributed significantly throughout Europe to strengthening democracies by providing additional avenues for citizens to access information and be exposed to different points of view. However, one mode of political speech has been banned in many European countries since the inception of television broadcasting, namely political advertising. This paper aims to assess the legitimacy and desirability of such bans with regard to the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information enshrined in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. To this end, three jurisdictions will be examined, namely Belgium, Ireland and Finland. There exist cogent reasons that support a comparison of such jurisdictions. The choice of Belgium and Ireland is inspired by both countries having a similar population size, electoral system, public and commercial broadcasting sector, and most importantly, by both having to some degree installed a ban on political advertising on public and private television. In Ireland and Belgium’s French Community, this {{takes the form of a}} blanket ban. In Belgium’s Flemish Community, however, the new Media Decree now allows broadcasters to transmit political ads during <b>pre-election</b> <b>periods.</b> Yet, as the federal law on election expenditure still prescribes a ban on paid political advertising on radio and television in pre-election time, the Flemish regulation remains a dead letter. The choice of Finland on the other hand is motivated by this country being another European country with a similar population, electoral system and broadcasting sector, that in contrast allows for political advertising on television. Examination of the regulation and practical organisation thereof can provide meaningful insights in the added value of political advertising within a democracy. This paper firstly describes the current legal situation in Belgium and Ireland concerning political advertising. Secondly, a critique thereof is provided, in the light of the European Court of Human Rights’ case law and the Finnish example. Whereas there are strong arguments for disallowing political advertising on public service broadcasters, we argue that there is an overwhelming case for allowing such advertising on private television, based on Article 10 of the European Convention. Moreover, allowing political advertising on private television would have many positive effects. Firstly, smaller political parties and political advocacy groups would be able to disseminate their views, which would at the same time enable citizens to have access to an increased number of viewpoints, and secondly, private television broadcasters could arguably increase their advertising revenue, which in turn would lead to increased investment in high quality news and current affairs programmes. In addition, we argue that political advertising should not be limited to party political broadcasts during (pre-) election periods, but should also include human rights groups advocating changes in law or governmental policy, environmental groups criticising government, and many other forms of political speech. In short, this paper aims to put forward a working model for allowing political advertising on private television in Belgium and Ireland...|$|R
