40|$|Abstract: The key {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to explore the impact of different macroeconomic variables on the stock prices in India using annual data from 1990 - 91 to 2010 - 11. A multiple regression model is designed to test the effects of macroeconomic variables on the stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> granger causality test is conducted to examine whether there exist any causal linkage between stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> macro economic variables. Our estimates of multivariate Granger causality indicate that there is no causal association between stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> interest rate, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> index of industrial production, but unidirectional causality exist between stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> inflation, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> foreign direct investment,stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> gross domestic product, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> exchange rate, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> gross fixed capital formation. However, bi- directional causality exist between stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> foreign exchange reserve, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> money supply, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> crude oil <b>price</b> <b>and</b> stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> whole <b>price</b> index. The multiple regression results of the study indicate that oil <b>price</b> <b>and</b> gold <b>price</b> have a significant negative effect on stock price, while balance of trade, interest rate, foreign exchange reserve, gross domestic product, industrial production index and money supply positively influence Indian stock price. On the other hand, inflation rate, foreign direct investment, exchange rate <b>and</b> wholesale <b>price</b> index do not appear to have any significant effect on stock price. The results have implications on domestic as well as foreign investors, stock market regulators, policy makers and stock market analysts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} what {{determines the}} correlation between <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> turnover in European housing markets. Using a panel vector autoregressive model, we find {{that there is a}} particularly strong feedback mechanism between <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> turnover. Momentum effects are another important reason why <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> turnover are correlated. Common underlying factors, such as GDP and interest rates, also explain part of the price-turnover correlation. The results in this paper imply that, to understand <b>price</b> <b>and</b> turnover dynamics, it is important to model <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> turnover as two interdependent processes. Ignoring this interdependency results in a considerable bias in the coefficient estimates of both <b>price</b> <b>and</b> turnover models...|$|R

5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential <b>pricing,</b> <b>and</b> secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|As of January 2015, Valve {{themselves}} had provided some user-developed Workshop content as paid-for features in Valve-developed games, including Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2; with over $57 million {{being paid to}} content creators using the Workshop.

To promote their new flagship, Lexus launched a US$50 million advertising campaign, {{the most expensive}} marketing effort since {{the launch of the}} division. In mid-1995, sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit, potentially raising the price of a fully optioned LS 400 to over US$100,000. Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by the second quarter of that year, and sales recovered in the following months. Ultimately, second-generation LS 400 sales were not as voluminous as the original model; production totaled approximately 114,000 units.|$|E

By applying the techniques of unit–root tests, cointegration and the long–run Granger non–causality test recently proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), we test the causal relationships between the BSE Sensitive Index and the five macroeconomic variables, viz., money supply, index of industrial production, national income, interest rate and rate of inflation using monthly data for the period 1992 - 93 to 2000 - 01. The major findings are (i) there is no causal linkage between stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> money supply, stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> national income <b>and</b> stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> interest rate, (ii) index of industrial production lead the stock <b>price,</b> <b>and</b> (iii) there exists a two – way causation between stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> rate of inflation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> consumption, {{through the use of}} debt. Using unique Canadian household-level data that reports the uses of debt, we begin by looking at the relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> debt. Using quantile regression, we find a positive and significant relationship between regional house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> total household debt all along the conditional debt distribution. This suggests that the household-level relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> debt goes beyond the purchase of real estate. We then find a positive relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> non-mortgage debt (the sum of secured lines of credit, unsecured lines of credit, leases and other consumer loans, except for credit cards) for homeowners. Combining these results with the reported uses of non-mortgage debt allows us to connect house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> nonhousing consumption - this connection is new to the literature on house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> consumption. We conclude that the increases in house prices over the 1999 - 2007 period were, indeed, associated with an increase in non-mortgage debt and non-housing consumption. Our results {{can be thought of as}} the establishment of a conservative lower bound for the overall relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> aggregate consumption...|$|R

5|$|Owing {{to budget}} {{constraints}} and the scheduled closure of Boeing's Globemaster production line in 2015, {{it was considered}} unlikely in 2012 that the RAAF would acquire more Globemasters. However, in August 2014 Minister for Defence David Johnston stated that the Government was likely to purchase a further one or two C-17s. The Government {{announced that it would}} purchase two Globemasters in October 2014, and requested information on the <b>pricing</b> <b>and</b> availability for a further pair of aircraft. In November 2014 Australia lodged a formal request with the United States Defense Security Cooperation Agency for four C-17s and associated equipment, for a total cost of $A1.85 billion. An order for the RAAF's seventh and eighth Globemasters was formally announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on 10April 2015. The first of the new C-17s arrived in Australia on 29 July 2015, and the second on 4 November that year. These two aircraft were among the last C-17s to have been built before the production line was closed, and it is not expected that the RAAF will acquire more Globemasters. It was reported in December 2014 that the New Zealand Government was considering purchasing between two and four Globemasters, and Australian Aviation journalist Andrew McLaughlin suggested that any such acquisition would build on Australia's C-17 support infrastructure. The New Zealand Government ultimately decided to not purchase any Globemasters.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend models of 9 ̆ 3 search market {{equilibrium}} 9 ̆ 4 to incorporate general equilibrium considerations.

For any distribution of <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage offers across firms these optimal strategies generate product demand and labor supply schedules. Firms then choose <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> wages to maximize expected profits taking these schedules as given, and the resulting profits are paid out to individuals as dividends. An equilibrium distribution of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> wages is one which results from optimal <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage setting behavior by firms given individuals optimal search strategies. There are two possible equilibrium configurations, a degenerate equilibrium in which all firms charge the same <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage <b>and</b> a <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage dispersion equilibrium.

40|$|Abstract Housing market cycles are {{featured}} by {{a positive correlation}} of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> trading volume, which is conventionally attributed to a causal relationship between <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume. This paper analyzes the housing markets in 114 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States from 1990 to 2002, treats both <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume as endogenous variables, and studies whether and how exogenous shocks cause co-movements of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume. At quarterly frequency, we find that, first, both home <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> trading volume are affected by conditions in labor markets, the mortgage market, and the stock market, and the effects differ between markets with low and high supply elasticity. Second, home prices Granger cause trading volume, but the effects are asymmetric—decreases in prices reduce trading volume, <b>and</b> increases in <b>prices</b> have no effect. Third, trading volume also Granger causes home prices, but only in markets with inelastic supply. Finally, we find a statistically significant positive price–volume correlation; which, however, is mainly explained by co-movements of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume caused by exogenous shocks, instead of the Granger causality between <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume...|$|R
