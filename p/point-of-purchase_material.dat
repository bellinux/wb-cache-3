40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} marketing strategies of produce managers affect consumer expenditures for fresh apples and pears. The {{objective of this}} study is to determine how display size, <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>material,</b> product origin, product information and display placement impact consumer expenditures for fresh apples and pears. These variables were incorporated into a non-linear Almost Ideal Demand System with share equations for Gala, Fuji, Red Delicious, Other Sweet Apples, Tart Apples, and Pears. Forty-four weeks of data on weekly store sales were collected from two grocery stores in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. Share influences and elasticities are provided for price inputs and for other variables where appropriate. Product origin, e. g. state and national, influenced consumers' expenditures for Red Delicious apples and pears; it was insignificant in other share equations. Product information, e. g. tart or sweet, only influenced expenditures on apple varieties that are less familiar to the consumer. The size of <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>material</b> had a significant effect on expenditures as did display sizes to a lesser extent. This research provided valuable information to produce managers and apple and pear producers on factors that influence consumers' expenditures at the retail level...|$|E

40|$|The retail sector, more {{specifically}} non-specialized food predominating retail outlets, {{is defined as}} the area of interest in this study. The main aim is to describe the relationship between the marketing activities in the retail outlets of two subjects (1) beer manufacturer and (2) his competitors. This aim is deducted from the presumption that more than two thirds of shopping decisions are made directly in the store. The manufacturer therefore has to be visible in the retail outlet and perform better than his competitors. Data were observed in the multinational retail chains once a month during one year. The observation was focused on one specific product category – beer. The competitors were observed as one group for the purpose of comparison. Three criteria were included in this study (1) a presence of products’ secondary position, (2) a presence of <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>materials</b> in the main product category area and (3) a presence of <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>materials</b> outside the main product category area. Data were analysed especially by using a logistic regression, but also other methods of statistical analysis were used. The dependence was identified in all three analyzed criteria. It varies from moderate to strong...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop and validate new methodologies to improve the collection of data {{and the effectiveness of}} promotion customization. This thesis contains two essays. In these essays, we search for optimal combinations of components of questionnaires to design split questionnaires and product categories to offer promotions. The first essay deals with how to improve collection of data. We focus on split questionnaires to collect data instead of using the more typical long questionnaires (i. e. more than 20 minutes) in marketing. In split questionnaires, different respondents respond different parts of the questionnaire. After generating different split questionnaires and administrating them to respondents, we impute data for the missing parts using the other people’s responses to those missing parts. In the end, we obtain almost the same information with split questionnaires as with complete questionnaires, but in a shorter time with less cost and obtaining better quality responses (less item nonresponse, higher response and more accurate responses). The second essay is a cross-category promotion customization problem. Currently, many multicategory models are restricted to a smaller number of categories, and the main purpose in these studies is to understand any type of demand relationship across product categories. Retailers can use cross-category relatedness for delivery of <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>materials,</b> cross-category coupons, creative store layout, and online feature ad design. Based on previous purchases of customers, we model customers’ decision of which categories to purchase and how much to spend and later search for the optimal categories to promote. ...|$|R

[...] However, originally the company was a spin-off of Atsushi Sakurada's previous company, Merchandising Organizing System.

[...] Earlier rumors in Japan speculated that the name came from the initials of three founders, two of which were bought out and written out of the company's history (Messrs.

40|$|The Jersey Fresh Program is {{a leading}} example of state {{sponsored}} agricultural promotion. The program attempts to create consumer awareness through billboards, radio and television advertising, special promotions, and distribution of attractive <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>materials.</b> This study empirically evaluates {{the effectiveness of the}} Jersey Fresh Program in terms of the impact the promotional logos have on consumers. This report includes a descriptive and logit analysis performed to predict the likelihood of consumers patronizing Jersey Fresh produce given certain behavioral and demographic characteristics. Participants exhibited a clear preference for Jersey Fresh produce and indicated that they believed it to be better than other produce in terms of quality and freshness. The study indicates that the Jersey Fresh Logo is perceived with a positive attitude among consumers. Awareness of Jersey Fresh was also found to be high among consumers and participants indicated that {{they would be willing to}} purchase Jersey Fresh produce if available. Produce displays in stores and television advertisements were most often cited to be the places in which the logos were seen. Consumers who frequently shop at direct marketing facilities such as farmers’ markets and roadside stands were more likely to be aware of Jersey Fresh, more likely to have bought Jersey Fresh labeled produce, and more willing to buy Jersey Fresh produce in the future. Consumers who read food advertisements in newspapers or brochures and who shop at more than one place in order to buy advertised specials, were more likely to be aware of Jersey Fresh than consumers who do not. Females, those who were over 35 years of age, and those had completed high school or higher levels of education were more likely to have purchased Jersey Fresh labeled produce. The results of this study may provide valuable information that can be applied not only to improve the Jersey Fresh Program but also in the promotion of other products of the state and in other states which have similar promotional programs.

40|$|How do {{consumers}} {{decide how}} many units to buy? This {{is a key}} issue for researchers, retailers, and manufacturers. While past {{research has focused on}} purchase incidence and brand choice, this research focuses on the psychological process behind the purchase quantity decision and shows how marketers can exert influence. We propose that a simple anchoring and adjustment judgment model describes how consumers make purchase quantity decisions. This process also suggests ways in which simple <b>point-of-purchase</b> (POP) <b>materials</b> can be employed to affect the quantity decision. Two field experiments and three lab studies show that external anchors have a powerful impact on quantity decisions whether presented in the form of multiple unit prices, purchase quantity limits, suggestive selling anchors, or even irrelevant anchors. A final study provides more direct evidence of the underlying judgment process and shows that people can be encouraged to retrieve alternative internal anchors that either expand or contract purchase intentions, eliminating the external anchor effect.

S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ENERGY STAR ® Change a Light, Change the World 2001 promotion. The promotion {{was the first in}} a series of planned national ENERGY STAR promotions aimed at increasing consumer familiarity with and loyalty to ENERGY STAR-qualifying products and related energy-saving best practices. Some of the evaluation findings were based on measurable indicators, such as traffic on the Internet, media impressions, ad equivalencies, products sold, number of participants, shelf space/model counts, mystery shopping, etc. In addition, much of the evaluation focused on talking to participants—including utilities, retailers, and manufacturers—to understand their experiences as promotion implementers. This included the experiences of utility partners who were participating in their first-ever ENERGY STAR lighting promotion, as well as the experiences of those with mature lighting programs. The evaluation examined how communications tools were used in the campaign—through the media, the Internet, and in-store <b>point-of-purchase</b> (POP) <b>materials.</b> The evaluation also explored how planning horizons, timing, and types of POP materials affect participatio...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. All {{consumers}} {{engage in}} some form of grocery shopping in order to satisfy their most basic needs. During grocery shopping consumers tend to make their final decision about grocery purchases within the store. This increases the importance of the availability of in-store information. Shelf-edge labels can be viewed as informative <b>point-of-purchase</b> promotional <b>material</b> providing information, such as price. Since the implementation of bar-coded shelf-edge labels, the practice of individually pricing items declined, leaving the shelf-edge label often to be the only source indicating price and similar in-store information. The provision of in-store promotional and informational material can be associated with high costs and therefore needs to be optimised to its fullest potential. However, the use of shelf-edge labels by South African consumers is a question on the minds of retailers as well as consumer scientists, since an empirical research regarding this topic has been neglected in the past. Therefore, neither retailers, nor scientists know the extent to which consumers use shelf-edge labels during grocery shopping. Consumers' reasons for certain responses to or expectations of shelf-edge labels have not yet been properly investigated. This research aimed to answer these questions. The results of the study answered the study's objectives in a descriptive and exploratory manner, which {{led to the development of}} a conceptual frame. This conceptual frame provides a content specific decision-making model which indicates the use of shelf-edge labelling during grocery shopping. Retailers can use this model, as well as other results drawn from the study, to implement shelf-edge labels as informational material to its fullest potential. The study is furthermore beneficial to science in its ability to assist in the understanding of consumer behaviour. Master...|$|R
40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{primary prevention}} strategy for infant {{iron deficiency anemia}} (IDA) was implemented and evaluated in a community with at-risk infants in northern Quebec, Canada. Communication strategies were used to promote iron-rich complementary food rather than iron-fortified formula, which can interfere with breastfeeding practice. This food-based approach has been successfully implemented in developing countries, but has not been applied in an industrialized country setting. Mass media (i. e., radio dialogues, key messages, print <b>material,</b> <b>point-of-purchase</b> grocery store display) and interpersonal (i. e., homemade baby food cooking activity) communication strategies were developed in collaboration with community members and implemented in partnership with an existing community program. Reach and exposure of the strategies were measured using a questionnaire administered to a post-intervention sample (n = 45). Sales of promoted iron-rich infant food were examined pre- and post-intervention period. A repeat cross-sectional design {{was used for the}} impact evaluation. Two groups of mothers with infants, aged 7 - 10 months at Time 1 (n = 32) and Time 2 (n = 22) were interviewed. Outcome variables were infants' total iron and complementary food iron intakes measured by two 24 -hour recalls. Secular trends in infants' hemoglobin values and milk type consumption were examined in the study community and two comparison communities. Multiple communication channels increased awareness of IDA and influenced self-reported use of iron-rich infant food. Iron-rich infant food sales increased from pre- to post-intervention (p < 0. 05). Complementary food intake iron increased between Time 1 (3. 2 +/- 0. 8 mg) and Time 2 (4. 4 +/- 1. 1 mg) (p < 0. 05). The proportion of infants with anemia (hemoglobin < 110 g/L) significantly decreased from the period before (37. 2 %) to during (14. 3 %) the intervention (p < 0. 05). No significant difference was found for this variable within the comparison communities. The proportion of infants receiving iron-fortified formula in the study community did not differ between Time 1 and Time 2, but increased from Time 1 (55 %) to Time 2 (73 %) (p < 0. 05) in the comparison communities, indicating an erosion of breastfeeding practice. These results suggest the effectiveness of communication strategies to improve infant iron nutrition in a community with good access to iron-rich infant food. The potential for this strategy in other communities warrants further investigation...|$|R
