5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu <b>patients</b> <b>whose</b> chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Treatment in {{the first}} stage aims for an optimal trade off between symptom control and {{treatment}} side-effects. The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use. However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in <b>patients</b> <b>whose</b> quality of life is impaired by those symptoms. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not really provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.|$|E
