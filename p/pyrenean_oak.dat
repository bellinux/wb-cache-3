25|$|At {{the bottom}} of granite valleys and on the {{siliceous}} riverbanks, there are very typical formations of ash with <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak,</b> especially {{at the foot of}} thin interior mountain ranges. The sheltered gorges of the Serranía de Cuenca have mixed riparian forests of lime and hazel trees, with ashes, willows and Wych elm (Ulmus glabra).|$|E
25|$|The {{maritime}} pine (Pinus pinaster) is found at an intermediate altitude and on generally siliceous soil, which in Galicia {{goes down to}} sea level and inland alternates with <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak.</b> Over limestone, the black pine (Pinus nigra subsp salzmannii) {{plays an important role}} in many of the mountain ranges in the centre, east and south of the Peninsula; in limy soil, and at the same altitude, it usually displaces the former. Both are displaced at higher altitudes by the Scots pine.|$|E
25|$|These {{woodlands}} {{are formed}} by willows, poplars, alder, ash, elm and sometimes by <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica), lime trees, birches and hazel trees. When the humidity starts to diminish in barren {{areas of the}} Ebro valley, the Levante and the southern half of the peninsula, the dryness is often accompanied by an increase of salts in the ground; under such conditions one can find formations of tamarisk shrubs, oleanders and giant reeds (Saccharum ravenae), sometimes accompanied by heather. In soils rich in silica but not in salts, {{such as those of}} the Sierra Morena and the Montes de Toledo, spurge appears, accompanied, in the warmest places, by oleanders and tamarisks.|$|E
50|$|The municipality’s {{different}} bioclimatic floors allow a {{great variety}} of vegetation. Chestnuts, <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oaks</b> and maritime pines are abundant in the middle floor, while holm oaks and cork oaks occupy the lower floors. The flatter lands are most suitable for agricultural use.|$|R
50|$|Forests {{and smaller}} wooded areas {{within the park}} are {{comprised}} mainly by cork oaks (Quercus suber), Portuguese <b>oaks</b> (Quercus faginea), <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus pyrenaica), olive trees (Olea europaea), alders (Alnus glutinosa), holly trees (Ilex aquifolium), bay laurels (Laurus nobilis), rhododendrons (Rhododendron ponticum), ferns, mosses, and lichens.|$|R

The vegetation is predominantly high-mountain shrublands and pine plantations, with some natural forests (<b>oaks,</b> <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oaks,</b> maples, etc.) ...|$|R
25|$|Oak forests, {{above all}} of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), {{are the most}} common in the Atlantic zone. They {{represent}} the typical forest floor formation of basal trees, extending to an altitude of some 600 metres. In higher regions, as one ascends the mountains, they yield to beech forests; {{at the bottom of the}} valleys they are replaced by ash trees and hazel tree groves. There are two main types of oak: the pedunculate oak and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). The latter extends furthest into the interior and highest in altitude, but plays a secondary part; in general, when the climate begins to show its continental character, these oak forests are replaced by <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of all the oaks, the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica) is {{the most}} {{resistant}} to drought and the continental-style climate. These forests, of a sub-Atlantic character, often represent the shift from Mediterranean vegetation to Atlantic vegetation. They cover a wide area of the peninsula and are of great importance, above all on the mountain ranges in {{the centre of the}} peninsula; from the interior of Galicia and extending south of the Cordillera Cantábrica they extend throughout the Sistema Central, reaching, to the south, (though scarce by the time they reach this region) the Sierra Nevada and Cádiz. They usually extend from some 700 to 800 metres to some 1500 to 1600 m in altitude. They prefer siliceous soil and, as altitude increases, they replace the damp oak forests and cork oak; on the high ground they give way to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests or to los piornales serranos with creeping juniper. In areas where the influence of the Atlantic is more evident, they are taken over by heather and Erica australis; in the remainder, in clearings and in more degraded phases, rock rose (Cistaceae) mixed with laurel leaf and Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas) is more frequent. Their natural range is usually covered by forests of Scots pine or maritime pine.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} their Atlantic character, these forests reach Moncayo, in {{the centre of the}} peninsula. [...] The southernmost are at the Hayedo de Montejo (in the {{autonomous}} community of Madrid) and in the northernmost area of the province of Guadalajara, in the Parque Natural del Hayedo de Tejera Negra (Cantalojas), and Somosierra-Ayllón. The forests seek watercourses and shade, and so their reforestation is very difficult and they are being displaced by the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>Oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica). The Irati [...] "rainforest", of some 170 square kilometres in the Navarran Pyrenees, {{is one of the most}} important beech and fir forests in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{types of}} {{vegetation}} differ {{due to the}} municipality's fluctuation in altitude. In its lower altitudes, about 3,000 ft, there are pastures with narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia); and in the forest of La Herrería grow <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus pyrenaica), sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa) and Montpellier maples (Acer monspessulanum).|$|R
50|$|The flora of the Sierra de Guadarrama is {{characterized}} {{in the higher}} elevation Atlantic vegetation region with Juniper groves, montane grasslands, Spanish broom thickets, pine forests, and <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>Oaks</b> forests; and in the lower elevation Mediterranean vegetation region by Holm oak forests. while the pastures around the summits are fringed by juniper and Spanish broom shrubs. The mountains abound {{with a variety of}} wildlife such as Spanish ibex, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, badger, various types of weasel, European wild cat, fox and hare. The area is also rich in birdlife including birds of prey such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the Eurasian black vulture.|$|R
25|$|Towards the {{interior}} of the peninsula, these forests become progressively more scarce: as the continental characteristics of the climate become stronger, the species most sensitive to cold become steadily more scarce. The continental groves, on soils lacking lime (calcium oxide), tend to be rich in junipers (Juniperus oxycedrus) and are superseded at higher altitudes and on cooler slopes by <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>Oaks.</b> This phenomenon is apparent in the Sierra de Guadarrama: when the oak forests have been destroyed, the soil is so poor and the environmental conditions so unfavourable, that it leads to ragged thickets dominated by common rock rose, Spanish lavender and rosemary. On limy soils something similar takes place, above all at altitudes of over 900 metres, oaks are accompanied by Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) and the scarcity of shrubs is such that the same Holm oak (Q. ilex subsp. rotundifolia or ballota) dominates almost entirely on its own the first phases of deterioration of the forest. The degradation caused by burning or felling leads to thickets of Scorpion's thorn (Genista scorpius), thyme and common lavender (Lavandula angustifolia).|$|R
2500|$|The {{temperate}} climate and humidity resulting from {{proximity to the}} coast favour {{the growth of a}} rich mat of forest includong Atlantic and Mediterranean species, marking the transition in Portugal from northern to southern vegetation. The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (Quercus robur) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the Cork oak (Quercus suber) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common hazel (Corylus avellana), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), European holly (Ilex aquifolium), Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), [...] Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Laurestine (Viburnum tinus), Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera), and Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus). In the valleys, near watercourses, grow Narrow-leaf ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), Grey willow (Salix atrocinerea), European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Alder buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) and Black Elderberry (Sambucus nigra).|$|E

2500|$|The floristic {{diversity}} includes 823 vascular taxa {{that occur}} in 128 types of natural vegetation. The oak forests which are common throughout the park, are specifically concentrated in Ramiscal, Peneda, Gerês and Beredo river valleys. These forested are dominated by an alliance between the Pyrenean (Quercus pyrenaica) and English (Quercus robur) oaks, which themselves are differentiated among the lower altitudes and exposed flanks (the Rusceto-Quercetum roboris) and those oaks with Atlantic characteristics (Myretillo-Quercetum roboris). The first association are commonly found with English oak (Quercus rober), cork oak (Quercus suber), butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), [...] maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), while the second association unites the English and <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oaks</b> with bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) [...] and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). In upper altitudes there are patches of English oak that enter into their own association (Holco-Quercetum pyrenacia), which is integrated into another group (Quericon robri-patraea). These oaks have been, {{over the course of}} human settlement, the object of intense use, resulting in a general degradation of the spaces into nothing more than shrubbery.|$|R

40|$|The Middle Spotted Woodpecker (Leiopicus medius) is {{a strict}} forest bird whose habitat {{preferences}} during the breeding season are well known. However, {{a lack of}} information about its habitat selection during the non-breeding season may hamper recommendations for the management and conservation of the species. Here we study habitat selection of this woodpecker at its southwestern boundary range (Izki Natural Park, northern Spain) during the non-breeding season (October–December) {{by means of a}} use–availability approach. We also examined seasonal differences in habitat use between the breeding season (April–May) and the non-breeding season. Results of ANOVA and backward-stepwise logistic regression revealed a clear selection of high forest cover, large <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus pyrenaica), and presence of dead trees during the non-breeding season. Despite very similar habitat use in both seasons, minor but interesting differences between seasons were observed, with a potential expansion during the non-breeding season into less mature forests (lower forest cover and fewer large trees) with a greater abundance of dead trees. These differences may reflect seasonal changes in the spatial requirements of the species and a decrease in food abundance during autumn– winter. On the basis of these findings, we propose management measures to improve the conservation status of the species in the Iberian Peninsula...|$|R
50|$|Below {{the pine}} forests, the middle {{elevations}} {{are covered by}} groves of <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica), which sometimes encroach on the higher pine belt; this is problematic as <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> have a protected conservation status and cannot be felled without dispensation from national park authorities. Nevertheless, controlled logging is allowed every year with the felled trees used to supply firewood to local mountain villages.|$|E
50|$|There are {{extensive}} {{areas of}} cork oak and <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak.</b> Holm oak is found on xeric sites. Sweet chestnut grows at higher elevations.|$|E
50|$|Trees:European black pine, {{maritime}} pine, Scots {{pine and}} mountain pine; holly, alder, maple, hazel, boxwood, beech, holm oak, Portuguese oak, <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak,</b> savin junipers, rowan and yew.|$|E
50|$|Quercus pyrenaica, {{commonly}} known as <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak,</b> is a tree native to southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa. Despite its common name, it is rarely found in the Pyrenees Mountains and is more abundant in central and southern Spain.|$|E
50|$|The {{environment}} {{resulted in}} a diverse vegetation, that includes holm oaks (Quercus rotundifolia) in the dry, sunny regions; and English oak (Quercus robur) and <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica) in the humid, colder areas.

50|$|The westernmost {{area of the}} {{mountain}} range shows a change in species distribution and variety, with a predominance of stone pine (Pinus pinea) in place of scots-pine, and Portuguese oak and Holm oak in place of <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> due to the lower elevations and higher precipitation of the region.|$|E
50|$|The park's flora is {{characterized}} by a deciduous forest with <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica), birch (Betula Celtiberian) and Mediterranean elements such as the arbutus and higher altitude holly. There are several endemic plants, including Portuguese laurel, Loron (Prunus lusitanica), a species that colonizes the ravines and other areas that have high humidity.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the area}} consists of a mix of Atlantic and Mediterranean continental species including such trees as holm oak, <b>pyrenean</b> <b>oak,</b> chestnut, black poplar, ash, and pines and shrubbery such as brooms and lavender. The fauna comprises various species of snakes, lizards, perching birds, small mammals, and an occasional wild boar.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with these}} {{characteristics}} {{it would also}} be necessary to mention peculiarities of the comarca of Liébana, which has a microclimate very similar to the Mediterranean, allowing to grow cork oaks, vines and olives, and which is still very well conserved from human activity.The other remarkable comarca is Campoo, in southern Cantabria, with its <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>Oak.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He was a {{correspondent}} {{member of the}} Académie des sciences (1816-1830) and an honorary member of the Société linnéenne de Paris (1821).

In 1784 he described Quercus palensis (<b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak)</b> of the botanical family Fagaceae, (synonym Quercus pyrenaica Willd.).|$|E
50|$|These {{natural environments}} {{are shaped by}} diverse flora, and include {{widespread}} species of pine (especially the Pinus pinaster and Pinus pinea species), the English oak (Quercus robur), the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica) the chestnut (Castanea sativa), the cork-oak (Quercus suber), the holm oak (Quercus ilex) or the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea). Due to their economic value, some species of the Eucalyptus genus were introduced and are now common, despite their environmental impact.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the eastern Sierra Morena, The {{dominant}} vegetation of Despeñaperros is Mediterranean forest. Holm oak (Quercus ilex) and cork oak (Quercus suber) predominate, along with Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pyrenaica) and various pines: stone pine (Pinus pinea), Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), and European black pine (Pinus nigra. The predominant shrubs are strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo), heather (genus Erica), rockroses of the genus Cistus, myrtle (genus Myrtus) and kermes oak (Quercus coccifera).|$|E
50|$|In the {{lowlands}} further inland, above {{all in the}} marls and clay soils, field elms (Ulmus minor) and poplar groves are more common, with occasional ashes and willows. At the bottom of granite valleys and on the siliceous riverbanks, there are very typical formations of ash with <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak,</b> especially {{at the foot of}} thin interior mountain ranges. The sheltered gorges of the Serranía de Cuenca have mixed riparian forests of lime and hazel trees, with ashes, willows and Wych elm (Ulmus glabra).|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} plant {{life in the}} Sierra de Gredos {{is closely related to}} the {{altitude}} at which it is found. In ascending order, the following species of trees can be found: holm oak (or holly oak), chestnut, alder, rowan (or mountain ash), birch, aspen, willow, <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak,</b> replaced in some areas by pine. At higher altitudes there are mostly bushes of the genus Cytisus (brooms), juniper and several species of camomile. Four different layers of vegetation have been identified:.|$|E
50|$|The {{maritime}} pine (Pinus pinaster) is found at an intermediate altitude and on generally siliceous soil, which in Galicia {{goes down to}} sea level and inland alternates with <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak.</b> Over limestone, the black pine (Pinus nigra subsp salzmannii) {{plays an important role}} in many of the mountain ranges in the centre, east and south of the Peninsula; in limy soil, and at the same altitude, it usually displaces the former.

50|$|The {{climate of}} the range is between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean climate. Shrubland and trees such as cork oak and <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> are {{prevalent}} in the areas covered with natural vegetation. Some of the higher altitudes have rocky outcrops where shrub grows between the crags. Holm oak is found on xeric sites and Sweet chestnut grows at higher elevations.On the lower slopes there are large areas of olive and Maritime pine. There are also scattered patches planted with non-native species such as eucalyptus.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that humans have {{occupied}} the territory of Portugal for thousands of years, something still remains of the original vegetation. In Gerês both mature deciduous and coniferous forests can be found, an extremely rare worldwide mature Mediterranean forest remain {{in some parts of}} the Arrábida mountain and a subtropical laurissilva forest, dating back to the Tertiary period, covers its largest continuous area in the world in the Madeira main island. Due to the human population decrease and rural exodus, <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>oak</b> and other local native trees are colonizing many abandoned areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distribution}} of S. granarius is lateral through the Central System mountain {{range of the}} Iberian Peninsula and reaches Galacia, Spain {{in the north and}} the Tajo River in the south.
