As players go through the game, they will gain Logos symbols to add to their Logos tablet, a blank slate, and begin to learn the language found throughout the game and gain special powers. Logos can be considered the equivalent of magic for Tabula Rasa, inasmuch as magic allows for incredible, otherwise unexplained acts; however, the logos are shown to be an extension of a scientific process developed by the Eloh.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that many ingenol compounds derived from Euphoria kansui exhibit topoisomerase inhibitory activity. 20 -O-ingenolEZ in these compounds exerted inhibitory effects on both topoisomerase II (topo II) activity and cell proliferative activity. Topoisomerase II inhibitors {{can be divided}} into the poison and catalytic inhibitor types and 20 -O-ingenolEZ is a catalytic inhibitor and inhibits topo IIα through inhibition of ATPase activity, but induces topo II-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis in BLM-/- DT 40 cells through the induction of the DNA damage checkpoint, similar to the <b>poison</b> <b>type</b> inhibitor adriamycin. The ATPase inhibitor of topo II ICRF- 193 also showed poison-like characteristics in the same cell line. However, the inhibitory effects of ICRF- 193 on the proliferation of BLM-/- DT 40 cells differed from those of 20 -O-ingenolEZ, as did the specificity of its inhibition of the proliferation of other cell lines. 20 -O-ingenolEZ showed hypersensitive inhibition of the proliferation of MCF- 7 cells and BLM-/- DT 40 cells with mutated DNA repair-related genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{collapse}} of the Sarotherodon galillaeus fishery in Lake Kinneret, from a mean annual catch of ~ 300 tons, to less than 10 tons in 2008 may indicate an imbalance between reproduction and mortality of the species. One possible reason is shortage of suitable reproduction grounds at low water levels. This study was aimed at understanding the reproduction site preferences of the Cichlids in Lake Kinneret. Sites around the entire lake, representing both open shores and protected lagoons were surveyed in {{spring and summer of}} 2012, 2013 and 2014. The number of cichlid nests and environmental factors (water depth, water temperature, presence/absence of inundated vegetation and its density) were recorded along transects running perpendicular to the water line. Peak reproduction activity for S. galillaeus and Oreochromis aureus were recorded from April to June in all sites. Nest distribution varied between stations and between transects, with densities ranging from zero to over a hundred nests in 100 m 2. reproduction took place in shallow water-mostly from 0. 25 m to 1. 5 m; no nests were observed in water deeper than 2 m. Lagoon sites had much higher reproduction activity than did the open shore sites. In the open shore sites, areas with moderate or light density of inundated vegetation were preferred over areas with no vegetation. Regression or <b>poison</b> <b>type</b> generalized linear models were employed to demonstrate that the different habitat types (lagoon vs. open shores, with/without vegetation) supported significantly different levels of reproduction activity. Management recommendations arising from this work are: (1) Expand the fishing ban during the reproduction season from the existing limited area (Beteha lagoons) to the entire littoral zone of the lake. (2) Maintain water levels higher than they currently are in order to allow greater availability of lagoon-type habitats. (3) Inundated vegetation should not be removed in an indiscriminant manner but selectively so as to create corridors and lagoon-like areas which are more favorable for reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Background: Research on {{poisoning}} epidemiology {{in different}} regions is highly important for evidence-informed health planning. The {{present study was}} conducted with the aim of evaluating the two-year epidemiologic pattern of acute poisoning cases treated at Adama Hospital Medical College (AHMC) in Adama, Ethiopia. Methods: In this retrospective descriptive study, medical records of emergency department patients with diagnosis of acute poisoning from the beginning of April 2013 to the beginning of April 2015 were reviewed. Result: Data of 292 patients with acute poisoning were retrieved, of which 50. 3 % were women. The majority of the patients (83. 6 %) were below 30 years of age. There most common affected patients were in the 21 - 30 year age-group (39. 5 %). The highest number of patients were farmers (18. 8 %) followed closely by unemployed individuals (18. 2 %). Considering the location of residence, the majority of the patients lived in rural areas (68. 8 %). Organophosphates were the most commonly used toxic agents (52. 1 %), followed by household cleaning products (12. 7 %) and alcohols (10. 3 %). Four patients died (case fatality rate = 1. 37 %) and all of them were due to complications of OP poisoning. Data analyses showed significant correlations between age-groups and intention of poisoning (P < 0. 001), <b>poison</b> <b>types</b> and patients’ gender (P = 0. 011), and <b>poison</b> <b>types</b> and place of residence (P = 0. 010). Conclusion: In Adama, poisonings are more common in rural residents and young adults, and organophosphates are the leading cause of poisoning. These findings warrant social empowerment actions as well as educational programs on poisonings and their outcomes, which should be especially targeted on this stratum of the society (young adult rural residents) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Poisoning {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and mostly treatable {{problems}} in emergency departments. In this study we aimed to analyze demographic properties of poisoning cases who applied to our hospital. Materials and Methods: Poisoning cases who applied to the Emergency Department from 1 April 2010 to 1 December 2011 were included. Parameters like sex, marital status, age, route of poisoning, duration of hospital stay, and final status of the patient have been recorded descriptively. Data is summarized with frequency, percentage and graphics. In addition, categorical data are analyzed by cross tables and chi-square test. Results: In this study period, 0. 38 % of the emergency department applications were poisoning cases. In the present study, 58. 9 % (n= 106) of the patients were women and 41. 1 % (n= 74) were men. The most common <b>poisoning</b> <b>type</b> was drug <b>poisoning</b> with 47 % (n= 85) and carbon monoxide poisoning with 22. 2 % (n= 40). Suicidal poisoning was the first cause of the exposures. There were significant differences between the ages of suicidal poisoning causes (p< 0. 01). Additionally, when data was examined according to sex, it was seen that among these poisoning cases, poisoning caused by suicidal attempts was 64. 2 % (n= 68) in women and 43. 2 % (n= 32) in men.

Pesticides, mainly the organophosphorus compounds are the most frequently used substances in agriculture and thus are easily accessible.

Aims: This includes, knowing the pattern of poisoning in India along with various parameters, such as mode of <b>poisoning,</b> <b>type</b> of <b>poison,</b> outcome of the poisoning, the most vulnerable age group involved in poisoning, so that the study will help in rapid clinical diagnosis and immediate treatment of the cases leading to decreased mortality and morbidity.

Poisoning cases reported to casualty and post-mortem cases of poisoning brought to the hospital from 01 / 06 / 2003 to 30 / 05 / 2004 were included in the study. Result: Total 1003 patients studied; acute poisoning in the age group of 21 - 30 years was the most common with higher frequency in males. Most common mode was suicidal. Most common agent responsible for poisoning was organophosphorus compounds followed by snake bite. Overall mortality due to poisoning was 12 %. It was highest in insecticidal poisoning. Conclusion: It was seen that adults between 21 and 30 years of age were more prone to suicidal poisoning with organophosphorous compounds followed by accidental poisoning due to snake bite.
