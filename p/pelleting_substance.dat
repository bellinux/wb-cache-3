25|$|Meconium, or {{the first}} feces {{produced}} by the foal, is a hard <b>pelleted</b> <b>substance.</b> It is normally passed within the first 24 hours of the foal's life, but may become impacted in the distal colon or rectum. Meconium impaction is most commonly is seen in foals 1–5 days of age, and {{is more common in}} miniature foals and in colts more than fillies (possibly because fillies have a wider pelvis). Foals will stop suckling, strain to defecate (presents as an arched back and lifted tail), and may start showing overt signs of colic such as rolling and getting up and down. In later stages, the abdomen will distend as it continues to fill with gas and feces. Meconium impactions are often diagnosed by clinical signs, but digital examination to feel for impacted meconium, radiographs, and ultrasound may also be used.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{observation of}} the solid hydrogen pellet ablation has been performed by using a fast stereo imaging camera to investigate the pellet ablation dynamics. The initial velocity component of the injected pellet is maintained during ablation in a hot plasma, and the pellet penetrates to the core plasma. On the other hand, {{it has been observed}} that part of high density pellet plasmoid, which is formed around the <b>pellet</b> <b>substance</b> by ablating hydrogen pellet, intermittently breaks away from the pellet ablating position and the breakaway plasmoid is transported across a confinement field. The breakaway plasmoid recurrently develops at the rate of about 100 times per millisecond and it is non-diffusively transported approximately 0. 1 m during its several 10 ?s lifetime in the opposite direction to the pellet motion, namely, toward the low magnetic field side. This observation gives a reasonable explanation for the difference between the pellet ablation position and the effective particle deposition profile...|$|R
50|$|In 2017 {{researchers}} used carbon nanotubes {{to reinforce}} a foam. The latter material supports 3,000 times {{its own weight}} and can return to its original shape when unweighted. Nanotubes, a powdered nickel catalyst and sugar were mixed. Dried <b>pellets</b> of the <b>substance</b> were then compressed in a steel die {{in the shape of}} a screw. The nickel was removed, leaving a screw-shaped piece of foam. The nanotubes' outer layers split and bonded with the graphene.|$|R
50|$|The light-water reactor {{produces}} heat by controlled nuclear fission. The {{nuclear reactor}} core is {{the portion of}} a nuclear reactor where the nuclear reactions take place. It mainly consists of nuclear fuel and control elements. The pencil-thin nuclear fuel rods, each about 12 feet (3.7 m) long, are grouped by the hundreds in bundles called fuel assemblies. Inside each fuel rod, pellets of uranium, or more commonly uranium oxide, are stacked end to end. The control elements, called control rods, are filled with <b>pellets</b> of <b>substances</b> like hafnium or cadmium that readily capture neutrons. When the control rods are lowered into the core, they absorb neutrons, which thus cannot {{take part in the}} chain reaction. On the converse, when the control rods are lifted out of the way, more neutrons strike the fissile uranium-235 or plutonium-239 nuclei in nearby fuel rods, and the chain reaction intensifies. All of this is enclosed in a water-filled steel pressure vessel, called the reactor vessel.|$|R
5000|$|... == Water-moderated {{reactors}} == Inside {{the core}} of a typical pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor are nuclear fuel rods equivalent to the diameter of a large gel type ink-pen, each about 4 m long, which are grouped by the hundreds in bundles called [...] "fuel assemblies". Inside each fuel rod, pellets of uranium, or more commonly uranium oxide, are stacked end to end. Also inside the core are control rods, filled with <b>pellets</b> of <b>substances</b> like boron or hafnium or cadmium that readily capture neutrons. When the control rods are lowered into the core, they absorb neutrons, which thus cannot take part in the chain reaction. Conversely, when the control rods are lifted out of the way, more neutrons strike the fissile uranium-235 (U-235) or plutonium-239 (Pu-239) nuclei in nearby fuel rods, and the chain reaction intensifies. The core shroud, also located inside of the reactor, directs the water flow to cool the nuclear reactions inside of the core.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work porous clay ceramic pellets (porosity ≤ 30 %) are {{investigated}} for the wastewater purification technologies. Calcareous and non-calcareous illite containing clays with different content of fine clay fraction (particle size ≤ 0. 005 mm) are used. Sawdust in amount of 3 wt % for the increasing of porosity and surface area is used. Non-calcareous clays {{are also used}} {{for the production of}} ceramic materials with porosity ≥ 50 %. Pores are formed in result of chemical reaction in clay suspension of aluminium paste with water. After sintering of dry samples the sorption ability of covalent (iodine) and ionic (ammonia) compounds are determined. Sorption ability depends on many factors such as chemical composition of clay, sintering temperature, pore size distribution in the ceramic materials, surface area, pH of water after immersion of <b>pellets</b> and adsorbable <b>substances...</b>|$|R

Analyze the release of organic matter at {{different}} dissolved oxygen conditions {{and the content of}} TOC changes after being used for different duration. Systematically studied on the physical and chemical properties of the filler and it’s released highly active organic nutrient composition. Further reveals the principle of humus activated sludge process {{how to deal with the}} high concentration organic wastewater. The results show that the humus soil pellets has a complex structure and irregular, containing large quantities of animal bone debris and plant fragments, and its main elements are C, Si, O. Three elements of the weight percentage reached 88. 69 %, atomic hundreds of content reached 93. 52 %. The humus soil <b>pellets</b> released organic <b>substances</b> at different dissolved oxygen conditions are different.

40|$|Chronic {{treatment}} with estrogens enhances some endothelium-dependent relaxations. Whether or not progesterone would exert {{a similar effect}} is unknown. Experiments were designed {{to determine the effect}} of chronic {{treatment with}} progesterone on endothelium-dependent responses. Adult female dogs were ovariectomized and <b>pellets</b> containing carrier <b>substance,</b> estrogen, progesterone, or estrogen plus progesterone were implanted subcutaneously. After 14 - 21 days coronary arteries were removed, cut into rings, and suspended for the measurement of isometric force in organ chambers in the presence of indomethacin. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to ADP, bradykinin, or the calcium ionophore did not differ among groups. However, relaxations to acetylcholine and to the α 2 -adrenergic agonist BHT- 920 were greater in the estrogen-treated group than in the estrogen plus progesterone-treated group. In rings without endothelium, relaxations to nitric oxide and isoproterenol did not differ among groups. However, relaxations of the smooth muscle to ADP were greater in the progesterone-treated group than in the progesterone plus estrogen group. These results suggest that progesterone alone minimally affects endothelium-dependent responses. However, progesterone seems to antagonize the stimulatory effects of estrogen on two endothelium-dependent responses that are associated with pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and the production of nitric oxide. These studies suggest that a specific receptor/second messenger system can be modulated by female reproductive steroid hormones. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A common way to {{formulate}} controlled-release (CR) pharmaceuticals is to coat <b>pellets</b> of active <b>substance</b> with a polymer film, decrease {{the size of}} the pellets and distribute them as multiple-unit dosages in capsules. To increase the understanding of the release mechanism, the pellet shape and surface structure of pellets, before and after release in microtitre plates, have been studied by scanning electron microscope and X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry. By performing these studies we associate release profiles during the first few hours to the microscopic structure. Pellets were divided into three classes (spherical pellets, dumbbell shaped pellets and twin-pellets) according to pellet form. Cases of burst release occurred for all three shape classes due to "open-window-defects" at the surface. Areas of thinner polymer film in the neck-region of dumbbell shaped pellets broaden the range of intermediate release rates for this pellet shape. The surface of twin pellets and dumbbell shaped pellets showed more defects, which increases the release rates in comparison to spherical pellets. All pellets with high release rates revealed ruptures in the polymer film, whereas only small cracks could be traced for pellets with slow release rates. The information gained is necessary for the development of future formulations and mathematical modelling of release patterns. The pharmaceutical used as model was remoxipride coated with a polymer film of ethyl cellulose and 10 wt. % triethyl citrate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop extended release pellet formulations with pH-independent drug release for the weakly basic drug SAG / ZK. A strong pH-dependent solubility was observed because of the weakly basic nature of the drug <b>substance.</b> <b>Pellets</b> were prepared by extrusion / spheronization followed by film coating. Two methods were used to overcome the problem of pH-dependent drug release. Firstly, organic acids were added to the core formulation in order to lower the micro-environmental pH inside the pellet core and therefore to increase the solubility of the drug substance in media with higher pH-values. Secondly, layers of an insoluble extended release polymer and an enteric polymer were applied onto pellet cores in order to reach a pH-independent drug release by adjusting the polymer permeability contrary to the drug solubility. Coated pellet formulations with a 15 % (% w/w based on the core weight) fumaric acid content as pH-modifier showed pH-independent drug release. However, the drug release from coated pellets with a 15 % tartaric acid content stayed dependent on the pH of the medium. The drug release patterns of fumaric acid formulations were found to be mainly influenced by the pH-adjusting properties of the organic acid. In contrast, the increasing porosity of the core pellets mainly influenced the dissolution behavior of tartaric acid containing formulations. X-ray diffraction studies showed no recrystallisation or the formation of new salts of the active ingredient and the organic acid during the preparation of the core beads. Pellets coated with a first layer of an insoluble polymer (Kollicoat® SR 30 D) and a second layer of an enteric polymer (Kollicoat® MAE 30 DP) showed a pH-independent drug release. The resulting dissolution level was to low for an oral extended release application. An increase in drug release was reached by the addition of different osmotically active excipients to the core formulation. Pellet formulations with a 15 % (% w/w based on the core weight) content of ionic excipients as sodium chloride and potassium chloride and the nonionic excipient sucrose showed pH-independent drug release. The drug release from double-layered pellet formulations with an addition of osmotically active ingredients was shown to be osmotically driven...|$|R
