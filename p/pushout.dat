40|$|A {{category}} is adhesive {{if it has}} all pullbacks, all <b>pushouts</b> along monomorphisms, and all exactness conditions between pullbacks and <b>pushouts</b> along monomorphisms which hold in a topos. This condition can be modified by considering only <b>pushouts</b> along regular monomorphisms, or by asking only for the exactness conditions which hold in a quasitopos. We prove four characterization theorems dealing with adhesive categories and their variants. 20 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Therefore, the <b>pushout</b> is not well-aligned with a {{principle}} of homotopy theory, which considers weakly equivalent spaces as carrying the same information: if one (or more) of the spaces used to form the <b>pushout</b> {{is replaced by a}} weakly equivalent space, the <b>pushout</b> is not guaranteed to stay weakly equivalent. The homotopy <b>pushout</b> does not share this defect.|$|E
50|$|There {{is always}} a map Typically, this map is not a weak equivalence. For example, the {{homotopy}} <b>pushout</b> encountered above always maps to the ordinary <b>pushout.</b> This map is not typically a weak equivalence, for example the join is not weakly equivalent to the <b>pushout</b> of , which is a point.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{characterisation}} of Goursat categories {{in terms of}} special kind of <b>pushouts,</b> that we call Goursat <b>pushouts.</b> This allows one to prove that, for a regular category, the Goursat property is actually equivalent to {{the validity of the}} denormalised 3 -by- 3 Lemma.

50|$|If C is small, we may {{equivalently}} {{say that}} C has all pullbacks, has <b>pushouts</b> along monomorphisms, and admits a full embedding into a Grothendieck topos preserving pullbacks and preserving <b>pushouts</b> of monomorphisms.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Adhesive {{categories}} are categories which have <b>pushouts</b> {{with one leg}} a monomorphism, all pullbacks, and certain exactness conditions relating these <b>pushouts</b> and pullbacks. We give a new proof {{of the fact that}} every topos is adhesive. We also prove a converse: every small adhesive category has a fully faithful functor in a topos, with the functor preserving the all the structure. Combining these two results, we see that the exactness conditions in the definition of adhesive category are exactly the relationship between <b>pushouts</b> along monomorphisms and pullbacks which hold in any topos. 1...|$|R
50|$|It can {{be shown}} that the {{homotopy}} <b>pushout</b> does not share the defect of the ordinary pushout: replacing A, B and / or C by a homotopic space, the homotopy <b>pushout</b> will also be homotopic. In this sense, the homotopy pushouts treats homotopic spaces {{as well as the}} (ordinary) <b>pushout</b> does with homeomorphic spaces.|$|E
5000|$|In {{category}} theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a <b>pushout</b> (also called a fibered coproduct or fibered sum or cocartesian square or amalgamated sum) is the colimit of a diagram consisting of two morphisms f : Z &rarr; X and g : Z &rarr; Y with a common domain. The <b>pushout</b> consists of an object P along with two morphisms X &rarr; P and Y &rarr; P that complete a commutative square with the two given morphisms f and g. In fact, the defining universal property of the <b>pushout</b> (given below) essentially says that the <b>pushout</b> is the [...] "most general" [...] way to complete this commutative square. Common notations for the <b>pushout</b> are [...] and [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between a metalogical property of entailment (interpolation) and a structural property of categories of theory presentations (stability of faithful morphisms under <b>pushouts)</b> is studied in an abstract "general logic" framework. In particular, a known result for {{first order logic}} (the "modularisation theorem"), stating that the stability of faithful morphisms under <b>pushouts</b> is equivalent to a specific form of interpolation, is generalised and re-established. Furthermore, the stability under <b>pushouts</b> of the faithfulness of a given theory interpretation is shown to be equivalent {{to the existence of}} interpolants on specific loci of the underlying formalism. The latter neither assumes nor requires that the underlying logic possesses interpolation globally. 1 Introduction In this paper we revise, generalise and re-establish, in a notation independent framework, a strong {{relation between}} (a form of) interpolation [5, 20, 29, 1] and the stability of conservative extensio [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Normal monomorphisms in {{the sense}} of Bourn {{describe}} the equivalence classes of an internal equivalence relation. Although the definition is given in the fairly general setting of a category with finite limits, later investigations on this subject often focus on protomodular settings, where normality becomes a property. This paper clarifies the connections between internal equivalence relations and Bourn-normal monomorphisms in regular Mal’tesv categories with <b>pushouts</b> of split monomorphisms along arbitrary morphisms, whereas a full description is achieved for quasi-pointed regular Mal’tsev categories with <b>pushouts</b> of split monomorphisms along arbitrary morphisms...|$|R
