5|$|Unsure {{of how the}} 1987 {{game would}} be received, Sierra's {{management}} chose to release it with no publicity or advertising budget. Many stores also refused to stock the game because of its adult content, which was subject to controversy. In effect, its first-month sales were lower than any new Sierra <b>product</b> <b>launch</b> in years.|$|E

25|$|Determining {{that its}} Evo {{platform}} lacked the horsepower to produce satisfying video games, Bally re-engineered its entire line of video and reel-spinning slot machines. Alpha, its new platform based on Sierra's operating system, dramatically improved Bally's entire portfolio of games, {{leading to the}} release of Hot Shot Progressives, a new series of video and reel machines. Overtaking the Blazing 7s line, Hot Shot Progressives quickly became the company's biggest seller and the most successful <b>product</b> <b>launch</b> in the company's history. Bally also introduced several new gaming platforms, including the V20 upright, the dual-screen V20/20 video slot, the S9E reel-spinner and the CineVision wide-screen video gaming device. As of July, 2009, more than 550 casinos worldwide utilize Bally systems products running on more than 400,000 slot machines.|$|E
25|$|The microSD {{removable}} miniaturized Secure Digital {{flash memory}} cards were originally named T-Flash or TF, abbreviations of TransFlash. TransFlash and microSD cards are functionally identical allowing either {{to operate in}} devices made for the other. SanDisk had conceived microSD when its chief technology officer and the chief technology officer of Motorola concluded that current memory cards were too large for mobile phones. The card was originally called T-Flash, but just before <b>product</b> <b>launch,</b> T-Mobile sent a cease-and-desist order to SanDisk claiming that T-Mobile owned the trademark on T-(anything), and the name was changed to TransFlash. At CTIA Wireless 2005, the SDA announced the small microSD form factor along with SDHC secure digital high capacity formatting in excess of 2GB with a minimum sustained read and write speed of 17.6Mbit/s. SanDisk induced the SDA to administer the microSD standard. The SDA approved the final microSD specification on July 13, 2005. Initially, microSD cards were available in capacities of 32, 64, and 128MB.|$|E

500|$|Songs of Innocence is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by Irish rock band U2. Released on 9 September 2014, it was {{produced}} by Danger Mouse, with additional production from Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The album was announced at an Apple Inc. <b>product</b> <b>launch</b> event and released the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. It was exclusive to iTunes, iTunes Radio, and Beats Music until 13 October 2014, when it received a physical release on Island and Interscope Records. The digital release made the record available to over 500million iTunes customers, for what Apple CEO Tim Cook marketed as [...] "the largest album release of all time".|$|E
500|$|Daniel Pemberton {{composed}} {{the music for}} the film. Much like the film's visual approach, the score {{is divided into three}} distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. [...] "You have the first act which is analog," [...] Pemberton explains, [...] "you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital." [...] For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 – the time the first act takes place – such as the Roland SH-1000 and Yamaha CS-80. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the San Francisco Opera House. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac <b>product</b> <b>launch,</b> and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section.|$|E
500|$|Activision called Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock its [...] "largest <b>product</b> <b>launch</b> ever", {{selling more}} than 1.4 million copies, and making over $100 {{million in its}} first week of release in North America; another 1.9 million copies were sold in the {{following}} month. Subsequently, the company was concerned that {{they were unable to}} meet the game's demand for the 2007 holiday season. As of July 15, 2008, the game has sold more than eight million copies. During the first seven months of 2008, the game sold 3.037 million units in the United States, 412,000 in the United Kingdom, and 26,000 in Japan, for a total of 3.475 million units, according to the NPD Group, GfK Chart-Track, and Enterbrain. More than two million copies of the game were sold for the Wii platform, making it the [...] best-selling third-party title for the platform. Game sales during the first 12 months after the game's release were over $750 million. At the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show, Activision CEO Mike Griffith stated that Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the first retail video game to exceed one billion dollars in sales. According to accumulated data from NPD Group in January 2010, Guitar Hero III is the second best-selling video game in the United States since 1995, following Wii Play. In March 2011, the title had become the top selling game with $830.9 million in lifetime sales.|$|E

500|$|On 9 September 2014, U2 {{announced}} their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple <b>product</b> <b>launch</b> event, and released it digitally {{the same day}} to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called [...] "the largest album release of all time." [...] Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US$100million on a promotional campaign. Produced by Danger Mouse with Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood, Songs of Innocence recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". The record received mixed reviews and drew criticism for its digital release strategy; it was automatically added to users' iTunes accounts, which for many, triggered an unprompted download to their electronic devices. Chris Richards of The Washington Post called the release [...] "rock-and-roll as dystopian junk mail". The group's press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on 16 November 2014. He suffered fractures of his shoulder blade, humerus, orbit, and pinky finger, leading to uncertainty that he would {{ever be able to}} play guitar again.|$|E
500|$|Ratings for Blue's Clues {{were high}} {{during its first}} season, and it was Nickelodeon's most popular {{preschool}} program. It {{has been described as}} the first commercial television show for preschoolers that was both educational and profitable. Its creators met regularly with businesses that developed Blue's Clues merchandise and products to ensure toys that were educational and met [...] "the same high... standards as the show." [...] Products, like the show, were heavily tested prior to marketing. Blue's Clues had sold almost 40 million units of its 45 VHS and DVD titles by 1998 and generated over $1 billion in product licensing in 2000. More than ten million Blue's Clues books were in print by 2001 and over three million copies of six CD-ROM titles based on the show had been sold. Seven Blue's Clues titles sold at least 1 million copies each. The show's first direct-to-video production was Blue's Big Musical Movie (2000), featuring Ray Charles and The Persuasions; it received mostly positive reviews and has sold over 3 million copies since 2006. The launch of Blue's Clues products at FAO Schwarz's flagship store in New York City was the most successful <b>product</b> <b>launch</b> in the store's history and was attended by over 7,000 people. By 2002, Blue's Clues had received several awards for children's programming, educational software, and licensing and been nominated for nine Emmy Awards. It also won a Peabody Award in 2001.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} leading up to an Apple <b>product</b> <b>launch</b> event on 9 September 2014 in Cupertino, California, rumours began to {{circulate}} that U2 were involved. A spokesperson for the band denied reports that they would perform at the event or that a new album would come preloaded on the anticipated new iPhone 6 smartphone. During the event, after the unveiling of the new iPhone and Apple Watch, U2 appeared on-stage to perform a new song entitled [...] "The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)". Afterwards, Apple CEO Tim Cook joined them to make a surprise announcement that the band had completed their 13th studio album, Songs of Innocence, and that it would be released digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. Bono called the album [...] "a gift ... to all their music customers", and said that the group wanted to [...] "get [...] to as many people as possible, because that's what our band is all about". The record was automatically added to the [...] "purchased" [...] section of users' iTunes music libraries. It was exclusive to iTunes and the streaming services iTunes Radio and Beats Music until 13 October 2014, when it was physically released and the no-cost promotion within the iTunes Store lapsed. The Edge called the album launch [...] "incredibly subversive. It's really punk rock, it's really disruptive." [...] Songs of Innocence was made available to over 500million iTunes customers in 119 countries, for what Cook marketed as [...] "the largest album release of all time".|$|E
