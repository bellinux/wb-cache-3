5|$|While {{preparing}} for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David {{to lead a}} Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party {{was to try to}} reach the Magnetic <b>Pole,</b> <b>and</b> was to carry out a full geological survey in the Dry Valley area. David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work. The party had orders to plant the Union Jack at the Magnetic <b>Pole</b> <b>and</b> to take possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire. After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South <b>Pole,</b> <b>and</b> Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This is composed {{of a wide variety}} of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, greywacke and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland was at this time close to the south <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> part of Laurentia. Fossils from the north-west Highlands indicate the presence of trilobites and other primitive forms of life.|$|E

5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the <b>pole,</b> <b>and</b> an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well.

Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more.

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South <b>Pole</b> <b>and</b> the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} identifying transfer functions from Bode plots is made. From this approach, a parameter estimation algorithm is developed. The major and novel contributions of this algorithm are: Using transfer function <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> zeros as parameters allowing to immediately obtain the factorized form; Automatic <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> zeros detection; <b>Poles</b> <b>and</b> zeros estimation only requiring the magnitude curve. Transport delays, if any, can be easily estimated by means of a simple least squares that uses the additional information supplied by the phase curve. The <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> zeros estimator minimizes a quadratic criterion of the amplitude diagram error. The minimization is performed by a modified Newton Raphson method that explores the hessian structure to drive the estimates through a descendant direction. The algorithm is designed to estimate transfer functions with real or complex <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> zeros. It was developed through a long process from which resulted two other parameter estimation algorithms: one to all real <b>pole</b> plants <b>and</b> the other to models with real <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> zeros. Both are described in this dissertation [...] . Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.

The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer Sir John Herschel, and was supported by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Ross had considerable past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he {{had been a member of}} a party that had reached the location of the North Magnetic <b>Pole,</b> <b>and</b> he was an obvious choice as commander.|$|E

Mercedes led rivals Ferrari by eighty-one points in the Constructors' standings at the start of the round, extending their lead to one hundred and three after Sebastian Vettel retired.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1908, Nimrod sailed for the Antarctic from Lyttelton Harbour, New Zealand. Shackleton's {{original}} plans had envisaged {{using the}} old Discovery base in McMurdo Sound to launch his attempts on the South <b>Pole</b> <b>and</b> South Magnetic Pole. Before leaving England, {{he had been}} pressured to give an undertaking to Scott {{that he would not}} base himself in the McMurdo area, which Scott was claiming as his own field of work. Shackleton reluctantly agreed to look for winter quarters at either the Barrier Inlet (which Discovery had briefly visited in 1902) or King Edward VII Land.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to base, the {{expedition}} {{learned of the}} presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales, 200miles (320km) to their east. Scott conceded that his ponies {{would not be able to}} start early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen's cold-tolerant dog teams for the <b>pole,</b> <b>and</b> also acknowledged that the Norwegian's base was closer to the pole by 60 miles.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{returned}} from the Antarctic having narrowly failed to reach the <b>Pole,</b> <b>and</b> this gave Scott the impetus to proceed with plans for his second Antarctic expedition. On 24 March 1909, {{he had taken the}} Admiralty-based appointment of naval assistant to the Second Sea Lord which placed him conveniently in London. In December he was released on half-pay, to take up the full-time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, {{to be known as the}} Terra Nova Expedition from its ship, Terra Nova.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{rational}} approximation (SRA) is {{a subset}} of interpolating methods using rational functions.
