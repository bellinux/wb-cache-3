Waiting time models can be used whenever the time to the occurrence of some event is the variable of interest. In {{the case of the}} time-to-toxicity data, the variable is the time from the beginning of an experiment until a tube is identified as pos-itive. The statistical analysis used the SAS procedure LIFEREG and included determination of the form of the response surface, identification of the error distribution, and simplification of the response surface. We found that increasing the macromolecule concentration decreased the probability of toxin formation. The probability of toxin formation also decreased at lower temperatures and at pHs further from the optimum. The waiting time modeling approach to developing models for botulinal toxin formation compared favorably with other ap-proaches but had one specific advantage. Waiting time models have the inherent advantage that safety con-cerns regarding predictions are automatically quantified in the analysis by formally identifying a distribution of times-to-toxicity.

B. stearothermophilus is a spore-forming thermophilic organism associated with flat sour spoilage of canned foods. A split-split plot design was used to measure the effects and interactions of pH (5. 5 to 7. 0), temperature (45 to 60 &C), and NaCl (0 to 1 %) on the growth kinetics of B. stearothermophilus in SCM. A total of 96 experiments were analyzed, with individual curve parameters determined by using the Gompertz equation.

40|$|Planktonic cells {{typically}} found in liquid systems, are routinely used for building predictive models or assessing {{the efficacy of}} food preserving technologies. However, freely suspended cells often show different susceptibility to environmental hurdles than colony cells in solid matrices. Limited oxygen, water and nutrient availability, metabolite accumulation and physical constraints due to cell immobilization in the matrix, are main factors affecting cell growth. Moreover, intra- and inter-colony interactions, {{as a consequence of}} the initial microbial load in solid systems, may affect microbial physiology. <b>Predictive</b> food <b>microbiology</b> approaches are moving toward a more realistic resemblance to food products, performing studies in structured solid systems instead of liquids. Since structured systems promote microbial cells to become immobilized and grow as colonies, it is essential to study the colony behavior, not only for food safety assurance systems, but also for understanding cell physiology and optimizing food production processes in solid matrices. Traditionally, microbial dynamics in solid systems have been assessed with a macroscopic approach by applying invasive analytical techniques; for instance, viable plate counting, which yield information about overall population. In the last years, this approach is being substituted by more mechanistically inspired ones at mesoscopic (colony) and microscopic (cell) levels. Therefore, non-invasive and in situ monitoring is mandatory for a deeper insight into bacterial colony dynamics. Several methodologies that enable highthroughput data collection have been developed, such as microscopy-based techniques coupled with image analysis and OD-based measurements in microplate readers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE(S) Heat {{processes}} {{applied to}} foods {{are based on}} a tradeoff between microbiological safety or stability, and quality (organoleptic characteristics, nutritional value…) of the processed food. The objective of this work was to propose an approach to optimize of the canning process of green beans in accounting for both non stability due to survival and growth of the thermophilic spore-forming bacteria Geobacillus stearothermophilus (the microbiological risk) and the vitamin C concentration (the nutritional benefit), an important nutrient in fruits and vegetables, and often used as a marker of process impact on the nutritional value of foods. METHOD(S) A model predicting simultaneously the risk of microbiological non-stability at 55 °C (a requirement in the canning industry) of canned green beans due to G. stearothermophilus, and vitamin C degradation along green bean canning process and storage was built and validated with independent sets of data, such as % of no stability observed in industry or measurement of vitamin C concentrations (Rigaux, 2013). In particular, a vitamin C degradation time at 85 °C and at 80 kJ. mol- 1 DHA activation energy named F 1 and the microbiological thermal death time at 121 °C and at reference value zT = 10 °C (F 0) were introduced in the model to allow a simultaneous prediction of vitamin C degradation and bacteria inactivation for any given time and temperature during the sterilization process. Parameters of the model were fixed, variable, uncertain, or both uncertain and variable. Uncertainty and variability on parameters were separately propagated through the model within the two-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation framework. RESULTS A mean risk of non-stability due to G. stearothermophilus of 0. 5 % of green bean cans (corresponding to usual industrial observations) was estimated with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [0. 1 %, 1. 2 %], as the % of cans containing more than 12 mg vitamin C/ 100 g (i. e. exceeding the nutrition claim limit) was estimated at 3. 2 % in mean with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [0. 1 %, 13. 2 %]. As the mean initial concentration was 17. 0 mg vitamin C/ 100 g with a 95 % variability interval of [4. 0, 30. 6], the model reports a significant degradation of vitamin C. Moreover the model predicts a relative independence between vitamin C concentration and G. stearothermophilus concentrations in canned green beans after sterilization. This offers the possibility of optimizing process parameters influencing one output without affecting the other. Then the model was used to test the consequences of some alternative process scenarios maintaining an acceptable level of microbiological non-stability, while increasing the vitamin C concentration. For instance reducing blanching time, increasing F 0, reducing waiting time before blanching and slightly acidifying the covering brine predicted simultaneously a % of non-stability decreased to 0. 1 % in mean with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [0. 0 %, 0. 7 %] and more than 30 % cans containing concentrations in vitamin C greater than 12 mg/ 100 g (33. 5 % in mean with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [7. 8 %, 52. 5 %]. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY Finding a tradeoff between risk and benefit, between food safety and quality, is a common issue in food industry. The modeling framework proposed in the present work, which considers variability and uncertainty of the modeled phenomena, is increasingly familiar to scientists developing Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment in food.

During the mathematical modeling of microbial growth and/or inactivation, great, but not always efficient, effort is spent on the determination of the model parameters from experimental data. In order to optimize experimental conditions with respect to parameter estimation, experimental design has been extensively studied since the 1980 s in the field of bioreactor engineering. The so-called methodology of optimal experimental design established in this research area enabled the reliable estimation of model parameters from data collected in well-designed fed-batch reactor experiments. In this paper, we introduce the optimal experimental design methodology for parameter estimation in the field of <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology.</b> This study points out that optimal design of dynamic input signals is necessary to maximize the information content contained within the resulting experimental data. It is shown that from few dynamic experiments, more pertinent information can be extracted than from the classical static experiments. By introducing optimal experimental design into the field of <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology,</b> a new promising frame for maximization of the information content of experimental data with respect to parameter estimation is provided. As a case study, the design of an optimal temperature profile for estimation of the parameters D-ref and z of an Arrhenius-type model for the maximum inactivation rate k(max) {{as a function of the}} temperature, T, was considered. Microbial inactivation by heating is described using the model of Geeraerd et al. (1999). The need for dynamic temperature profiles in experiments aimed at the simultaneous estimation of the model parameters from measurements of the microbial population density is clearly illustrated by analytical elaboration of the mathematical expressions involved on the one hand, and by numerical simulations on the other.

40|$|An {{important}} factor {{which has not}} been included in many models in the field of <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology</b> is the influence of a background of microflora in a food product. It is however generally known that the growth of a microorganism as a pure culture can be substantially different from its growth in a mixed culture, due to microbial interactions. Because of the importance of these interactions and the lack of suitable modeling techniques in the field of <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology</b> to describe them, the potential of models in other research fields-namely ecology-to deal with interactions is explored in previous work of the authors. However, a model structure for microbial growth in food products cannot simply be copied from those elaborated in ecology. The structure of a predictive growth model is indeed typical, primarily due to the explicit modeling of a lag phase. The current paper proposes a prototype model structure for growth of mixed microbial populations in homogeneous food products.

40|$|Nowadays, {{most of the}} {{mathematical}} models used in <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology</b> are deterministic, i. e. their model output is only one single value for the microbial load {{at a certain time}} instant. For more advanced exploitation of <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology</b> in the context of hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) and risk analysis studies, stochastic models should be developed. Such models predict a probability mass function for the microbial load at a certain time instant. An excellent method to deal with stochastic variables is Monte Carlo analysis. In this research, the sensitivity of microbial growth model parameter distributions with respect to data quality and quantity is investigated using Monte Carlo analysis. The proposed approach is illustrated with experimental growth data. There appears to be a linear relation between data quality (expressed by means of the standard deviation of the normal distribution assumed on experimental data) and model parameter uncertainty (expressed by means of the standard deviation of the model parameter distribution). The quantity of data (expressed by means of the number of experimental data points) as well as the positioning of these data in time have a substantial influence on model parameter uncertainty. This has implications for optimal experiment design. (C) 2004 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Predicting {{the growth}} and {{behaviour}} of microorganisms in food {{has long been an}} aim in food microbiology research. In recent years, microbial models have evolved to become more exact and the discipline of quantitative microbial ecology has gained increasing importance for food safety management, particularly as minimal processing techniques have become more widely used. These processing methods operate closer to microbial death, survival and growth boundaries and therefore require even more precise models. Part one discusses general issues involved in building models of microbial growth and inactivation in foods, with chapters on the historical background of the field, experimental design, data processing and model fitting, the problem of uncertainty and variability in models and modelling lag-time. Further chapters review the use of quantitative microbiology tools in <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology</b> and the use of <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology</b> in risk assessment. The second part of the book focuses on new approaches in specific areas of microbial modelling, with chapters discussing the implications of microbial variability in predictive modelling and the importance of taking into account microbial interactions in foods. Predicting microbial inactivation under high pressure and the use of mechanistic models are also covered. The final chapters outline the possibility of incorporating systems biology approaches into food microbiology...|$|E
40|$|Description of {{microbial}} cell (population) behavior as influenced by dynamically changing environmental conditions intrinsically needs dynamic mathematical models. In the past, major {{effort has been}} put into the modeling of microbial growth and inactivation within a constant environment (static models). In the early 1990 s, differential equation models (dynamic models) were introduced {{in the field of}} <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology.</b> Here, we present a general dynamic model-building concept describing microbial evolution under dynamic conditions. Starting from an elementary model building block, the model structure can be gradually complexified to incorporate increasing numbers of influencing factors. Based on two case studies, the fundamentals of both macroscopic (population) and microscopic (individual) modeling approaches are revisited. These illustrations deal with the modeling of (i) microbial lag under variable temperature conditions and (ii) interspecies microbial interactions mediated by lactic acid production (product inhibition). Current and future research trends should address the need for (i) more specific measurements at the cell and/or population level, (ii) measurements under dynamic conditions, and (iii) more comprehensive (mechanistically inspired) model structures. In the context of quantitative microbial risk assessment, complexity of the mathematical model must be kept under control. An important challenge for the future is determination of a satisfactory trade-off between predictive power and manageability of <b>predictive</b> <b>microbiology</b> models. status: publishe...|$|E
