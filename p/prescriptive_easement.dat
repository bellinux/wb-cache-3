25|$|The {{period of}} {{continuous}} {{use for a}} <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement</b> to become binding is generally between 5 and 30 years depending upon local laws (sometimes based on {{the statute of limitations}} on trespass).

25|$|Easements by prescription, {{also called}} <b>prescriptive</b> <b>{{easements}},</b> are implied easements granted after the dominant estate {{has used the}} property in a hostile, continuous and open manner for a statutorily prescribed number of years. <b>Prescriptive</b> <b>easements</b> differ from adverse possession by not requiring exclusivity.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{fee simple}} adverse possession, <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easements</b> {{typically}} {{do not require}} exclusivity. In states that do, such as Virginia, the exclusivity requirement has been interpreted to mean that the prescriptive user must use the easement {{in a way that}} is different than the general public, i.e. a use that is [...] "exclusive" [...] to that user, Callahan v. White, 238 Va. 10, 381 S.E.2d 1 (1989).|$|R
5000|$|In {{any event}} {{principles}} of misrepresentation apply in personam (against the person, {{rather than to}} bind the property) which may instead be bound by <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easements.</b> Section 8.4 of the standard seller's Law Society Property Information Form invites the seller to confirm or deny the known examples of these interests, excluding leases which are dealt with {{by way of the}} contract for sale and purchase. [...] Dealing with leases/tenancies is Standard Condition of Sale 3.3 {{on the part of the}} seller and the default special condition on its reverse that the property is sold with vacant possession.|$|R

5000|$|Previously, a Maine {{lower court}} had granted a <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement</b> to town {{residents}} to access a private road {{in order to}} gain beach access. On July 19, 2016, the Maine Law Court vacated the lower courts decision to grant a <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement</b> across Cedar Beach Road. As a result, there was no longer a <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement</b> across Cedar Beach Road to Cedar Beach and it is wholly private and its use may be determined by the owner, Gables Real Estate, LLC. Betsy Atkins, President of Gables Real Estate, LLC has agreed to allow Harpswell residents to continue to use the road to access the beach. An article by Walter Wuthmann on July 20, 2016 in the Forecaster provides background and the Town of Harpswell's response to Atkins granting permission.|$|E

5000|$|Frio River is popularly {{considered}} navigable from {{well above}} Leakey to about 5 mi downstream of Concan. From that latter place, the Frio River's water volume in summer months {{is insufficient to}} surmount the natural percolation down into limestone subsurface water courses; therefore, the river bed appears dry intermittently, and the river is no longer efficiently navigable continuously year-round from that place to its confluence with the Nueces River. Applicable laws concerning navigability include statutes written in Spanish that are still in force in Texas. The river may only be accessed from public access points, and all river banks are private property. Accessing the riverbanks is only legal {{in the event of}} portaging canoes or scouting for obstructions. As stated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which manages navigable rivers in Texas: [...] "Senate Bill (S.B.) 155 strikes a balance between the navigation right and private property interests by providing that portaging or scouting obstructions do not create a <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement</b> over any private property so used. Thus, under S.B. 155, if private riverside property is used to portage or scout obstructions, the landowner does not bear any risk of permanent loss of a property interest. Should it become unnecessary to use that particular riverside property to portage or scout obstructions (for example, because the river changes course), the public right of use disappears." ...|$|E
40|$|Human nature {{dictates}} that private ownership of land creates conflict among neighbors. In {{the realm of}} adverse possession and prescriptive easements, the law intervenes to settle these disputes. Adverse possession quiets conflict by providing the ripened possessor with title in fee simple absolute. In contrast, a <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement</b> provides the holder with only a right of use. However, there are occasions when a <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement</b> establishes a right of use so broad and encompassing that it amounts to a grant of de facto possession. Thus, such a “comprehensive prescriptive easement” enables the court to award the equivalent of possession while only requiring proof of mere prescriptive use. This Note examines the problems of comprehensive prescriptive easements, and explores possible solutions where rights of use are the equivalent of possession...|$|E

40|$|On January 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Montana {{reversed}} and remanded {{a district}} court decision that had foreclosed the public’s {{right to access}} the Ruby River. The Court held that {{the right of way}} was a public <b>prescriptive</b> <b>easement,</b> which extended beyond the road surface itself to include such area as necessary for the county to maintain the road {{in the interest of the}} public. Furthermore, the Court concluded that once a public right-of-way is established by prescriptive use, the scope of current and future use of such an easement is not limited to those historic adversarial practices which gave rise to the easement, but rather is subject to uses that are incidental to original uses or “reasonably foreseeable. ” Finally, the Court found the adjacent landowner’s takings claim to be without merit because any compensable interest had been expressly severed by his predecessor in title and the enactment of the state’s Stream Access Law, which encumbered his deed with an inalienable public servitude. This decision clarifies potential ambiguities surrounding the public’s right to use roads and bridges for recreational access to Montana’s public lands. Ultimately, the Court protected Montana’s legacy of public access to its world famous rivers, consistent with its decisions on the issue over the past several decades...|$|E
