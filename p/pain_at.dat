5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E

The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000–01 season Liverpool {{won three}} {{competitions}} {{to complete a}} unique treble of trophies. The first trophy was the League Cup, when they beat Birmingham City 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after the match had finished 1–1. They then won the FA Cup, as Owen scored two goals {{in the last ten}} minutes to overturn a one-goal deficit to win the match against Arsenal 2–1. The final trophy the club won was the UEFA Cup. An own goal in the last minute of extra time by Delfí Geli secured a 5–4 victory over Spanish team Alavés. Liverpool finished the league in third place, securing a return to the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) {{for the first time since}} the Heysel Stadium disaster. Liverpool's participation in the UEFA Champions League in the 2001–02 season saw the club reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by German team Bayer Leverkusen 4–3 on aggregate. The season was Liverpool's best in the league in recent years, as they finished second, seven points behind Arsenal. Despite their improved performance in the league, Liverpool were unable to defend the FA and League Cup, exiting in the fourth and third rounds respectively. The season was overshadowed by Houllier's heart problems. He suffered chest <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> half-time during a match with Leeds at Anfield. He had an eleven-hour operation to fix an acute dissection of the aorta and did not return until February. His assistant Phil Thompson took charge of the team in the interim.|$|E

40|$|In a Norwegian {{prospective}} population-based cohort study, {{we examined}} whether {{the number of}} chronic musculoskeletal pain sites changed over an 11 -year period, and if the number of <b>pain</b> sites <b>at</b> follow-up was associated with health-related and lifestyle factors at baseline. The study included data on 78, 973 adults participating in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) in 1995 – 1997 (HUNT 2) and 2006 – 2008 (HUNT 3). Based on three categories of baseline pain sites, associations between baseline health-related, lifestyle, and demographic factors and number of <b>pain</b> sites <b>at</b> follow-up were analysed with linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, marital status, physical activity, education, and other chronic diseases. We also estimated within-subject associations. Regardless of <b>pain</b> extent <b>at</b> baseline, anxiety and/or depression, sleeping problems, smoking, and obesity were positively associated with number of <b>pain</b> sites <b>at</b> follow-up, while education and physical activity were inversely associated with number of pain sites. The within-subject analyses showed largely similar associations for the health-related factors, whereas associations of lifestyle factors were attenuated. The mean number of pain sites remained unchanged between the two surveys. Overall, our study revealed prospective associations between several factors and pain sites 11 years later, regardless of the number of <b>pain</b> sites <b>at</b> baseline...|$|R
