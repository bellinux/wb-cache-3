40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> <b>housing,</b> as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its maximum rated continuous current for its maximum rated operating voltage. From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray tube housing into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> <b>housing.</b> As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{relationship}} of x-ray <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> temperature to duty cycle was studied for a superficial therapy x-ray installation, a dental radiographic installation, and a rotating-anode medical diagnostic installation. Thermistors {{were used to}} measure the <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> temperature at points selected to be representative of thermal conditions {{on the surface of the}} x-ray <b>tube</b> <b>housing.</b> Measurements were made for continuous operation and intermittent operation, for the beam directed horizontally, and for the beam directed vertically down. Maximum temperatures were observed on the uppermost surfaces of the tube housings and minimum temperatures were observed on the lower surfaces of the tube housings. The orientation of the <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> was found in some cases to alter the maximum <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> temperature. Theoretically, <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> temperatures for continuous and intermittent operation should be the same, but some differences were observed. These differences between <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> temperatures observed for continuous operation and those observed for intermittent operation were due to differences in the duty cycle ratings specified by the x-ray tube manufacturer for continuous and intermittent operation...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a measurement of temperature in a steelmaking furnace with an oxygen refining process, specifically in a tandem furnace. Knowledge of {{the temperature is}} important for optimizing the manufacturing process and extending {{of the life cycle}} of the inner furnace lining. Conditions in the furnace are very demanding; the temperature may temporarily exceed 2000 °C and exhibits changes of 60 °C s− 1. The atmosphere in the furnace is mainly oxidizing and its chemical composition is very variable. In the atmosphere there are also present liquid and solid compounds which act chemically and abrasively on the lining and on the sensor. These conditions make it impossible to use a suction pyrometer, contactless optical or acoustic measurement methods. It was decided to use a thermocouple in a <b>protective</b> <b>tube.</b> The sensor was inserted into the furnace through a steel bushing with water cooling. For the first measurement the type B thermocouple in Al 2 O 3 <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> inside an outer shielding tube made from SiC was used. The second sensor used the type C thermocouple in a special thick-walled <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> made from sintered SiC. The sensor does not measure the temperature of the gas itself, since it is affected by radiation of the surrounding areas. Conditions for heat transport from the furnace to the sensor are variable and difficult to determine; therefore, the accurate identification of the atmosphere temperature is not possible. Limit values of the temperature interval of the atmosphere were determined, for hypothetical cases of athermanous and ideally diathermic atmospheres. Web of Science 751039...|$|R

40|$|In Vietnam, {{the history}} of cities can easily be seen through their urban patterns, landscapes and housing typologies. Most recently, the {{economic}} reform in 1986 has resulted in huge impact on the Vietnamese society. The rapid economic growth and privatisation of the market {{has resulted in the}} appearance and significant development of the “new tube house” which soon became the most dominant housing type in Vietnam. Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, has a long history and also is very rich in architectural styles and typologies which are reflected in its urban pattern. However, there is no actual clear boundary in urban scale as the new <b>tube</b> <b>houses</b> are scattered all over the city and they are adapted differently to the contexts. This paper aims to investigate how the traditional urban <b>tube</b> <b>houses</b> in Hanoi transformed into the new <b>tube</b> <b>house</b> and, on the other hand, present the results of a survey conducted in Vietnam on how these houses respond to the Vietnam local climate and perform in terms of energy consumption.

Facing the problems of this disaster has been the start of this exploration in urban- and architectural water management. This thesis is an evolving process in finding answers to the key question “Which design solutions at a building level will help Cần Thơ adapt to the worldwide climate related flooding problems?”. The final result is identified in three separate objectives: 1) To create a toolbox with climate adaptive and particularly water robust solutions on a building level for the design process of houses in delta areas; 2) To propose a sustainable climate adaptive solution on a neighborhood level with particular attention to the existing <b>tube</b> <b>houses</b> in Ninh Kieu (District Centre of Cần Thơ, Mekong Delta, Vietnam) for the year 2100; 3) To propose a climate adaptive and water robust architectural re-design for the <b>tube</b> <b>houses</b> in Ninh Kieu for the year 2100.
