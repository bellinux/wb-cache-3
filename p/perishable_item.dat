The book’s ten chapters first cover the preliminaries of periodic review versus continuous review and look at a one-period newsvendor perishable inventory model. The author moves to the basic multiperiod dynamic model, and then considers the extensions of random lifetime, inclusion of a set-up cost, and multiproduct models of perishables. A chapter on continuous review models looks at one-for-one policies, models with zero lead time, optimal policies with positive lead time, and an alternative approach. Additional chapters present material on approximate order policies, inventory depletion management, and deterministic models, including the basic EOQ model with perishability and the dynamic deterministic model with perishability.

40|$|There is an {{essential}} need in the retail industry, of integrating inventory planning and pricing strategies. In the fast-fashion world of retail, inventory is treated as a <b>perishable</b> <b>item</b> leading to short selling periods. It is a common practice for retailers to liquidate unsold merchandise via clearance markdown policies. Joint marketing and production decisions are important and challenging in retailing. Clearance sales depend on the pricing, seasonal effects, and the assortment of goods available to the customer. Errors in inventory distribution and clearance pricing result in loss of potential revenue or excess inventory to be salvaged. In the case of Spanish-based retailer Zara, thirteen percent of annual revenues are attributed to clearance sales. To maximize these revenues a supply chain tool is designed to facilitate the inventory distribution decisions for the clearance season while considering price markdowns. A two part linear optimization model considers the demand forecast, pricing decisions, and logistic costs in determining the allocation of excess inventory. The business case {{is very similar to}} other retailers where revenues need to be maximized. However, Zara's business model and vertically integrated supply chain makes this case very unique. In a forecast error comparison test, the proposed solution improved the forecast error from 8 to 4 percent in respect to the current forecast process. by Orietta Parra Verdugo. Thesis (M. B. A.)

At the earliest, Goyal (1985) established a single-item inventory model under permissible delay in payments when selling price equals the purchase cost. Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) extended Goyal (1985) model to consider the deteriorating items. Jamal et al. (1997) further generalized the model to allow for shortages. Teng (2002) amended Goyal (1985) model by considering the difference between selling price and purchasing cost, and found that it makes economic sense for a well-established retailer to order less quantity and take the benefits of payment delay more frequently. Chang et al. (2003) developed an EOQ model for deteriorating items under supplier credits linked to ordering quantity. Huang (2003) extended Goyal (1985) model to develop an EOQ model with up-stream and down-stream trade credits in which the length of down-stream trade credit period is {{less than or equal to}} the length of the up-stream trade credit period. Teng and Goyal (2007) complemented the shortcoming of Huang (2003) model and proposed a generalized formulation. Mahata and Goswami (2007) developed an inventory model to determine an optimal ordering policy for deteriorating items under two-level trade credit policy in the fuzzy sense. Huang (2007) incorporated Huang (2003) model to investigate the two-level trade credit policy in the EPQ frame work. Recently, Mahata (2012) proposed an EPQ model for deteriorating items with up-stream full trade credit and down-stream partial trade credit with a constant demand. Annadurai and Uthayakumar (2012) analyzed partial trade credit financing in a supply chain by EOQ-based model for decaying items with shortages. Taleizadeh et al. (2013) considered an EOQ problem under partial delayed payment and partial backordering. Chen et al. (2014) discussed the EPQ model under retailer partial trade policy. Taleizadeh and Nematollahi (2014) investigated the effects of time value of money and inflation on the optimal ordering policy in an inventory control system to manage a <b>perishable</b> <b>item</b> over the finite horizon planning under backordering and delayed payment. Ouyang et al. (2015) discussed the integrated inventory model with the order-size dependent trade credit and a constant demand. Lashgari et al.

40|$|Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a {{disruptive}} technology that has penetrated almost every facade of modern civilization. RFID is an automated identification system that uses radio frequency waves to transmit data between a tag and a reader. Penetration of RFID in low cost item level tagging is hindered {{due to the}} high price of tags. The high cost of chipped tags stalled many ambitious projects such as low cost and <b>perishable</b> <b>item</b> level tagging for retails, supply chain management, logistics, pharmaceuticals and luggage handling to just name a few. The tag can be made low cost removing the microchip in the tag. The aim is to make the chipless tag that costs sub cents and is compatible with the current Electronic Product Code (EPC) Global standard. A few research groups have been working in the domain of chipless RFID tags. The big challenge of chipless RFID tag development is to incorporate 64 data bits in a half the credit card size real estate. Recently reported chipless RFID tags can meet neither the bit nor the real estate requirement. The thesis has presented numerous microwave passive designs to develop compact chipless tags with high data capacity. The goal is to develop fully printable uniplanar chipless RFID tags that offer: (i) high spectral efficiency meaning maximum number of data bits possible in the ultra-wide band (UWB) frequency range from 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz, (ii) high spatial efficiency meaning very compact design of multiple data encoding elements in prescribed surface area of the tag, and (iii) operational flexibility such as orientation insensitive tag design. To fulfil the thesis goal a set of high data capacity, spectrally efficient and compact chipless tags are designed. The designed chipless tags are: (i) polarization diversity (PD) based re-transmission type tag; (ii) dual-band modified complementary split ring resonator (MCSRR) based tag; (iii) single polarized radar cross section (RCS) based tag, (iv) dual polarized RCS based tag, (v) multi-dimensional data encoding (MDDE) based tag and (vi) polarization insensitive (PI) tag. To realize the aforementioned chipless tags, a number of compact resonant structures with different polarization attributes, such as single polarized, dual polarized and polarization insensitive, have been proposed. A chipless RFID tag reader is also developed to read the designed tags in a laboratory setting. Successful reading of the designed tags using the developed reader has been accomplished for both mono-static and bi-static tag reading arrangements. The developed chipless RFID system finds potential applications in authentications of Australian polymer banknote and secured documents, tagging of goods and consumables products, bus tickets, stamps, and pharmaceuticals...|$|E

40|$|Norway {{produced}} 1, 31 {{million tonnes}} of farmed salmon in 2015, {{and the production}} {{is expected to grow}} to 5 million tonnes in 2050. Every day, around 120 semi-trailers are on the roads, just with the mission of transporting fresh salmon from Norway to markets in Europe. The road network has an overall high load and the fish transport generates a big share. To handle future growth in the seafood industry it is therefore important to come up with new sustainable transportation solutions. This report presents seaborne transportation of fresh salmon from Norway to Europe as a solution to future growth in the seafood industry. The aim of this thesis is to look at seaborne transportation and utilize optimization to build a mathematical model that transports salmon between loading and unloading ports, and to get insight and knowledge about the problem. Transportation of seafood with semi-trailers are well utilized and the salmon gets fast to different markets. It will take a longer time to slaughter the salmon to fill up a ship, than filling up a semi-trailer. Fresh salmon is a <b>perishable</b> <b>item</b> and the durability is extremely important. The product degrades fast and it is important to track the time from the salmon first was slaughtered, to know exactly how old it is when it is delivered. The biggest slaughter facilities in Norway often slaughter the salmon in three shifts per day. The production rate of salmon, that is assumed to be transported with ships, is therefore assumed to be constant per hour. The problem presented in this thesis is modeled as an Inventory Routing Problem, which enables the planners to evaluate both the inventory levels and the routing decisions. The mathematical model developed is a mixed integer model. Perishable considerations are included in the model to track the lead time and avoid waste of the product. To the authors knowledge perishability of items has never been explicitly modeled in maritime inventory routing problems before. The mathematical model is implemented in the commercial software FICO(TM) Xpress Optimization Suit. It is tested on a case study for different combinations of loading and unloading ports. Result for one loading port and one unloading port with a production rate of 35 tonnes of salmon per hour gives a maximum lead time of 128 hours throughout the whole planning horizon. The problem is solved to optimality, and two ships are necessary in the solution. Increasing the production rate to 50 tonnes per hour, a solution with 10. 7 % optimality gap is obtained, and the model was stopped after 14 hours. The maximum lead time is decreased to 106. 5 hours, but three vessels are necessary. The computational study for two ports shows that number of vessels necessary to keep the inventories satisfied and minimizing the lead time and cost are dependent on the production rate. The model has been tested with three ports as well, but few solutions have been obtained. A lot of time has been used on building a model with perishable considerations, and due to a developed model with high complexity fewer solutions than planned for have been obtained. However, the model developed presents a new type of model that considers maritime inventory routing of a perishable asset. Tighter formulations are necessary for the model to solve the problem, but the model can be considered as a starting base for becoming a decision tool for the fish transportation in the future...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} an order up to level (T, S) policy for perishable items with random lifetime. We investigate two cases: {{the first one}} is the case where excess demand is completely lost and the second one deals with full backorders. Demands arrive according to a Poisson process. The lifetime of each item is assumed to be exponentially distributed and the procurement lead time is constant. We also assume that there is at most one outstanding order at any time. We model this inventory system as a Markov process in which stationary regime can be characterised. This model allows us to get insights on the impact of the model parameters on the overall system performance in terms of costs. Keywords: perishable items; periodic review inventory control; Markov process 1. Introduction Perishable items {{are one of the most}} important sources of revenue in grocery industry and food stuff (Deniz 2007). They are also an important source of waste due to their limited lifetime. Lystad, Ferguson, and Alexopoulos (2006) report that about $ 30 billion are lost due to perishable products in US grocery industry. Consequently, the effect of perishability cannot be disregarded. A large part of investigations analysing perishable inventory systems in the literature assume that the inventory is reviewed continuously and products have stochastic lifetime. However, periodic inventory control policies are used in many practical situations, especially in the case of multi-item, multi-echelon inventory systems, where items are often ordered within a common frequency. For instance, van Donselaar et al. (2010) report that stores that order through an automated store ordering system receive at most one shipment per day from the central warehouse which regroups all the items to be delivered that day. The literature concerning perishable inventory systems can be classified depending on whether the inventory is controlled continuously or periodically and whether products' lifetime is assumed to be constant or stochastic. In almost all models, the FIFO issuing policy is used. Other types of issuing policies exist such as the LIFO issuing policy used by Cohen and Prastacos (1978), and the disposal decision model studied by Martin (1986). Since the present paper does not consider the case of a continuous review inventory system, we refer the reader to Kouki (2010), Karaesmen, Scheller-Wolf, and Deniz (2011) and Nahmias (2011) that deal with such specific inventory policies. For periodic review perishable inventory systems with deterministic lifetime, the problem of finding optimal ordering policy is well known as the fixed-life perishability problem (FLPP) (Nandakumar and Morton 1993). If products cannot be held in stock more than one period, the FLPP is reduced to the known Newsboy problem (Khouja 1999). Van Zyl (1964) proposes a first dynamic programme approach for products having a lifetime of two periods and derives the optimal policy when shortage costs are charged to unsatisfied demand. Nahmias and Pierskalla (1973) build a model where they charge a cost associated with the outdating (perished items) and show that the order quantity for a <b>perishable</b> <b>item</b> is always smaller than the one of a non-perishable item. This work is extended by Fries (1975) and Nahmias (1975) to the case where products have three or more units of lifetime. Nahmias (1975) assumes that the cost of outdating is charged to the period in which the order arrives while Fries (1975) assumes that this cost is charged at the period where outdating occurs. These two models are shown to be identical by Nahmias (1977) when the remaining number of periods in the horizon exceeds the product lifetime. Then, Nahmias (1978) considers a fixed ordering cost and emphasises the difficulty to compute the optimal policy by a multidimensional dynamic programming approach. This arises since the dynamic programming approach needs to track the different ages' categories of items in stock. However, direct computation of an optimal policy turns out to be impractical because of the dimension of the dynamic programme generated by the different age categories. Therefore, several other researches have focused on developing heuristic approximations. Nahmias (1976) considers only two ages: the total old quantity of on-hand inventor...|$|E
