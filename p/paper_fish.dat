60|$|The first {{object to}} catch my eye, when the shoji were pushed apart, the next morning, was a string of the {{ubiquitous}} <b>paper</b> <b>fish,</b> dangling limp in the motionless May air from a pole in a neighboring yard; highly suggestive of having just been caught for breakfast. The sight would have been painfully prophetic but for the food we had brought with us; for, of all meals, a Japanese breakfast is the most cold, the most watery, and the most generally fishy in the world. As it was, breakfast consisted of pathetic copies of consecrated originals. It might have been excellent but for the canned milk.|$|E
60|$|The {{nature of}} the hills I have already explained, and this time we have had no lakes or {{ornamental}} water. These are very easily made out {{of a piece of}} glass--the glass lid of a box for example--laid upon silver paper. Such water becomes very readily populated by those celluloid seals and swans and ducks that are now so common. <b>Paper</b> <b>fish</b> appear below the surface and may be peered at by the curious. But on this occasion we have nothing of the kind, nor have we made use of a green-colored tablecloth we sometimes use to drape our hills. Of course, {{a large part of the}} fun of this game lies in the witty incorporation of all sorts of extraneous objects. But the incorporation must be witty, or you may soon convert the whole thing into an incoherent muddle of half-good ideas.|$|E
60|$|At {{a corner}} of a street, some rich men had got {{together}} and left unguarded all the gold, diamonds, and rubies of the East; but when you came near you saw that this treasure was only a gathering of goldfish in glass globes--yellow, white, and red fish, with from three to five forked tails apiece and eyes that bulged far beyond their heads. There were wooden pans full of tiny ruby fish, and little children with nets dabbled and shrieked in chase of some special beauty, and the frightened fish kicked up showers of little pearls with their tails. The children carried lanterns {{in the shape of}} small red <b>paper</b> <b>fish</b> bobbing at the end of slivers of bamboo, and these drifted through the crowd like a strayed constellation of baby stars. When the children {{stood at the edge of}} a canal and called down to unseen friends in boats the pink lights were all reflected orderly below. The light of the thousand small lights in the street went straight up into the darkness among the interlacing telegraph wires, and just at the edge of the shining haze, on a sort of pigeon-trap, forty feet above ground, sat a Japanese fireman, wrapped up in his cloak, keeping watch against fires. He looked unpleasantly like a Bulgarian atrocity or a Burmese 'deviation from the laws of humanity,' being very still and all huddled up in his roost. That was a superb picture and it arranged itself to admiration. Now, disregarding these things and others--wonders and miracles all--men are content to sit in studios and, by light that is not light, to fake subjects from pots and pans and rags and bricks that are called 'pieces of colour.' Their collection of rubbish costs in the end quite as much as a ticket, a first-class one, to new worlds where the 'props' are given away with the sunshine. To do anything because it is, or may not be, new on the market is wickedness that carries its own punishment; but surely there must be things in this world paintable other and beyond those that lie between the North Cape, say, and Algiers. For the sake of the pictures, putting aside the dear delight of the gamble, it might be worth while to venture out a little beyond the regular circle of subjects and--see what happens. If a man can draw one thing, it has been said, he can draw anything. At the most he can but fail, and there are several matters in the world worse than failure. Betting on a certainty, for instance, or playing with nicked cards is immoral, and secures expulsion from clubs. Keeping deliberately to one set line of work because you know you can do it and are certain to get money by so doing is, on the other hand, counted a virtue, and secures admission to clubs. There must be a middle way somewhere, as there must be somewhere an unmarried man with no position, reputation, or other vanity to lose, who most keenly wants to find out what his palette is set for in this life. He will pack his steamer-trunk and get into the open to wrestle with effects that he can never reproduce. All the same his will be a superb failure.|$|E

40|$|In this <b>paper</b> <b>fishing</b> trawler {{scheduling}} and production {{planning for a}} quota-based integrated commercial fishery is modelled mathematically. The catch capacity of fishing trawlers and the capacity of processing firms are two major factors which influence the scheduling of fishing trawlers. Production planning in fish processing firms depends on steady supply of fresh fish from the fishing trawlers to the processing firms. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to co-ordinate trawler scheduling, fishing, processing, and labour allocation of quota based integrated fisheries. We demonstrate the workability of our model with a numerical example and sensitivity analysis based on data obtained {{from one of the}} major fisheries in New Zealand...|$|R

The swamp fishermen carry their fishing {{not only in the}} daytime, but also engage in night fishing, by which they can get nocturnal fishes effectively. They form the production units called nsanga mainly through their affinity for fishing and selling their catch. The fishing methods selected by them differ from nsanga to nsanga in a fishing camp, accordingly, the fishing period, time and caught species also vary. Such utilization of the swamps can be regarded as a segregation among the swamp fishermen...|$|R

5000|$|Beginning {{as early}} as August, nests are built in dense foliage, usually in a {{terminal}} fork of a Pisonia branch, though several other plants may be used. The cup-shaped nest is constructed by both members of the pair from dry grasses and other vegetable material, as well as cobwebs and various kinds of anthropogenic debris such as toilet <b>paper,</b> <b>fishing</b> line and human hair. Nests may take {{up to a week}} or more to complete. [...] The usual clutch is of three pale blue eggs, with an incubation period of 12-14 days. The hatchlings are altricial and nidicolous and are fed by both parents. The chicks fledge at 12-14 days old and leave the nest shortly afterwards, still being fed by their parents for about another two weeks.

So these are the people who would give the fishes, the April fish, to celebrate the beginning of the New Year.
