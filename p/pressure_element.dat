An evenly divided altitude scale is secured by using a mechanism between the <b>pressure</b> <b>element</b> and pointer which gives the required motion of the pointer.

The proposed algorithm can be applied without the information concerning the thermal boundary condition on the component inner surfaces and it is fast enough to be applied in an online mode.

40|$|The hydrodynamics of planing {{ships are}} studied using a finite <b>pressure</b> <b>element</b> method. In this method, a {{boundary}} value problem (BVP) is formulated based on linear planing theory; the planing ship {{is represented by the}} pressure distribution acting on the wetted bottom of the ship, and the magnitude of this pressure distribution is evaluated using a boundary element method. The pressure is discretized using overlapping pressure pyramids, known as tent functions, so that the resulting distribution is piece-wise continuous in both longitudinal and transverse directions. A set of linear algebraic equations for the determination of the pressure is then established using a collocation technique. It is found that the matrix of the linear equations is ill conditioned; this leads to oscillatory behaviour of the predicted pressure distribution if the direct solution method of LU decomposition or Gaussian elimination is used to solve the system of linear equations. In the current study, this numerical instability is analysed in detail. It is found that the problem can be addressed by adopting singular value decomposition (SVD) technique for the solution of the linear equations.

40|$|High thermal {{stresses}} are created during {{the operation of}} power block devices such as boiler drums, outlet headers, steam valves, turbines and heat exchangers. Due to a cyclic character of such stresses, a phenomenon of low-cyclic fatigue occurs, which {{may lead to the}} formation of fractures. Manufacturers of power block devices frequently advice the users to keep within the prescribed limits for maximum heating and cooling rates of elements [1]. Attempts are made to develop algorithms for operating power blocks [2, 3]. Thanks to these mathematical systems, one is able to extend the life of operating devices and shorten the duration of all transient operations. It is necessary to find temperature and pressure histories during heating and cooling operations of pressure elements so the maximum equivalent stresses at stress concentration points would not exceed the allowable values based on the assumed element lifetime.

Previous work in which the stiffness terms resulting from constant pressure were derived has been extended to enable modeling of nonconstant pressure applied over nonenclosed volumes. These conditions will result in nonsymmetric terms in the global stiffness matrix which will not cancel out. Three new <b>pressure</b> stiffness <b>elements</b> incorporating these nonsymmetric terms have been implemented as dummy elements in COSMIC NASTRAN and have been tested on various simple examples as well as an existing ASRM NASTRAN finite element model. The results indicate that for all load cases of practical interest to the ASRM program, the nonsymmetric terms have very little effect on the dynamic characteristics. In addition, the <b>pressure</b> stiffness <b>elements</b> developed in the previous work which assumed constant pressure gave virtually the same results as the new elements even for problems in which the pressures are not constant. The original elements appear to work well as long as the pressure gradient across any individual element is no larger than about 0. 75 psi/inch.
