25|$|In 1931, {{to develop}} the first aerogels, Kistler used {{a process known as}} {{supercritical}} drying which avoids a direct phase change. By increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a supercritical fluid state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel, avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network. While this can be done with ethanol, the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions. A safer, lower temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>method</b> involves a solvent exchange. This is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a CO2-miscible liquid such as ethanol or acetone, then onto liquid carbon dioxide and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its critical point. A variant on this process involves the direct injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel. The end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide, without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume.|$|E

40|$|Flow {{measurement}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges in order to calculate efficiency in hydropower. Most hydropower plants in Sweden use differential <b>pressure</b> <b>methods</b> for flow measurement. These methods are dependent on constant conditions in the waterways. A change in these conditions, like turbine improvements, prevents differential <b>pressure</b> <b>methods</b> to verify efficiency improvements. Since efficiency improvements can’t be verified by one measurement system, another method, which isn’t affected by changing conditions, can be used. This other method can calibrate or support the primary flow measurement system. This study investigates the possibility of designing such a method. The potential of different flow measurement methods have been estimated through literature study. Laboratory experiments were conducted on two measurement systems, designed from two differential <b>pressure</b> <b>methods.</b> From the result from these experiments, a system for field measurement was designed from the lab prototype and tests were made in a hydropower plant. The method is unaffected by improvements in the waterways since it’s placed on the intake. The field measurements generated test data, from which a relative flow measurement model was made. The model approximated the higher flows with a relative error between 0, 5 and 5, 0 %. However, the model has weaknesses that partly depend on bad quality in measurement data. More tests are required to verify the method. The method is applicable in most hydropower plants, simple and relatively easy to install...|$|R

50|$|The {{study of}} {{physiological}} methods for deception tests measuring emotional disturbances {{began in the}} early 1900s. Benussi was the first to work on practical deception tests based on physiological changes. He detected changes in inspiration-expiration ratio—findings confirmed by N.E. Burtt. Burtt conducted studies that emphasized the changes in quantitative systolic blood-pressure. William Moulton Marston studied blood-pressure and noted increase in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or over indicated guilt through using the tycos sphygmomanometer, with which he reported 90-100% accuracy. His studies used students and actual court cases. Then in 1913 W.M. Marston determined systolic blood-pressure by oscillatory methods and his findings cite definite changes in blood pressure during the deception of criminal suspects. In 1921, John Augustus Larson criticized Marston's intermittent blood <b>pressure</b> <b>method</b> because emotional changes were so brief they could be lost. To adjust for this he modified the Erlanger sphygmograph to give a continuous blood pressure and pulse curve and used it to study 4,000 criminals.|$|E
