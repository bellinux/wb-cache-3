5000|$|<b>Popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> {{syndrome}} (PPS) is {{an inherited}} condition affecting the face, limbs, and genitalia. [...] The syndrome goes {{by a number}} of names including the popliteal web syndrome and, more inclusively, the facio-genito-popliteal syndrome. The term PPS was coined by Gorlin et al.. in 1968 {{on the basis of the}} most unusual anomaly, the <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> (a web behind the knee).|$|E
40|$|Orofacial clefts are {{the most}} common craniofacial birth defects {{occurring}} in 1 / 700 births. Affected children need caring by a multidisciplinary team from birth until adulthood. Such a team includes many disciplines (nursing, plastic surgery, speech specialist, dentist, ….). Although quality of life can be improved with good care, the disease represents a burden to the patient, the family and society with important financial consequences. Orofacial clefts can be part of a syndrome, but most commonly, they occur as an isolated defect. Non-syndromic clefts have a complex etiology with genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors contributing to the condition. Many candidate genes have been identified based on human and animal studies. They play a role in different cellular processes required {{for the development of the}} lip and the palate (migration, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and adhesion). Environmental factors suggested to increase the risk of clefts are mainly maternal smoking and alcohol use. Supplementation of folic acid and multivitamins are suggested to be protective. One of the most common cleft syndromes is the van der Woude syndrome accounting for 2 % of clefts. It is mainly characterized by the presence of lip pits (85 %), cleft lip with or without palate (50 %) and hypodontia. In 2002, the Interferon Regulatory- 6 factor (IRF 6) was identified as the major causal gene of VWS, but also of the <b>Pterygium</b> <b>Popliteal</b> syndrome (PPS). In addition to the features of VWS, PPS patients can have popliteal and/or oral webs, unusual nails, syndactyly, ankyloblepharon and/or genital anomalies. In order to assess the prevalence of IRF 6 mutations in the European population, we collected a series of 51 patients with VWS and 17 with PPS. We showed that IRF 6 is causal in 66. 7 % of the VWS patients and in 76. 5 % of the PPS patients. Moreover, the mutations are not scattered at random with the majority of VWS mutations localized in exons 3, 4, 7 and 9, and the majority of PPS mutations in exon 4, suggesting that these exons should be screened first for clinical diagnosis. Genes responsible for syndromic clefts are strong candidates for non-syndromic cleft lip and palate as sometimes, phenotypes can be indistinguishable. IRF 6 is indeed a predisposing factor for isolated clefts. Based on the assumption that non-syndromic patients may have a mutation with a mild effect or polymorphisms acting as modifier, we screened 95 multiplex non-syndromic families for IRF 6 mutations. We found three mutations that were already described in VWS patients in three different families. A posteriori careful examination of the families allowed the clinical geneticist to reject the non-syndromic phenotype and change the diagnosis to VWS showing that a genetic result can lead to a more precise diagnosis. Moreover, we could identify a new minor sign that should be looked for when considering VWS. We also suggest that a priori non-syndromic families with autosomal dominant inheritance should be screened for IRF 6 (Publication I). Cleft can occur as a result of single nucleotide substitution but also as a result of cytogenetic abnormalities, the characterization of which can lead to the identification of causal genes. To find new candidate genes, we routinely performed 400 -band karyotyping. Subsequently, we used molecular karyotyping with Affymetrix SNP arrays to delimit borders of candidate regions or to identify copy number variations with a better resolution. One of the interesting genomic imbalances that we observed was a balanced translocation occurring in a familial case from Lille. In this family, father and child had a cleft of the palate, micro/retrognathia, malar hypoplasia and dental anomalies. The karyotype of both patients was 46,XY,t(1; 2) (p 34;q 33). Characterization of the breakpoints by FISH, chromosome microdissection and reverse array hybridization permitted to localize the relevant breakpoint on chromosome 1 in the first intron of FAF 1. Association studies displayed that FAF 1 predisposes to cleft palate and Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). In a screening of 228 individuals with isolated clefts, we identified two coding substitutions that might be responsible for the cleft as they are localized in domain important for the function of the gene. These changes were also seen in unaffected individuals. However, these changes could have a mild effect on protein function which without a certain genetic background and/or environmental triggers could not result in a cleft. Therefore, functional studies are required to test the effect of these changes. Knockdown of zFaf 1 in the zebrafish allowed us to observe orofacial anomalies due to defects occurring during chondrogenesis via Sox 9 expression alteration. We concluded that FAF 1 is a key player in jaw development and that disruptions of this gene are associated with orofacial abnormalities (Publication II). We also identified a t(1; 17) (p 21;q 24) translocation in a girl with a priori CP and dislocation of the hip. We mapped the breakpoint 600 kb upstream of SOX 9, a gene haploinsufficiency of which results in skeletal defects, PRS and genital anomalies referred to as campomelic dysplasia. In the light of the literature data and cytogenetic results, we suggested additional radiographic examination which reveals classical features of acampomelic campomelic dysplasia. In paralleI, we identified a deletion that co-segregated in a PRS family. This deletion was situated 1. 2 - 1. 4 Mb upstream of SOX 9 and overlapped one previously reported craniofacial enhancer. Sequencing of this regulatory element in a cohort of 73 PRS patients showed an enrichment of one SNP in the cohort compared to internal controls. By luciferase reporter assay, we showed that the minor allele weakened the enhancer activity of the regulatory element in which it was localized. Moreover, an association study with an intragenic SNP showed that SOX 9 variations play a role in cleft palate in two populations, and in PRS in our cohort (Publication III, submitted and IV, in preparation). Finally, we identified by microarray analysis a deletion of 22 q 13. 33 and a duplication of 12 q 24. 33 in a syndromic patient with cleft palate. Based on clinical and literature data, we hypothesized that the CP arose from the duplication of one or more gene in the 12 q 24. 33 region. In order to assess the role of candidate genes in the region, we conducted an association study using five variants in a set of 189 trios affected with CP or PRS. This is the first study conducted on a PRS cohort. Our results suggest two new associated factors for CP or PRS, SFSWAP and MMP 17, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that SOX 9 and FAF 1 are implicated in CP in several populations and PRS in our cohort, giving human evidence for FAF 1 -SOX 9 pathway to play a role in palatogenesis and mandibular chondrogenesis. We also showed cleft type specificity for genetic factors such as IRF 6 and 8 q 24 locus do not associate with CP (Publication IV, in preparation). In conclusion, we show that clefts have a multigenic etiology with several genes, FAF 1, SOX 9, MMP 17 and SFSWAP associated with the condition. We show that syndromic patients and/or chromosomal alterations can lead to the identification of new candidate genes. Moreover, by two examples (IRF 6 with VWS and SOX 9 wit ACD), we demonstrated that a genetic result can help in differential diagnosis. (SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

50|$|The term PPS {{has also}} been used for two rare {{autosomal}} recessively inherited conditions: Lethal PPS and PPS with Ectodermal Dysplasia. Although both conditions feature a cleft lip/palate, syngnathia, and <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium,</b> they are clinically distinguishable from the autosomal dominant case. Lethal PPS is differentiated by microcephaly, corneal aplasia, ectropion, bony fusions, hypoplastic nose and absent thumbs, while PPS with Ectodermal Dysplasia is differentiated by woolly hair, brittle nails, ectodermal anomalies, and fissure of the sacral vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} signs seen in VWS {{are similar to}} those of <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome (PPS), which is also an autosomal dominant disease. Approximately 46% of affected individuals have lip pits; other features include genital abnormalities, abnormal skin near nails, syndactyly of fingers and toes, and webbed skin. The disease is also caused by mutations in IRF6; however, they occur in the DNA-binding domain of IRF6 and result in a dominant negative effect in which the mutated IRF6 transcription factor interferes with the ability of the wild type copy to function, in the case of a heterozygous individual.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mutation}} of the IRF6 gene {{can lead}} to the autosomal dominant van der Woude syndrome (VWS) [...] or the related <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome (PPS). [...] Van der Woude syndrome can include cleft lip and palate features along with dental anomalies and lip fistulas. In addition, common alleles in IRF6 have also been associated with non-syndromic cases of cleft lip and/or palate through genome-wide association studies and in many candidate gene studies. These disorders are caused by mutations in the IRF6 gene and some of the phenotypic heterogeneity is due to different types of IRF6 mutations.One explanation for this phenotypic variation between syndromes is based on a differential impact on the structure of the dimerized mutant proteins. VWS mutations appear to result in haploinsufficiency while PPS mutations may be dominant negative in nature. The spectrum of mutations in VWS and PPS has been recently summarized. IRF6 has been shown to {{play a critical role in}} keratinocyte development. A role for IRF6 in the common forms of cleft lip and palate has also been demonstrated and may explain ~20% of cases of cleft lip only. Variants in IRF6 have yielded consistent evidence of association with syndromic cleft and/or palate across multiple studies. A study by Birnbaum and colleagues in 2009 confirmed the impact of this gene on the etiology of cleft lip and/or palate, and the GENEVA Cleft Consortium study, which studied families from multiple populations, reconfirmed the findings that IRF6 mutations are strongly associated with cleft and/or palate. A role of IRF6 in causing cleft lip and/or palate is further supported by analysis of IRF6 mutant mice which exhibit a hyper-proliferative epidermis that fails to undergo terminal differentiation, leading to multiple epithelial adhesions that can occlude the oral cavity and result in cleft palate. Research on animal models indicate IRF6 determines keratinocyte proliferation and also has a key role in the formation of oral periderm. Recently, through utilization of mouse genetics, gene expression analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies and luciferase reporter assays, it has been shown that IRF6 is a direct target of p63, which underlies several malformation syndromes that include cleft features, and p63 activates IRF6 transcription through the IRF6 enhancer element. Variation in the enhancer element increases susceptibility to cleft lip only. Both cleft lip with or without a cleft palate and cleft palate only features have been seen in families with an IRF6 mutation. In addition, different types of clefts can segregate within the same family.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE:: Interferon {{regulatory}} factor 6 encodes {{a member}} of the IRF family of transcription factors. Mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 cause Van der Woude and <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome, two related orofacial clefting disorders. Here, we compared and contrasted the frequency and distribution of exonic mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 between two large geographically distinct collections of families with Van der Woude and between one collection of families with <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome. METHODS:: We performed direct sequence analysis of interferon regulatory factor 6 exons on samples from three collections, two with Van der Woude and one with <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome. RESULTS:: We identified mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 exons in 68 % of families in both Van der Woude collections and in 97 % of families with <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome. In sum, 106 novel disease-causing variants were found. The distribution of mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 exons in each collection was not random; exons 3, 4, 7, and 9 accounted for 80 %. In the Van der Woude collections, the mutations were evenly divided between protein truncation and missense, whereas most mutations identified in the <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome collection were missense. Further, the missense mutations associated with <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome were localized significantly to exon 4, at residues that are predicted to bind directly to DNA.

The type and distribution of mutations are consistent with the hypothesis that Van der Woude is caused by haploinsufficiency of interferon regulatory factor 6.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{examine the}} role of the IRF 6 {{mutations}} in Polish families with Van der Woude syndrome and <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome and to determine the effect of IRF 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs 7552506, rs 2013162, and rs 2235375) on cleft lip and/or palate susceptibility. DESIGN IRF 6 mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing of all coding exons of the gene and their flanking intronic regions. Cosegregation analysis was performed to establish the relation of single nucleotide polymorphisms and cleft lip and/or palate phenotypes. PATIENTS We screened the IRF 6 gene in eight families with clinical recognition of Van der Woude syndrome and <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome. RESULTS In five families we identified pathogenic mutations, all affecting the DNA-binding or the protein-binding domain of IRF 6. Two of the mutations were novel-a missense mutation Arg 31 Thr and a small deletion Trp 40 Glyfs* 23. In most cases we found also a haplotype of three single nucleotide polymorphisms-rs 7552506, rs 2013162, and rs 2235375. The association of the single nucleotide polymorphisms and cleft lip and/or palate susceptibility has been previously published. The variants did not cosegregate with phenotype in examined families nor did they cosegregate with pathogenic mutations. The single nucleotide polymorphisms were deemed not causative, due to their presence in unaffected family members. CONCLUSIONS Two novel mutations (Arg 31 Thr and Trp 40 Glyfs* 23) in the IRF 6 gene were identified to be causative for Van der Woude and <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndromes. In the present study no association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms rs 7552506, rs 2013162, and rs 2235375 and the cleft lip and/or palate phenotype was found.

Using Affymetrix 250 K SNP array genotyping and homozygosity mapping, we mapped this malformation syndrome to chromosomal region 21 q 22. 3. Direct sequencing of RIPK 4 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase protein 4) showed a homozygous transversion (c. 362 T>A) that causes substitution of a conserved isoleucine with asparagine at amino acid position 121 (p. Ile 121 Asn) in the serine/threonine kinase domain of the protein. Additional pathogenic mutations—a homozygous transition (c. 551 C>T) {{that leads to a}} missense substitution (p. Thr 184 Ile) at a conserved position and a homozygous one base-pair insertion mutation (c. 777 _ 778 insA) predicted to lead to a premature stop codon (p.

Molecular modeling of the kinase domain showed that both the Ile 121 and Thr 184 positions are critical for the protein's stability and kinase activity. Luciferase reporter assays also demonstrated that these mutations are critical for the catalytic activity of RIPK 4. RIPK 4 mediates activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and is required for keratinocyte differentiation and craniofacial and limb development. The phenotype of Ripk 4 −/− mice is consistent with the human phenotype presented herein. Additionally, the spectrum of malformations observed in the presented families is similar, but less severe than the conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK) -deficient human fetus phenotype; known as Cocoon syndrome; this similarity indicates that RIPK 4 and CHUK might function via closely related pathways to promote keratinocyte differentiation and epithelial growth...|$|E

Other disorders associated with intra-oral synechiae include congenital alveolar synechiae, van der Woude syndrome, <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome and oromandibular limb hypogenesis syndrome. The authors report a hitherto undescribed association of palatoglossal fusion with cleft palate and hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital disorder that consists of popliteal webs and craniofacial, genitourinary and extremity anomalies. Only moderate successful surgical excision of the fi brotic band within the popliteal web has been reported because the nerves and vessels in the affected site are short and displaced into the web and they are attached to adjacent tissues. We performed hamstring tenotomy on the ischial tuberosity, tenotomy of the fl exor hallucis longus and Z-lengthening of the Achilles tendon on the ankle in our patient, and {{this was followed by}} gradual correction using an Ilizarov external fi xator. Full extension of the knee joint was achieved at the ninth postoperative week. However, some recurrence of fl exion contracture was noted at two years follow-up. Gradual soft tissue lengthening with an Ilizarov external fi xator {{can be one of the}} optimal procedures when excision of a fi brous band and Z-plasty are not possible due to severe adhesion of the nerves and vessels into a fi brotic band. However, a cautious approach is recommended when considering the high risk of recurrence...|$|E
40|$|In mammals, {{adhesion}} and {{fusion of}} the palatal shelves are essential mechanisms {{during the development}} of the secondary palate; failure of these processes leads to the congenital anomaly, cleft palate. The mechanisms that prevent pathological adhesion between the oral and palatal epithelia while permitting adhesion and subsequent fusion of the palatal shelves via their medial edge epithelia remain obscure. In humans, mutations in the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF 6) underlie Van der Woude syndrome and <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome. Recently, we have demonstrated that mice homozygous for a mutation in Irf 6 exhibit abnormalities of epithelial differentiation that results in cleft palate as a consequence of adhesion between the palatal shelves and the tongue. In the current paper, we demonstrate that Irf 6 is essential for oral epithelial differentiation and that IRF 6 and the Notch ligand Jagged 2 function in convergent molecular pathways during this process. We further demonstrate that IRF 6 {{plays a key role in}} the formation and maintenance of the oral periderm, spatio-temporal regulation of which is essential for ensuring appropriate palatal adhesion...|$|E
40|$|<b>Popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> {{syndrome}} (PPS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} disorder, thought to occur with an incidence of approximately 1  in 300   000  live births. The main clinical manifestations are popliteal webbing, cleft lip, cleft palate, lower lip pits, syndactyly, and genital and nail anomalies. This report describes the clinical features in two families with PPS and one isolated case, showing the range of anomalies found both within and between the families. PPS has some features in common with Van der Woude syndrome (VWS), also inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, with cleft lip/palate and, more distinctively, lower lip pits. Although the gene for VWS {{has not yet been}} identified, it has been localised to within 1. 6  cM in the region 1 q 32 - 41. To determine whether PPS and VWS represent allelic forms of the same gene, three families were genotyped for markers flanking and within the critical region. A multipoint lod score of 2. 7  was obtained, with no evidence of recombination, supporting the hypothesis that these two disorders are allelic.    Keywords: pterygium; van der Woude syndrome; cleft lip; cleft palat...|$|E
40|$|Individuals {{from three}} {{families}} ascertained in Bogota, Colombia, showing syndromic phenotypes, including cleft lip and/or palate, were exome sequenced. In each case sequencing revealed underlying causal variation confirming or establishing diagnoses. The findings include very rare and novel variants providing insights into genotype and phenotype relationships. These include the molecular diagnosis {{of an individual}} with Nager syndrome and a family exhibiting an atypical Incontinentia Pigmenti phenotype with a missense mutation in IKBKG. IKBKG mutations are typically associated with pre-term male death but this variant is associated with survival for 8 – 15 days. The third family exhibits unusual phenotypic features and the proband received a provisional diagnosis of Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS). Affected individuals share a novel deleterious mutation in IRF 6. Mutations in IRF 6 cause Van der Woude and <b>Popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome and contribute to nonsyndromic cleft lip phenotypes but have not previously been associated with a PRS phenotype. Exome sequencing followed by in silico screening to identify candidate causal variant(s), and functional assay in some cases, offers a powerful route to establishing molecular diagnoses. This approach is invaluable for conditions showing phenotypic and/or genetic heterogeneity including cleft lip and/or palate phenotypes where many underlying causal genes have not been identified...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionVarious {{treatment}} options are in use to address severe knee flexion contractures in children. Their success depends on an adequate {{selection of the}} proper one applying to each individual anatomical situation. HypothesisApplied to limb deformity, the Ilizarov technique combines progressive correction, to joint structures flexibility restitution in case of severe knee flexion contracture. We review a continuous series of <b>popliteal</b> <b>pterygium</b> syndrome patients managed with this technique. Patients and methodsMedical records of eight children (11 knees), consecutively treated between 1986 and 2007, were reviewed. Knee flexion ranged from 40 to 120 °. Contracture (>  90 °) was extremely severe in 10 cases. Progressive correction was gained by Ilizarov external fixation. Complications during and following articular chain distraction-lengthening were noted. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 21 years. ResultsSurgical realignment was rendered particularly complex by the popliteal cutaneous band itself, partly responsible of the joint stiffness and sciatic nerve shortening. Deformities were corrected by the Ilizarov technique. Complete extension was obtained in all cases. In six cases, flexion contracture reccurrence required to repeat the correction, using the same technique, at a mean interval of 3 – 4  years. During follow-up, four evolutive partial posterior tibial dislocations and one complete dislocation were diagnosed, all associated with recurrence of the flexion contracture. Level of evidence: Level IV. Therapeutic Study...|$|E
