50|$|The {{advantage}} of the slow-drying quality of oil paint is that an artist can develop a painting gradually. Earlier media such as egg tempera dried quickly, which prevented the artist from making changes or corrections. With oil-based paints, revising was comparatively easy. The disadvantage is that a painting might take months or years to finish, which might disappoint an anxious patron. Oil <b>paints</b> <b>blend</b> well with each other, making subtle variations of color possible as well as creating many details of light and shadow. Oil paints can be diluted with turpentine or other thinning agents, which artists take advantage to paint in layers.|$|R
2500|$|To reduce optical {{visibility}} {{during daylight}} flights, the B-2 is painted in an anti-reflective paint.

50|$|Martin worked only in black, white, {{and brown}} {{before moving to}} New Mexico. The last {{painting}} before she abandoned her career, and left New York in 1967, Trumpet, marked a departure in that the single rectangle evolved into an overall grid of rectangles. In this painting the rectangles were drawn in pencil over uneven washes of gray translucent paint. In 1973, she returned to art making, and produced a portfolio of 30 serigraphs, On a Clear Day. During her time in Taos, she introduced light pastel washes to her grids, colors that shimmered in the changing light. Later, Martin reduced the scale of her signature 72 × 72 square paintings to 60 × 60 inches and shifted her work to use bands of ethereal color. Another departure was a modification, if not a refinement, of the grid structure, which Martin has used since the late 1950s. In Untitled No. 4 (1994), for example, one viewed the gentle striations of pencil line and primary color washes of diluted acrylic <b>paint</b> <b>blended</b> with gesso. The lines, which encompassed this painting, were not measured by a ruler, but rather intuitively marked by the artist. In the 1990s, symmetry would often give way to varying widths of horizontal bands.|$|R
5000|$|From the Nuclear Movement (founded in Milan in 1951 by Dangelo e Baj), Bianco {{gained a}} love of materials. In his works, the {{features}} of the faces become increasingly imperceptible, giving way to <b>paint</b> <b>blends.</b> His next progression was more radical, a composition of pigments, glass crystals, paint, glue, iridescent paste, and pebbles. [...] On the contrary, from Spatialism he captured the more creative, experimental, ironic and Dadaist dimension, taking interest in the materialistic trace and chromatic writing. The paintings are almost completely free of figures and become a layer of threads and paint strokes.French critic Pierre Restany wrote: [...] "We should not forget that Remo Bianco was formed during the post - WWII period in the Milanese school of spatialism of Lucio Fontana and Carlo Cardazzo from which he drew the double lesson of energy and eclecticism - in one word, liberty".Regarding his relationship with Spatialism movement, Italian painter Virgilio Guidi in the presentation of the catalogue of his first solo exhibition, in 1952, at venetian [...] "Galleria del Cavallino" [...] directed by Carlo Cardazzo, defined him as an [...] "isolated spatialist" [...] spaziale isolato as well as a [...] "sensitive spatialist" [...] spaziale sensibile.

40|$|Embedding 2 D layered {{materials}} into polymers {{and other materials}} as composites {{has resulted in the}} development of ultrasensitive pressure sensors, tunable conductive stretchable polymers, and thermoelectric coatings. As a wettable paint or ink, many 2 D materials may be penciled, printed, or coated onto a range of surfaces for a variety of applications. However, the intrinsic conductive properties of painted coatings using 2 D and layered materials are not completely understood, and conductive polymer additives may mask underlying properties such as directional conductivity. We report a process for making a paint from solvent-exfoliated Bi 2 Te 3 into solution-dispersible 2 D and few-layer (multiple quintuple) nanosheet inks, that form smooth, uniform <b>paint</b> <b>blends</b> at several concentrations of Bi 2 Te 3. The individual solvent-exfoliated nanosheets are edge-coated by (poly) ethylene glycol to produce a paint, stable over extended period in solution. Electrical transport is found to be sensitive to aspect ratio, and conduction along the painting direction is suppressed for longer strips so long as the aspect ratio is high (4 – 10 × or more), but for short and wide paint strips (aspect ratio ≤ 1), conductance is improved by a factor of 3 ×. Square 2 D paint regions show no clear directional preference for conductance at room temperature but are markedly affected by higher temperatures. Conductivity along a preferential conduction pathway through the nanosheet ensemble is modulated by 2 D nanosheet stacking along the direction of paint application for a given aspect ratio. This paint and insights into geometrical 2 D composite conduction may have implications for conductive composites, thermoelectrics, and writable circuits using 2 D material paints or inks...|$|R

50|$|Most Imperial Eagle beakers had a {{capacity}} of three to four liters and were crafted from white or coloured glass. The cylindrical Imperial Eagle beakers are 20 to 32 cm in height and have a diameter of 10 to 15 cm. These beakers were occasionally crafted with a lid and a foot made out of brass or tin. The decorations were painted on the glass with enamel. This technique had reached Germany from Venice via Tirol. Using the enamel method, the <b>paints</b> were <b>blended</b> with crushed glass. After the surface was painted, the glasses were heated once again in order to melt the newly painted colour onto the surface. With this method, the durability of the painting and brightly shining colours was achieved.|$|R
