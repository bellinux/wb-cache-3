500|$|Indeed, {{it may not}} be {{inappropriate}} to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement. [...] Distinguished University of Chicago Divinity School theologian Shailer Mathews once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book Religion in the Making: [...] "It is infuriating, and I must say embarrassing as well, to read <b>page</b> <b>after</b> <b>page</b> of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the accusations}} of {{nepotism}} that greeted his appointment on January 3, 1903, Sifton fast became a well-respected judge. [...] He served as {{chief justice of}} the Northwest Territories until September 16, 1907, when the Supreme Court of Alberta was established, whereupon he headed this new court, sitting in Calgary as the first Chief Justice of Alberta. [...] He was notoriously difficult for barristers to read: he generally heard arguments expressionlessly smoking a cigar, and it was as a judge that he first acquired his long-time nickname of the Sphinx for his inscrutability. [...] In one trial, he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides' lengthy closing arguments and, once they concluded, immediately delivered his judgment. [...] The bewildered lawyers wondered what he had been writing down, since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments; once Sifton had left the courtroom, they found their answer in the form of <b>page</b> <b>after</b> <b>page</b> covered with the judge's signature. [...] He rarely recorded his ratio decidendi but, despite this, few of his decisions were overturned on appeal. It has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons. Much of his work was in criminal law, dealing especially with theft of livestock (in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years hard labour, severe {{by the standards of the}} day). By the end of his judicial career, he had convicted as many Americans as Canadians. His rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory, based more on social morality than legal precedent, and he did not establish any important precedents.|$|E

2500|$|Taine's {{influence}} on French intellectual culture and literature was enormous. He {{had a special}} relationship, in particular, with Émile Zola.

2500|$|Reviewing {{the book}} in The Wall Street Journal, Dave Shiflett said that Morton portrayed Cruise as [...] "a top-gun Scientologist who is up to no good," [...] and that [...] "Mr. Morton, {{apparently}} unfazed by {{the reputation of the}} group's notoriously hair-triggered legal department, leaves few stones unhurled." [...] Stefanie Roberts of The Independent Florida Alligator wrote [...] "Author Andrew Morton's narrative, though for the most part irritatingly unbiased, does a fair job of reaffirming how far gone Cruise truly is." [...] Roberts wrote that the book would have drawn in more readers if it had [...] "taken a few more obvious jabs at Cruise." [...] Writing in the San Jose Mercury News, Tony Hicks criticized parts of the work, and recommended that it be taken [...] "with the proper grain of salt." [...] Hicks wrote that [...] "Holes and all, it's a hard book to put down, especially with wild tales of Scientology spilling forth <b>page</b> <b>after</b> <b>page.</b> The entertainment value falls off toward book's end, when Morton attempts to wrap up his story with some editorializing and a diagnosis of both Cruise and his religion that, while seeming accurate to a degree, nevertheless comes off preachy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his journal, Klebold {{wrote about}} his view {{that he and}} Harris were [...] "god-like" [...] and more highly evolved than every other human being, but his secret journal records self-loathing and suicidal intentions. <b>Page</b> <b>after</b> <b>page</b> was covered in hearts, as he was {{secretly}} {{in love with a}} Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at Blackjack Pizza. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be [...] "god-like". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word [...] "WRATH" [...] printed in red. It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and {{that he would like to}} spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place. Klebold was described as being [...] "hotheaded, but depressive and suicidal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Knapen, who had distanced {{himself from}} the Society soon after its foundation, accused De Telegraaf and de Volkskrant of taking the Society way too seriously, and called the media {{controversy}} a [...] "farce". Van Amerongen, however, stood up defiantly in De Groene Amsterdammer, in which he indeed explained [...] "Decision 4" [...] to be a mere joke, but the republican initiative as a whole [...] "extremely serious" [...] and [...] "serious in every sense", and provided more legitimacy for the cause. He primarily rebuked De Telegraaf, accusing it of hypocrisy by first calling {{the emergence of the}} Republican Society [...] "barely noteworthy", before filling <b>page</b> <b>after</b> <b>page</b> about it for an entire week, and write down reviling remarks from several famous Dutch people addressed to the republicans (singer Gerard Joling called them [...] "traitors"). Some like historian Anton van Hooff joined the ranks of the Society, other republicans such as Socialist Party leader Jan Marijnissen did not (no 'conspiratory clubs'), but did support having a public nationwide debate on the monarchy, which in their opinion unjustly appeared to be a taboo subject. Several politicians and commentators proceeded to sweeten the issue, which, despite the serious undertone, appeared to be a partially [...] "derailed joke", because the prankish remarks in Vinken's minutes such as [...] "Decision 4" [...] were unintentionally taken seriously in print. Although the existence of the Republican Society was revealed prematurely and rather clumsily, it succeeded in having the form of government debated nationally. One year later, the media no longer wrote about the royal house without criticism, and the membership of the Republican Society grew rapidly.|$|E

Our emphasis in providing a values-based education, broad-based curriculum with multidisciplinary learning, industry and global exposure prepares our graduates for challenging times in today’s economic climate. They leave the University with a strong set of skills and knowledge, versatile enough to adapt and survive well in different industries.
