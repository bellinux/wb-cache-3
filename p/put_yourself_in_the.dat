40|$|Money to {{encourage}} morality? Not {{as simple as}} it sounds, says David Burchell NOW that’s what I call value for money. Or is that values for money? Missed by most commentators on the federal budget was a new agenda for values education in Australian schools, designed to address the supposed epidemic of ‘values-neutrality’ in state schooling of which the PM spoke so feelingly late last year. Yet the $ 32 million allocated to this ‘values roadshow’ will amount to little more than a grant of $ 1600 per school to hold forums with students, parents and teachers on values and on what the Treasurer, slightly vaguely, called ‘things like the dangers of drugs’. Last I noticed, $ 1600 doesn’t buy an enormous amount of education in morality. Don’t hold your breath waiting for our young people’s chins to lift, or their shoulders to square, or their handshakes to firm up, any time soon. It would be churlish to suggest that the values push is pure window-dressing. The PM and others in his cabinet clearly believe sincerely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> need for some kind of reaffirmation of the values Australians should (and, they no doubt believe, once did) hold dear. But in practice values education is a tricky business. That slightly whacky-sounding $ 1600 may in effect be a delicate compromise between the earnest desire to be seen to be doing something about the ethical education of the young, and the vexed business of finding a broadly agreeable means of actually doing it. When the PM complained of ‘values-free’ education, he no doubt believed he knew what he meant. He meant, I suppose, that schools nowadays are inclined to favour a ‘cultural relativist’ approach to the understanding of history and society. Or, in other words, an approach which affords all cultures and beliefs what is commonly called equal value or merit, or an equal entitlement to our respect. It’s not always clear what this claim to ‘equal value’ means. Often it’s more a matter of good intentions than moral theory. A bit like those pious claims by liberal-minded clerics that they believe all religions are ‘equally valid’ - when presumably in their hearts of hearts they don’t, or else they wouldn’t have become Christian clerics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place. Against this air of moral vagueness the PM and his supporters want to deploy a definite set of values to which all Australians can cleave. In his budget statement the education minister, Dr Nelson, short-listed in this category ‘values such as tolerance, trust, mutual respect, courage, compassion, honesty and courtesy’. As such lists go, it’s not a bad one: it’s hard to imagine that many Australians could disagree with any of these values, as such. Yet here’s <b>the</b> rub. <b>In</b> practice values never are just values, as such - they’re always values about something actual and real. I don’t feel compassion - I feel compassion for that bullied kid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playground, or my sick auntie, or that maltreated pet. We can all agree on the value of compassion, or human sympathy, or <b>putting</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place of another. But the moment you try to discuss this, substantively, in a classroom setting, things start getting tricky very fast. I have a hunch, for instance, that if a hundred average school-teachers tried to discuss the operation of compassion or sympathy or empathy in a hundred classrooms right now, in ninety-five of those hundred cases the subject would turn very quickly to current events - events such as the refugee debate, or the Iraq war, or the treatment of military detainees, to pick but three rather obvious examples. It’s hard to believe that the PM would like or approve of the argument that would follow. This {{is not to say that}} the PM has no bedfellows when it comes to values in schooling. Just that some of them might not be the people he’s used to fighting over the doona with. Take that grey eminence of Australian small-l liberalism, Donald Horne. Last year, lamenting Australians’ lack of sympathy towards asylum-seekers, Professor Horne too blamed our schools. If only, he claimed, we had taught better the values of tolerance and cultural sensitivity in our classrooms, Australians would be a more likeable bunch. The professor and the PM might agree on the values, but I doubt they’d see eye to eye on their implementation. That ‘school forum’ starring the PM and not-so-Young Donald would be well worth its $ 1600. Of course, the values push didn’t just drop out of the sky. It follows a weighty Values Education Study, submitted to <b>the</b> government <b>in</b> August last year. The report handed out small bundles of cash to participating schools, and watched what they did with it. Unsurprisingly, most of the values identified were fairly similar, regardless of the sector of the school concerned. Emphases on tolerance, mutual respect, community involvement, self-reliance and personal responsibility pop up all over <b>the</b> place. <b>In</b> fact, if there was an empathetic heartland, it was probably the religious schooling sector, rather than the state sector - as those with a sense of history may have anticipated. <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> major divide wasn’t - contrary over what the PM might believe - over which values to foster, but rather over how to do the fostering. And here most schools, regardless of the sector they belonged to, tended to fall into one of two camps. Is the purpose of values education to inculcate definite values into students, through classroom instruction? Or is it better for students to ‘learn by doing’ - in clubs or sports teams, or in community involvement? Should students be coached <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art of moral reasoning, so they can tell right from wrong? Or should the classroom be about values, rather than in favour of them, so students can make up their own minds? Whatever the PM might think, answering these questions isn’t an easy business. You and I might think our attitude to life is the key to our self-image and self-respect. But in practice there’s nothing more overwhelmingly tedious than be lectured by others about their values, and why they think they should be our values, too. <b>In</b> fact, as <b>the</b> report cannily observes, the results of this sort of preaching are often counter-productive. Instead of fashioning a battalion of Weary Dunlops you churn out a posse of Marlon Brandos. All of which suggests that the PM and his education minister need to put on their thinking-caps. Tolerance, fairness and self-respect are all crucial attributes of Australian citizens. But if there’s a value-free model of values education, I’ve yet to hear of it.

Three experiments were conducted which demonstrate that perspective taking benefits occur for nonentitled adolescents but not for entitled adolescents. Effects for perspective taking and entitlement are driven by evaluative concern for nonentitled adolescents and a perceived lack of relational closeness for entitled adolescents...|$|R
