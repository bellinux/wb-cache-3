40|$|A {{quality control}} program {{utilizing}} both “known ” and “blind ” control specimens was analyzed in the routine clinical chemistry laboratory. The results obtained with the control samples of 18 automated and nonautomated procedures demonstrated the presenceof analytical bias. Only through {{the evaluation of}} blind control samples tested at random times can a reliable measure of the <b>proficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> be achieved. ‘THE CLINICAL CHEusmY Laboratories of The Ohio State University Hospitals perform approximately 500, 000 analyses per year, including 24, 000 control specimens. A considerable number of these control speci-mens are sent through the laboratory as “blind ” samples. When reviewing our control data, we wondered whether a systematic dif-ference appears between the data derived from known and unknown control samples. If no significant divergence between the 2 groups {{could be found in}} our laboratory, it would permit us {{to reduce the number of}} “blind ” samples. When reviewing the literature we found to our surprise only one reference dealing with this subject matter in a clinical laboratory, and this one reported tile absence of bias between known and unknown control results (i). The purpose of this h-t’portis to make available our data on known and unknown control samples and to report the presence of bias.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{whether it is}} appropriate to assume comparability of hepatitis virus C (HCV) -RNA results across laboratories in multi-centre studies, nine <b>laboratories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Paediatric HCV Network participated in an international <b>proficiency</b> study <b>of</b> HCV-RNA assays. A panel of 12 samples of different dilutions and genotypes was sent to each laboratory and tested with qualitative and/or quantitative HCV-RNA assays according to local procedures. Commercial assays were used in seven laboratories and in-house assays in two. All six laboratories in which a commercial qualitative assay was used were proficient, as were four of six runs (in five laboratories) in which a commercial quantitative assay was used. <b>The</b> <b>proficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> where in-house assays were used could not be assessed according to the VQC definition because <b>of</b> differences in <b>the</b> methods used. Overall, there were several false-negative results, but only one false-positive result with a quantitative assay and none with a qualitative assay. The false-negative results may have implications for <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> infection, and highlight the need for an antibody test to be performed at 18 months to confirm <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> infection. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> qualitative assays were generally consistent across laboratories but it was difficult to evaluate and compare <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> quantitative assays. Multivariate analysis of data collected in multi-centre studies should therefore allow for centre and/or assay used. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jSCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

These included typing of nosocomial pathogens {{as a service}} to local hospital infection control programs. Two external quality assessment (EQA) surveys were performed in 2001 and 2003 to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>proficiencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> at Staphylococcus aureus typing. EQA panels included S. aureus isolates with either indistinguishable, clonally related, or unrelated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. A hypothetical hospital outbreak problem was also submitted for analysis. Typeability, reproducibility, discrimination (D) index, and epidemiological concordance were evaluated. Ten centers participated in each survey. Seven centers performed PFGE analysis, while others used repetitive-element or randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR, amplified fragment length polymorphism, or spa typing. Full typeability (100 %) was achieved by all centers, and all but one showed 100 % reproducibility. Discrimination was appropriate (D index, ≥ 96 %) for centers performing PFGE analysis but not for all those using other methods (D index range, 72 % to 97 %). Correct answers to the epidemiological questions were provided by 7 / 10 and 10 / 10 centers in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Individual feedback of results was provided to each center together with specific technical recommendations for improving performance.

In this paper we distinguish between a computational compe-tency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SGA—an efficient, but narrow computational ability—and a computational <b>proficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SGA—a computational ability that is both efficient and broad. Till date, attempts to deduce a computational <b>proficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SGA have been unsuccessful. It may, however, be possible to infer a computational <b>proficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SGA from a set of related computational competencies that have been deduced. With this in mind we deduce two computational competencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SGA. These competencies, when con-sidered together, point toward a remarkable computational <b>proficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SGA.
