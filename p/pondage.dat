500|$|Over {{the years}} further {{changes to the}} {{alignment}} have occurred. The eastern section of the highway no longer runs west to Nimittabel, instead meeting the Monaro Highway to the south; the old section has been renamed as Old Bega Road. It also no longer runs east to the coast at Tathra, and now terminates where it meets the Princes Highway; the section from Bega to Tathra has been renamed as Tathra Road. The western section has also seen some major changes with the highway being realigned to avoid Lake Eucumbene near [...] due {{to the construction of}} Eucumbene Dam in the 1950s.

40|$|Nagasaki City {{is located}} in a narrow peninsular region of western part of Kyushu, therefore, it is a bad {{condition}} to keep the resources of water. As the reservoirs have been constructed in small basins, they occassionally could not help cutting off water supply. The author has studied a water balance of reservoirs in this city. As the first report, a simulation of change of <b>pondages</b> and an estimation of run-off coefficients in each of the basins were studied with use of unit-graph method. In the result of this study has been shown that the run-off coefficients are considerably defferent from one another...|$|R
50|$|The Hunter River rises on {{the western}} slopes of Mount Royal Range, part of the Liverpool Range, within Barrington Tops National Park, east of Murrurundi, and flows {{generally}} northwest and then southwest before being imponded by Lake Glenbawn; then flowing southwest and then east southeast before reaching its mouth of the Tasman Sea, in Newcastle between Nobbys Head and Stockton. The river is joined by ten tributaries upstream of Lake Glenbawn; and a further thirty-one tributaries downstream of the reservoir. The main tributaries are the Pages, Goulburn, Williams and the Paterson rivers and the Moonan, Stewarts and Wollombi brooks. East of Hexham, the river splits into two main channels, separated by the Ramsar-protected Kooragang Wetlands that feeds Milham Ponds, Wader Pond, Swan Pond {{and a series of}} smaller wetland <b>pondages.</b> The southern arm of the river also creates Hexham Island, while the northern creaters Smiths Island and flows in Fullerton Cove. The two channels converge at Walsh Point, reaching confluence with Throsby Creek adjacent to the Newcastle central business district, before reaching the river mouth. The Hunter River descends 1397 m over its 468 km course from the high upper reaches, through the Hunter Valley, and out to sea.|$|R

5000|$|The Eildon <b>Pondage</b> Power Station is a {{hydroelectric}} power station on the Eildon <b>Pondage</b> at Lake Eildon, Victoria, Australia. Eildon <b>Pondage</b> has one turbo generator, with a total generating capacity of [...] of electricity. It is {{owned and operated by}} Pacific Hydro, and the electricity produced is sold to electricity retailer TXU.|$|E
50|$|Eildon <b>Pondage</b> re-uses {{the water}} from Eildon Power Station, which is stored in the <b>pondage</b> to ensure a {{controlled}} release into the Goulburn River downstream from Lake Eildon.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of limited <b>pondage,</b> calculating its effect on power generation is important in determining how often the plant can be operated. The <b>pondage</b> factor is a rough index of the amount <b>pondage</b> needed when the stream flow is constant and the plant is operational during specific periods. It is calculated by the ratio of total inflow hours per week to the hours the power plant will be operated in that same period. For example, if a river has an inflow for seven days a week and the plant operates for five of those days for eight hours:24-hour inflows and plant operation would have a <b>pondage</b> factor of one.|$|E

50|$|Tumut Pond Reservoir or Tumut Pond <b>Pondage</b> (sometimes also Tumut 1 Reservoir/Tumut 1 <b>Pondage)</b> {{is formed}} by the Tumut Pond Dam.

50|$|Run-of-the-river {{hydroelectricity}} (ROR) or run-of-river hydroelectricity {{is a type}} of hydroelectric generation plant whereby {{little or}} no water storage is provided. Run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage, in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as <b>pondage.</b> A plant without <b>pondage</b> has no water storage and is, therefore, subject to seasonal river flows. Thus, the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source while a plant with <b>pondage</b> can regulate the water flow at all times and can serve as a peaking power plant or base load power plant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pondage</b> usually {{refers to}} the comparably small water storage behind the weir of a run-of-the-river {{hydroelectric}} power plant. Such a power plant has considerably less storage than the reservoirs of large dams and conventional hydroelectric stations which can store water for long periods such as a dry season or year. With <b>pondage,</b> water is usually stored during periods of low electricity demand and days when the power plant is inactive, enabling its use as a peaking power plant in dry seasons and a base load power plant during wet seasons. Ample <b>pondage</b> allows a power plant meet hourly load fluctuations {{for a period of}} a week or more.|$|E

Projects with <b>pondage,</b> as opposed to those without <b>pondage,</b> can store water for daily load demands. In general, projects divert some or most of a river's flow (up to 95% of mean annual discharge) through a pipe and/or tunnel leading to electricity-generating turbines, then return the water back to the river downstream.|$|E
