40|$|A 25 -year-old woman awoke with right-sided visual loss {{the morning}} {{following}} a severe right temporal headache. An urgent MRI scan suggested optic neuritis, {{but there was}} no improvement in vision despite methylprednisolone. On examination of the right side 7 days later, acuity was 20 / 50 – 2, and she saw no color plates. There was a trace of optic nerve pallor with increase in cup-to-disc ratio compared with the normal left side. Repeat MRI demon-strated enlargement and T 2 prolongation (hyperintensity) of the prechiasmal right optic nerve and right half of the chiasm (figure 1 A). Gradient-echo (GRE) imaging demonstrated marked signal loss (figure 1 B). These features suggested hemorrhage into a chi-asmal/optic nerve cavernous malformation (cavernoma), which was confirmed at surgical excision. Optic pathway cavernomas present with either an acute chias-mal syndrome (“apoplexy”) or slowly progressive visual loss. 1 There is a tendency for recurrent hemorrhage within 2 years and surgical resection is usually recommended. 2 GRE is the most sen-sitive sequence for detecting blood-products from recent or chronic hemorrhage, which manifests as focal signal loss. Although optic cavernomas are rare, their differentiation from entities with clin-ically similar presentations, such as optic neuritis, is important because of the potential for <b>permanent</b> <b>compromise</b> of vision...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPain is {{a public}} health problem, greatly {{impairing}} quality of life. Almost 80 % of patients with chronic pain reported that their pain interferes with activities of daily living, and two thirds reported that the pain causes negative impact on their personal relationships. The physical and functional disability, whether temporary or <b>permanent,</b> <b>compromises</b> the professional activity and causes work absenteeism, increasing costs of health systems. ObjectivesThe aim of this review is to analyze, based on the literature, the analgesic effect of lidocaine administered intravenously {{for the treatment of}} chronic pain and to evaluate the reduction of pain intensity in patients with chronic pain, focusing on musculoskeletal and neuropathic etiology. MethodologyThe method used was a review of the literature, consisting in searching the scientific literature on the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine infusion in the treatment of patients with chronic pain. ContentOf the 19 studies reviewed, 12 had results that confirm the analgesic effect of intravenous lidocaine in patients with chronic pain. Most authors used doses of 5 mg/kg infused for 30 minutes or more, producing significant analgesia with variable duration (minutes to weeks). ConclusionsBased on the literature review, {{it is not possible to}} uniformly specify the most effective and safe dose of lidocaine administered intravenously for the treatment of neuropathic or musculoskeletal pain. As for effectiveness, the intravenous infusion of lidocaine as an alternative for the treatment of chronic pain of various etiologies seems very promising, but further studies need to be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Biometries {{characteristics}} are immutable, resulting in <b>permanent</b> biometrics <b>compromise.</b> To address this problem, we prescribe a generic cancellable biometrics formulation - BioPhasor. BioPhasor {{is a set}} of binary code based on iterated mixing between the user-specific tokenised pseudo-random number and the biometric feature. This method enables straightforward revocation of biometric template via token replacement. The transformation is non-invertible and BioPhasor able to achieve extremely low error rate compare to sole biometrics in verification setting. The privacy invasion and nonrevocable problems in biometrics could be resolved by revocation of resulting feature through the pseudo-random number replacement. We also consider an unfavorable scenario in which an imposter has access genuine token and used by the imposter to claim as the genuine user. The feasibility of the formulation is demonstrated by the experiments on fingerprint images from the FVC 2004 database...|$|R

40|$|Dobrisa Cesaric is {{probably}} the most widely read, quoted and recited Croatian and Yugoslav poet of the twentieth century. His poetry has not only captured the attention of readers of all ages and backgrounds, but has also permeated deeply into the life and soul of millions of men. Strangely, but not unexpectedly in the present social and cultural climate, Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poetry has not been completely understood and adequately evaluated by either the public or by literary critics. Evaluation of Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poetry has not dared to go beyond its two surface, but widely acknowledged features: the interchange of suffering and light in human life and the harmony of content and form in Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poems. Contrary to this superficial assessment, Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poetry includes a striking, deep, consistent and complete life doctrine which is in its entirety the reflection of the genuine Christian attitude to life. Without being aware of it, Cesaric lived an inner life, human and mystical at the same time, which was an emulation of the life of Jesus. Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poems disclose that he successively tried to find accommodation with the four 2 ̆ 7 natural 2 ̆ 7 ideological options into which rapid social change has divided people. Unable and unwilling to make <b>permanent</b> <b>compromises</b> with the four ideologies offered (a local Christian tradition, nationalism, socialism, social escapism), Cesaric retreated to a position based in his own rich deposit of love. Deprived of the total and universal exchange of life, usually called love, he forced himself to become satisfied only with bringing life, love and light into the hearts of unknown but numerous readers and admirers. Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s failure to recognize in Jesus the model for his own use of his life ought to be of great concern to the officials and chartered guardians of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 heritage, a heritage which has not been expressed in terms understandable to contemporary men. The acceptance and real appreciation of Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poetry by masses of readers bring the hope that a global society, for which the economic and technological foundations have already been laid, is ready and willing to receive and accept Jesus 2 ̆ 7 message when it is properly worded...|$|R
40|$|Erosive tooth wear in {{children}} is a common condition. The overlapping of erosion with mechanical forces like attrition or abrasion is probably in deciduous teeth more pronounced than in permanent teeth. Early erosive damage to the <b>permanent</b> teeth may <b>compromise</b> the dentition for the entire lifetime and require extensive restorative procedures. Therefore, early diagnosis of the condition and adequate preventive measures are of importance. Knowledge of the etiological factors for erosive tooth wear {{is a prerequisite for}} such measures. In children and adolescents (like in adults) extrinsic and intrinsic factors or a combination of them are possible reasons for the condition. Such factors are frequent and extensive consumption of erosive foodstuffs and drinks, the intake of medicaments (asthma), gastro-esophageal reflux (a case history is discussed) or vomiting. But also behavioral factors like unusual eating and drinking habits, the consumption of designer drugs and socio-economic aspects are of importance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—This study {{focuses on}} the {{relevance}} of size, eloquence, type of venous drainage, the Spetzler-Martin scale as a whole, and other factors, such as rupture of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) for the prediction of neurological deficits {{in the context of}} microsurgical AVM removal.  METHODS—One hundred and fifty patients with AVMs, whose data were retrieved from a prospectively employed computerised data bank were included. Seventeen patients (11. 3 %) underwent preoperative embolisation. According to the Spetzler-Martin scale they were graded as follows: 22. 0 % grade I, 32. 0 % grade II, 29. 3 % grade III, 14. 0 % grade IV, and 2. 7 % grade V. Intracerebral haemorrhage was present in 39. 0 %. The AVMs were 6 cm in 4. 7 %; 59. 3 % of the AVMs were eloquently located and 29. 3 % had deep venous drainage (DVD). Follow up information was assessed 6 months after surgery in all but one patient, who died. The applied statistical test was χ 2.  RESULTS—Surgical morbidity was 15. 3 %. Early new deficits were noted in 39. 3 %, permanent new deficits in 10. 6 %, being significant (major) in 7. 3 %. The ocurrence of permanent deficits correlated significantly with size, deep venous drainage, and the Spetzler-Martin scale. There was statistical evidence for a trend in risk of poor surgical outcome across the three categories non-eloquent, "less eloquent" (for example, visual cortex) and "highly eloquent" (brainstem, basal ganglia, or precentral cortex) with the last being associated with the highest risk for <b>permanent</b> neurological <b>compromise.</b>  CONCLUSION—"Eloquence" of the Spetzler-Martin scale should be divided into "highly eloquent" and "less eloquent", which is important for risk analysis of the treatment of asymptomatic and deep seated AVMs and for future trials comparing various treatment modalities. In addition, resection of eloquent AVMs v non-eloquent ones is significantly associated with higher surgical morbidity. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{looked at}} the problem of {{constructed}} wetlands deviating from their initial design parameters {{to the detriment of}} treatment performance, {{in the context of a}} contemporary storm water treatment wetland in Perth, Western Australia. The study investigated the system components and internal process management of the wetland, and their impact on its capacity to remove nutrients and contaminants from urban stormwater over a seven year period. It found that a designed feature of the wetland, specifically <b>permanent</b> inundation, <b>compromised</b> the ability of the wetland to accommodate inputs of organic material and sulfate, resulting in intensified substrate reduction. Strongly reduced sediments containing dissolved sulfides and other phytotoxins accumulated to concentrations sufficient to cause vegetation dieback; and the cover and health of the emergent macrophytes within the wetland declined dramatically. Loss of emergent macrophytes coincided with changes in nitrogen removal, not in the reduction of nitrate but in the increase of ammonium, consistent with the increasingly reduced conditions. There was not a significant change in phosphorus removal, perhaps suggesting that phosphorus removal was primarily through physical means (sedimentation) rather than chemical. It was considered that the broadscale deoxygenation of the wetland was detrimental both to its nutrient removal capacity and biodiversity attributes. Applying active adaptive management, a trial was conducted involving manipulation of inundation depths, such that redox potentials were increased in a passively aerated treatment. The growth of the emergent macrophyte species Baumea articulata was demonstrated to improve significantly within this treatment, suggesting a similar modification to the hydraulics of the wetland could improve emergent macrophyte growth. The importance of macrophytes to treatment processes is well established and so this modification is expected to improve the water treatment function of the wetland. The study successfully demonstrated that the design of urban constructed wetlands must be site specific and adaptive to ensure specific ecosystem services, such as water treatment, are maintained...|$|R
5000|$|At the Bill's {{third reading}} in the Commons on 21 May 1914 several members asked about a {{proposal}} to exclude the whole of Ulster for six years. Asquith was seeking any solution that would avoid a civil war. During the emotional debate which lasted until 25 May 1914, Sir Edward Carson made the statement: [...] "I say this to my Nationalist fellow-countrymen, and indeed also to the Government, you have never tried to win over Ulster. You have never tried to understand her position. You have never alleged, and you cannot allege, that this Bill gives her one atom of advantage." [...] A government amending bill {{was introduced in the}} House of Lords on 23 June 1914 (before it had considered the original bill itself) and passed there with amendments on 8 July. Carson and the Irish Unionist Party (mostly Ulster MPs) backed the amending bill, which envisaged [...] "temporary exclusion of Ulster" [...] from the workings of the future Act. The Lords' amendments to the amending bill were unacceptable to the government. What was still to be negotiated were the number of counties excluded (four, six or nine) and whether exclusion would be temporary or <b>permanent.</b> The <b>compromise</b> proposed by Asquith was straightforward. Six counties in northeast Ulster were to be excluded [...] "temporarily" [...] from the territory of the new Irish parliament and government, and to continue to be governed as before from Westminster and Whitehall. How temporary the exclusion would be, and whether northeastern Ireland would eventually be governed by the Irish parliament and government, remained an issue of some controversy. To save endless debate in parliament, George V called the Buckingham Palace Conference with two MPs from each of the British Liberal and Conservative parties, and two each from the nationalists and unionists. The conference, held between 21 and 24 July 1914, achieved very little.|$|R
40|$|Aim.

Material and methods. The register of patients with AF, visited an outpatient clinic of Yaroslavl from 01 January to 31 December 2013, was created. Quality of AF patient examination in the outpatient clinic was assessed. Morbidity and mortality of these patients were monitoring during 12 months by the contacts with patients, their relatives and doctors in charge. Results. The typical patient with AF has advanced age, mainly <b>permanent</b> AF and <b>compromised</b> history of cardiovascular diseases. 12 -month monitoring of 212 outpatients with AF showed high mortality and the need for hospitalization due to cardiovascular diseases in this group.

The irregularity of observation and the lack of examination of patients with AF may be the reasons of the increased rates of mortality and complications in this group of outpatients. </p...|$|R
40|$|Erosive tooth wear in {{children}} is a common condition. Besides the anatomical differences between deciduous and permanent teeth, additional histological differences may influence their susceptibility to dissolution. Considering laboratory studies alone, {{it is not clear}} whether deciduous teeth are more liable to erosive wear than permanent teeth. However, results from epidemiological studies imply that the primary dentition is less wear resistant than permanent teeth, possibly due to the overlapping of erosion with mechanical forces (like attrition or abrasion). Although low severity of tooth wear {{in children}} does not cause a significant impact on their quality of life, early erosive damage to their <b>permanent</b> teeth may <b>compromise</b> their dentition for their entire lifetime and require extensive restorative procedures. Therefore, early diagnosis of erosive wear and adequate preventive measures are important. Knowledge on the aetiological factors of erosive wear is a prerequisite for preventive strategies. Like in adults, extrinsic and intrinsic factors, or a combination of them, are possible reasons for erosive tooth wear in children and adolescents. Several factors directly related to erosive tooth wear in children are presently discussed, such as socio-economic aspects, gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting, and intake of some medicaments, as well as behavioural factors such as unusual eating and drinking habits. Additionally, frequent and excessive consumption of erosive foodstuffs and drinks are of importance...|$|R
30|$|Because end-stage {{renal disease}} may complicate AKI, subclavian access for DC {{placement}} should be proposed {{as a last resort}} for fear of vein stenosis, which <b>compromises</b> <b>permanent</b> access in critically ill patients [5]. Prospective surveys of DCs in critically ill patients suggest that internal jugular access might be preferable to femoral access to minimize DC dysfunction [35] and blood recirculation [36], and to improve RRT provision [37]. The results of recent studies contrast with these data. In the Cathedia study, which included 750 patients from 12 different ICUs, the rate of DC dysfunction of the first RRT vascular access was similar in the femoral (36 / 348, 10.3 %) and the internal jugular routes (38 / 342, 11.1 %), and the time to DC dysfunction did not differ between the two access sites [11]. These results were confirmed in a subgroup analysis performed in 134 patients who received two successive DCs at two different insertion sites (either femoral or internal jugular) and that showed a rate of DC dysfunction of 22.4 % with femoral access and of 26.1 % with internal jugular access [13]. However, when the sides of site insertion are compared, there is a trend to a lower rate of DC dysfunction in the right internal jugular site (6.6 %) than in the femoral sites (10.3 %). DC dysfunctions are more frequently observed at the left internal jugular site (19.5 %) than at the right internal jugular and femoral sites [11].|$|R
2500|$|Although some dentists advise {{that the}} best {{treatment}} for an avulsed tooth is immediate replantation, {{for a variety of}} reasons this can be difficult for the non-professional person. The teeth are often covered with debris. This debris must be washed off with a physiological solution and not scrubbed. Often multiple teeth are knocked-out and the person will not know which socket an individual tooth belongs to. The injured victim may have other more serious injuries that require more immediate attention or injuries such as a severely lacerated bleeding lip or gum that prevent easy visualization of the socket. Pain may be severe and the person may resist replantation of the teeth. People may, in light of infectious diseases (e.g. HIV), fear handling the teeth or touching the blood associated with them. If immediate replantation is not possible, the teeth should be placed in an appropriate storage solution and brought to a dentist who can then replant them. The dentist will clean the socket, wash the teeth if necessary, and replant them into their sockets. He will splint them to non-knocked-out teeth for a maximum of two weeks for teeth with normal alveolar process and bone support. Properly handled, even replantation of periodontally <b>compromised</b> <b>permanent</b> teeth in older patients under good maintenance have been reported, with splinting extending for over 4 weeks due to the reduced support structure for the root due to periodontal disease. [...] One week to ten days after the replantation, the dental pulps of the replanted teeth should be removed and a root canal treatment completed within two months.|$|R
