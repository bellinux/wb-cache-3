40|$|Biomass {{production}} of annual crops is often {{directly proportional to}} the amounts of radiation intercepted, water transpired and nutrients taken up. In many places the amount of rainfall {{during the period of}} rapid crop growth is less than the <b>potential</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation,</b> so that depletion of stored soil water is commonplace. The rate of mineralization of nitrogen (N) from organic matter and the processes of nutrient loss are closely related to the availability of soil water. Results from Kenya indicate the rapid changes in nitrate availability following rain. Nutrient supply has a large effect on the quantity of radiation intercepted and hence, biomass production. There is considerable scope for encouraging canopy expansion to conserve water by reducing evaporation from the soil surface in environments where it is frequently rewetted, and where the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil is sufficient to supply water at the energy limited rate (e. g. northern Syria). In regions with high evaporative demand and coarse-textured soils (e. g. Niger), transpiration may be increased by management techniques that reduce drainage. Increases in atmospheric [CO 2] are likely to have only a small impact on crop yields when allowance is made for the interacting effects of temperature, and water and nutrient supply. <br...|$|E
40|$|Climate and {{vegetation}} can dramatically alter the water cycle on local to regional scales. A {{change in the}} surface energy and water balance, especially in arid regions, can have significant impacts on local water availability and, therefore, water resource management. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the role of climate {{and vegetation}} in the energy and water balance of a riparian wetland in the central Great Plains. The site is located near the Republican River in southwestern Nebraska, where decreases in streamflow have been observed in recent decades. In an effort to reduce consumptive use from evapotranspiration (ET), and thereby reclaim surface water, invasive species such as Phragmites australis are being removed throughout the riparian corridor of the river basin. In this study, we have installed two energy/water balance monitoring stations, a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), and various water and soil temperature probes in the P. australis and native (Typha latifolia) portions of the wetland to determine the energy and water balance during the 2009 growing season (April 11 −October 3). Sensible heat flux is measured using the LAS, while ET is calculated as a residual of the energy balance (i. e., net radiation minus the sensible heat flux and heat storage in the canopy, water, and soil). Comparisons are also made with ET rates calculated from the simpler Priestley-Taylor method. Additional calculations of ET rates for both P. australis and T. latifolia (Cattail) were made using Landsat remote sensing imagery during five days from April 19 to September 26. Lastly, an open water evaporation model was developed to simulate the <b>potential</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from an open water body, in the absence of vegetation. The model assumes a shallow, well-mixed water layer that is similar in area and depth to the existing wetland, and the results are used to infer the potential amount of “water savings” that might be achieved by the removal of P. australis vegetation from the wetland. The results of the energy budget analysis show that the average ET rate for the wetland during the growing season is 4. 4 mm day- 1, with a maximum rate of 8. 2 mm day- 1 occurring around June 29. This measured daily ET is higher than some values found in previous studies (e. g., 6. 9, 6. 5, 6. 3, 5. 0, and 5. 8 mm day- 1) and is attributed to differences in plant structure/biology, environment, and regional climate. The vegetation phenology and net radiation are the two largest meteorological/vegetation drivers for the seasonal variability in ET. Remote sensing-based estimates of ET are similar than those of the in-situ energy balance during full vegetation, and they also reveal that the ET rates from P. australis are, on average, about 28 % (1. 18 mm day- 1) greater than those for T. latifolia. We concluded that the Priestley-Taylor equation provides a good estimate of ET, particularly during the height of the growing season, when most of the net radiation is balanced by latent heat flux. Results of the water balance analysis reveal a reasonable correspondence between water level fluctuations and the energy budget-derived estimates of ET. Periods when the two curves do not agree imply influx (outflux) of groundwater early (late) in the growing season. Results suggest that the removal of P. australis from wetlands within the Republican River basin could potentially result in a growing season “water savings” of up to 28 % if the native species of T. latifolia replaces the non-native P. australis. If a free water surface replaces P. australis, depending on wind sheltering, a “water loss” or a “water savings” could occur. We conclude that due to the general presence of wind sheltering throughout the riparian corridor of the Republican River basin, this would more likely lead to a small, but tangible amount of “water savings” if replaced by open water...|$|E

Maximizing the efficiency of clay pipe irrigation requires guidelines and criteria for system design and operation. In this study, experimental and simulated (with HYDRUS (2 D/ 3 D)) soil wetting patterns were investigated for sub-surface pipe systems operating at different water pressures. Predictions of the soil water content made with HYDRUS {{were found to be}} in good agreement (R 2 = 0. 98) with the observed data. Additional simulations with HYDRUS were used to study the effects of various design parameters on soil wetting. Increasing the system pressure increased the size of the wetted zone. The installation depth affects the recommended lateral spacing as well as the amount of evaporative water loss. For a given water application, the <b>potential</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>evaporation</b> affected the shape of the wetted region only minimally.

Simple solarimeters may help to accomplish this objective. Bare soil albedo was a linear function of the water content of a very thin surface layer of soil, and albedo correlated well with water contents of thicker soil layers. In addition, albedo measurements could be used to delineate the 3 classical stages of soil drying. Albedo may also be used to differentiate between the initial <b>potential</b> <b>rate</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> following an application of water, and the succeeding falling <b>rate</b> phase.

40|$|Predicting {{the flow}} of water between the soil surface and the {{atmosphere}} is a critical issue which geotechnical engineers must resolve for many practical problems. The analysis of saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow problems requires the specification of the flux of water at the upper soil boundary. The flow of moisture at the ground surface is also important for many problems in soil mechanics. These include the analysis of volume change in expansive soils and the stability of slopes. The transfer of water across the soil-atmosphere surface occurs as infiltration and <b>evaporation.</b> The mechanics <b>of</b> infiltration into the soil surface is well understood and has been widely addressed in the literature. Alternately, the process <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from the soil surface is poorly understood. Extreme difficulties frequently arise while predicting evaporation from unsaturated soil surfaces. Empirical methods <b>of</b> estimating <b>evaporation</b> from unsaturated soil surfaces {{can be found in the}} literature: however, the suitability and accuracy of these methods can be questioned. A theoretical approach for evaluating the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from an unsaturated soil surface is developed. The theory is based on the principles of Darcy's Law and Fick's Law to describe {{the flow of}} liquid water and water vapour in the saturated-unsaturated soil below the surface. Dalton's Law and a modified form of Penman's Method for evaporation are utilized to predict evaporation from the soil surface. Drying tests were conducted using three distinct soil types of sand, silt and clay. The soil surfaces were found to evaporate at the same rate as free water surfaces when saturated. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> begins to decline once the soil surfaces become unsaturated and total suction exceed approximately 3000 kPa. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> is proportional to total suction and continues to decline as suction increases. This principle appears independent of soil type and universal for the three texturally distinct soils selected for testing. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> may be predicted on the basis of the water content of the soil and its moisture retention curve established using routine test procedures. The proposed theory was used to simulate the results of a 42 day evaporation test for a column of fine, uniform, clean sand. Good agreement was generally found between the computed and measured values <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate,</b> soil water content and soil temperature. Additional analyses were conducted using various values of the saturated coefficient of permeability and the pore-size distribution index. The computed evaporative fluxes were found to be very sensitive to the permeability of the soil. Varying the coefficient of molecular diffusion for water vapour was also found to influence the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation.</b> The modified Penman expression was applied to an example evaporation problem for Saskatoon, Saskatchewan during a 10 day period in July. The evaporative fluxes were computed with the watertable positioned at several depths below the surface of the sand. Evaporative rates were found to vary widely between the full <b>potential</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 7. 7 mm/day and 0. 4 mm/day depending on the position of the water table. In general, the results showed that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from a soil surface depends strongly on the groundwater conditions...|$|R

An apparatus was built in which dilute amalgams could be prepared and studied in an oxygen-free environment before being exposed to oxygen under controlled conditions. The apparatus was able to maintain a pressure of less than 1. 3 x 0. 000001 N/sqm (10 to the minus 8 th power torr) of gases and vapors other than mercury and less than 1. 3 x 10 to the minus 8 th N/sq m (10 to the minus 10 th power torr) partial pressure of oxygen; also, it provided for mechanical sweeping of the liquid metal surfaces in the vacuum environment. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> pure mercury and of dilute amalgams of tin (52 ppm), sodium (229 ppm), and lithium (165 ppm) were determined at temperature between 25 and 55 C {{both before and after}} 70 minute exposures to an approximately 270 N/sq m (2 torr) pressure <b>of</b> oxygen. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> the pure mercury and the amalgams as first prepared were similar but the rates for the amalgams were reduced by at least 80 % at 25 C {{as a result of the}} exposure to oxygen.

40|$|Measurements <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> {{water through}} thin films {{have been made}} by Rideal(1) and Langmuir(2). To find the effect of the film alone, the usual method adopted is to measure the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from a pure water surface and then to compare this with the rate from film covered surface. In Rideal's {{experiments}} one arm A of a U shaped vessel contained the water to be evaporated. This could be maintained at a constant temperature by means of a thermostat. The other arm B was kept at 0 ° C. so that after the vessel had been exhausted of air, water from the arm A distilled into the arm B. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> was determined by weighing the cold arm. The experimental <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> found in this way may be compared with the theoretical rate deduced from the kinetic theory of gases. … Rideal found that the experimental <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> was only about 0. 4 % of that predicted by the kinetic theory and that the presence of a thin film of fatty acid on the water surface reduced the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> still further. His experimental arrangements were however by no means ideal and the film resistance deduced therefrom is very unreliable. This will be clear at once when it is noted that he assumed that the pressure above the liquid surface was equal to the saturated vapour pressure at the temperature of the cold arm. Since the pressure above the evaporating surface must be greater than that in the cold arm to which the vapour is flowing, the assumption leads to a value of m which is too large. Rideal takes the temperature of the water surface as being equal to the temperature of the thermostat. Since for rapid <b>evaporation</b> the temperature <b>of</b> the water surface must fall considerably below that of the thermostat this also leads to a value of m which is too large. For the reasons given above it is clear that Rideal’s method is not suitable for the measurement of film resistance and the present work is an attempt to obtain a method which will be more reliable.
