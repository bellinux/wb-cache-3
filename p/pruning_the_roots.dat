This research was conducted in the forest nursery Muchów (Jawor Forest District, regional directorate of State Forests in Wrocław) and two different pruning treatments (no pruning and at 12 cm depth) and nitrogen fertilization doses (25 and 50 kg×ha− 1) were applied.

No statistically significant impact by the nitrogen fertilization doses on seedling height could be observed (p = 0. 125).

How it does this {{is to have the}} pots designed so as to air <b>prune</b> <b>the</b> roots.The advantage is when the plant is planted into its home environment it has a stronger root base to start with. When polythene bags are used instead, this root tends to go through the bag into the ground and is then broken off when the tree is moved for planting. <b>The</b> other <b>roots</b> are insufficiently developed to cope with the shock caused by this and so the tree's chances of survival are reduced. <b>The</b> <b>root</b> trainer is mounted in a stand above ground so that, when <b>the</b> tap <b>root</b> emerges, it is dried by the air.

30|$|We can now nest {{the lower}} bound into the {{subgraph}} mining steps in gSpan to efficiently <b>prune</b> <b>the</b> DFS code tree. During the depth-first search through the DFS code tree, we always maintain the currently top-k best subgraph patterns according to gSide and the temporally suboptimal gSide value (denoted by θ) {{among all the}} gSide values calculated before. If q̂(g_i)>θ, the gSide value of any supergraph g_j of g_i should be no less than q̂(g_i) according to Theorem  1, i.e., q(g_j)>q̂(g_i)>θ. Thus, we can safely <b>prune</b> <b>the</b> subtree <b>rooted</b> from g_i in the search space. If q̂(g_i)<θ, we cannot prune this subtree since there might exist a supergraph g_j of g_i such that q(g_j)<θ. As long as a subgraph g_i can improve the gSide values of any subgraphs in T, it is added into T and the least best subgraph is removed from T. Then we recursively search for the next subgraph in the DFS code tree. The branch-and-bound algorithm gMSV is summarized in Algorithm  1.|$|R

40|$|The role of {{endogenous}} inhibitors {{and growth}} substances {{in the regulation}} of bud dormancy of wood plants was investigated using mature trees, seedlings, isolated shoots, and aseptically cultured buds and shoots. The photoperiodic induction of dormancy was not mediated through changes in inhibitor β activity, or ABA levels of buds and leaves of Alnus viridis seedlings. Changes in {{the activity of the}} inhibitor β fraction of buds and leaves of field grown Alnus glutinosa occurred during autumn but were not correlated with the onset of dormancy. Exogenous applications of 10 - 4 M ABA, 10 - 3 M CCC, ABA + CCC, 10 - 3 M C 5, 10 - 3 M C 9 and 10 - 3 M C 10 to actively growing Alnus viridis seedlings did not result in the formation of dormant buds. Dormancy was not induced by <b>pruning</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> system of actively growing alder seedlings or by the treatment of isolated growing shoots with 10 - 4 M ABA. ABA prolonged the dormancy of apparently dormant buds after their transfer to an environment favouring growth, but this effect was modified by species, time of year, presence and absence of leaves, and position of the bud on the stem. C 8 and C 9 prolonged the dormancy of Populus nigra Italica while C 10 promoted bud burst in Salix alba/babylonica. CCC was ineffective in most species tested (Alnus, Populus and Salix) except when in combination with ABA. The use of aseptic shoots of Populus yunnanensis cultured in vitro as a bioassay for dormancy-inducing substances was found to be limited by the variable growth responses elicited. No dormancy-inducing substances were detected in extracts, including the inhibitor β fraction, of dormant buds or leaves or shoots. The presence of various concentrations of ABA, C 5, C 10, AMO 1618 and ABA + AMO 1618 in the medium did not cause the formation of dormant shoot morphology, although growth was inhibited by certain treatments.

Results on frequent pruning of Bougainvillea glabra plants gave the highest quantum yield, chlorophyll a and b, and maximum flower initiation per plant {{compared to those}} of non-pruning plants. Though the sugar content in pruned plants decreased, {{probably due to the}} prolonged vegetative phase, flowering process continues and developed new flower shoots.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new technique to solve exactly a discrete optimization problem, based on the paradigm of “negative ” thinking. The motivation is that when searching the space of solutions, often a good solution is reached quickly and then improved {{only a few times}} before the optimum is found: hence most of the solution space is explored to certify optimality, but it does not yield any improvement of the cost function. So it is quite natural for an algorithm to be “skeptical ” about the chance to improve the current best solution. For illustration we have applied our approach to the unate covering problem. We designed a procedure, raiser, implementing a negative thinking search, which is incorporated into a common branch-and-bound procedure. Raiser is invoked at a node of the search tree which is deep enough to justify negative thinking. Raiser tries to detect a hard core of the matrix corresponding to the node by augmenting an independent set of rows in order to increase incrementally the cost of the minimum solutions covering the matrix. Eventually either raiser <b>prunes</b> <b>the</b> subtree <b>rooted</b> at <b>the</b> node (having found a lower bound equal or greater than the current best solution) or returns a new solution that becomes the current best one. Experiments show that our program, AURA, outperforms both ESPRESSO and our enhancement of ESPRESSO using Coudert’s limit lower bound [3]. It is always faster and in the most difficult examples either has a running time better by up to two orders of magnitude, or the other programs fail to finish due to timeout or spaceout. The package SCHERZO is faster on some examples and loses on others, due to a less powerful <b>pruning</b> strategy of <b>the</b> search space, partially mitigated by a more effective computation of the maximal independent set. ...|$|R

40|$|Forward pruning, or {{selectively}} searching {{a subset}} of moves, is now commonly used in game-playing programs {{to reduce the number}} of nodes searched with manageable risk.
