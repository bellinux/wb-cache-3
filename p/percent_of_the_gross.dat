5|$|The service {{industry}} {{is the largest}} economic contributor in South Dakota. This sector includes the retail, finance, and health care industries. Citibank, which was the largest bank holding company in the United States at one time, established national banking operations in South Dakota in 1981 {{to take advantage of}} favorable banking regulations. Government spending is another important segment of the state's economy, providing over ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> state product.

5|$|After {{appearing}} in André de Toth's Civil War drama Springfield Rifle (1952)—a standard Warner Bros. film that was {{overshadowed by the}} success of its predecessor—Cooper made four films outside the United States. In Mark Robson's drama Return to Paradise (1953), Cooper plays an American wanderer who liberates the inhabitants of a Polynesian island from the puritanical rule of a misguided pastor. Cooper endured spartan living conditions, long hours, and ill health during the three-month location shoot on the island of Upolu in Western Samoa. Despite its beautiful cinematography, the film received poor reviews. Cooper's next three films were shot in Mexico. In Hugo Fregonese's action adventure film Blowing Wild (1953) with Barbara Stanwyck, he plays a wildcatter in Mexico who gets involved with an oil company executive and his unscrupulous wife with whom he once had an affair. In 1954, Cooper appeared in Henry Hathaway's Western drama Garden of Evil with Susan Hayward, about three soldiers of fortune in Mexico hired to rescue a woman's husband. That same year, he appeared in Robert Aldrich's Western adventure Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster. In the film, Cooper plays an American adventurer hired by Emperor Maximilian I to escort a countess to Vera Cruz during the Mexican Rebellion of 1866. All of these films received poor reviews but did well at the box-office. For his work in Vera Cruz, Cooper earned $1.4 million in salary and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gross.</b>|$|E

Unemployment rose sharply, especially among the young, and by 1977 there were one million unemployed people under age 24. Inflation continued, aggravated by the increases {{in the price of}} oil in 1973 and 1979. The budget deficit became permanent and intractable, averaging about 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product (GDP), higher than any other industrial country.

Textile manufacturing, a rapidly growing proportion of which consists of synthetics, account for about 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> industrial output and continues to be important, but less so than before.

Bangkok alone accounts for 48.4 percent of Thailand's service sector, which in turn constitutes 49.0 percent of GDP. When the Bangkok Metropolitan Region is considered, manufacturing {{is the most significant}} contributor at 28.2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> regional product, reflecting the density of industry in the Bangkok's neighbouring provinces.

25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{trait of}} the Dutch economy {{emerging in the}} 18th century was the fiscal-financial complex. The historically large public debt, resulting from the Republic's participation in the European wars {{around the turn of}} the 18th century, was held by a small percentage of the Dutch population (there was hardly any external debt). This implied that the Dutch fiscal system now became yoked to the service of this debt in a way that served the interests of this small rentier class. No less than 70 percent of the annual revenue of the province of Holland (the main debtor) had to be dedicated to debt service. These revenues consisted mainly of regressive indirect taxes with the perverse effect that income was transferred from the poorer classes to the richer to the amount of 14 million guilders a year (approximately 7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gross</b> National Product at the time). This debt burden rested preponderantly on the tax payers from Holland, as the finances of the provinces were separated in the confederal system of the Republic, and this unequal debt burden militated against other provinces agreeing to fiscal reform. Fiscal reform was also opposed by the rentiers that had a vested interest in retaining their interest income, but not in paying (direct) income taxes to pay for the debt service.|$|E
