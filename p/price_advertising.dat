40|$|In this thesis, the {{production}} - marketing decisions in a duopolistic market are studied. The defined problem {{consists of two}} competitor firms {{and is based on}} their <b>pricing,</b> <b>advertising</b> and production decisions. Objectives of both firms are assumed to be profit maximization. The proposed solution procedure is based on a cyclic solution in which one of the firms solves its own problem at each step of the cycle. It is assumed that firms forecast their competitor's <b>pricing</b> and <b>advertising</b> decisions and use these data as an input for their own model. The termination condition of the cycle is defined as the equilibrium, where none of the firms changes its <b>pricing</b> and <b>advertising</b> policy significantly as a response to its competitor's decisions. The problem is formulated as a non-linear mixed integer programming (NLMIP) model and two solution methods are employed. First, a commercial package to solve NLMIP problems (GAMS ®) is used. Second, a genetic algorithm (GA) developed to solve the problem is employed. Both of these methods are employed at each step of the solution cycle. The problem is solved for different parametric conditions using both solution methods. Sixteen initial forecasts, combinations of low and high averages and standard deviations of <b>pricing</b> and <b>advertising</b> forecasts of the competitor, are analyzed. Under each of these forecast cases, 5 parameters, price elasticity, cross-price elasticity, advertising lagged effect weights, ratio coefficient for competitors advertising effect, and cross-moving demand are analyzed. The impacts of these parameters on the <b>pricing,</b> <b>advertising,</b> and production decisions of the firms under the sixteen initial forecasts produce similar results. In addition, the demand volumes and the profit values are investigated for these parameters. Price elasticity is observed as the parameter having the greatest impact on decisions, followed by cross-moving demand, advertising lagged effect weights, cross-price elasticity, and ratio coefficient for competitor advertising effect, respectively. Keeping the firm's cost structure constant, competitor's cost structure is changed so as to increase its production cost considerably compared to the previous experiments. Through a set of experiments, the impact of the change in the cost structure on the <b>pricing,</b> <b>advertising</b> and production decisions is investigated. A sensitivity analysis is applied to the logit demand function parameters over a wide range and the results are reported...|$|R

[...] Blackmun reasoned that this case concerned not only commercial regulation, but the free flow of information. This case was just as much about the consumers’ right to receive information as it was about the pharmacists’ right to provide it, and that the right to free speech is just as much about the “listener” as it is about the “speaker”.Blackmun further described how the court’s past precedent had whittled down the “commercial speech” exemption through past precedent; for example, Bigelow v. Virginia, , in which the Court struck down a Virginia statute prohibiting the advertisement of out-of-state abortion procedures.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{consumer}} search {{model in which}} firms sell products with two product attributes that are horizontally differentiated. One attribute is observable without visiting the firm, while the other can only be discovered upon visiting the store.

Moreover, firms can influence the order of search by adjusting prices and/or by providing match-value information. We show that <b>price</b> <b>advertising</b> leads to lower prices and profits. With <b>price</b> <b>advertising,</b> a lower price not only retains more consumers, but is also more likely to attract them. Second, we how that with <b>price</b> <b>advertising</b> equilibrium prices and profits decrease in search costs.

40|$|The {{quality of}} many {{consumer}} nondurable goods or services is sufficiently complex or obscure that consumers cannot completely verify the true quality in a single usage.

The model of competition does not yield explicit closed-form expressions for the dynamic <b>price</b> and <b>advertising</b> paths of the two firms.

This paper uses a unique new data set of UK company advertising to answer these questions. The evidence presented suggests that only a small proportion of firms include price information in any of their advertisements. Price information tends to be included in a higher percentage of the advertisements of distribution companies and of those which face more than ten competitors. In addition, the importance of price as a form of competition is a factor in determining the inclusion of price information, but only where the firm aims most of its advertisements towards final consumers.

40|$|We study a model where {{retailers}} endogenously {{engage in}} both brand advertising to attract loyal customers {{as well as}} informational advertising, which consists of deciding whether and what price to list on a price comparison site.

Price levels are also predicted to depend systematically on firms ’ branding activities. These predictions are consistent with online data from a leading price comparison site. An important by-product of endogenizing both brand and <b>price</b> <b>advertising</b> is the asymmetric impact of changes in advertising costs on firm profits. A reduction in the cost of <b>price</b> <b>advertising</b> reduces equilibrium profits whereas a reduction in the cost of brand advertising has no effect on equilibrium profits.
