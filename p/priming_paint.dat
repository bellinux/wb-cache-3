[...] After painting but before clear coating, the part {{is ready to be}} processed. A polyvinyl alcohol hydrographic film, which has been gravure-printed with the graphic image to be transferred, is carefully placed on the water's surface in the dipping tank. The clear film is water-soluble, and dissolves after applying an activator solution. Once dipping is begun, the surface tension of the water will allow the pattern to curve around any shape. Any remaining residue is then rinsed off thoroughly. The ink has already adhered and will not wash off. It is then allowed to dry.|$|R

5000|$|The wooden {{surface was}} {{sometimes}} <b>primed</b> for <b>painting</b> {{with a layer}} of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.Two painting techniques were employed: encaustic (wax) painting and egg-based tempera. The encaustic images are striking because of the contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an [...] "Impressionistic" [...] effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance. In some cases, gold leaf was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} restoration {{includes not}} only repair of the parts {{that can be seen}} - the body, trim, chrome, wheels, and the passenger compartment - but also the components that are not necessarily visible or otherwise evident, including the engine and engine compartment, trunk, frame, driveline, and all ancillary parts like the brakes, accessories, engine cooling system, electrical system, etc. Repairs are made to correct obvious problems, as well as for cosmetic reasons. For example, even if a wheel is covered by a full hubcap and not seen, and is structurally sound, it should have the tire unmounted and any required repairs performed such as rust removal, straightening, <b>priming,</b> and <b>painting.</b>|$|R

[...] "The presentation by the <b>Prime</b> Minister <b>painted</b> the Bill in {{a very positive light}} and we voiced our support," [...] Mataca said.

50|$|The {{fabrication}} process for precast concrete sandwich wall panels {{allows them to}} be produced with finished surfaces on both sides. Such finishes can be very smooth, with the surfaces painted, stained, or left natural; for interior surfaces, the finish is comparable to drywall in smoothness and can be finished using the same <b>prime</b> and <b>paint</b> procedure as is common for conventional drywall construction. If desired, the concrete can be given an architectural finish, where the concrete itself is colored and/or textured. Colors and textures can provide the appearance of brick, stone, wood, or other patterns {{through the use of}} reusable formliners, or, in the most sophisticated applications, actual brick, stone, glass, or other materials can be cast into the concrete surface.|$|R

5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already <b>primed</b> and <b>painted</b> bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|R
50|$|Due to acrylic paint's more {{flexible}} nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist {{does not have}} to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 15-20 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry. Although canvas needs to be properly <b>primed</b> before <b>painting</b> with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of wet-in-wet technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the absence}} of {{adhesion}} failure, paint on wood exposed outdoors gradually erodes. Degradation of paint by erosion may take a decade or more, depending {{on the degree of}} exposure to sunlight and moisture and the thickness and type of paint. While a paint system is eroding, it still protects the wood surface from degradation. Until this erosion process proceeds {{to the point where the}} primer begins to show, the paint surface can be renewed readily with an additional topcoat. With timely refinishing, painted wood can last for centuries (Feist & Hon 1984). If, however, the paint [...] wood interphase fails, the paint film will debond within a short time and the paint will blister, crack, and peel. This failure can result in damage to the wood surface and more difficult and costly refinishing. One cause of interphase failure is a degraded wood surface caused by weathering prior to initial <b>priming</b> with <b>paint</b> (Arnold et al. 1992, Boxall 1977, Bravery & Miller 1980, Desai 1967, Evan...|$|R

40|$|The project goal is {{to develop}} an {{advanced}} coal beneficiation technology that can achieve high recovery of the parent coal`s calorific value, while maximizing pyritic sulfur removal. Coal cleaning is to be accomplished by physical means incorporating an advanced gravimetric process. Evaluation of different media types and their attendant systems for recovery, concentration and regeneration is to be completed. Phase I, media evaluation, now completed, involved a paper study {{and a number of}} laboratory tests to eliminate all but the best media options. Phase II, media testing, involved detailed testing of the more promising media and separators in a closed-loop pilot facility. In the final phase, phase III, the optimum medium, separator, and medium recovery system(s) will be tested with commercial-size equipment.

5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to a week-long plaster application, an entire house can be drywalled {{in one or two}} days by two experienced drywallers, and drywall is easy enough to use that it can be installed by many amateur home carpenters. In large-scale commercial construction, the work of installing and finishing drywall is often split between the drywall mechanics, or hangers, who install the wallboard, and the tapers and mudmen, or float crew, who finish the joints and cover the fastener heads with drywall compound. Dry wall can be finished anywhere from a level 0 to a level 5, where 0 is not finished in any fashion and 5 is the most [...] "pristine". Depending on how significant the finish is to the customer the extra steps in the finish {{may or may not be}} necessary, though <b>priming</b> and <b>painting</b> of drywall is recommended in any location where it may be exposed to any wear.|$|R
30|$|From {{the fifteenth}} century on, small glass {{particles}} were used as additives to paint layers [2 – 5] and as decorative materials in wall paintings and plaster [6 – 8]. Powdered glass particles were found in <b>priming</b> and <b>paint</b> layers of several European paintings from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century [3, 9]. A lead glass sample from a late fifteenth century German altarpiece also contained copper as colouring agent [3]. In the sixteenth century glass was added mainly for technical purposes such as siccatives and grounding. Laboratory testing carried out with modern ingredients indicated that the glass content was due to a better texture and colour depth of the tested red lakes [3]. A similar approach can be assumed for glass flakes used in plaster decorations. Glass flakes from 1722 in the Sala Terrena of Weissenstein Castle at Pommersfelden, Bavaria, {{were found to be}} lead glass with copper and iron as colouring elements [10]. Glass flakes on stucco work from 1714 in the former Grotto Hall in the Zwinger of Dresden (now Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon), Germany, were mainly made of lead glass as well besides some examples being soda-lime glass [11].|$|R

30|$|PCA {{analysis}} of the selected ion monitoring chromatograms of the proteinaceous materials showed the presence of egg in practically all layers of bright fragments and in the bottom layers of the dark fragments. According to literature, a mixture of drying oil, egg and resins was often used for <b>priming</b> in polychromic <b>paints</b> on stone in Italy. Since Beklemishev made ‘Fugitive Slave’ during his time there, {{it is possible that}} he used these materials. However, looking at the middle layers of the dark fragments, evidence for casein as proteinaceous ingredient was also found. Since the layers where casein was found are thicker, the presence of casein indicates that a casein-oil mixture was possibly applied as binding to get more pasty paint films. This way one may conclude that different binding materials were used for different layers.|$|R
