25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, <b>pterygium,</b> pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E

2500|$|Clapton's {{mother was}} a nurse who {{died when he was}} ten; his father was a doctor who died in 1999. Clapton has <b>pterygiums</b> and his eye surgeon {{recommended}} he wear dark glasses. Clapton met Susie, a fashion model, in the mid-1980s. They married and had twin daughters, Saskia and Montana. In March 2008 he appeared on ABC-TV's Talking Heads where he told Peter Thompson about his early life. He described the impact of his mother's erratic lifestyle prior to her suicide when he was ten; he then met his father {{for the first time and}} was enrolled in a private boarding school: [...] "My mother was sort of the antithesis of my father, because she had always aspired to... more the Bohemian artistic side of life" [...] and [...] "it was a bit of a shock when my father came to collect me... we just never got on. It was a fiery clash from the very start. My father obviously wanted me to become a doctor or some similar sort of career".|$|R
2500|$|The eye is most {{sensitive}} to damage by UV {{in the lower}} UVC band at 265–275nm. Radiation of this wavelength is almost absent from sunlight but is found in welder's arc lights and other artificial sources. Exposure to these can cause [...] "welder's flash" [...] or [...] "arc eye" [...] (photokeratitis) {{and can lead to}} cataracts, <b>pterygium</b> and pinguecula formation. To a lesser extent, UVB in sunlight from 310–280nm also causes photokeratitis ("snow blindness"), and the cornea, the lens, and the retina can be damaged.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery was {{important}} in treating patients with eye complications, such as trachoma and cataracts. [...] A common complication of trachoma patients is the vascularization of the tissue that invades the cornea of the eye, which {{was thought to be}} the cause of the disease, by ancient Islamic physicians. The technique used to correct this complication was done surgically and known today as peritomy. This procedure was done by [...] "employing an instrument for keeping the eye open during surgery, a number of very small hooks for lifting, and a very thin scalpel for excision." [...] A similar technique in treating complications of trachoma, called <b>pterygium,</b> was used to remove the triangular-shaped part of the bulbar conjunctiva onto the cornea. This was done by lifting the growth with small hooks and then cut with a small lancet. Both of these surgical techniques were extremely painful for the patient and intricate for the physician or his assistants to perform.|$|E

Sometimes a line of iron deposition can be seen adjacent to the head of the <b>pterygium</b> called Stocker's line. The location of the line can give an indication of the pattern of growth.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to show the frequency, sex and age {{distribution}} of eyelids skin tumor changes and degenerative changes of the conjunctiva for the period of three years (2011 – 2013) at the Department of Ophthalmology in Split. We analyzed the eyelids skin lesions in biopsy material at the Department of Pathology and the same were compared with the profession of the patients. In this period there were found 131 tumor changes of the eyelids. The most common tumor was the basal cell carcinoma (118) with the higher frequency in women. There were 10 squamous cell carcinomas with the equal representation among sexes and three melanomas. There were 79 female and 52 male patients. There were 299 <b>pterygiums</b> operated with the higher frequency in women (68. 2 %). Exposure to UV radiation, particulary UVB radiation is the most common causative factor for genetic abnormalities in cells and provoked factor in oncogenesis of skin tumors. In our research we found a correlation between changes in the eyelids and conjunctiva caused by UV radiation with the professional interest of the respondents. Due to high incidence of eyelids skin tumor changes in the population professionally exposed to UV radiation, medical professionals should be aware of the importance of the public education on the etiology of these tumors and the importance of the UV protection...|$|R

Materials and methods: Twenty-eight benign essential blepharospasm patients who were administered unilateral Botox A prior to ocular surgery between January 2004 and May 2011 were included in this study. Eleven cases had <b>pterygiums,</b> ten had cataracts, and four had glaucomas, while the remaining three had aphakia. All cases&rsquo; severity of spasm (stage 0 &ndash; 4) and eyelid closing forces (stage 1 &ndash; 4) were evaluated according to the Jankovic scale prior to the injection, at 3 days, 14 days, 1 month, and 3 months after Botox A injection. Results: Of the patients enrolled in the study, 16 were female and 12 were male, with an average age of 55. 52 &plusmn; 1. 53 years (52 &ndash; 65). Average onset of the Botox injection&# 39;s effect was 2. 8 &plusmn; 0. 9 (2 &ndash; 5) days. Its effect lingered for about 11. 5 &plusmn; 3. 6 (8 &ndash; 22) weeks. The severity of spasm and eyelid closing forces of all the patients enrolled were compared prior to the injection at 3 and 14 days and the first and third months after the injection. There were statistically significant differences between prior to the injection and 3 days (P = 0. 001), 14 days (P &lt; 0. 001) and 1 month after the injection (P &lt; 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference between prior to the injection and 3 months after the injection (P = 0. 513). Fourteen days following the injection, the surgeries were successfully performed. Conclusion: Botox A administered prior to ocular surgery will control both blepharospasm and lower the risks that can be encountered before and during surgery, thus increasing the comfort of the patient and the surgeon.

50|$|As the <b>pterygium</b> grows, it {{replaces the}} corneal epithelium, and erodes the {{superficial}} layers beneath it. These layers are Bowman's membrane, and the anterior corneal stromal lamellae. The <b>pterygium</b> pulls and distorts the cornea as it enlarges.|$|E
5000|$|Surgery {{is usually}} {{performed}} under local anaesthetic with light sedation as day surgery. The <b>pterygium</b> is stripped carefully {{off the surface}} of the eye. If this is all that is done, the <b>pterygium</b> regrows frequently. The technique with the lowest recurrence rate uses an auto graft of conjunctiva from under the eyelid. This is placed over the defect remaining from the removed <b>pterygium.</b> The graft can be stitched in place, which is time consuming, and painful for the patient afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Van der Woude {{syndrome}} (VDWS) and popliteal <b>pterygium</b> syndrome (PPS) are allelic {{variants of}} the same condition; that is, they are caused by different mutations {{of the same}} gene.

50|$|Some {{research}} also suggests a genetic predisposition {{due to an}} expression of vimentin, which indicates cellular migration by the keratoblasts embryological development, which are the cells {{that give rise to}} the layers of the cornea. Supporting this fact is the congenital <b>pterygium,</b> in which <b>pterygium</b> is seen in infants. These cells also exhibit an increased P53 expression likely due to a deficit in the tumor suppressor gene. These indications give the impression of a migrating limbus because the cellular origin of the <b>pterygium</b> is actually initiated by the limbal epithelium.|$|E
