40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many {{regional}} and country-wide <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> for Johne's disease (JD) were developed due to associated economic losses, {{or because of}} a possible association with Crohn's disease. These <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> were often not successful, partly because management protocols were not followed, including the introduction of infected replacement cattle, because tests to identify infected animals were unreliable, and uptake by farmers was not high enough because of a perceived low return on investment. In {{the absence of a}} cure or effective commercial vaccines, control of JD is currently primarily based on herd management strategies to avoid infection of cattle and restrict within-farm and farm-to-farm transmission. Although JD <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> have been implemented in most developed countries, lessons learned from JD prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are underreported.

Drawing on these theories, a brief planning intervention was designed and its effectiveness compared to an information-based health promotion <b>programme</b> (<b>control)</b> All participants were given information about the safe limits per dnnking occasion and the adverse consequences of binge dnnking, {{and were asked to}} dnnk within the safe limits in order to avoid these consequences. In addition, participants in the planning intervention group received an option menu of possible responses for refusing a dnnk, asked to choose one strategy and specify a time and place in which the chosen strategy would be implemented. The planning intervention group did not differ from the control group on reported likelihood of future binge drinking, nor on levels of past drinking, age and gender At a 2 -week follow-up, members of the planning intervention group reported lower drinking frequency than controls The implications of pnor planning for interventions aimed at reducing alcohol-related harm are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} multi-stage {{scheduling and}} routing problem with alternative machines at each supply chain (SC) stage and non-preemptive operations is studied. The peculiarity of the considered {{problem is the}} consideration of both continuous flows in operations and discrete assignments. Such problems are typical in the process industry. Taking into account the basic aspects that pertain to this case, a dynamic decomposition of the problem {{on the basis of}} optimal <b>programme</b> <b>control</b> is proposed. A particular feature and novelty of the presented study is the consideration of non-preemptive operations and their execution dynamics. The solution is based on a combined application of discrete and continuous optimization. With the special properties of the proposed scheduling model, it becomes possible to develop an optimal solution to the integrated scheduling and routing of jobs. Since the schedule generation is formulated in control terms, the models of scheduling and adaptation can be integrated. From the practical point of view, such integration can be advantageous subject to further dynamic analysis of the robustness, stability, and adaptability of SC schedules...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the work of}} the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in West Africa, a programme which over a 22 year history has reduced the public health problems of blinding onchocerciasis in eleven countries of West Africa through vector control and, more recently, ivermectin distribution. The paper emphasizes the different approaches to control the programme has developed in the different parts of the programme area which have been determined by the epidemiology of the disease (savanna/forest form), the migratory characteristics of the vectors, intensity of the disease before commencement of treatment, the combined impact of vector control and ivermectin and the likelihood of infiltration of infective blackflies from outside the programme area. The programme has constantly monitored the impact of operations on the trends in prevalence, incidence, annual transmission potential, ocular morbidity and species of fly populations, and as a result, has identified areas where special interventions are required until the programme comes to an end in 2002.

The study included 75 young footballers from Football School “Kragujevac,” who were followed during the two-month training programme. The subjects were divided into the following groups: 1) control group (consumed a standard diet); 2) group that consumed fish oil (2500 mg of n- 3 PUFAs per day); 3) group that consumed nutritional sunflower oil (2500 mg of n- 6 PUFAs daily). The maximal progressive exercise test was performed using a treadmill belt.

Moreover, ways and means of innovatively supplying in the need for future scholars in engineering and science is crucial for the economic stability of South Africa. This dissertation examines a model for the effective management of a Mathematics Advancement Programme, utilising engineering management technology, for a community engagement project to innovatively create future engineering scholars for tertiary education institutions. Application of project management and control systems theory, while including some leadership concepts, is made in the operational structure of a Maths Advancement <b>Programme.</b> <b>Control</b> systems theory has been applied to project management {{in order to create a}} sustainable method of monitoring feedback in a triangulation sampling system.

40|$|Background: The health sector {{reform in}} Colombia {{had a deep}} effect on public health programmes. Changes on organizative {{structure}} and intervention activities for Tuberculosis control (TBC), {{have been caused by}} the emergence of new actors involved in health services delivery; design of new health plans; responsibilities diversification and their vagueness; and system decentralisation. Objective: Known perceptions of key actors of TBC control about effects generated by Colombian Health Sector Reform implementation. Methods: A qualitative case study was carried out. Information was obtained through semi-structured interviews. In total, 15 key health officials responsable for tuberculosis control at national, state and local level were interviewed. Results: The most relevant negative effects of the implementation of Health Sector Reform on TBC control programme were: lack of political will; corruption in resources management; poor managerial and technical skills; deficiency in government supervision activities at local level; inadequacy of the government fulfilment of its administrative and financial obligations. Diversification of financial resources was pointed out as a facilitating factor, because of the increased allocation of resources for <b>programme</b> <b>control.</b> Discussion: A perceived reduction of the regulative and control role of the government in the operation of the Health System and on the TBC was the main finding of the study. Introduction of new actors on health services delivery and the increased resource allocation to TBC control did not produce the expected positive effects, and quantity and quality of tuberculosis actions were reduced...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTranscription {{factors have}} long been {{recognised}} as powerful regulators of mammalian development yet it is largely unknown how individual key regulators operate within wider regulatory networks. Here {{we have used a}} combination of global gene expression and chromatin-immunoprecipitation approaches during the early stages of haematopoietic development to define the transcriptional <b>programme</b> <b>controlled</b> by Runx 1, an essential regulator of blood cell specification. Integrated analysis of these complementary genome-wide datasets allowed us to construct a global regulatory network model, which suggested that key regulators are activated sequentially during blood specification, but will ultimately collaborate to control many haematopoietically expressed genes. Using the CD 41 /integrin alpha 2 b gene as a model, cellular and in vivo studies showed that CD 41 is controlled by both Scl/Tal 1 and Runx 1 in fully specified blood cells, and initiation of CD 41 expression in E 7. 5 embryos is severely compromised in the absence of Runx 1. Taken together, this study represents the first global analysis of the transcriptional <b>programme</b> <b>controlled</b> by any key haematopoietic regulator during the process of early blood cell specification. Moreover, the concept of interplay between sequentially deployed core regulators is likely to represent a design principle widely applicable to the transcriptional control of mammalian development...|$|R

The project aims to support media competence which goes far beyond the pupils ’ familiar use of a machine that computes. The media education approach in the school scenario described in the paper, intends to mediate an understanding of the programmable algorithmic machine in an aesthetic shaping context. The pupils of the Laboratory School of Art and Media Education (Kunst- und Medienpädagogische Laborschule) at the UNESCO-Project School in Flensburg, Germany, an elementary and lower secondary school, work together with art students of initial teacher training at the university. The 6 th graders involved in the model scenario develop, transform, <b>programme,</b> <b>control</b> and present digital and other media in an integrated way. They participate in complex shaping processes, developing interactive objects which behave in an overall environment for play. The school scenario described in the paper is one example of the school projects initiated in the framework of the research project. It was realised at lower secondary school.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} {{the effect of}} a short, individualized exercise programme on balance dysfunction in the elderly. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized, controlled, multicentre trial. SETTING: Physical and recreational therapy departments from two rehabilitation centres. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four subjects of > 75 years with functional balance problems living independently or in a residential care facility. Seventy-seven subjects completed the intervention period and four-week follow-up. At a one-year follow-up 49 subjects were evaluated on balance functioning. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve sessions of an individualized balance training programme (experimental group) or 12 sessions of an individualized extra attention <b>programme</b> (<b>control</b> group) given in 4 - 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Berg Balance Scale and the Dynamic Gait Index to establish balance functioning, a visual analogue scale to establish fear of falling in daily life and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale to verify feelings of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Subjects in the experimental group improved significantly more on the Berg Balance Scale and the Dynamic Gait Index than those in the control group (p f 0. 001, p f 0. 001, respectively). However the effect disappeared at a one-year follow-up on the Berg Balance Scale. No prognostic factors could be identified to determine who would benefit most from the individualized exercise programme. Results on the other response variables revealed no effect of the intervention. CONCLUSION: A short individualized exercise programme can improve functional balance in people aged 75 years and older.
