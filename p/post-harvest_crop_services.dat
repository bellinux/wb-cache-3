40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. porri, {{the causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} blight of leek, is a current threat for leek (Allium porrum) {{production in the}} Netherlands. The roles of <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> waste and plant invasion from soil in leek plant infection was investigated with the purpose to gain better understanding on the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen. In a survey done over 167 leek fields, P. syringae pv. porri was present in 101 fields. About a tenfold higher P. syringae pv. porri average infection rate was recorded in leek plants from fields where <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> waste was returned than in those from fields where no waste was returned. P. syringae pv. porri could survive for at least 1 month in shredded plant material made from infected plants (mimicking crop waste in practice). Field experiments done over three successive years revealed that leek plants that were treated with crop waste at the nursery and production growth stages consistently showed higher infection rates than plants that remained untreated. Plants that were treated with crop waste only at one of both stages revealed intermediate infection rates. In a plant-soil microcosm study, it appeared that P. syringae pv. porri strain P 55 R colony numbers in the leek rhizosphere were approximately 4 orders in magnitude higher than in corresponding bulk soils. P. syringae pv. porri was shown to colonize leek roots and cells of the pathogen were also present in the leaves. It was concluded that <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> waste {{play an important role}} in the epidemiology of P. syringae pv. porri in leek production. The following route for primary infection of leek plants is proposed, from crop plant residues via soil to leek roots and plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{delivery}} of food security via continued crop yield improvement {{alone is not}} an effective food security strategy, and must be supported by pre- and post-border biosecurity policies to guard against perverse outcomes.

This paper focuses on the role that biosecurity is set to play in future food security by preventing both pre- and post-harvest losses, thereby protecting crop yield. We model biosecurity as a food security technology that may complement conventional yield improvement policies if the gains in global farm profits are sufficient to offset the costs of implementation and maintenance.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a community reintegration outpatient (<b>CROP)</b> <b>service</b> for promoting well-being and 					community participation following spinal cord injury (SCI). 					Participants. Community-dwelling adults (N= 14) with traumatic and nontraumatic SCI. Interventions. The <b>CROP</b> <b>service</b> is a 12 -week (1 × week; 120 minutes) interprofessional closed therapeutic education service. Main Outcome Measure(s). Moorong Self-Efficacy Scale (MSES); Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA); Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS); Coping Inventory of Stressful Situations (CISS); World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF); semistructured qualitative interviews. Methods. Twenty-one participants were recruited from two subsequent <b>CROP</b> <b>services,</b> with only 14 persons completing all data assessments. 					Data were collected at baseline (week 0), at exit (week 12), and at a three-month follow-up. Semistructured interviews were conducted at exit. Results. Self-efficacy (MSES) and positive affect (PANAS) improved from baseline to exit (P<. 05), but the changes were not maintained at follow-up. Qualitative analysis identified four major themes related to therapeutic benefits: (1) role of self; (2) knowledge acquisition; (3) skill application; and (4) group processes. Conclusions.

40|$|The {{exponential}} utility, moment-generating function {{approach to}} stochastic efficiency {{is used to}} evaluate pest control technologies for cotton under normal, gamma, and beta distributed crop yields. Results suggest that early termination of cotton is more profitable than current practice but may not be preferred if risk aversion characterizes grower behavior. Research directions and policy implications are indicated. Insect pests {{are among the most}} serious problems facing agriculture worldwide. Combined pre- and <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> loss due to agricultural pests is estimated to be as much as 45 percent (Pimentel). In the U. S. alone, more than $ 3. 6 billion was spent on pesticides during 1981 (Eichers). Moreover, problems such as secondary pest outbreaks, resurgence, and particularly pest resistance to pesticides (see e. g., Flint and van den Bosch) may further increase pest control costs. It is not surprising that there is now considerable interest among researchers, growers, and policy makers in developing better pest management technology. Integrated pest management (IPM) technologies which emphasize a variety of cultural, biological, and chemical pest control inputs are currently being developed for many crops. As these new technologies become available, economists have methods to evaluate them and make recommendations concerning implementation (Osteen et al., McCarl). Economist...|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{softening}} {{of fruits}} during the ripening process leads to deterioration. This is of significant global importance as softening-mediated deterioration leads to huge postharvest losses. N-glycan processing enzymes {{are reported to}} play an important role during climacteric fruit softening: however, to date these enzymes have not been characterized in non-climacteric fruit. Two ripening-specific N-glycan processing enzymes, α-mannosidase (α-Man) and β-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase (β-Hex), have been identified and targeted to enhance the shelf life in non-climacteric fruits such as capsicum (Capsicum annuum). The purification, cloning, and functional characterization of α-Man and β-Hex from capsicum, which belong to glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families 38 and 20, respectively, are described here. α-Man and β-Hex are cell wall glycoproteins that are able to cleave terminal α-mannose and β-D-N-acetylglucosamine residues of N-glycans, respectively. α-Man and β-Hex transcripts as well as enzyme activity increase with the ripening and/or softening of capsicum. The function of α-Man and β-Hex in capsicum softening is investigated through RNA interference (RNAi) in fruits. α-Man and β-Hex RNAi fruits were approximately two times firmer compared with the control and fruit deterioration was delayed by approximately 7 d. It is shown that silencing of α-Man and β-Hex enhances fruit shelf life due to the reduced degradation of N-glycoproteins which resulted in delayed softening. Altogether, the results provide evidence for the involvement of N-glycan processing in non-climacteric fruit softening. In conclusion, genetic engineering of N-glycan processing can be a common strategy in both climacteric and non-climacteric species to reduce the <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> losses...|$|R

40|$|Diamondback moth or DBM is {{the major}} pest of Brassica {{vegetable}} production worldwide. Control has relied on insecticides, and DBM resistance to these compounds has evolved rapidly. We review and summarize data on DBM population dynamics across a large latitudinal gradient from southwest to northeast China: DBM is, on average, more common in southern locations than in northern locations. The species 2 ̆ 7 phenology is consistent: in southern and central locations there is a decline during hot summer months, while in the north, the species can only exist in the summer following migrations from the south. A cohort-based discrete-time model, driven by daily maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall, which was built using the DYMEX modelling software, captures the age-structured population dynamics of DBM at representative locations, with year round cropping and threshold-based insecticide applications. The scale of the simulated pest problem varies with cropping practices. Local production breaks and strict <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> hygiene are associated with lower DBM populations. Biological control appears to improve the management of DBM. Of the management strategies explored, non-threshold based applications of insecticides with reduced spray efficacy (due to poor application or resistance) appear the least effective. The model simulates the phenology and abundance patterns in the population dynamics across the climatic gradient in China reasonably well. With planned improvements, and backed by a system of field sampling and weather inputs, it should serve well as a platform for a local pest forecast system, spanning the range of DBM in China, and perhaps elsewhere...|$|R
