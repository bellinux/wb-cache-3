The hollow columnar-grained aero engine Vane casting, being discussed in this paper, suffers further from extraneous defects such as inclusions, core shift and resultant dimensional deviations.

Microscopic examination carried out on the cross section of the blades revealed that the cracks were extended from the cooling passage up to the surface. Fractographic study showed that there was multiple fatigue crack initiation on the inner surface. After initiation, these cracks propagated progressively across the thickness and joined together to form a major crack. The reason for fatigue crack initiation could not be established...|$|E
40|$|A cracked {{engine mount}} of an {{aircraft}} {{was sent to}} the laboratory to analyze the cause of failure. Dye <b>penetrant</b> <b>test</b> indicated a crack at one of the weld joints. Investigation revealed this crack to be a fatigue crack. The fatigue crack had initiated at the weld – parent metal interface and propagated circumferentially about 12 mm. Microstructural study showed martensitic structure in the heat affected zone (HAZ). This was further corroborated by high hardness in this region. A section of the tube close to the HAZ was found to have low hardness (170 - 210 HV). This indicates improper heat treatment of the weld joint. It appears most probable that the abnormal microstructure in the HAZ and the low hardness of the tube adjacent to HAZ were responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. As per the specification, the tube should have hardness of about 270 HV...|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} {{inspection system}} based on eddy current testing (ET) techniques has been developed to inspect turbine wheel blades on the APU used in NASA's Space Transportation system. The APU is a hydrazine-powered gas turbine with a 15 -cm diameter Rene 41 turbine wheel, which has 123 first-stage blades and 123 second-stage blades. The flaw detection capability of the ET system is verified through comparison with fluorescent <b>penetrant</b> <b>test</b> results. Results of the comparison indicate that ET is capable of inspecting surfaces with very restrictive geometries. The ET capability requires development of probes with extremely small coils to allow inspection within 0. 4 mm of the blade root and the {{leading and trailing edges}} of the blade and within a height restriction of less than 1 mm. The color 2 D presentation of the ET data provided crack-growth pattern and length information similar to those found with visual techniques.

40|$|Among layer {{manufacturing}} techniques, Laser Consolidation (LC) {{finds its}} ideal application {{in the production}} of thin-walled metal parts for industrial niches characterised by high innovation and product complexity. To fully exploit the technological potential, developments must be made to assess LC’s repeatability and reliability. Previous studies proved that high strength parts of fine microstructure are obtained if appropriate build strategies are used. The aim of this research is to analyse a racecar exhaust collector, built in Inconel by LC, relating the failure modes and microstructure to the construction plan. The exhaust collector component was built using a custom strategy and was run on a dynamometer before failing after approximately 1200 km. An investigation of the failure mechanism was carried out by a primary macroscopic analysis, aided by an X-ray control and dye <b>penetrant</b> <b>test.</b> Metallographic sections were then sampled from the critical areas to study the microstructure and relate it to the manufacturing process. Results proved that the distribution of primary microcracks associated with internal residual stresses caused by the build strategy and aggravated by differential shrinkage during the test thermocycles was responsible for ultimate failure. This issue was a result of build strategy and the non-coaxial laser head, therefore, alternative pathways could be developed capable of removing most, if not all, of the contributory factors. The analysed case suggests that LC build strategy selection is as critical to ensure low cycle fatigue resistance as component design and confirms that LC is effective {{in the production of}} advanced technological parts with high geometrical complexity given the correct build strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the knowledge about non-destructive testing of adhesion of a coating to the steel substrate. Two technologies {{have been used for}} the deposition of the coating: the technology of conventional casting for the tin-base coating "Stanit" and the technology of thermal spray coating for the tin coating "Babbitt", copper-base coating CuSn 8 and for an NiAl interlayer. The above coating types have been compared using metallography, non-destructive ultrasonic and dye penetrant testing, X-ray diffraction, GD-OES depth profiling and energy-dispersive electron microanalysis. The following information has been collected that has to be sorted acording to the deposition technology used. For the evaluation of adhesion between the steel substrate and the coatings prepared by conventional casting, suitability of the ultrasound testing was proved, with the dye <b>penetrant</b> <b>test</b> as a supplementary method. Measurement parameters were defined for the ultrasonic testing. For te WAS technology (wire arc spraying), the non-destructive methods did not prove to be reasonably applicable in practice. The reason is that significant changes in the morphology of the structure occur in this technology. Layered structure with interfaces between the splatters of the coating, non-deformed particles and single layers of the coating results in a strong attenuation of the ultrasound waves. The coating exhibit a poor acoustic transmittion or no acoustic transmittion at all. results obtained by the non-destructive methods and other experimental methods used have been compared and a good agreement was found.
