5|$|The {{painting}} was commissioned in 1546 after Titian {{had made a}} number of portraits of Paul. He had already depicted Pier Luigi and three of his children – Vittoria, Alessandro and Ranuccio. Ottavio was perhaps again portrayed by him in 1552, and most likely commissioned the original Naples <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> Titian's Danaë series, although Lodovico Dolce believed it was Alessandro who had approached Titian.|$|E

5|$|Bianchi was {{transported to}} {{hospital}} with severe head injuries, and {{was moved to}} his native France in November. He remained there until his death more than nine months later on 17 July 2015, when he was mourned by the motor sport community. Bianchi's accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> which it was determined there was no single cause that prompted the crash. The victory allowed Hamilton to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points over Rosberg, who was 63 points in front of Daniel Ricciardo. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, and Williams remained ahead of Ferrari {{in the battle for}} third place with four races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 through 1994 {{the award}} was given {{out by a}} panel of science fiction experts led by Orson Scott Card. Beginning in 1995, the {{committee}} was replaced by a group of jurors, who vote on the nominations submitted for consideration. The initial jurors were James Gunn, Frederik Pohl, and Judith Merril. Merril was replaced on the jury by former winner Kij Johnson in 1997, one of Sturgeon's children—Noel Sturgeon in most years—was added to the <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> 1999, and George Zebrowski was added to the <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> 2005. Nominations are submitted by reviewers, fans, publishers, and editors, and are collated by the current Director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, Christopher McKitterick, into a list of finalists to be voted on by the jury. The maximum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Campbell Award. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. Since 2004 winners have received a personalized trophy, while since the inception of the award a permanent trophy has recorded all of the winners.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium's {{original}} scoreboard was a black, non-descript, rectangular {{unit with}} a two line reader <b>panel.</b> <b>In</b> 1985, it {{was moved to}} beside the left field foul pole {{to make room for}} a new rectangular 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard was not used to display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.|$|E

5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck <b>panel.</b> <b>In</b> that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{started on}} May 23 in Lethbridge {{and went on}} to the other Canadian cities of Saskatoon, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, London, Winnipeg, Calgary, Victoria, Vancouver, Kelowna, Edmonton, and Red Deer. London was added mid-tour because of popular demand. The London {{performances}} were hosted by Men Against Sexual Trafficking and the London Anti-Human Trafficking Committee. The final performances of the tour were conducted at the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer from October 2 to 6. After the Saturday matinée in each city, a panel discussion was held with both the audience and anyone else who wanted to attend, the purpose being to raise awareness about human trafficking in Canada and elsewhere. The final talkback <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> Red Deer was attended by about 70 people.|$|E

5|$|Van der Paele {{may have}} kept the <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> his private {{chambers}} or as a church altar. He donated it to the church either in 1436 or on his death in 1443; it remained there until the church was demolished in 1779. Most likely the work was situated in the nave as an accompaniment to an altar for Saints Peter and Paul and used for memorial masses for van der Paele and his family. It was installed on the main altar after the Iconoclasm of 1566.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5|$|Removing the {{original}} tablet {{to the victims}} of the East Ham Sewage Works accident had left an unsightly gap in {{the original}} row of tiles. In 1931, Mary Watts tracked down Fred Passenger, a former employee of DeMorgan who had, after the closure of the business, set up his own ceramics business using DeMorgan designs. Passenger was by this time working for a pottery business in Bushey Heath established by artist Ida Perrin, but Mary Watts persuaded him to produce a single <b>panel</b> <b>in</b> the style of DeMorgan to fit into the empty space. Herbert Maconoghu, a schoolboy who had died in 1882 attempting to rescue two friends from drowning, {{had been one of the}} names originally suggested by Watts, and Passenger produced a tablet to Maconoghu in the style of the original central row, which was installed in April 1931. Maconoghu was actually Herbert Moore McConaghey, the son of Matthew and Martha McConaghey, and he was born in Mynpoorie in Indian where Matthew was working as a settlement officer for the Imperial Civil Service.|$|E
