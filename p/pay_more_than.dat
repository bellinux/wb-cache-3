5|$|On April 22, 2013, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings {{announced}} their intentions not {{to renew their}} existing deal with Viacom. Since then, Viacom's deal with Netflix expired, and shows such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer were removed. On June 4, 2013, Viacom announced a multi-year licensing agreement which would move its programs, such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer, to Amazon.com, Netflix's top competitor. Amazon agreed to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $200 million to Viacom for the license, its largest subscription streaming transaction ever.|$|E
5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E

5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One Meridian Plaza's owners E/R Partners to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> US$13 {{million for the}} site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust for a higher amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon Plaza in 1993. Damaged and vacant since the One Meridian Plaza fire, Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to {{the south side of}} the One Meridian Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to the One Meridian Plaza fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of the One Meridian plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While the One Meridian Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Round held First Division club Cardiff City in snowy {{conditions}} at Ninian Park. Vale won 2–0, and their victory was {{aided by the}} fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with a handshake and a smile. Cardiff placed a £25,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> £25,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away.|$|E
5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a market rate {{to ensure their}} workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E

25|$|These {{securitization}} trusts may {{be structured}} by government-sponsored enterprises {{as well as}} by private entities that may offer credit enhancement features to mitigate the risk of prepayment and default associated with these mortgages. Since residential mortgage holders in the United States have the option to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the required monthly payment (curtailment) or to pay off the loan in its entirety (prepayment), the monthly cash flow of an MBS is not known in advance, and an MBS therefore presents a risk to investors.|$|E

25|$|The High Court {{answered}} {{both questions}} in the negative. The majority, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, in separate decisions, applied the decision in the Sawmillers case, holding that the Arbitration Court could not make an award that was inconsistent with a State law. There were two fundamental propositions that were central to the judgments of the majority, (1) the reserved powers doctrine that power to regulate the domestic trade and commerce was reserved to the State and that the Australian parliament could not invade that sphere and (2) that arbitration was the exercise of judicial power and that the Arbitration Court was required to determine the matter according to law, including State law. Section 109 of the Constitution, did not apply because the Arbitration Court was required to declare and administer the law, not make it, thus an award made by the Arbitration Court was not a federal law that would prevail over a State law. Discontent with a State law was not an industrial dispute between employees and their employer. On the question of inconsistency the majority held the question was whether {{it was impossible to}} obey both laws. Because an employer could agree to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the State minimum wage, the Arbitration Court could order the employer to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the minimum.|$|E
25|$|The Miami Conservancy District began {{construction}} of its flood control system in 1918.

Since its completion, the Miami Conservancy District has protected the Dayton area from flooding more than 1,500 times. Ongoing expenses for maintaining the district comes from property tax assessments collected annually from all property holders in the district.

40|$|If you {{are told}} that job A <b>pays</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> job B and job B <b>pays</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> job C, then you can {{conclude}} that job A <b>pays</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> job C. This conclusion follows deductively because pays-more-than() —or, more generally, more-than() —is a transitive relation. How does the human mind reason about transitive relations such as more-than(), taller-than(), etc. ? Transitive relations are logically well-behaved: Given that some relation, R(), is transitive, and given the facts R(A, B) and R(B, C), we can conclude R(A, C) with certainty. As such, {{there are many ways}} in principle to reason about them. For example, it is easy to imagine a cognitive "module " devoted to transitive reasoning. Like a program written in PROLOG, the module might take statements about transitive relations as input—for example, statements of the form pays-more-than(A, B) and pays-more-than(B, C) —and generate various inferences—such as pays-most(A), pays-least(C), and pays-more-than(A, C) —as output. However, the behavioral evidence suggests that this is not how the human mind processes transitive relations. A logical module would not provide any inherent basis for predicting that some transitive inferences will be more difficult to make than others. But it has been {{known for a long time}} that people solve some transitive-inference problems more quickly an...|$|R
