40|$|Background. The {{impact of}} co-morbid {{substance}} use in first-episode schizophrenia {{has not been}} fully explored. Method. This naturalistic follow-up of a cohort of 152 people with first-episode schizophrenia examined substance use and clinical outcome in terms of symptoms and social and neuropsychological function. Results. Data were collected on 85 (56 %) of the patient cohort after a median period of 14 months. Over the follow-up period, the proportion of smokers rose from 60 % at baseline to 64 %. While 30 % reported lifetime problem drinking of alcohol at baseline, only 15 % had problem drinking at follow-up. Furthermore, while at baseline 63 % reported lifetime cannabis use and 32 % were currently using the drug, by the follow-up assessment the latter figure had fallen to 18. 5 %. At follow-up, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> users had significantly more severe positive and depressive symptoms and greater overall severity of illness. A report of no lifetime substance use at baseline was associated with greater improvement in spatial working memory (SWM) at follow-up. Conclusions. Past substance use may impede recovery of SWM performance in people with schizophrenia in the year or so following first presentation to psychiatric services. The prevalence of substance use other than tobacco tends to diminish over this period, {{in the absence of}} specific interventions. <b>Persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use in first-episode schizophrenia is associated with more severe positive and depressive symptoms but not negative symptoms, and should be a target for specific treatment intervention. © 2007 Cambridge University Press...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Preventing relapse is an {{essential}} element of early intervention in psychosis, but relevant risk factors and precise relapse rates remain to be clarified. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically compile and analyse risk factors for and rates of relapse in the early course of psychosis. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of English and non-English language, peer-reviewed, longitudinal studies, with a minimum 12 -month follow-up and at least 80 % of participants diagnosed with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) that reported risk factors for relapse. RESULTS: Of 153 potentially relevant articles, 29 were included in the study. Pooled prevalence of relapse of positive symptoms was 28 % (range= 12 - 47 %), 43 % (35 - 54 %), 54 % (40 - 63 %) at 1, 1. 5 - 2, and 3 years follow-up, in that order. A total of 109 predictors were analysed, with 24 being assessed in at least 3 studies. Of those, 20 predictors could be extracted for meta-analysis. Medication non-adherence, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use disorder, carers' critical comments (but not overall expressed emotion) and poorer premorbid adjustment, increased the risk for relapse 4 -fold, 3 -fold, 2. 3 -fold and 2. 2 -fold, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical variables and general demographic variables have little impact on relapse rates. Conversely, non-adherence with medication, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use disorder, carers' criticism and poorer premorbid adjustment significantly increase the risk for relapse in FEP. Future studies need to address the methodological limitations of the extant research (e. g. definition of relapse), focus on the identification of protective factors and evaluate theoretically derived models of relapse.

30|$|There is {{inconsistency}} in {{the criteria}} used for categorization of various substances under regulations in the EU. The criteria for considering an active substance (PPP), safener, or synergist to be a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substance are {{laid down in}} paragraph 3.7. 2 of Annex II of Regulation EC 1107 / 2009 [10]. The persistence criterion is fulfilled when the half-life in marine water and sediment, fresh and estuarine water and sediment, and in soil exceeds specific values (see Table  1). It is further noted that ‘assessment of persistency in the environment shall be based on available half-life data collected under appropriate conditions, which shall be described by the applicant.’ Similarly, in paragraph 3.7. 3.1, a very <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> (vP) is characterized by longer half-lives in the same environmental media. The term ‘half-life’ is neither clearly defined nor further specified as to the environmental media considered for assessment.

40|$|Objective:To {{conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} review of current evidence on factors for nonadherence to treatment in individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Methods:MEDLINE, LILACS, PsycINFO, and SciELO databases were searched with the keywords first episode psychosis, factor, adherence, nonadherence, engagement, disengagement, compliance, and intervention. References of selected studies were consulted for relevant articles. Results:A total of 157 articles were screened, of which 33 articles were retained for full review. The factors related to nonadherence were: a) patient-related (e. g., lower education level, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use, forensic history, unemployment, history of physical abuse); b) environment-related (e. g., no family involved in treatment, social adjustment difficulties); c) medication-related (e. g., rapid remission of negative symptoms when starting treatment, therapeutic alliance); and d) illness-related (e. g., more positive symptoms, more relapses). Treatment factors that improve adherence include a good therapeutic alliance and a voluntary first admission when hospitalization occurs. Conclusion:The results of this review suggest that nonadherence to treatment in FEP is multifactorial. Many of these factors are modifiable and can be specifically targeted in early intervention programs. Very few studies have assessed strategies to raise adherence in FEP...|$|E

This study evaluates {{the development of}} depressive symptoms, MDD diagnosis, and suicidal ideation in a high-risk sample (N= 524) diagnosed with conduct disorder (CD) and substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms as youth and re-assessed approximately 6. 5 years later. Dual trajectory classes of both alcohol and other drug use (AOD) and antisocial behavior (ASB), previously identified using latent class growth analyses (LCGA), were used to predict depression outcomes. The Dual Chronic, Increasing AOD/Persistent ASB, and Decreasing Drugs/Persistent ASB classes had higher past-week depression scores, more past-year MDD symptoms, {{and were more likely}} to have past-year MDD than the Resolved class. The Dual Chronic and Decreasing Drugs/Persistent ASB classes also had more past-year MDD symptoms than the Persistent AOD/Adolescent ASB class. Youth at highest risk for developing or maintaining depression in adulthood had the common characteristic of persistent antisocial behavior. This suggests young adulthood depression is associated more with persistent antisocial behavior than with <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use in comorbid youth.

40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} risk and {{predictors}} of non-adherence with treatment (NAT) in adolescents with first episode psychosis (FEP) receiving their first treatment in a long-standing early intervention and prevention centre. Methods: The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Australia admitted 157 adolescents with FEP from 1998 to 2000. Treatment at EPPIC spans an average of 18 - months. Data were collected from patients medical records (MR) using a standardized questionnaire. 134 MR were available. Time to NAT was the outcome of interest. Baseline and treatment predictors of NAT were examined via cox proportional hazards model. Results: Kaplan-Meier 18 -month NAT-risk was 0. 28. A lower severity of illness at baseline (HR= 0. 20), living without family during treatment (HR= 4. 8), and <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use during treatment (HR= 2. 6) contributed significantly to predicting NAT.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: To {{assess the}} impact of {{duration}} of untreated psychosis (DUP) on baseline and 18 -month follow-up characteristics controlling for relevant confounders in an epidemiological first-episode psychosis (FEP) cohort. METHOD: The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Australia admitted 786 FEP patients from January 1998 to December 2000. Data were collected from medical files using a standardized questionnaire. Data from 636 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Median DUP was 8. 7 weeks. Longer DUP was associated with worse premorbid functioning (p< 0. 001), higher rate of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (p< 0. 001), and younger age at onset of psychosis (p= 0. 004). Longer DUP was not associated with baseline variables but with a lower rate of remission of positive symptoms (p< 0. 001) and employment/occupation (p< 0. 001), a higher rate of <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use (p= 0. 015), worse illness severity (p< 0. 001) and global functioning (p< 0. 001) at follow-up after controlling for relevant confounders, explaining approximately 5 % of variance of remission of positive symptoms (p< 0. 001) in the total sample and 3 % in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders excluding bipolar I disorder (p= 0. 002). Outcome was significantly worse when DUP exceeded 1 - 3 months. CONCLUSION: Avoiding pitfalls of non-epidemiological studies, DUP appears to be a modest independent predictor of prognosis in the medium-term.

40|$|In this Project in an {{interdisciplinary}} cooperation {{the influence of}} tensides on the performance improvement of biochemical decomposition of <b>persistent</b> <b>substances</b> has been investigated. During {{the first part of}} the project (Prof. Raebiger) two continously supplied experimental plants were built. These two plants, using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, were run simultaneously with and without tensides respectively. The investigations show, that the results in regard to the decomposition rate are better from the plant operated with tenside. Also, the decomposition rate in relation to the total solids content has shown to be better in the plant run with tenside in comparison to the plant without tenside. This was especially relevant during simulated malfunctions. In project part II (Prof. Dr. U. Fischer) further investigations into the influence of tensids on the microbial decomposition of pollutants have been conducted using the adapted microorganism cultures taken from the experimental reactors. Investigations using activated sludge flakes and a monoculture in a batchprocess have shown an increased growth in the presence of the investigated tensids. A variation in the pollutant concentration as well as the addition of the tensid Bioversal to the nutrient medias yielded hints for the optimization of the culture conditions. In Part III of the project (Prof. Leibfritz) an extraction process was optimized in order to meet the requirements of the bacteria cultures and the objective of the project. Among other things, the influence of the tensids on the decomposition speed of the pollutants has been demonstrated in the course of this examinations.

Emissions in the trop-ics rather than in mid latitudes and application to vegeta-tion rather than to the soil tend to enhance the mobility and to limit the persistence. The changing geographic application pattern of DDT in 1970 - 1990, which was caused by the phasing out in many countries during this period, went along with sig-nificant changes in the environmental fate of DDT: the number of completed atmospheric cycles ('hops') in-creased and the residence times in the ground compart-ments decreased correspondingly.

Study aims were to: (i) determine CTO frequency in a large representative sample of first episode psychosis (FEP) patients; (ii) compare the characteristics of patients with or without CTO before entry, during treatment and at discharge from an early psychosis program. Information on 660 patients treated at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) between 1998 and 2000 was collected from medical files. 19. 2 % of patients were under CTO at least once during treatment and they differed on most pre-treatment, baseline, treatment and service discharge variables.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the performance of silica aerogel synthesized using sodium silicate in the adsorption of phenol from aqueous solutions. Material and Method: Silica aerogel was prepared by Sol-Gel process. The influence of effective variables such contact time, initial pH of the solution, adsorbent dose, and initial phenol concentration on the adsorption efficiency was investigated. The characterization of prepared silica aerogel and confirmation of phenol adsorption was determined through SEM, XRD analysis and NMR, FTIR spectra respectively. The adsorption data was evaluated via Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Results: This research found that the phenol adsorption efficiency increased by increasing pH from 3 to 11, so that after 60 min, the absorption efficiency at the 100 mg/L initial phenol concentration and 0. 5 g adsorbent obtained 84 and 96. 4 % at pH 3 and 11, respectively. The SEM image and XRD patternof synthesized silica aerogel confirmed the creation of porous and amorphous structure. After the phenol absorption, the NMR and FTIR spectra of silica aerogel, confirmed the creation of new bands because of phenol molecule at the adsorbent structure. The absorption of phenol was compatible with Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic. The maximum absorption capacity (qm) obtained was 47. 39 mg/g.

The Swedish Committee on New Guidelines on Chemicals Policy [9] proposed that “a substance is regarded as unacceptably persistent if its half-life is longer than 8  weeks in a simulation test at 20  °C”. This half-life corresponds to a half-life of 1  year in the northern European climate (average annual temperature of 5  °C) and takes into account unfavourable degradation conditions.

40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} {{the impact of}} co-morbid substance use disorders (SUD) in psychosis have {{tended to focus on}} cross-sectional data, with few studies examining the effects of substance use course on clinical outcome. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the impact of baseline SUD and course of SUD on remission of positive symptoms. Methods: The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre admitted 786 first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients between 1998 - 2000. Data on SUD and clinical outcome were collected from patientsT medical records (MR) of 643 patients who met inclusion criteria. Results: Lifetime prevalence of SUD was 74 %, with 62 % having a SUD at baseline. This reduced to 36 % in those patients who completed 18 months of treatment at the EPPIC program. A cox regression analysis indicated that a decrease or cessation of substance use significantly increased the probability of remission, whilst persistent SUD substantially reduced the likelihood. In addition, patients who reduced use appeared to have better outcomes at 18 months than those patients who had never used substances. Baseline SUD was not found to have any significant influence on symptom remission. Conclusions: Patients presenting with FEP have high rates of SUD. Effective management of psychosis within a specialised service is associated with reductions in SUD over the course of treatment, although <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use is associated with noncompliance, treatment drop-out and poor remission rates.

40|$|Alcoholism is a <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> abuse {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} negative health, social, and economic outcomes. Treatment strategies for alcohol use disorders are limited, and only three drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment. Although behavioral therapy and drug combination strategies improve abstinence outcomes, the majority of those in treatment will not achieve long-term abstinence. Therefore, better treatment strategies are needed. While much progress has been made toward understanding the neurobiology of alcoholism, this knowledge has not been effectively translated into treatment strategies. Animal models of alcohol drinking have been crucial to this research effort, but until recently there have been few procedures that effectively model alcoholism by producing binge-like drinking, withdrawal, and relapse behavior. In the last five years the intermittent alcohol access (IAA) model, which uses repeated cycles of scheduled alcohol deprivation and reinstatement to elevate drinking, has been established as such a procedure, with substantial evidence that escalation of drinking produced by IAA is mediated by similar mechanisms as in human alcoholics, which include transcriptional regulation that alters functioning of mesolimbocortical reward pathways. The IAA model. The studies reported herein characterize changes in gene expression in mesolimbocortical brain regions associated with development of maladaptive binge-like alcohol drinking due to scheduled abstinence, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, which regulates motivated behavior. Furthermore the IAA model is characterized with regard to effectiveness in 2 ethanol-preferring C 57 BL/ 6 inbred mouse strains, and the influence of concurrent access to multiple alcohol concentrations is examined. Finally, the potential of naltrexone and novel mu-opioid receptor-selective antagonist NAQ to modulate alcohol drinking under continuous access and intermittent access procedures is reported. Microarray analysis is used to analyze the transcriptome in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and ventral midbrain of C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl mice after alcohol deprivation, and to identify differentially expressed genes and gene co-expression networks in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice during continuous access, as well as after six cycles of IAA. Differentially expressed genes, network hub genes, and regulation mechanisms represent high priority targets for further study in binge-like drinking behavior, with the goal of translating this knowledge to treatment strategies for alcoholism...|$|E
40|$|South Australia will be {{the first}} Australian state to {{introduce}} legislation to remove children born to parents convicted of manslaughter or murder and place them under the custody of the relevant minister, the SA government announced recently. SA Coroner Mark Johns made the initial recommendation after investigating the many years of abuse and eventual death of four-year-old Chloe Valentine. Chloe was injured and died in 2012 after her mother and mother’s partner repeatedly put the girl on a 50 -kilogram bike and filmed her crashing into objects. Across Australia, 34 children were the victims of filicide – the killing of a child by a parent – in the two years leading up to 2012. In a well-coordinated and well-resourced child protection system, health staff, child protection workers and forensic specialists should already be collaborating to share information about children and families at risk of harm. These teams should be responding to the warnings some parents give prior to committing these crimes, then deciding whether parents convicted of murdering their children should have subsequent offspring removed. However, responses to high-risk pregnancy and high-risk infants across Australia could be described as haphazard, and legislation alone will not correct the problem. Uncharted territory South Australia’s move is not without precedent. New Zealand gave the court responsibility for the safety of subsequent children born to parents convicted of murder or manslaughter in 2013. However there is no publicly accessible data on the rate of removal and no evaluations to date. Importantly, the New Zealand legislation has some flexibility to work with parents convicted of murder or manslaughter, but the onus is on the parent to demonstrate they are safe to parent subsequent children. We have strong research detailing the demographics of parents who kill children and other contributing factors, such as psychotic depression, parental separation, retribution for leaving a relationship, domestic violence, fatal maltreatment, substance use and so on. Researchers have also made a number of suggestions about {{what can be done to}} prevent filicide aside from removing children, such as treating mental illness and introducing safe havens for anonymous birthing. But there has been no evaluation of what works and what doesn’t. The ethics of designing a research project that compares treatments, interventions or approaches to protect subsequent children of those who commit filicide over time is an understandable barrier. Logistical barriers While the intent of the South Australian legislation to prevent harm is noble, it doesn’t address the barriers that currently exist in the child protection system. First, the plan assumes we know who has been convicted of the manslaughter or murder of their child. The judicial and law enforcement sector knows who these people are. However, other agencies with crucial involvement in child protection only know if they are told by law enforcement. The law enforcement sector cannot be responsible for actively tracking the reproductive activity of those convicted of the manslaughter or murder of children for the term of convicted person’s life. Removal “at birth” also implies that the health department has been informed of the previous conviction, that the child protection agency knows the woman is pregnant and that they know where the woman will give birth. By linking the removal “at birth”, the focus is on the woman and does not account for the paternity of the child. It’s unclear how this approach will include males previously convicted who may or may not be identified as the biological father of the unborn/newborn or current partner of the pregnant woman. Responding to high-risk pregnancies Child protection authorities were first notified about Chloe Valentine during her mother’s pregnancy. According to the Coroner, a report to the Child Abuse Report Line described Chloe’s mother as “dirty”, “smelly”, “unhygienic”, “taking drugs and drinking”, and “not obtaining proper antenatal medical treatment”. It is not uncommon for child welfare risks to emerge during pregnancy. Indicators of possible future harm to the child include suicide risk, serious and <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use, being a victim of domestic violence, homelessness and inadequate preparations for birth. Child protection legislation, risk studies and structured decision-making tools are commonly employed in child protection situations to assess and respond to risk. One of the key planks in the platform to monitor pregnant women at risk of domestic violence, unmanaged mental illness and substance use, is the unborn child high risk birth alert operating in some jurisdictions. Some states have legislation to support the prenatal reporting of children at risk. In states or territories where there is no law specifically relating to unborn child information exchange, inter-agency collaboration protocols allow agencies to share information about unborn children. These policy responses are aimed at redressing the risks giving rise to the prenatal report, prior to the child’s birth; in other words, getting to the cause of maltreatment and working on those risks. But the patchwork of responses states and territories have to high-risk pregnancy and high-risk infants is problematic. There is also a risk that pregnant women under surveillance will avoid contact with services, such as avoiding antenatal care, deny they are pregnant, move to other jurisdictions to give birth, not register the child’s birth, and so on. Systems that seem to work best are integrated, supported by cross-agency policy and strive for active engagement with service users. Wrap-around intersecting interagency responses must be coordinated, backed by the legal sharing of child protection information. Systems that don’t work well are fragmented, typified by lack of collaboration and communication. Structural issues such as conflicting service mandates, under-resourcing and difference in practice frameworks can result in services being provided in silos to at-risk families, rather than in cooperation. This complex area requires a sophisticated response. There may be pockets where programs are operating well, but there is no systematic approach across the country, or even state-wide. Any risk-management system in child protection needs multilateral agency participation to ensure such a system delivers on what it is trying to do: protect subsequent children. • Rosemaria Flaherty, PhD candidate, Australian Centre for Child Protection, University of South Australia and Fiona Arney, Chair and Director, Australian Centre for Child Protection, University of South Australia This article was originally published on The Conversation.

40|$|Direct {{electrical}} energization {{methods for}} removal of <b>persistent</b> <b>substances</b> from water are under {{investigation in the}} framework of the ytriD-project. The emphasis of the first stage of the project is the energy efficiency. A comparison is made between a batch reactor with a thin layer of water and an aerosol reactor. The method of energization is mainly the application of fast pulses. In case of the batch reactor it is compared with DC. The ozone concentration is determined as an indicator for the efficiency of the chemical reactions, the yield is 4 g/kWh for the DC batch reactor, 50 g/kWh for the pulsed batch reactor and 50 - 100 g/kWh for the aerosol reactor. For initial testing phenol degradation is determined. 50 % of the initial 0. 1 mM is reached in 8 min in the pulsed batch reactor and less than 30 s in the aerosol reactor. The phenol removal speeds up by a factor 3 upon the addition of Fe-ions. Matlab simulations confirm that the surface-to-volume ratio is an important parameter for the speed of phenol degradation...|$|R
40|$|Kraft mills are {{responsible}} for the massive discharge of highly polluted effluents, and new bleaching processes (i. e. Total Chlorine Free (TCF)) is presented as a feasible option to reduce this environmental impact. However, increased TCF pulp production is accompanied by an increase in chelate use. The most commonly used chelates, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA), are considered to be relatively <b>persistent</b> <b>substances</b> in water treatment plants, and consequently environmentally critical compounds. The purpose of this work is to investigate DPTA behaviour in an anaerobic system. An Anaerobic Filter (AF) was operated with three different DPTA load rates (LR DPTA = 0. 07 - 0. 28 gDPTA/L×d), and the operating strategy was to maintain the anaerobic system stable during the entire operation (alkalinity ratio below 0. 3). The AF's maximum Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal was 59 %, whereas the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) was around 95 %. However, only 5 % of DPTA removal was observed under anaerobic conditions during the first operating period. Scanning electronic microscopy indicates that the operating system reduced microorganism biodiversit...|$|R
40|$|During recent years, {{the issue}} of {{hazardous}} substances in wastewater {{has become a major}} concern with respect to both human health and environment. This has led to the launch of several studies into the monitoring of different aquatic environments (urban wastewaters, treated effluent, surface water, groundwater, drinkable water). In the last years, a particular interest was devoted to the monitoring of hospital wastewater in terms of either conventional pollutant or micropollutant concentrations and loads. With few exceptions, hospital effluents are considered to possess the same pollutant load as urban ones, and they are therefore discharged into the same sewage network and conveyed for co-treatment at the nearest municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Nevertheless, hospital effluents contain a great variety of toxic or <b>persistent</b> <b>substances,</b> due to laboratory and research activities as well as general hospital activity and excretion of medicines, generally occurring in concentrations ranging from ng/L to mg/L, while in urban wastewaters they are not present or they may occur at a lower level. Once pharmaceuticals are administered, their active substances are metabolized, but only to a certain extent. The unmetabolized fractions (varying between 10 and 95...|$|R
