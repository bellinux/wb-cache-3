A batch of mono-crystalline silicon wafers have undergone all the technological processes such as chemical cleaning, phosphorus diffusion and finally screen printing metallization.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{dispensing}} {{as an alternative}} front side metallization process in crystalline silicon photovoltaics demonstrated, how an adaption of paste rheology allows for a precise adjustment of contact finger geometry in a wide range. In order to demonstrate the benefit of this advantage, the analytical simulation tool Gridmaster was extended to observe the effect of various geometrical parameters on solar cell results and manufacturing costs. In addition, respective geometrical parameters of thick film <b>printed</b> <b>contact</b> fingers were determined using a special in house developed tool based on MATLAB. As a result, contact geometries as achievable by means of ultrafine line dispensing are ideally suited for contacting silicon solar cells. Compared with standard fine line single screen printed finger geometries, an efficiency increase of up to Δη = 0. 4 %abs. {{as well as a}} reduction of manufacturing costs of 1 €ct. /Wp on module level can be achieved using dispensing technology. In order to obtain suitable data, simulation results were compared with solar cell results on industrial pre-processed Cz-Si p-type wafer material applying the novel ten nozzle parallel fine line dispensing unit. Therefore, a new dispensing paste was developed combining optimum optical finger aspect ratios of ARo= 0. 7 with excellent contacting behavior.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of a new two-layer process to contact industrial solar cells. However, most of the results seem to be transferable to standard screen print paste contacts. The seed layer was created by a pad or screen printer and thickened by light-induced plating (LIP) of silver. These contact structures were investigated microscopically {{to gain a better understanding}} of the observed electrical parameters. A review of the present microscopic contact formation model for flat surfaces is presented. This model was extended and applied to surfaces textured with random pyramids. This analysis has revealed two new types of silver crystallites which can be described by a crystallographic model. The dependence of the silver crystallite density on the surface doping concentration was investigated. Next, the dependence of the contact resistance on the width of the seed layer was measured showing that the contact resistivity increases with a reduction of the seed layer width. These results have been further approved by an analysis of SEM images of wet-chemically etched contacts examining the density of crystallites and the fraction of removed SiNx layer. Contact resistance R-C measurements before and after LIP of silver showed surprisingly a positive influence of tire plating process on R-C.

40|$|AbstractFlexographic {{printing}} is a high-throughput rotational {{relief printing}} method and represents a promising innovative approach {{for the front}} side metallization of silicon solar cells. The ability to realize narrow contact fingers with very low silver consumption makes this technology particularly interesting for busbarless solar cells with wire-interconnection like Meyer Burger's SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT). This study intends to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the general feasibility for this approach. Fundamental printing tests are carried out to investigate important influence parameters like the flexible printing plate and the correlation between printing pressure and contact finger width. We found out that contact finger elements on elastomer printing plates down to an actual width of wf = 7 ± 2 μm can be realized using a high-resolution laser-engraving process. Furthermore, we show that <b>printed</b> <b>contact</b> finger width increases by approx. Δwf ≈ 10 μm for each Δploc = 0. 05 MPa of pressure increase and thus has a strong impact on the contact grid. Busbarless Al BSF Cz-Si solar cells with flexo-printed front side metallization are fabricated and measured using Pasan GridTOUCH/SpotLIGHT-system. The best group of solar cells obtains a mean conversion efficiency of η = 19. 0 % and a maximum conversion efficiency of ηmax = 19. 4 %. A mini-module with the best two solar cells achieved a aperture conversion efficiency of η = 15. 8 %. Causes for cell-to-module losses are investigated and discussed in detail.

Method: The oxygen transport of a contact lens is evaluated through the central optical {{zone of the}} lens. Cosmetic <b>printed</b> <b>contact</b> lenses contain pigment colorant in the periphery or mid-periphery of the lens. Therefore, {{to assess the impact}} of cosmetic print on oxygen permeability, special lenses need to be produced that contain the colorant within the central optical zone. This technique was used to obtain multiple measurements of nonedge-corrected Dk/t of both the center pigmented lens and its nonpigmented equivalent, using a polarographic measurement described in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 18369 - 4 : 2006 (E), and the Dk derived for each measurement is corrected for edge effect. In addition, the edge-corrected Dk values of lenses made from the same monomer batch were measured. The lenses were packaged and autoclaved with and without proprietary technology which embeds PVP in the contact lens during autoclaving. The resulting Dk value of the printed lens material was then used with thickness data to generate true Dk/t profiles for a given lens power. Results: The edge-corrected Dk of the printed etafilcon A lens with offset pigment colorant was measured to be 19. 7 × 10 - 11 (cm 2 /s) (mL O 2 /mL·mmHg) at 35 °C. This was within ± 20 % tolerance range as specified in ISO 18369 - 2 : 2012 (E) for the edge-corrected Dk of the nonpigmented etafilcon A control lens evaluated during the same session, 19. 5 × 10 - 11 (cm 2 /s) (mL O 2 /mL·mmHg). The edge-corrected Dk values of the lenses packaged with PVP (mean 20. 1, standard deviation [SD] 0. 3) were also within the ± 20 % tolerance range compared to those packaged without PVP (mean 20. 0, SD 0. 3). Conclusion: The pigment colorant and PVP embedded in the contact lens during autoclaving were not found to influence the oxygen permeability of the etafilcon A material.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of silicon solar cells such that the cost/watt could be reduced to a competitive level. In this thesis, three aspects of the front-side of crystalline silicon solar cells have been investigated. Advanced texturing, emitter formation and passivation are detailed in chapters 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Below, each chapter is summarized. In chapter 2, a new technique has been developed that textures the frontside while polishing the rear-side. The technique involves the application of an acrylic adhesive micro-masking layer to a rough, as-cut wafer. Upon removal, remnants of the adhesive layer adhere only to the peaks of the as-cut wafer. The wafer is then subject to a 4 minute 12. 5 wt% heated NaOH etch, where the front-side of the wafer is textured and the rearside of the wafer is polished. The developed technique can lead to savings by: decreasing cycle time (4 min vs. 20 min conventional texturing time), saving consumables (one chemical solution vs. two) and reducing the amount of silicon loss (15 &# 956;m vs. 25 &# 956;m from texturing both sides and then polishing the rear). Equivalent solar cell efficiencies have been achieved when comparing the developed technique to conventional random pyramid textured and in-line polished wafers. Chapter 3 focuses on a novel emitter formation process that has been developed. The process involves the combination of ion implantation, passivation and annealing in a firing furnace. The developed process may enable ion implant technology to have a lower cycle time than conventional diffusion as the anneal is done in a firing furnace (within 90 seconds). Cell results show that implantation-induced damage can be annealed to an extent to reach open circuit voltages above 640 mV. Along with emitter formation, intentional and unintentional emitter alterations have also been investigated. wo processes that cause unintentional emitter etch back have been investigated, the rear emitter removal process as well as surface cleaning processes. Processes that alter the emitter profile necessitate an increase in sheet resistance monitoring. To reduce recombination, the phosphorus profile was altered. While this improved current and open circuit voltage, the use of aggressive screen printing paste shunted shallow junctions and significantly decreased the fill factor. The need for improved contact formation was evident for higher sheet resistance emitters developed in chapter 3, which has been done in chapter 4. In chapter 4, passivation and contacting of emitters developed in chapter 3 were improved with the introduction of thermal oxidation. Thermal oxide has been shown to improve i-PERC solar cell efficiency by 0. 6 - 1. 0 % absolute. There are clear differences between improvements made on the front-side and the rear-side due to thermal oxide, the individual contributions of which are detailed in chapter 4. It has been shown that the gain in efficiency is largely attributed to the front-side. Careful selection of the emitter {{must be taken into account}} when attempting to enhance performance by oxidation. The recombination reduction is caused by the additional phosphorus drive-in and has been assessed separately from passivation enhancement achieved by the silicon oxide. Besides the expected improvement in open circuit voltage (passivation), the fill factor has also shown to improve. The improvement in fill factor is due to a significant (one order of magnitude) reduction in contact resistance in high sheet resistance (> 85 &# 8486;/&# 9633;) emitters. This has been accredited to a large peak of phosphorus in the thermal oxide, which has been confirmed by SIMS and XPS measurements. Contact characterization by means of SEM, EDX, and C-AFM show that the large phosphorus content in the silicon oxide may improve crystallite formation or may form AgPx as detected by EDX. Phosphosilicate glass was used as an alternate method to introduce phosphorus in the passivation layer. Although PSG is not adequate for passivation, it has been shown to be able to enable a contact resistance below 3 mWcm² on a 95 &# 8486;/&# 9633; emitter, which demonstrates the potential of phosphorus incorporation in passivation layers. The reliability and stability of the contacts has been assessed. Extended versions of the IEC 61215 s damp heat and thermal cycling tests have been performed. Phosphorus rich silicon oxide passivated i-PERC cells are shown to be as reliable as conventional screen printed cells. abstract iii samenvatting v acknowledgments vii list of abberviations and symbols xi 1 introduction 1 1. 1 The Problem (Global Warming)............... 1 1. 2 A Solution (PV)....................... 6 1. 3 Thesis Motivation (c-Si PV)................. 8 2 advanced texturing 13 2. 1 Theory............................. 13 2. 1. 1 Motivation...................... 13 2. 1. 2 Pyramid Textured Front-Side and Polished Rear-Side 18 2. 1. 3 Texturing Chemistry................. 21 2. 1. 4 Spectrophotometer Reflectance Measurements... 22 2. 2 State of the Art In Industry................. 23 2. 2. 1 Texturing....................... 25 2. 2. 2 Polishing....................... 26 2. 3 Contribution......................... 27 2. 3. 1 Optimizing random pyramid texturing....... 27 2. 3. 2 Fingerprints...................... 31 2. 3. 3 Texturing and Polishing in One Solution...... 33 2. 4 Conclusion.......................... 43 3 advanced electron collector formation 45 3. 1 “Emitter” vs. “Collector”.................. 45 3. 2 Diffusion Theory....................... 47 3. 2. 1 Diffusivity and Fick’s Laws of Diffusion...... 48 3. 2. 2 Phosphorus Diffusion Using POCl 3........ 52 3. 2. 3 Phosphorus Implantation.............. 54 3. 3 State of the Art In Industry................. 58 3. 3. 1 POCl 3 In Industry.................. 58 3. 3. 2 Industrial Implantation Processes.......... 59 3. 4 Contribution......................... 61 3. 4. 1 Non Intentional Emitter Etch Back......... 61 3. 4. 2 Intentional Emitter Etch Back........... 65 3. 4. 3 POCl 3 Process Parameters............. 69 3. 4. 4 Diffusion Uniformity Improvements......... 72 3. 4. 5 Novel Implantation Process............. 76 3. 5 Conclusion.......................... 88 4 advanced passivation + contact formation 91 4. 1 Theory............................ 91 4. 1. 1 Recombination Basics................ 91 4. 1. 2 The Silicon Surface.................. 95 4. 1. 3 Measuring J 0 n+ by QSSPC............. 97 4. 1. 4 Contact Resistance................. 98 4. 1. 5 Transfer Length Method............... 100 4. 2 State of the Art In Industry................. 102 4. 2. 1 PECVD Silicon Nitride............... 102 4. 2. 2 Contacting Using Screen-Printed Silver...... 104 4. 3 Contribution (Oxidation Enhanced i-PERC)....... 107 4. 3. 1 Initial J 0 n+ and Lifetime Investigation....... 107 4. 3. 2 Varying Oxidation Time.............. 111 4. 3. 3 Pre-Oxidation POCl 3 Re-Optimization...... 117 4. 3. 4 Impact of Oxidation Temperature......... 122 4. 3. 5 Oxidation vs. N 2 anneal............... 127 4. 3. 6 Individual Front/Rear Thermal Oxide Enhancement 132 4. 3. 7 Altering Phosphorus Content in Thermal Oxide. 138 4. 3. 8 Ag Screen <b>Printed</b> <b>Contact</b> Characterization.... 147 4. 3. 9 Contact Stability and Reliability.......... 152 4. 4 Conclusion.......................... 157 5 summary and outlook 159 5. 1 Summary........................... 159 5. 2 Loss Analysis......................... 161 5. 3 Outlook............................ 165 5. 4 Last word........................... 167 appendix (confirmed cell efficiencies) 169 publications 171 bibliography 175 nrpages: 216 status: publishe...|$|E
