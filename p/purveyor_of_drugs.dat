40|$|In the past, rheumatologists {{may have}} been {{perceived}} by some specialist colleagues as <b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> toxic <b>drugs</b> for only modest benefits. Some physicians may have had the opinion that we trea-ted complex conditions which were poorly understood with potent <b>drugs</b> whose mechanism <b>of</b> action was largely unknown. The with-drawal <b>of</b> several anti-rheumatic <b>drugs</b> {{over the years and}} the ensuing publicity may have perpetuated this idea; for example, benoxaprofen was withdrawn in 1982 due to hepatotoxicity and more recently some COX- 2 -specific inhibitors were also with-drawn due to an increased risk of ischaemic events. As rheuma-tologists now adopt management strategies to prevent disability rather than just managing it, perceptions of the risk–benefit relationship of DMARDs too may be changing. Many of the original DMARDs arose out of serendipity rather than science; {{as a direct result of}} an improved understanding of the pathophy...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{competing}} {{views about the}} role of gangs and gang mem-bers in drug sales. The first argues that street gangs are well-organized <b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> illegal <b>drugs</b> who reinvest the profits from drug sales into the gang. A second approach rejects this notion. Its proponents claim that drug sales by gangs are seldom well-organized and that gang members often act independently of the gang in selling drugs. We examine these two argu-ments in the context of findings from a three. year field study of street gangs in a large midwestern city. We find that gang members are involved exten-sively in the sale <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> but that sales are seldom well organized. These results are discussed in light of the organizational structure of the gang and the nature <b>of</b> the street <b>drug</b> market. Concern about street gangs has grown in the last decade. Ob-jects of this concern include the spread of gangs into cities with lit-tle previous gang activity, their role in violence, and their involvement in property c ime. Perhaps no other topic, however, has received as much attention as the role <b>of</b> gangs in <b>drug</b> sales. Because street gangs and ~crack " cocaine emerged {{at about the same time}} in many cities, a number of observers have drawn a causal link between the two. Such concerns reflect he view of fed-eral and local law enforcement that these activities are well organ-ized and have national connections (National Institute of Justice 1993). This view has received considerable support in the litera-ture. An alternative position suggests that gangs are involved more casually in the sale <b>of</b> <b>drugs.</b> To control drug sales effectively, gangs must possess everal characteristics. First, an organizational structure must be present. * The research on which this paper is based was conducted in part with sup-port from the Administration ofChildren and Families, Department ofHealth and Human Services (Grant 90 CL/ 1076).
