The bank claimed {{the two men}} and their business, Atlantic Wine & Package LLC, defaulted on a May 2006 loan of $1.3 million {{to set up a}} wine shop and restaurant. Jenkins, a retired surgeon who owned Atlantic Wine since 2004, brought Vick in as an investor. In May 2008, the U.S. District Court in Atlanta granted a summary judgment in favor of Wachovia.

500|$|In December 2009, Zayat was sued by Fifth Third Bank for {{an alleged}} $34 million in unpaid loans. He had taken out {{multiple}} {{loans from the}} bank totaling over $38 million between 2007 and 2009. Fifth Third alleged that Zayat was in default because he failed to make two payments in 2009. As part of the loan package, the bank had a security interest in Zayat Stables' horses, prize money, stallion shares and stallion income. Further, the bank added an amended provision to its later loans stating, [...] "if Zayat Stables defaulted {{on any of the}} Notes, such default would be considered a default under all of the notes thereby entitling Fifth Third to accelerate the <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> and all accrued interest due and owing under all of the Notes." [...] While Zayat paid off some of the money owed, the bank contended that he remained in default on one loan. The bank alleged that Zayat had lost $52 million between 2006 and 2008, that he had not reported a previous Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy he had filed under the name Ephraim David Zayat, and the bank attempted to foreclose on his horses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Compositional data {{analysis}} deals with {{situations where the}} relevant information is contained only in the ratios between the measured variables, {{and not in the}} reported values. This article focuses on high-dimensional compositional data (in the sense of hundreds or even thousands of variables), as they appear in chemometrics (e. g., mass spectral data), proteomics or genomics. The goal of this contribution is to perform a dimension reduction of such data, where the new directions should allow for interpretability. An approach named <b>principal</b> <b>balances</b> turned out to be successful for low dimensions. Here, the concept of sparse principal component analysis is proposed for constructing principal directions, the so-called sparse <b>principal</b> <b>balances.</b> They are sparse (contain many zeros), build an orthonormal basis in the sample space of the compositional data, are efficient for dimension reduction and are applicable to high-dimensional data.

Next, a detailed calculation of the latitude profile of surface angular velocity is performed, based on approximate equations containing only the <b>principal</b> <b>balances,</b> and agrees well with observation.
