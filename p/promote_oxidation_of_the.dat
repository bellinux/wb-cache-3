40|$|AbstractThe {{metabolism}} of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25 (OH) D 3] {{was examined}} in several phagocytic cells including alveolar macrophages and myeloid leukemia cells (M 1, HL- 60 and U 937). Phagocytic cells converted 25 (OH) D 3 to 10 -oxo- 19 -nor- 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 {{and a new}} metabolite. The former metabolite was dominant in shorter incubation periods (1 h), whereas the latter dominated over longer incubation periods (24 h). The new metabolite was produced from 25 (OH) D 3 directly but not through 10 -oxo- 19 -nor- 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3. The new metabolite was unequivocally identified as 8 α, 25 -dihydroxy- 9, 10 -seco- 4, 6, 10 (19) -cholestatrien- 3 -one. These results suggest that phagocytic cells somehow <b>promote</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triene part of vitamin D compounds...|$|E
40|$|A facultative Staphylococcus arlettae bacterium, {{isolated}} from an activated sludge {{process in a}} textile industry, was able to successfully decolourize four different azo dyes under microaerophilic conditions (decolourization percentage > 97 %). Further aeration of the decolourized effluent was performed to <b>promote</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degradation products. The degradation products were characterized by FT-IR and UV–vis techniques and their toxicity with respect to Daphnia magna was measured. The amine concentrations {{as well as the}} total organic carbon (TOC) levels were monitored during the biodegradation process. The presence of aromatic amine in the microaerophilic stage and its absence in the aerobic stage indicated the presence of azoreductase activity and an oxidative biodegradation process, respectively. TOC reduction was ∼ 15 % in the microaerophilic stage and ∼ 70 % in the aerobic stage. The results provided evidence that, using a single Staphylococcus arlettae strain in the same bioreactor, the sequential microaerophilic/aerobic stages were able to form aromatic amines by reductive break-down of the azo bond and to oxidize them into non-toxic metabolites.

The fuel was doped with a cerium-based catalyst to <b>promote</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soot bed. The soots {{were subjected to}} combustion testing in a DTG under both temperature ramping and isothermal conditions, and under temperature ramping in a small fixed bed. The combustion gas was 10 % oxygen in nitrogen, which was supplemented {{in the case of}} the fixed bed with other gases found in diesel exhausts. The temperatures of initiation of combustion Tin were measured in the DTG and in the fixed bed. The kinetic rates of oxidation were calculated from the DTG results taking into account the influence of oxygen transport. The effect of gas composition on ignition and burnout in the fixed bed was determined. Ignition did not occur in the DTG, but rather burning progressed steadily. There was a large increase in the kinetic rate constants with cerium present, but the activation energy was unchanged. There was no difference in rates between the two cerium additives. No consistent differences were observed between the combustion kinetics of soots generated under different engine conditions. At temperatures above 600 °C a decline in the catalytic effect of the doped samples appeared. In the fixed bed the catalysed samples tended to partly burn and then ignite and be totally consumed. The appearance of ignition was erratic with the addition of minor gases to the combustion gas. A simple combustion and heat transfer model was able to predict ignition temperatures.

Here, DNA-mediated CT also leads to oxidation of a DNA-bound base excision repair enzyme, MutY. DNA-bound Ru(III), generated through a flash/quench technique, is found to <b>promote</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [4 Fe- 4 S] 2 + cluster of MutY to [4 Fe- 4 S] 3 + and its decomposition product [3 Fe- 4 S] 1 +. Flash/quench experiments monitored by EPR spectroscopy reveal spectra with g = 2. 08, 2. 06, and 2. 02, characteristic of the oxidized clusters. Transient absorption spectra of poly(dGC) and [Ru(phen) 2 dppz] 3 + (dppz = dipyridophenazine), generated in situ, show an absorption characteristic of the guanine radical that is depleted {{in the presence of}} MutY with formation instead of a long-lived species with an absorption at 405 nm; we attribute this absorption also to formation of the oxidized [4 Fe- 4 S] 3 + and [3 Fe- 4 S] 1 + clusters. In ruthenium-tethered DNA assemblies, oxidative damage to the 5 ′-G of a 5 ′-GG- 3 ′ doublet is generated from a distance but this irreversible damage is inhibited by MutY and instead EPR experiments reveal cluster oxidation. With ruthenium-tethered assemblies containing duplex versus single-stranded regions, MutY oxidation is found to be mediated by the DNA duplex, with guanine radical as an intermediate oxidant; guanine radical formation facilitates MutY oxidation. A model is proposed for the redox activation of DNA repair proteins through DNA CT, with guanine radicals, the first product under oxidative stress, in oxidizing the DNA-bound repair proteins, providing the signal to stimulate DNA repair...|$|E
40|$|In {{the broad}} {{scientific}} field of thin films, applications have rapidly expanded {{since the second}} half of the 20 th century, as has been described in the valorization chapter. This thesis describes research at the interface between surface chemistry and physics. The characterization of d-metal surface nanolayer caps in chapter 3 has revealed that they can actually <b>promote</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mo layer on which they are deposited. Vise versa, Ni and Co caps themselves oxidize, but in monolayer quantities already prevent Mo oxidation. We attribute these observations to sacrificial e- donation, and in the case of Au and Cu, also to roughening of the surface. Chapter 4 shows that all cap oxide and part of the MoO 3 can be reduced by atomic H exposure, which also removes part of the carbonaceous contaminants that absorb on the surface both in ambient air and during use in lithography tools. The carbonaceous contaminants are hydrogenated to volatile hydrocarbons that desorp from the surface. Atomic O exposure removes remaining C and leaves a clean metal oxide surface without erosion via volatile metal oxides. With subsequent atomic H treatment, this offers an attractive technique for non-destructive surface cleaning of the optical elements in lithography. The in-depth chemical and vacancy mediated diffusion have further been investigated in chapter 5 and 6 with XPS, AES, CS-EELS, HAADF-STEM and EDX. Several capping layers and boron are observed to diffuse into and through the underlying Mo, B 4 C and Si layers without significant chemical interaction, towards the subsurface Si-on-Mo interface, where d-metal silicide formation and agglomeration occurs. Rather than in the mid-Si layer, kinetically favorable silicides and borides are formed at the Si-on-Mo interface front, notably RuSix and MoBx. The MoBx appeared to be an attractive barrier material and has been patented. Reversed “substrate-on-adlayer” interfaces can yield entirely suppressed reactivity and diffusion, stressing the influence of surface free energy and the supply of atoms to the interface via segregation on thin layer growth. Chemical diffusion and LaB 6 and LaC 2 interlayer formation in La/B 4 C multilayers for reflection of wavelengths just above 6. 65 nm have been studied in chapter 7 and 8. The research in chapter 8 reveals surfactant mediated growth and chemical stabilization of the La/B 4 C interface by nitridation. We have shown in chapter 8 that B 4 C is more readily nitridated by N 2 + bombardment during or after growth than La, which apparently yields an equilibrium that involves dinitrogen complexes. The loosely bound N or N 2 in the La/B 4 C interface substrate partially diffuses into the adlayer, resulting in surfactant mediated growth. Subsequent nitridation of the adlayer is observed, yielding nitridated interfaces that are chemically inactive to LaB 6 and LaC 2 interlayer formation. These processes occur without significantly affecting interface diffuseness when N 2 + bombardment is applied after individual layer growth, yielding local BN and more diffuse LaN formation. Complete interdiffusion is observed when N 2 + bombardment is applied during B 4 C growth. Nitridation of the interfaces has greatly improved the reflective properties of La/B 4 C multilayers. This makes application in reflective optics highly advantageous for short-wavelength light sources, e. g. the FLASH free electron laser, next generation photolithography beyond EUVL, soft x-ray spectroscopy, Rontgen fluorescence analysis and imaging...|$|E

To improve our understanding of how hypochlorite cleaning solutions affect filtration membranes, PES, PVP and thin films of PES/PVP blends have been aged by soaking in bleach water. This study was performed using 4000 ppm of free chlorine with a controlled pH of 8 and 12.

40|$|Eletrochemical {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on TiN and ZrN coated 304 stainless steels in 0. 5 N chloride containing solution to identify the effect of film thickness and Ti or Zr interlayer between TiN or ZrN coatings, respectively, on their corrosion properties. Time dependent corrosion behavior was monitored utilizing the widely used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. The corrosion resistance values were justified by the polarization resistance obtained from linear polization. Active to passive transition behavior was studied utilizing the potentiodynamic cyclic polarization test. The charge transfer resistance values obtained from both EIS and linear polarization indicated higher corrosion resistance of ZrN coated steels than the TiN coated steels; justifying our previous findings. It was approximately 106 ohm. cm 2 for the former and 6 x 105 ohm. cm 2 for the latter. Higher resistance of ZrN coated steels was attributed to formation of a passive film on the coating. Increasing the film thickness from 5 to 10 μm and laying a metal interlayer between two coating layers did not significantly change the charge transfer resistance suggesting the mechanism for protection is dominated by surface phenomena like formation of an oxide film. Cyclic polarization scans indicated that the corrosion potential of ZrN coated steels was lower than the bare steel and that of TiN coated steels slightly higher than the bare steel. The critical current density for film formation was {{an order of magnitude}} lower for ZrN coated steels than TiN coated steels; approximately 10 - 3 for the former and 10 - 2 for the latter. This suggested easier formation of oxide film on ZrN than on TiN. The passive films were in the form of ZrO 2. 2 H 2 O for the former and TiO 2. H 2 O for the latter. Increasing the coating thickness and laying an interlayer between the coating layers increased the coating breakdown potential where pits formed. The higher corrosion resistance of ZrN was then attributed to the easier formation of oxide film on its surface as suggested by the lower critical current density for film formation. Formation of passive oxide film on ZrN was investigated utilizing electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). A layer of approximately 1000 Angstrom thick containing oxygen formed on the ZrN surface after exposure for more than 60 days. This layer was identified by ZrO 2 from the binding energy value of the core electron of Zr. It was suggested that this oxide existed in the hydrated form during exposure to aqueous environment but dehydrated after removal and exposure to a laboratory environment. A broad oxygen O 1 s peak suported this argument. However, insignificant change in the oxygen content was found for TiN exposed for more than 60 days. Oxide film formation on ZrN but not on TiN was proposed as driven by the potential difference between coating and steel substrate. Lower potential of ZrN than steel promotes oxidation of the nitride to form oxide film as a protective layer. Higher potential of TiN than the substrate will not <b>promote</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nitride. The substrate oxidizes and its corrosion protective ability will depend on the passive film on the substrate. Thermodynamic calculations were carried out to construct the pH-potential or Pourbaix diagram for ZrN in water which potentially can be used as protective coating. Equilibrium potential for oxide formation from nitride is higher than from its base metal. The shape of immunity, passivity and corrosion regions of nitride follow closely that of the base metal. Theoretial prediction for choosing good protective coatings for particular metal or alloys can be made using this diagram. A local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS) technique was developed to enhance understanding of overall impedance of passive systems like stainless steel and aluminum alloys. Local impedance of passive area and pits were measured by this technique. Contribution of these local areas to the overall impedance measured by EIS were identified. Pit may not significantly change the overall impedance because the current from the small pit spread laterally to the larger passive area. The pit response is masked by the response of the passive area. Information on the local corrosion rate of pit and passive area, and pit growth behavior are obtainable from this local impedance technique which is not available from the overall impedance which only provide surface averaged response. Local charge transfer resistance and capacitance values can be used to justify the active pit model for pit in pasive system. Application of LEIS technique to monitor damage in carbon/ glass/vinyl ester composite under simulated galvanic coupling in 0. 5 N NaCl was carried out. Differences of local impedance over blisters and polymer removal regions were measured. Under open circuit condition, significant variation in local impedanec over glass and carbon regions were identified suggesting differences in electrolyte diffusion into the composite at these regions. LEIS technique was found as very useful to measure local corrosion rate and monitor damage. Further investigations on application of this technique to other corrosion system should be conducted to fully utilized its capability to map the impedance of entire corroding surface...|$|E

40|$|By {{combining}} electrical, physical, and transport/atomistic modeling results, {{this study}} identifies critical conductive filament (CF) features controlling TiN/HfO 2 /TiN resistive memory operations. The leakage current through the dielectric {{is found to}} be supported by the oxygen vacancies, which tend to segregate at hafnia grain boundaries. We simulate <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> a current path during the forming operation employing the multi-phonon trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) electron transport model. The forming process is analyzed within <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> dielectric breakdown, which exhibits much shorter characteristic times than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electroforming process conventionally employed to describe <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductive filament. The resulting conductive filament is calculated to produce a non-uniform temperature profile along its length during the reset operation, <b>promoting</b> preferential <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filament tip. A thin dielectric barrier resulting from the CF tip oxidation is found to control filament resistance in the high resistance state. Field-driven dielectric breakdown of this barrier during the set operation restores the filament to its initial low resistive state. These findings point to <b>the</b> critical importance <b>of</b> controlling <b>the</b> filament resistance characteristics (cross section, stoichiometry) during forming to achieve low power RRAM cell switching...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SCFC) operating on hydrocarbon fuels is developed. The SCFC concept is a simplification of a conventional solid oxide fuel cell in which the anode and cathode are both exposed to the same premixed fuel-air mixture, and selective catalysts <b>promote</b> electrochemical <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel at the anode and simultaneous electrochemical oxygen reduction at <b>the</b> cathode. Optimization <b>of</b> SCFC stacks requires considering complex, coupled chemical and transport processes. The model accounts for <b>the</b> coupled effects <b>of</b> gas channel fluid flow, heat transfer, porous media transport, catalytic reforming-shifting chemistry, electrochemistry, and mixed ionic-electronic conductivity.

To improve the heat dissipation at the metal/ceramic interface, a high quality bonding between the substrate and the copper conductor is needed.

40|$|Batch {{combustion}} {{of fixed}} beds of coal, bagasse and blends thereof {{took place in}} a pre-heated two-stage electric laboratory furnace, under high-heating rates. The average input fuel/air equivalence ratios were similar for all fuels. The primary and secondary furnace temperatures were varied from 800 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> fuel blending, combustion staging, and operating furnace temperatures on the emissions from the two fuels were assessed. Furnace effluents were analyzed for carbon dioxide and for products of incomplete combustion (PIC) including CO, volatile and semi-volatile hydrocarbons, as well as particulate matter. Results showed that whereas CO 2 was generated during both the observed sequential volatile matter and char combustion phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuels, PICs were only generated during the volatile matter combustion phase. CO 2 emissions were the highest from coal, whereas CO and other PIC emissions were the highest from bagasse. Under this particular combustion configuration, combustion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volatile matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blends resulted in lower yields of PIC, than combustion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volatiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neat fuels.

40|$|Several {{procedures}} for <b>the</b> demetalation <b>of</b> silver(III) corrolates have been tested.

This oxidation cannot be completely avoided by addition of hydrazine, particularly in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> 3 -NO 2 substituted complexes which are quantitatively converted into the corresponding 3 -NO 2, 5 -hydroxy isocorroles upon silver ion removal. Several beta-nitro isocorrole products were isolated, and one was structurally characterized.

While reaction with sodium borohydride was shown to be quite effective to demetalate unsubstituted silver corrolates {{this was not the case}} for the beta-nitro derivatives where the peripheral nitro group is reduced by borohydride giving the corresponding 3 -amino free base corrole species. For the beta-nitro corrole silver complexes, a successful approach was obtained using DBU/THF solutions which afforded the 3 -NO 2 corrole free-base compound as a single reaction product in good yield. These conditions were also effective for unsubstituted corroles although longer reaction times were necessary in this case. To study in greater detail the corrole demetalation behavior, selected Ag(III) derivatives were characterized by cyclic voltammetry in pyridine, and the demetalation products spectrally characterized after controlled potential reduction in a thin-layer spectroelectrochemical cell...|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{reactions}} of Cu/TaNx /Si and silicon nitride/Cu/TaNx /Si multilayers after thermal treatment at 500 and 700 ◦C under an ambient with residual oxygen were investigated using an energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM). The Cu and TaNx films were deposited onto the Si (0 0 1) wafer by ionized metal plasma (IMP) technique. An interlayer of TaOxNy was observed between Cu and TaNx diffusion barrier in the Cu/TaNx /Si sample after 500 ◦C annealing. It {{is evident that}} oxygen diffused through the Cu grain boundaries and <b>promotes</b> <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ta nitride barrier layer to form the TaOxNy. It is {{also found that the}} as-deposited TaNx (x ∼ 0. 5) film with nano-crystalline microstructure would transform into Ta 2 N structure with large grain character after 500 ◦C heat treatment. After 700 ◦C annealing, not only the TaNx barrier layer transformed into Ta 2 N but <b>the</b> silicidation <b>of</b> Cu to Cu 3 Si and TaNx to Ta 5 Si 3 occurred. However, no TaOxNy interlayer was observed. This may result from <b>the</b> preferable <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> Cu 3 Si that may suppress <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> TaNx. Nevertheless, in the silicon nitride capped (silicon nitride/Cu/TaNx /Si) case, there was no TaOxNy interlayer observed in the 500 ◦C annealed specimen. And the interfacial reaction in the silicon nitride/Cu/TaNx /Si annealed specimen at 700 ◦C also showed much less severe extent than the sample without capping.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between NO (0. 01 to 200 ppm) and n-butane (50 to 600 ppm) in air {{has been investigated}} in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from 330 ° C to 450 ° C (600 K to 720 K). Low concentrations of NO in n-butane/air systems <b>promote</b> <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> n-butane; conversely, low concentrations of n-butane in air <b>promote</b> <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>of</b> NO to NO 2. For given [NO]/[n-butane] ratio and reaction time, there is a critical sharply-defined 'crossover' temperature at which the system goes from being unreactive to reactive, with 100 % conversion NO→NO 2 occurring at T>Tcrossover. The crossover temperature increases, and becomes less sharply defined, with increasing [NO]/[n-butane] ratio. The conversion NO→NO 2 is accompanied by <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> n-butane and <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> CH 3 CHO, CO, HCHO, (CH 3) 2 CO, various butenes, and propene. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> n-butane consumption depends in a complex manner on the experimental conditions especially on <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiment temperature to the characteristic turnover temperature which marks <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> negative temperature coefficient (NTC) for n-butane/air reaction (≈ 380 ° C or 650 K).
