40|$|At the University of Twente, a fetal {{heart monitor}} {{based on a}} high-TC SQUID {{magnetometer}} system is under development. The purpose of this system is to measure a fetal heart signal in a clin. environment. For cooling a first demonstrator version, a closed-cycle Joule-Thomson cooler from APD Cryogenics - the Cryotiger? - was selected. In this work, the Cryotiger is characterised with respect to three noise generating mechanisms: electromagnetic interference, mech. vibrations and temp. fluctuations. The electromagnetic interference of the cold tip was below the resoln. of our 3 -axis fluxgate magnetometer (7 pT/?Hz). The interference from the compressor, however, requires it to be placed 2 m or more from the sensor head {{in order to remain}} below the environmental <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>disturbances.</b> As mech. vibrations of a magnetometer in a background field - the earth magnetic field - will result in an apparent field at the frequency of vibration, we require the rotation of the cold tip to remain below 200 micro rad in the frequency band of interest (0. 5 - 100 Hz). This was checked by applying a magnetic field to a SQUID magnetometer mounted on the cooler's cold tip. In this way, rotations of 3 micro rad and translations of 40 nm of the Cryotiger were measured; both at a frequency of 49 Hz. A further issue with respect to our application is the fluctuation in operating temp. Under no-load operation, the temp. occasionally increased from around 70 K to about 82 K. With a load of roughly 2 W, a temp. of about 74 K was obtained, which increased about 2 K over a 20 day period. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of narrowband interference near frequencies carrying information {{is a common}} problem in modern control and signal processing applications. A very narrow notch filter is {{required in order to}} remove the unwanted signal while not compromising the integrity of the carrier signal. In many practical situations, the interference may wander within a frequency band, in which case a wider notch filter would be needed to guarantee its removal, which may also allow for the degradation of information being carried in nearby frequencies. If the interference frequency could be autonomously tracked, a narrow bandwidth notch filter could be successfully implemented for the particular frequency. Adaptive signal processing is a powerful technique {{that can be used in}} the tracking and elimination of such a signal. An application where an adaptive notch filter becomes necessary is in biomedical instrumentation, such as the electrocardiogram recorder. The recordings can become useless when in the presence of electromagnetic fields generated by <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Research was conducted to fully characterize the interference. Research on notch filter structures and adaptive filter algorithms has been carried out. The lattice form filter structure was chosen for its inherent stability and performance benefits. A new adaptive filter algorithm was developed targeting a hardware implementation. The algorithm used techniques from several other algorithms that were found to be beneficial. This work developed the hardware implementation of a lattice form adaptive notch filter to be used for the removal of <b>power</b> <b>line</b> interference from electrocardiogram signals. The various design tradeo s encountered were documented. The final design was targeted toward multiple field programmable gate arrays using multiple optimization efforts. Those results were then compared. The adaptive notch filter was able to successfully track and remove the interfering signal. The lattice form structure utilized by the proposed filter was verified to exhibit an inherently stable realization. The filter was subjected to various environments that modeled the different <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>disturbances</b> that could be present. The final filter design resulted in a 3 dB bandwidth of 15. 8908 Hz, and a null depth of 54 dB. For the baseline test case, the algorithm achieved convergence after 270 iterations. The final hardware implementation was successfully verified against the MATLAB simulation results. A speedup of 3. 8 was seen between the Xilinx Virtex- 5 and Spartan-II device technologies. The final design used a small fraction of the available resources for each of the two devices that were characterized.
