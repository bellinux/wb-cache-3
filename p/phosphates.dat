In all tissues examined, dihydroxyacetone <b>phosphate</b> entered phosphatidate more rapidly via acyl dihydroxyacetone <b>phosphate</b> than via glycerol <b>phosphate.</b> Tissues with a relatively low rate of phosphatidate synthesis via glycerol <b>phosphate,</b> showed no compensating increase in the rate of synthesis via acyl dihydroxyacetone <b>phosphate.</b> The rates at which tissue homogenates synthesize phosphatidate from dihydroxyacetone <b>phosphate</b> via glycerol <b>phosphate</b> increase as glycerol <b>phosphate</b> dehydrogenase increases.

One of the most important classes of ligands are <b>phosphate</b> esters. In this thesis I describe the investigation of some <b>phosphate</b> ester-metal ion equilibria.

In addition, the complexation of 1 -naphthyl <b>phosphate,</b> 8 -quinolyl <b>phosphate</b> and 8 -quinolyl methyl <b>phosphate</b> with nickel and cobalt ions was also studied.

Group A received a normal (0. 8 %) <b>phosphate</b> meal, followed by saline infusion; Group B, a low (0. 03 %) <b>phosphate</b> meal, followed by saline infusion; Group C, a low <b>phosphate</b> meal, followed by infusion of somatostatin to suppress endogenous insulin secretion; and Group D, a low <b>phosphate</b> meal, followed by infusion of somatostatin plus insulin.

Following a low <b>phosphate</b> meal in Groups B, C, and D, there was a decrease in plasma <b>phosphate,</b> as compared with Group A.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of extracellular <b>phosphate,</b> the mechanisms and control of intestinal <b>phosphate</b> transport remain unclear. The present study used in vivo and in vitro methods to compare the extent of Na+- dependent versus Na+-independent <b>phosphate</b> transport along the rat small intestine and colon at different luminal <b>phosphate</b> concentrations. Na+-dependent and Na+-independent <b>phosphate</b> transport and genomic expression of type II (NaPi-II) and type III (PiT) transporters in young (3 - week old) and adult (8 - and 16 -week old) animals fed a control or low <b>phosphate</b> diet have also been quantified. mRNA levels of Na+- dependent <b>phosphate</b> transporters have been analysed in the 5 / 6 nephrectomy model of chronic renal failure and following treatment with matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE). The acute effects of altered luminal <b>phosphate</b> concentration on intestinal <b>phosphate</b> transport and renal <b>phosphate</b> transporter expression was also assessed. The findings confirm the jejunum {{to be the main}} site of Na+-dependent <b>phosphate</b> absorption under both normal and low dietary <b>phosphate</b> conditions. Low <b>phosphate</b> diet upregulates Na+-dependent and Na+- independent <b>phosphate</b> transport in both duodenum and jejunum, whereas age only affects Na+-dependent component in the duodenum and jejunum. When luminal <b>phosphate</b> concentrations are in the physiological (millimolar) range, absorption in the jejunum displays less Na+-dependency and is unlikely to be mediated exclusively by the Na+- dependent NaPi-IIb cotransporter. In the ileum, again using millimolar luminal <b>phosphate</b> concentrations, significant Na+-dependent <b>phosphate</b> transport was detected, but the rate of <b>phosphate</b> absorption was lower than in the jejunum. Since NaPi-IIb is not expressed at the rat ileal brush-border membrane (BBM), the presence of significant Na+- dependent <b>phosphate</b> transport suggests an alternative <b>phosphate</b> uptake pathway in the ileum. At millimolar luminal <b>phosphate</b> concentrations in the distal colon, only Na+-independent <b>phosphate</b> absorption was detected. Thus, at concentrations of <b>phosphate</b> normally present in the intestinal lumen, Na+-independent pathways of <b>phosphate</b> absorption are present in the proximal small intestine and distal colon, as well as a non-NaPi-IIb-mediated Na+-dependent pathway in the distal small intestine. PiT 2 assumes a dominant role in <b>phosphate</b> transport in the jejunum of pre-weaned animals, and in the kidneys of animals fed a low <b>phosphate</b> diet. PiT 1 transporter is not regulated by age or low <b>phosphate</b> diet at the genomic level. Chronic renal failure reduces intestinal and renal expression of the major transporter NaPi-II, and also PiT 1 and PiT 2. However, MEPE reduces intestinal expression of NaPi-IIb and PiT 2 alone in chronic renal failure animals. Acute duodenal instillation of either 15 mM or 1. 3 M <b>phosphate</b> did not affect the renal BBM protein expression of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc.
