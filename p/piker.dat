5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a <b>piker</b> {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

Then, {{in the summer of}} 1999 they toured with the show Det æ'kke lett å være hann which was described as a stand-up musical, where Falsk did most of the talking with his stand-up routine, while Mathisen played guitar in the backing band.|$|E

50|$|In 1769-70 {{during the}} 1768-74 Russian-Ottoman War {{there was an}} {{uprising}} among the Dnieper and Donets <b>Pikers</b> regiments. The unrest started on territory of today's Poltava Oblast and eventually spread across the lands of the Zaporizhian Host. It was mercilessly put down by Russian Imperial forces and its instigators were punished by knout or sent to katorga.

2500|$|... "Spotty Powder" [...] {{was first}} {{published}} as a short story in 1973. In 2005, The Times reprinted [...] "Spotty Powder" [...] as a [...] "lost" [...] chapter, saying it {{had been found in}} Dahl's desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the way Leonardo da Vinci wrote his journal). This chapter describes Spotty Powder, which looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not have to go to school. The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda <b>Piker</b> and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty Powder room to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs <b>Piker</b> interpreted as screams. Mr Wonka assures her (after making a brief joke where he claims that headmasters are one of the occasional ingredients) it was only laughter. Exactly what happened to them is not revealed in the extract.|$|E

2500|$|A {{castrated}} male {{is called}} a steer in the United States; older steers are often called bullocks {{in other parts of}} the world, but in North America this term refers to a young bull. [...] <b>Piker</b> bullocks are micky bulls (uncastrated young male bulls) that were caught, castrated and then later lost. [...] In Australia, the term Japanese ox is used for grain-fed steers in the weight range of 500 to 650kg that are destined for the Japanese meat trade. In North America, draft cattle under four years old are called working steers. [...] Improper or late castration on a bull results in it becoming a coarse steer known as a stag in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In some countries, an incompletely castrated male is known also as a rig.|$|E

60|$|Babbitt's virtues as a {{real-estate}} broker--as the servant {{of society in}} the department of finding homes for families and shops for distributors of food--were steadiness and diligence. He was conventionally honest, he kept his records of buyers and sellers complete, he had experience with leases and titles and an excellent memory for prices. His shoulders were broad enough, his voice deep enough, his relish of hearty humor strong enough, to establish him as one of the ruling caste of Good Fellows. Yet his eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and complacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned out by speculative builders; all landscape gardening save the use of curving roads, grass, and six ordinary shrubs; and all the commonest axioms of economics. He serenely believed that the one purpose of the real-estate business was to make money for George F. Babbitt. True, it was a good advertisement at Boosters' Club lunches, and all the varieties of Annual Banquets to which Good Fellows were invited, to speak sonorously of Unselfish Public Service, the Broker's Obligation to Keep Inviolate the Trust of His Clients, and a thing called Ethics, whose nature was confusing but if you had it you were a High-class Realtor and if you hadn't you were a shyster, a <b>piker,</b> and a fly-by-night. These virtues awakened Confidence, and enabled you to handle Bigger Propositions. But they didn't imply that you were to be impractical and refuse to take twice the value of a house if a buyer was such an idiot that he didn't jew you down on the asking-price.|$|E

50|$|In 1625, at Lake Kurukove in Kremenchuk, the Treaty of Kurukove {{was signed}} between the Cossacks and the Poles.

Following the 1654-1667 Polish-Muscovite war and Treaty of Andrusovo, the city was secured by Tsardom of Muscovy and became part of the Myrhorod Polk (regiment) within the left-bank Cossack Hetmanate. The city played a key role of the Muscovite colonization policy of Ukraine and their strive for the shores of Black Seas as regional administrative center of the early Novorossiya Governorate and Yekaterinoslav Vice-regency (Namestnichestvo). With creation of Novorossiya Governorate, in Kremenchuk was created Dnieper <b>Pikers</b> Regiment and coincidentally few years later (1768-69) in the neighboring regions of Poland started out so called Koliyivshchyna (literally the <b>Piker's</b> unrest).|$|R
