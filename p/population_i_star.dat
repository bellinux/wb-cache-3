5|$|In {{the center}} of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is {{believed}} to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, <b>population</b> <b>I</b> <b>stars.</b> The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.|$|R
50|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} this star {{indicates that it}} is a young, <b>population</b> <b>I</b> <b>star.</b> However, the chemical abundances in its outer atmosphere tell a different story, suggesting {{that it is a}} population II star with an age of 12−13 billion years. This discrepancy may indicate that the star has undergone a period of mass accretion. Possible scenarios indicate that the star has either undergone a merger with a close companion, or else interacted with the progenitor cloud of the nearby open cluster NGC 2516.|$|E
5000|$|HD 23079 {{is a star}} {{approximately}} 114 {{light years}} away in the constellation Reticulum. Since the star is magnitude 7.1, it is not {{visible to the naked}} eye, but at least in binoculars, it should be easily visible. The spectral type is F8 or G0, it is a main-sequence (hydrogen-fusing) star. The star is larger and more massive than our Sun. As it is typical for planet-harboring stars, it is a <b>population</b> <b>I</b> <b>star,</b> with metallicity of -0.24 dex (58% solar). The age of the star is 6.53 billion years old, older than Sun’s 4.57 billion years.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{ordinary}} main-sequence stars, cool subdwarfs (of spectral types G to M) {{produce their}} energy from hydrogen fusion. The explanation of their underluminosity lies in their low metallicity: these stars are unenriched in elements heavier than helium. The lower metallicity decreases the opacity of their outer layers and decreases the radiation pressure, {{resulting in a}} smaller, hotter star for a given mass. [...] This lower opacity also allows them to emit {{a higher percentage of}} ultraviolet light for the same spectral type relative to a <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> <b>star,</b> a feature known as the ultraviolet excess.Usually members of the Milky Way's halo, they frequently have high space velocities relative to the Sun.|$|E
40|$|Two new UV-bright stars {{detected}} within 2 arcmin of {{the center}} of Omega Cen are spectroscopically investigated with the short-wavelength spectrograph of the IUE. The IUE spectra of the UV-bright stars UIT- 1 and UIT- 2 in the core of Omega Cen superficially resemble those of <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> mid-B <b>stars.</b> The absorption lines of the core UV-bright stars are significantly weaker than in <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> <b>stars,</b> consistent with their membership in the cluster. Synthetic spectra calculated from low-metallicity Kurucz model stellar atmospheres are compared with the spectra. These objects are insufficiently luminous to be classical hydrogen-burning post-AGB stars. They may be evolved hot horizontal branch stars which have been brightened by more than 3 mag since leaving the zero-age horizontal branch. It is inferred from the spectra and luminosity of the core UV-bright stars that similar objects could provide the source of the UV light in elliptical galaxies...|$|R

50|$|The oldest {{observed}} stars, {{known as}} Population II, have very low metallicities; as subsequent generations of stars were born they became more metal-enriched, as the gaseous clouds {{from which they}} formed received the metal-rich dust manufactured by previous generations. As those stars died, they returned metal-enriched material to the interstellar medium via planetary nebulae and supernovae, enriching further the nebulae out of which the newer stars formed. These youngest stars, including the Sun, therefore have the highest metal content, and are known as <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Population I, or metal-rich stars, {{are those}} young stars whose {{metallicity}} is highest. The high metallicity of population I stars {{makes them more}} likely to possess planetary systems than older populations, because planets form by the accretion of metals.

Generally, the youngest stars, the extreme population I, are found farther in and intermediate population I stars are farther out, etc. The Sun is considered an intermediate <b>population</b> <b>I</b> <b>star.</b> Population I stars have regular elliptical orbits around the Galactic Center, with a low relative velocity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distance}} {{calculated from}} the nebular expansion rate is 3.35kpc, which is less than previous studies, and the resulting luminosity of 150,000 times the sun (...) is much lower than previously calculated.

Previous studies found distances of 5kpc to 8.4kpc, with corresponding luminosities of , as expected for a typical WN8h {{which is a very}} young star just moving away from the main sequence. This may be an uncommon post-red-supergiant WN star with some hydrogen still remaining. In this case WR 124 would be much older, around 8.6 million years, but the luminosity is still lower than predicted by theory. [...] WR stars of lower metallicity can form from lower mass progenitors and have lower luminosity, but this would be unusual for a <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> <b>star</b> within the Milky Way.|$|E

The space velocity components of this star in the galactic coordinate system are V, = -1.0, -7.2 km s−1.

40|$|The {{existence}} of faint blue stars {{far above the}} galactic plane, which have spectra {{that are similar to}} nearby <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> B <b>stars,</b> present several interesting questions. Among them are: Can a <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> B <b>star</b> travel from the disk to a position many kiloparsecs above the plane in a relatively short main sequence lifetime? Is it possible that single massive star formation is occurring far from the galactic plane? Are these objects something else masquerading as main sequence B stars? This paper (the first of two) analyzes the abundances of a sample of these stars and reveals several which are chemically similar to nearby <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> B <b>stars</b> while others clearly have abundance patterns more like those expected in BHB or PAGB stars. Several of those with old evolved star abundances also have interesting features of note in their spectra. We also consider why this sample does not have any classical Be stars and identify at least two nearby solar metallicity BHB stars.

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> <b>stars</b> such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{stars with}} lower {{metallicity}} are smaller and hotter than stars with higher metallicity. For subgiants, this {{is complicated by}} different ages and core masses at the main sequence turnoff. Low metallicity stars develop a larger helium core before leaving the main sequence, hence lower mass stars show a hook {{at the start of}} the subgiant branch. The helium core mass of a Z=0.001 (extreme population II) [...] star at the end of the main sequence is nearly double that of a Z=0.02 (<b>population</b> <b>I)</b> <b>star.</b> The low metallicity star is also over 1,000 K hotter and over twice as luminous {{at the start of the}} subgiant branch. The difference in temperature is less pronounced at the end of the subgiant branch, but the low metallicity star is larger and nearly four times as luminous. Similar differences exist in the evolution of stars with other masses, and key values such as the mass of a star that will become a supergiant instead of reaching the red giant branch are lower at low metallicity.|$|E

The Sun is an intermediate <b>Population</b> <b>I</b> <b>star.</b> Population I stars have regular elliptical orbits of the galactic centre, with a low relative velocity. It was hypothesized that the high metallicity of Population I stars makes them more likely to possess planetary systems than the other two populations, because planets, particularly terrestrial planets, are thought to be formed by the accretion of metals. However, observations of the Kepler data-set have found smaller planets around stars with a range of metallicities, while only larger, potential gas giant planets are concentrated around stars with relatively higher metallicity — a finding that has implications for theories of gas giant formation.
