5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic <b>pain.</b> <b>For</b> those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and <b>pain.</b> <b>For</b> several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler had been playing with a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing through the <b>pain</b> <b>for</b> several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of <b>pain.</b> <b>For</b> acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred <b>pain.</b> <b>For</b> acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a {{passenger}} {{in a private}} Aero Commander 680 airplane that was flying in bad weather from Washington to Massachusetts. The plane crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy's aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh and spent months in a hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. He suffered chronic back <b>pain</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of his}} life as a result of the accident. Kennedy took advantage of his long convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care services. His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his Republican opponent by a three-to-one margin.|$|E

5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of <b>pain</b> <b>for</b> the rest of his life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E

The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat {{would not want to}} take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through <b>pain</b> <b>for</b> his own sake.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{studies have}} focused on {{identifying}} predictors of medical consultation <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> in healthy children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: This investigation sought to identify parent and child laboratory and non-laboratory predictors of pediatric healthcare utilization <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> problems. STUDY GROUP: Participants were 210 healthy children and adolescents (102 girls), aged 8 - 17 years who took part in a laboratory pain session. METHODS: Three months after the laboratory session, participants were contacted by telephone to ascertain whether they had experienced pain and whether they had seen a healthcare professional <b>for</b> <b>pain.</b> Zero-order correlations among sociodemographic status, child laboratory pain responses, parent physical/mental health status and medical consultation <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> were conducted to identify relevant correlates of pediatric healthcare utilization; these correlates were subjected to multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses indicated that higher anticipated <b>pain</b> and bother <b>for</b> the cold pressor task, as well as poorer parent physical health status, were associated with pediatric medical consultation <b>for</b> <b>pain,</b> but only among girls. Sequential logistic regression analyses controlling for child age indicated that only parent physical health status, not the laboratory indicators, significantly predicted healthcare consultation <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> among girls. No parent or child correlates of care-seeking <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> emerged <b>for</b> boys. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that parents 2 ̆ 7 perceived physical health plays a role in determining whether medical care is sought <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> complaints in healthy girls. These results suggest that interventions to assist parents in managing their own physical health problems could lead to reductions in medical consultation for girls 2 ̆ 7 pain...|$|R
