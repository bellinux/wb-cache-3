40|$|Decision {{making in}} daily {{maintenance}} requires consideration of multiple factors. The {{importance of each}} of the factors fluctuates depending on the repair scenario and the needs of the maintainer.

40|$|Abstract. A {{distributed}} {{constraint satisfaction}} problem (Distributed CSP) is a CSP in which variables and constraints are distributed among multiple automated agents, and various application problems in Distributed Artificial Intelligence can be formalized as Distributed CSPs. We {{develop a new}} algorithm for solving Distributed CSPs called asynchronous weak-commitment search, which is inspired by the weak-commitment search algorithm for solving CSPs. This algorithm can revise a bad decision without an exhaustive search by changing the <b>priority</b> order <b>of</b> agents dynamically. Furthermore, agents can act asynchronously and concurrently based on their local knowledge without any global control, while guaranteeing the completeness of the algorithm. The experimental results on various example problems show that this algorithm is by far more efficient than the asynchronous backtracking algorithm for solving Distributed CSPs, in which the priority order is static. The priority order represents a hierarchy of agent authority, i. e., the <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making. Therefore, these results imply that a flexible agent organization, in which the hierarchical order is changed dynamically, actually performs better than an organization in which the hierarchical order is static and rigid. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{shipping}} industry {{represents a}} large sector {{with a wide}} range and significant scale of impacts. This underlines the need for sustainable decision making, which ensures the economic viability of operations in the long term, whilst reducing environmental impacts and health and safety risks. The demand for integrated tools that enable decision makers to integrate a holistic set of sustainability measures has already been pointed out in the literature, ideally considering the whole life cycle. In this Thesis, a multi-criteria decision support framework has been developed to evaluate the implementation of different material options on a life cycle basis. This comprises an evaluation of Life Cycle Costs (LCC), Environmental Impacts (EI) and Risk Assessment (RA) alongside each other, explicitly accounting for uncertainties in the inputs. Subsequently, all these aspects are integrated through a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach, allowing to account for different perspectives and <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> maker. The framework was used to evaluate High-Strength Low-Alloy steel (HSLA) and advanced composites to replace conventional steel in ship structures. Results show the potential of these materials, indicating significant financial and emission savings over the life cycle, despite their higher initial costs. However, currently uncertainties and consequently risks are present and the approach shows how to account for these depending on the <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> maker. It is demonstrated that the approach provides structured decision support for sustainable material choices. The novelty lies in integrating different sustainability aspects in one coherent framework, taking a life cycle perspective. By doing this it is possible to integrate different types of data and explicitly account for different stakeholder perspectives and decision maker priorities. Another key feature is the clear visualisation of results, facilitating transparent communication to support the decision making process. Whilst the contribution of the research presented is demonstrated for the shipping sector, the potential of applying the framework and the methodology in other industrial applications is highlighted...|$|R

The evaluation includes ten Departments and six agencies of the Federal Government representing 74 percent of the total budget authority of 560 billion dollars. It is based on the information received in responses from federal agencies to the Office of Management and Budget Eleven major criteria were formulated for use in evaluating the applicability of the ZBB process and its performance in the individual agencies. A scoring model was used to determine the effectiveness of the ZBB process within each agency, as well as across agencies. ZBB was perceived by federal agencies as an effective tool for use in the allocation of limited resources. The following aspects of ZBB were ranked in the order in which they yield the greatest benefits in producing effective budgets: (a) <b>priority</b> ranking <b>of</b> agency programs, (b) participation of management in decisionmaking, and (c) conducting trade-offs within and across programs. In most cases, the increased participation (extent and quality) resulted in the establishment of a close link with top management and an enhanced understanding <b>of</b> organizational objectives, <b>priorities,</b> and resource allocations to various programs. The use of ZBB was not intended to and did not, in fact, produce significant tangible cost savings in federal agency 1979 budgets, but did result in reallocations of resources to activities with higher priority. Most federal agencies believed that the use of ZBB required excessive expenditures of time and effort. The agencies felt that ZBB was not particularly applicable to "uncontrollable" programs and hence the time and effort spent on using ZBB in these decision units was not beneficial. The agencies faced problems in developing "minimum level" packages which represent lowest level budgets for the organizational units. Most agencies used an arbitrary percentage reduction from the existing level to force uniformity across all <b>decision</b> units. Use <b>of</b> a predefined "minimum level" may have precluded a zero-base analysis <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> units which is the major cornerstone <b>of</b> ZBB. <b>Priority</b> ranking <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> packages at the subordinate management level was usually carried out by managers using their own independent judgments. At the top agency level, most agencies used formal ranking procedures and collegial panels to produce the initial ranking <b>of</b> agency-wide <b>decision</b> packages. The difficulties agencies faced in determining <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> packages included ranking those functions/activities that were dissimilar and/or interrelated and considering those activities not having measurable outputs or distinct workload measures. accounting: operating budgets, zero-base budgeting...|$|R

Much environmental information has the obvious spatial character that can be addressed by GIS. Fuzziness is a type of imprecision characterizing classes that for various reasons cannot have, or don’t have sharply defined boundaries. This {{is very different from the}} conventional set theory which only considers two state- inclusion or exclusion, not partially belonging. It can provide a framework to solve this fuzziness problem in the procedure of evaluation of urban quality. Many of the environmental information include fuzzy uncertainty. Many of environmental evaluation problems are characterized by imprecision and absence of sharply defined criteria of class or set membership. Evaluation methods which recognize the inherently fuzzy nature of environmental problems are needed. Because of the fuzzy uncertainty and spatial characteristic of environmental phenomenon, the integration of fuzzy set theory and GIS in environmental quality evaluation is needed.

Meanwhile, there is an abundance of technological solutions that help “clean” agriculture’s hotspots, either by reducing inputs, by producing renewable energy or by protecting ecosystems. Decisions about clean technologies remain difficult due to the variety of options, difficulties in cost-benefit calculations, and potential trade-offs in sustainability. We therefore addressed the issue of decision-making regarding clean technologies in agriculture. A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was used to rank the most sustainable technologies. Evaluation of 17 selected clean technologies was based on literature information and expert opinion. Wireless sensor irrigation networks, frequency converters for vacuum pumps and stable air conditioning, PV electricity and drip irrigation were the five technologies with the highest sustainability scores, outperforming the 12 other clean technologies. When all sustainability dimensions and criteria were equally weighted, PV electricity was superseded by variable speed drive technology for irrigation in the top five.

Our recent detailed investigation of shale gas and shale oil plays in China found that the source rock intervals in China’s lacustrine basins are highly heterogeneous, having dominantly organic-rich shale source rock with thin interbeds of organic-lean siltstone, sandstone and carbonates (Jiang et al. 2015, 2016). For the most part, these thin zones within the source rock interval received only minor attention in the past since hydrocarbons do not flow without stimulation.|$|R
40|$|The {{expectations}} of patients have dramatically {{changed since the}} introduction of the first public health services more than a decade ago, as have the surrounding conditions a health system has to tackle. The grown health systems of the industrialised countries counter the challenges of an ageing society, technological advancement and chronic disease by a state of constant reform, which has been present for the last few years, without the abolition of the basic principles of affordability, accessibility and solidarity. One solution to answer all these expectations and requirements is so-called "integrated care", a patient-centred model, which propagates better processes, coordination and cooperation between the different service providers and sectors in health care. Based on a comprehensive discussion of the existing theories on health systems analysis, decision making and performance measurement in health as well as the trade-offs emerging therefrom, {{the first part of this}} thesis examines the changing conditions and expectations as well as problem areas of organisation and restructuring in health care systems. This analysis serves as a foundation for {{the introduction of the}} integrated care concept, an international expert questionnaire on the decision making in integrated care and conclusions on <b>priority</b> setting <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> makers in health. The analysis of the results demonstrates the high value that is placed on a clear political framework and incentives for the promotion of integrated care, as well as the substantive demand for improved communication, coordination and information structures.
