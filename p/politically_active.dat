5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} <b>politically</b> <b>active</b> in {{the years}} following the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes.

The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E

Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto of a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race.

Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E
