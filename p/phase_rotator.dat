30|$|Our current {{measurements}} {{and the fact}} that RT 42 is an alkane mixture now sheds some light on the differing c_p values. The <b>rotator</b> <b>phases</b> of the pure alkanes persist in mixtures of alkanes, at least provided the differences in chain length of the components are not too different; also, the temperature range in which the <b>rotator</b> <b>phases</b> exist is broadened [34, 52, 53]. Combining this information with our measurements, we conclude that RT 42 displays a normal crystalline phase below 10 ^∘C, a first <b>rotator</b> <b>phase</b> between 16 and 26 ^∘C, and a second <b>rotator</b> <b>phase</b> between 29 and 36 ^∘C, finally followed by the liquid phase above 42 ^∘C. Calorimetric data do not allow the identification of the phases, but a best guess based on the phase diagram of the pure alkanes with similar melting points suggests that the lower rotator is the R_I phase and the upper one the R_II phase. It is likely that similar conclusions can be drawn for many other Rubitherm RT PCMs, and more generally for any alkane-based PCM.|$|R

40|$|In modern RF {{system on}} chips (SoCs), the digital content consumes up to 85 % of the IC chip area. The recent push to {{integrate}} multiple RF-SoC cores is met with heavy resistance by the remaining RF/analog circuitry, which creates numerous strong aggressors and weak victims leading to RF performance degradation. A key such mechanism is injection pulling through parasitic coupling between various $LC$-tank oscillators {{as well as}} between them and strong transmitter (TX) outputs. Any static or dynamic frequency proximity between aggressors (i. e., oscillators and TX outputs) and victims (i. e., oscillators) that share the same die causes injection pulling, which produces unwanted spurs and/or modulation distortion. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a new frequency planning technique of a multicore TX where each $LC$-tank oscillator is separated from other aggressors beyond its pulling range. This is done by breaking the integer harmonic frequency relationship of victims/aggressors within and between the RF transmission channels using digital fractional divider based on a phase rotation. Each oscillator's center frequency can be fractionally separated by ~ 28 % but, at the same time, both producing closely spaced frequencies at the <b>phase</b> <b>rotator</b> outputs. The injection-pulling spurs are so far away that they are insignificantly small (- 80 dBc) and coincide with the second harmonic of the carrier.

As seen above, C 23 has additional phases between the crystal and the liquid. The presence of these so-called <b>rotator</b> <b>phases</b> is a common phenomenon for alkanes of intermediate chain length n [34, 45, 49].

We analyse {{the influence of the}} fluctuations of both thermal noise and frequencies (seen as a disorder) on a large but finite population of $N$ rotators, in the case where the law of the disorder is symmetric. On a finite time scale $[0,T]$, the system is known to be self-averaging: the empirical measure of the system converges as $N\to\infty$ to the deterministic solution of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation which exhibits a stable manifold of synchronized stationary profiles for large interaction. On longer time scales, competition between the finite-size effects of the noise and disorder makes the system deviate from this mean-field behavior. In the main result of the paper we show that on a time scale of order $\sqrt N$ the fluctuations of the disorder prevail over the fluctuations of the noise: we establish the existence of disorder-induced traveling waves for the empirical measure along the stationary manifold.

In addition, more than 20 designs are under study for the acceleration of protons, heavy ions, electrons and muons, with applications as diverse as treating cancer, irradiating materials, driving subcritical reactors, boosting highenergy proton intensity, and producing neutrinos. Moreover, it has become apparent that FFAG designs need not be restricted to the traditional 'scaling ' approach, in which the orbit shape, optics and tunes are kept fixed. Dropping this restriction has revealed a range of interesting new design possibilities. This paper will review the various approaches being taken...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades the puissant desire to miniaturize the digital {{circuits}} to achieve higher speed and larger density has shaped the evolution of the silicon-based technologies. This development opens a new era in the field of millimeter-wave electronics in which many low-cost high-yield silicon-based transistors can be used on a single chip to enable creation of novel architectures with unique properties not achievable with old processes. In addition to this high level of integration capability, the die size of comparable or even larger than the wave-length makes it possible to integrate antennas, transceivers, and digital circuitry all on a single silicon die. It is important to realize that although smaller parasitic capacitors and shorter transistor channels have improved fT and fmax of transistors, extremely thin metal layers, highly doped substrates, and low breakdown voltage transistors have severely affected the performance of analog and RF building blocks. For example, thin metal layers have increased the loss and lowered the quality factor of the building blocks such as capacitors and inductors and low breakdown voltage transistors have made the power generation quite challenging. Additionally, if not carefully designed, small wave-lengths in the millimeter-wave range may cause unintended radiation by on-chip components. In this dissertation, we address these issues in design of millimeter-wave silicon-based single-chip phased-array transceivers with integrated antennas. We also introduce the technique of Direct Antenna Modulation (DAM) and implement two proof-of-concept chips operating at 60 GHz. We will present the receiver and the on-chip antenna sections of a fully integrated 77 GHz four-element phased-array transceiver with on-chip antennas in silicon. The receiver section of the chip includes the complete down-conversion path comprising low-noise amplifier (LNA), frequency synthesizer, <b>phase</b> <b>rotators,</b> combining amplifiers, and on-chip dipole antennas. The signal combining is performed using a novel distributed active combining amplifier at an IF of 26 GHz. In the LO path, the output of the 52 GHz VCO is routed to different elements and can be phase shifted locally by the <b>phase</b> <b>rotators.</b> A silicon lens on the backside is used to reduce the loss due to the surface-wave power of the silicon substrate. Our measurements show a single-element LNA gain of 23 dB and a noise figure of 6. 0 dB. Each of the four receive paths has a gain of 37 dB and a noise figure of 8. 0 dB. Each on-chip antenna has a gain of + 8 dBi. A direct antenna modulation (DAM) technique is also introduced, where the radiated far-field signal is modulated by time-varying changes in the antenna near-field electromagnetic (EM) boundary conditions. This enables the transmitter to send data in a direction-dependent fashion producing a secure communication link. The transmitter architecture makes it possible to use narrow-band highly-efficient switching power amplifiers to transmit wideband constant and non-constant envelope modulated signals. Theoretically, these systems are capable of transmitting independent data in multiple directions at full-rate concurrently using a single transmitter. Direct antenna modulation (DAM) can be performed by using either switches or varactors. Two proof-of-concept DAM transmitters operating at 60 GHz using switches and varactors are demonstrated in silicon proving the feasibility of this approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{continuation}} {{of our work}} in [A. P. Gantapara et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 015501 (2013) ], we investigate here the thermodynamic phase behavior {{of a family of}} truncated hard cubes, for which the shape evolves smoothly from a cube via a cuboctahedron to an octahedron. We used Monte Carlo simulations and free-energy calculations to establish the full phase diagram. This phase diagram exhibits a remarkable richness in crystal and mesophase structures, depending sensitively on the precise particle shape. In addition, we examined in detail the nature of the plastic crystal (<b>rotator)</b> <b>phases</b> that appear for intermediate densities and levels of truncation. Our results allow us to probe the relation between phase behavior and building-block shape and to further the understanding of <b>rotator</b> <b>phases.</b> Furthermore, the phase diagram presented here should prove instrumental for guiding future experimental studies on similarly-haped nanoparticles and the creation of new materials.
