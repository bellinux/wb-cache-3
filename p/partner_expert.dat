It proves a necessity of development of role scenarios under conditions of application of the competence approach in training and practical activity. Thus, the author offers five key roles in activity of a personnel management specialist, which reflect different vectors of directions of the scenario of professional activity regardless of the performed function and position. The article specifies the following roles in the offered classification: <b>partner,</b> <b>expert,</b> communicator, consultant and curator. It presents results of a sociological study, which demonstrate the degree of co-ordination of opinions of employers and practicing personnel managers with respect to performance of roles in the sphere by their professional activity by the latter. This helps to identify a number of problems, which include the problem of availability of reserves of increase {{of the level of}} competence of personnel management specialists. This issue, in its turn, closely deals with main aspects of formation of competitiveness of the said specialists, since the degree of formation of competences is the key condition of formation of competitive advantages...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increased}} popularity of organic food production, {{new information about}} the risks attached to food products has become available. Consumers need {{to make sense of}} this information, interpret the information in terms of risks and benefits, and consequently choose whether to buy these products or not. In this study, we examined how social media mediated interaction with another person impacts risk perception and sense-making regarding eating organic food. Specifically, we investigated how risk perception and sense-making are influenced by the specific message frame, the identity of the conversation partner, the perceived similarity and expertise of this partner, and the initial attitude of individuals. An online interaction experiment, including a simulated chat in which we manipulated the message frame (gains vs losses vs uncertainty) and the conversation <b>partner</b> (<b>expert</b> vs peer vs anonymous) was conducted using a representative sample of Dutch internet users (n = 310). Results showed that chatting with partners who were perceived to be expert was associated with lower levels of risk perception, while chatting with partners who were perceived to be similar was associated with higher levels of information need, intention to take notice, and search for and share information. Results also showed that initial attitude had a strong effect. The more positive consumers were about eating organic food, the lower their risk perception and the higher their need for information, intention to take notice of, search for and share information following the chat. Implications for authorities communicating on food (risks) are discusse...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} both power and gender in the use of influence strategies. Women and men responded to three scenarios in which they interacted with an imagined partner in situations with different levels of interpersonal power: more power than their <b>partner</b> (<b>expert),</b> less power (novice), and the same amount of power (equivalent). Partners were either same sex or other sex. Participants used more direct strategies when they were experts and more indirect strate-gies when they were novices, and women and men were very similar in the strategies they selected. Overall, power differences had a more pro-found effect than gender in predicting the choice of influence strategies. What are often construed as gender differences in social influence proba-bly are perceived power differences. As such, gender differences in be-havior must be understood within a context of status and power. Stereotypes portray women as more easily influenced than men and as having little influence over others as compared with men (Broverman, Vogel, Broverman, Clarkson, & Rosenkrantz, 1972; Eagly & Wood, 1982). There has been some debate as to whether these stereotypes reflect existing differences between women and men, and if so, why they exist. Possible explanations include differences in socialization patterns for young girls and boys, differences in the social roles of women and men, and differences This article is based on my Master’s Thesis at the University of California, Berkeley, December 1990.

30|$|In {{the context}} of a heavy {{dependence}} on the “technology factor,” new forms of proactive management, i.e., some “dynamic shaping of technologies” and continuous directing, become crucial. Needless to say that the abovementioned “dynamic perception” of technologies naturally implies the need for organizational agility as well as the ability to take into account a variety of prospects rather than asserting and promoting one’s own—dominant within the company/organization—point of view. It means that modern technology executives cannot perform their professional activities based only on the “internal” professional relation. The proactive approach forces them to forecast and think out of the box, i.e., search for potential <b>partners,</b> <b>experts,</b> and cooperation. Moreover, due to the increasing interactive impact on the direct processes of production and management that is exerted by clients, end users are no longer perceived as passive objects, but rather as the subjects of management who actively participate in managerial processes.|$|R

By analysing the collected data it is shown that those latter studies are based on a fallible conclusion regarding economic incentives due to a mismatched theoretical levels; firm level and interpersonal level.

The members of the dyads completed a number line task privately, jointly and privately again. In the joint condition, dyad members shared their private estimates and then negotiated a joint estimate. Both dyad members averaged their private individual estimates to determine joint estimates, thereby showing a strong equality bias. Their performance in the joint condition exceeded {{the performance of the}} dyad’s best estimator, demonstrating interaction benefit, only when the dyad members had similar levels of expertise and when the averaged dyad performance was sufficiently accurate. At the end of the task, participants rated their and their partner’s level of competence. Participants were accurate in classifying themselves as the expert or the novice within the dyad. Nevertheless, novices tended to overestimate their ability as they admitted to being less competent but only slightly worse than their <b>expert</b> <b>partner.</b> <b>Experts,</b> instead, believed themselves to be more competent but were humble and considered their performance only marginally better than their partner.
