30|$|A {{last point}} {{worthy of note}} is the {{possible}} heterogeneity in the <b>policy</b> effect across <b>periods.</b> In particular, the policy {{may be more effective}} as time goes on or, on the other hand, the effect may be stronger just after the announcement of the policy, then phases out with the passing of time. In order to see whether the policy effect is quarter- and/or year-specific, three specifications are estimated based on the empirical strategy just outlined above. First, the policy effect is imposed to be constant across quarters over the period. More specifically, there is no allowance for quarter and year specific dummies, and the comparison is between the entire <b>period</b> after the <b>policy</b> introduction and the entire <b>period</b> before the <b>policy.</b> This specification is called “period specific” policy effect. Next, the policy effect is imposed to be constant across quarters within a year, but allowing for variation between years by introducing year specific dummies for the <b>policy</b> <b>period.</b> This specification enables the estimation of the policy effect for each year over the <b>policy</b> <b>period.</b> Thirdly, an allowance is made for heterogeneous policy effect across quarters by including year specific quarter dummies. This time the comparison is between each quarter within the <b>policy</b> <b>period</b> and the entire <b>period</b> before the <b>policy</b> intervention. This most flexible specification provides separate estimates of the policy effect for each quarter over the <b>policy</b> <b>period</b> 15. Furthermore, each quarter within the <b>policy</b> <b>period</b> is compared to the corresponding quarter in the pre-policy period in order to test the role of seasonality in policy effectiveness.|$|R

50|$|When he {{returned}} to the US, Lovestone was forced to pay for his insubordination and was expelled from the party - ostensibly not for challenging Stalin, but for his support of Bukharin and the Right Opposition and for his theory of American exceptionalism, which held that capitalism was more secure in the United States and thus socialists should pursue different, more moderate strategies there than elsewhere in the world. That contradicted Stalin's views and the new Third <b>Period</b> <b>policy</b> of ultra-leftism promoted by the Comintern. Lovestone and his friends had thought that they commanded the following of the mass of party members and, once expelled, optimistically named their new party the Communist Party (Majority Group). When the new group attracted only a few hundred members it changed its name to the Communist Party (Opposition). They were aligned with the International Communist Opposition, which had sections in fifteen countries. The CP(O) later became the Independent Communist Labor League and then, in 1938, the Independent Labor League of America before dissolving in 1941. The party published the periodical Workers' Age (originally The Revolutionary Age), which was edited by Bertram Wolfe, along with a number of pamphlets.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} solving a nonhomogeneous infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem in the general case of potentially multiple optimal first period policies. More precisely, we seek an algorithm that, given a finite subset of the problem’s potentially infinite data set, delivers an optimal first <b>period</b> <b>policy.</b> Such an algorithm can thus recursively generate, within a rolling horizon procedure, an infinite horizon optimal solution to the original infinite horizon problem. However it can happen that for a given problem no such algorithm exists. In this case, {{it is impossible to}} solve the problem with a finite amount of data. We say such problems fail to be wellposed. Under the assumption of increasing marginal returns in actions (with respect to states) and stochastically increasing states into which the system transitions (with respect to actions), we provide an algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the corresponding nonhomogeneous MDP whenever the problem is well-posed. The algorithm proceeds by discovering, in finite time, a forecast horizon for which an optimal solution delivers an optimal first <b>period</b> <b>policy</b> to the infinite horizon problem. In particular, we show by construction, the existence of a forecast horizon (and hence, a solution horizon) for all such well-posed problems. We illustrate the theory and algorithms developed by solving every well-posed instance of the time-varying version of the classic asset selling problem...|$|E

40|$|Can {{policies}} {{designed to}} maximize exploitation by elites benefit {{the people who}} live in forests? Forestry policy throughout the developing world originates from European ‘‘scientific’’ forestry traditions exported during the colonial <b>period.</b> These <b>policies</b> were implemented by foreign and local elite whose interest was to maximize and extract profit. In spite of reforms since the end of the colonial <b>period,</b> <b>policies</b> on the environment usually remain biased against rural communities. Even when more recent policies are fair, the rural poor face severe biases in implementation. In addition, they must compete on an uneven playing field of ethnic and other social inequities and economic hurdles. This article examines how forestry policy and implementation maintain double standards on this uneven playing field in a manner that permanently excludes the rural poor from the natural wealth around them—producing poverty in the process. Change that would support poverty alleviation for forest-based communities requires a radical rethinking of forest policy so as to counterbalance widespread regressive policies and structural asymmetries...|$|R
40|$|In the literature, {{integrated}} inventory {{model has}} {{received a lot of}} attention. Most previous works on this topic have been based on the assumption of constant demand rate. However this assumption is not reliable in reality; it is either increasing or decreasing with time. In this thesis, we considered the model which consists of a single vendor who manage the production and deliver to a single buyer with a linearly decreasing demand rate over a finite time horizon. Costs are attached to manufacturing set up, the delivery of a shipment and stockholding at the vendor and buyer. The objective is to determine the number of shipments and size of those shipments which minimize the total system cost - assuming the vendor and buyer collaborate and find a way of sharing the consequent benefits. We begin this thesis with the integrated inventory policy for shipping a vendor’s final production batch to a single buyer under linearly decreasing demand. The first case considered here is the holding cost at the vendor is less than at the buyer. We solve this model with equal shipment sizes <b>policy,</b> equal shipment <b>periods</b> <b>policy</b> and unequal shipment sizes and unequal shipment <b>periods</b> <b>policy.</b> Then, we develop a mathematical model when the unit holding cost is higher at the vendor rather than at the buyer (consignment stock problem). For this case, we also consider equal shipment sizes <b>policy,</b> equal shipment <b>periods</b> <b>policy,</b> and unequal shipment sizes and unequal shipment periods as in the previous case policy. It is followed by an integrated inventory model with n production batches which consists of the final batch {{at the end of the}} production cycle. This model also considers the case of the buyer’s holding cost being greater than the vendor’s and vice versa. We consider this model with equal cycle time and unequal cycle time for both policies. We show the solution procedure when the shipment sizes are equal and when they are unequal. We solve all the models in this thesis using Microsoft Excel Solver and illustrate all the policies with numerical examples and sensitivity analysis. Then we make some comparison of the model. Lastly we end the thesis with conclusion and some recommendations for further research...|$|R
