60|$|The {{voices of}} {{children}} {{playing in the}} street aroused her. Night had fallen. She groped {{her way to a}} lamp and lighted it. In the kitchen she stared, lips trembling, at the pitiful, half <b>prepared</b> <b>meal.</b> The fire had gone out. The water had boiled away from the potatoes. When she lifted the lid, a burnt smell arose. Methodically she scraped and cleaned the pot, put things in order, and peeled and sliced the potatoes for next day's frying. And just as methodically she went to bed. Her lack of nervousness, her placidity, was abnormal, so abnormal that {{she closed her eyes and}} was almost immediately asleep. Nor did she awaken till the sunshine was streaming into the room.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{contribution}} of pragmatism to value theory {{is the idea}} of contributory goods with a contributory conditionality.

This is in contrast to other goods, which may be considered [...] "good" [...] in a wider variety of situations.|$|E
50|$|One of Jessie’s {{earliest}} recorded {{memories of}} her uncle Walt was from her summers spent at George Whitman’s house in Camden.

Angered, Lou would turn to Jessie and say, “geniuses are not especially easy to live with.” Jessie also remembers, albeit inaccurately, Walt Whitman’s meeting with Oscar Wilde. These memories were recorded by Ralph L. Fansler, who initially interviewed Jessie under the pseudonym Garrett Newkirk. He later revealed his true identity, and the two maintained correspondence throughout most of Jessie’s late life.|$|E

50|$|Antigonon leptopus was {{prepared}} for consumption by the aboriginal inhabitants of Baja California in a way reminiscent of popcorn. The seeds were toasted by placing them in a flat basket made of flexible twigs torn into several strips and woven to make a solid surface. On top of the seeds they would put live coals, and with both hands they would shake the basket so that the coals come up against the seeds, toasting them but not burning the basket. When the toasting is finished the burned out coals are removed and {{a major portion of}} the seeds are burst open exposing a white meal. Afterwards the seeds are separated from the husks from which they have come by dextrously tossing them into the air with the basket, just as wheat is winnowed in Spain. Thus cleaned they would grind and eat the <b>prepared</b> <b>meal.</b> They would also boil it and make fried cakes.|$|E

While several people are rounded up, a young woman who looks to be captured notices a stain on an officer's shirt. This triggers a flashback beginning with a tomato seed being planted, then sprouting, then harvested and then packaged. The packages are eventually transported to a grocery store where a lady selects the tomatoes to take home with her. As she is preparing tomato sauce, subtitles accurately instruct the viewer on the recipe for making the sauce for spaghetti. The lady places the <b>prepared</b> <b>meal</b> into a tupperware container. The officer from earlier in the video appears with the meal in his squad car. He dribbles the tomato sauce onto his shirt while eating it and creates the stain. This brings the flashback {{to the beginning of the}} video.

At present they live throughout Tanzania and Mozambique and have a small presence in Kenya. The Makonde population in Tanzania was estimated in 2001 to be 1,140,000, and the 1997 census in Mozambique put the Makonde population in that country at 233,358, for a total estimate of 1,373,358.

5000|$|Upon arrival {{the guests}} found all three granary {{buildings}} decorated with evergreens, flags, banners, and bunting. Lawson used the largest room, with seating arrangements for over one thousand guests {{for music and}} dancing; assigning the two smaller rooms, each with a seating capacity for 400 guests, for lectures and the serving of refreshments. The formalities began with James Burns, the celebrated London gymnast reciting an amusing sketch entitled, ‘How to read a man like a book’. At noon Lawson served a ‘fruit, grain, and vegetable meal’, consisting of raw turnip, boiled cabbage, boiled wheat, boiled barley, shelled peas, oatmeal gruel, boiled horse beans and boiled potatoes. He also presented a salad, made from chopped carrot, turnip, cabbage, parsley and celery, served with a congealed sauce made from boiled linseed. There were no condiments and since everything was cold except the potatoes, one can only imagine the guest's apprehension, as they sat down to dinner. To compensate for the poorly <b>prepared</b> <b>meal</b> each guest upon rising from the table received an apple and a biscuit. The {{total cost of the}} ingredients was less than £8. The entertainment continued in the afternoon with a colourful concert comprising gymnastic displays, music, songs and speeches. During the afternoon, the two [...] steam engines set off with whistles screaming to lead a procession through the farm. Around five in the afternoon guests received an ‘evening meal’, followed by a lecture entitled, ‘Diet and the Health of the Human Body’. However unpalatable these proceedings may appear today the guests appreciated the proceedings. The problems arose from lack of experience, a shortage of cooking facilities, and from Lawson's insistence that the food comprise a truly national flavour, thus excluding rice, raisins, currants, pepper, sugar, salt and other readily available imports. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, public opinion suggested that the lectures and experiments were ample compensation for the dissatisfaction caused by the bland food. The second festival was equally successful, and although Lawson levied a small charge for food, he did provide bread and beef. Lawson hailed the third festival as a Social Science Congress, with a series of lectures covering a wide variety of scientific topics. Again, food was free and although beef and ham were available, the meal consisted in the main of rice boiled with currants and raisons. On this occasion, the application for free tickets was so immediate and numerous that after receiving almost 3,000 requests he closed the offer on December 3, Although ruined by rain, observers recalled two novel events, labourers using Cain’s boiler to heat the water to mash tea, and an attempt by Lawson to introduce a non-smoking policy. In total, Lawson sponsored five festivals, the first four on consecutive Christmas days, while the fifth celebration took place in July, in a meadow adjoining the River Ellen.|$|E

Higher dose of gamma irradiation (6 kGy) decreased the protein and fats constituents of Kubba.
