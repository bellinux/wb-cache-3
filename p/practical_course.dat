5|$|Early historians, {{including}} the 6th century cleric Gildas, have noted 383 {{as a significant}} point in Welsh history, as it is stated in literature as the foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus, or Macsen Wledig, stripped all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators, to launch a successful bid for imperial power; continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor. Gildas, writing in about 540, says that Maximus departed Britain, taking with him all of its Roman troops, armed bands, governors and the flower of its youth, never to return. Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his <b>practical</b> <b>course</b> was to transfer local authority to local rulers. The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties, including those of Powys and Gwent. It was this transfer of power that {{has given rise to}} the belief that he was the father of the Welsh Nation. He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{realignment}} of the Glaven channel {{meant that}} the Eye would be left unprotected {{to the north of}} the river, and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change. It was decided that the only <b>practical</b> <b>course</b> of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10ha (25acre), significantly more than the 0.4ha (1acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a herringbone pattern outside the buildings, each 50m long and 1.80m wide (194 by 5.9ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight boreholes, and geophysics (magnetometry and metal detection) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.|$|E

40|$|The {{reasons for}} the decline in students' {{interest}} in science have been studied for the last decades. The key {{question is how to}} stimulate this interest and motivate students and pupils to study science. Part of this thesis was testing the influence of <b>practical</b> <b>courses</b> on upper secondary school students' motivation toward studying biology. To start with, it was found out how many <b>practical</b> <b>courses</b> were taught for each biology topic at Czech upper secondary schools. Molecular biology and genetics {{emerged as one of the}} topics with the lowest number of <b>practical</b> <b>courses.</b> Therefore, molecular biology <b>practical</b> <b>courses</b> have been proposed and tested. It was shown that these <b>practical</b> <b>courses</b> can increase students' motivation scores. The possible influece of age, gender and number of <b>practical</b> <b>courses</b> during biology lessons on motivation was tested as well. Motivation of Czech students was compared to motivation of New Zealand students. Younger students and boys were more motivated to study biology in both countries. New Zealand students were more motivated than Czech students. Motivated students like the participants in the Biology Olympiad, Students' Professional Activities, biology summer course and optional biology courses were used to describe the origin of their motivation toward biology...|$|R

2500|$|While {{teaching}} at Wesleyan Female College in Macon, GA, Charlotte Ford cites Andrews as having her first formal contact with botany through {{contact with the}} botany professor, Charles Townsend, although her interest truly sparked from her childhood days exploring the forest around Haywood. Andrews styled herself as an amateur botanist, collecting samples and doing minor research whenever she could find the time. [...] During her botanical career, Andrews became a strong proponent of conservation, using her published pieces to rail against turpentine distillers and developers for destroying woodlands. [...] Her first textbook, Botany All the Year Round, published in 1903, aimed {{at a high school}} audience, was particularly useful for rural schools. It contained activities and labs aimed at attracting these schools to a low-budget scientific discipline that utilized the natural world around them, instead of pricey experimental materials. A <b>Practical</b> <b>Course</b> in Botany, her second textbook, however, was aimed more at a college and university audience and stressed the relationship between botany and more practical fields such as agriculture and economics. [...] Internationally acclaimed, Practical Botany was translated for use in French schools. [...] Andrews was also nominated {{to be a member of}} the Italian International Academy of Science, although she was too old at the time to travel to Naples and accept the honor. In the end she bequeathed the royalties from her books to the city of Rome, GA for a municipal forest reserve, although the city eventually turned the money back over to her estate because of lack of funds, probably due to the depression.|$|E

60|$|On re-reading my protest, which I {{honestly}} {{think much}} needed, against our heathen idolatry of mere ablution, I {{see that it}} may possibly be misread. I hasten to say that I think washing a {{most important thing to}} be taught both to rich and poor. I do not attack the positive but the relative position of soap. Let it be insisted on even as much as now; but let other things be insisted on much more. I am even ready to admit that cleanliness is next to godliness; but the moderns will not even admit godliness to be next to cleanliness. In their talk about Thomas Becket and such saints and heroes they make soap more important than soul; they reject godliness whenever it is not cleanliness. If we resent this about remote saints and heroes, we should resent it more about the many saints and heroes of the slums, whose unclean hands cleanse the world. Dirt is evil chiefly as evidence of sloth; {{but the fact remains that}} the classes that wash most are those that work least. Concerning these, the <b>practical</b> <b>course</b> is simple; soap should be urged on them and advertised as what it is--a luxury. With regard to the poor also the <b>practical</b> <b>course</b> is not hard to harmonize with our thesis. If we want to give poor people soap we must set out deliberately to give them luxuries. If we will not make them rich enough to be clean, then emphatically we must do what we did with the saints. We must reverence them for being dirty.|$|E

'I have to consider with God's help by Monday whether to enter the cabinet or to retire altogether: at least such is probably the second alternative.' He wished to consult Hope and Manning, and they, upon discussion, urged that the point was too narrow on which to join issue with the government. This brought him round. 'I well remember,' he says of this early case of compromise, 'that I pleaded against them that I should be viewed as a traitor, and they observed to me in reply that I must be prepared for that if necessary, that (and indeed I now feel) in these times the very wisest and most effective servants of any cause must necessarily fall so far short of the popular sentiment of its friends, as to be liable constantly to incur mistrust and even abuse. But patience and the power of character overcome all these difficulties. I am certain that Hope and Manning in 1843 were not my tempters but rather my good angels.'[159] ...|$|E
60|$|If a man {{be in any}} vague latent {{doubt about}} the {{intrinsic}} correctness and excellence of his general life-theory and <b>practical</b> <b>course</b> of life; then, if that man chance to light on any other man, or any little treatise, or sermon, which unintendingly, as it were, yet very palpably illustrates to him the intrinsic incorrectness and non-excellence of both the theory {{and the practice of}} his life; then that man will--more or less unconsciously--try hard to hold himself back from the self-admitted comprehension of a matter which thus condemns him. For in this case, to comprehend, is himself to condemn himself, which is always highly inconvenient and uncomfortable to a man. Again. If a man be told a thing wholly new, then--during the time of its first announcement to him--it is entirely impossible for him to comprehend it. For--absurd as it may seem--men are only made to comprehend things which they comprehended before (though but in the embryo, as it were). Things new it is impossible to make them comprehend, by merely talking to them about it. True, sometimes they pretend to comprehend; in their own hearts they really believe they do comprehend; outwardly look as though they did comprehend; wag their bushy tails comprehendingly; but for all that, they do not comprehend. Possibly, they may afterward come, of themselves, to inhale this new idea from the circumambient air, and so come to comprehend it; but not otherwise at all. It will be observed, that, neither points of the above speculations do we, in set terms, attribute to Pierre in connection with the rag pamphlet. Possibly both might be applicable; possibly neither. Certain it is, however, that at the time, in his own heart, he seemed to think that he did not fully comprehend the strange writer's conceit in all its bearings. Yet was this conceit apparently one of the plainest in the world; so natural, a child might almost have originated it. Nevertheless, again so profound, that scarce Juggularius himself could be the author; and still again so exceedingly trivial, that Juggularius' smallest child might well have been ashamed of it.|$|E
