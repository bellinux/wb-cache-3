500|$|... "The Red Woman" [...] is {{the first}} episode of the sixth season of HBO's fantasy {{television}} series Game of Thrones, and the 51st overall. The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Jeremy <b>Podeswa.</b>|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, <b>Podeswa</b> stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] <b>Podeswa</b> also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview <b>Podeswa</b> described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. <b>Podeswa</b> stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try to create that, then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E
5000|$|This led Handsome Boy to signing more artists, many {{of which}} were {{discovered}} through [...] "Elvis Mondays" [...] nights at Toronto's El Mocambo nightclub. Other artists who released material on Handsome Boy included hHead, Groovy Religion, Meryn Cadell, The Monoxides, John Oswald and Slowburn. The label also released the soundtrack to Jeremy <b>Podeswa's</b> film Eclipse. Through the 2000s, the label stopped releasing new material, although it remained in business as a [...] "catalogue" [...] label of its earlier releases while Rogers worked for Richard Branson and focused on tech, film and television projects. It did not release a new record until Street Pharmacy's album Divorce in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, Foundas is kinder to the film, {{observing that}} it is:less a {{straight}} matter of addition or subtraction {{than it is}} a complex algebra equation, with multiple variables that all have a bearing on the sum. It is also, much like the film that opened Toronto this year, Jeremy <b>Podeswa's</b> [...] "Fugitive Pieces," [...] another visually lush, dramatically obvious story of Holocaust survivors still wrestling with the ghosts of their past, several decades on {{from the end of}} World War II. Generally solid performances and Barzman's sensitive handling help to elevate the pic above the realm of the familiar and could result in okay arthouse biz among auds not yet exhausted by the subject matter.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the young}} filmmakers (they were all {{under the age of}} 30) worked on each other’s films.

McDonald also guest-edited the October 1988 “Outlaw Edition” of Cinema Canada that first publicized the {{existence}} of this new group of filmmakers.
