Francis Danby, a British painter born in Ireland, probably {{was inspired by}} Géricault's picture when he painted Sunset at Sea after a Storm in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that The Raft of the Medusa was [...] "the finest and grandest historical <b>picture</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen".|$|E

500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the <b>picture...</b> <b>I</b> didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that <b>picture,</b> <b>I</b> think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E

500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview.

At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater <b>picture.</b> <b>I</b> was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society.

500|$|Kurrle's {{first foray}} into the film {{industry}} was on the 1916 film, Her Great Price, directed by Edwin Carewe. He later collaborated with Carewe {{on a number of}} pictures during the 1920s. He began his career working for Metro Pictures, where he stayed at until 1921. Metro was one of the film companies which merged in 1924 to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The quality of Kurrle's work was noticed even early in his career. His filming of 1919's Lion's Den was called [...] "spectacular". Kurrle's work the following year on The Right of Way was described by some as [...] "... remarkable even in this day of almost perfect cinematography." [...] By 1921, Kurrle was already a member of the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC). [...] Early that year, he followed Carewe and left Metro to become a freelance cinematographer. Fifteen of the twenty-four films Kurrle worked on during 1921-27 were directed by Carewe. In 1922, while filming a Carewe <b>picture,</b> <b>I</b> Am the Law, Kurrle successfully tested a new high-speed film from Eastman. The new film allowed interior filming with less lighting, reducing both equipment and staffing costs.|$|E

500|$|Musically, 21st Century Breakdown {{is similar}} to the punk rock style of American Idiot, but many critics have claimed that Green Day's {{traditional}} sound has evolved in the five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band [...] "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while Spin called the title track [...] "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked: [...] "It's important to us that we're still looked at as a punk band. It was our religion, our higher education". However, he also noted that Armstrong had delved into the past in writing 21st Century Breakdown, gleaning inspiration from the artists who shaped rock music. Armstrong himself has stated: [...] "Ground zero for me is still punk rock.

500|$|Post editor Ben Hibbs said of Speech and Worship, [...] "To me {{they are}} great human {{documents}} {{in the form of}} paint and canvas. A great <b>picture,</b> <b>I</b> think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The Four Freedoms did— and do." [...] Walt Disney wrote, [...] "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it." [...] Rockwell believed that Freedom of Worship and Freedom of Speech were his better results in the series. Laura Claridge has written that the inspirational phrase [...] "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" [...] is a [...] "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the Thirteen Articles of Faith by Joseph Smith." [...] In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published. The expression [...] "according to the dictates of his conscience" [...] (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.|$|E
500|$|All {{involved}} {{contend that}} the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, {{which led to a}} permanent divorce. [...] "I had no idea that I would be snapped out of the <b>picture.</b> <b>I</b> thought it was cruel and impersonal," [...] said Betts. Allman was finally sober and felt more miserable shows with Betts would be a waste of time. Betts later received a cash settlement, which is subject to a confidentiality agreement; he went on to record new music with a new band. Jimmy Herring joined the band for the summer tour, where the band fought negative press; fans contended that attending shows by an Allman Brothers Band without Betts was pointless. Herring exited shortly after the tour, as he felt guilty that he would replace Betts. That August, former bassist Allen Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York. Warren Haynes set up a benefit show for his former bandmate, which featured the Allman Brothers Band. With Derek Trucks unavailable, he sat in for the set. In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band for their Beacon run: [...] "It was my first time with the band in four years and it was very comfortable," [...] he remarked.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} the first Hollywood {{production}} to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution. Cinematographer John Schwartzman {{had this to say}} about the camera: [...] "Today was Epic, Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion <b>picture.</b> <b>I</b> can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer." [...] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, [...] "I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D." [...] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the [...] "RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that." [...] Webb continued that [...] "you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it." [...] The Amazing Spider-Man climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMAX DMR release.|$|E
500|$|Parasakthi {{received}} critical acclaim. P. Balasubramania Mudaliar of Sunday Observer wrote, [...] "The {{story is}} simple {{but it has}} been made powerful by Mr. Karunanidhi by his beautiful dialogues. Mr. Shivaji Ganesan, who plays the main role dominates from the beginning to the end" [...] and concluded, [...] "If an Academy award were to be given to any <b>picture,</b> <b>I</b> have little doubt that this picture would be entitled on its merits to such an award." [...] Dinamani Kadir, a Tamil weekly owned by Indian Express Limited (then known as The Indian Express Group), carried an unusually long review of Parasakthi running into three closely printed pages. The review was given a cynical title, [...] "Kandarva Mandalam" [...] ("The Abode of Kandarvas") and it began with a small box-item which read, [...] "Parasakthi: This goddess is abused in a Tamil film with her name". The reviewer opined, [...] "The main aim of the film is to attach gods. Along with that, the government and society are overtly and covertly attacked. The embittered and agitated reviewer further claimed, [...] "He , acting as a mad man, threatens and beats the people on the street and grabs whatever they have and eats it. Then he goes to give repeatedly all those economics lectures, rationalist lectures and anti-god lectures. When we see the hero doing all that, it seems as if he is portraying the lives of those who are trying to force such ideas in the ...film." [...] For the reviewer, thus, the DMK men were living on others' sweat and preaching unacceptable subsersive ideas. The magazine Sivaji praised the dialogues written by Karunanidhi, and the performances of Ganesan and Sahasranamam.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} of the scene juxtaposes the prim and proper Huguenot man and his immaculately dressed wife and son with these three, as they form their own [...] "family group" [...] across {{the other side of}} the gutter. The head of John the Baptist on a platter is the advertisement for the pie shop, proclaiming [...] "Good eating". Below this sign are the embracing couple, extending the metaphor of good eating beyond a mere plate of food, and still further down the street girl greedily scoops up the pie, carrying the theme to the foot of the <b>picture.</b> <b>I.</b> R. F. Gordon sees the vertical line of toppling plates from the top window downwards as a symbol of the disorder on this side of the street. The man reduced to a head on the sign, in what is assumed to be the woman's fantasy, is mirrored by the [...] "Good Woman" [...] pictured on the board behind who has only a body, her nagging head removed to create the man's ideal of a [...] "good woman". In the top window of the [...] "Good Woman", a woman throws a plate with a leg of meat into the street as she argues, providing a stark contrast to the [...] "good" [...] woman pictured on the sign below. Ronald Paulson sees the kite hanging from the church as part of a trinity of signs; the kite indicating the purpose of the church, an ascent into heaven, just as the other signs for [...] "Good Eating" [...] and the [...] "Good Woman" [...] indicate the predilections of those on that side of the street; but he also notes it as another nod to the pastoral tradition: here instead of soaring above the fields it hangs impotently on the church wall.|$|E

500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine {{what they are going to}} do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest <b>picture</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E
