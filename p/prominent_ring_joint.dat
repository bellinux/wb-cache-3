In {{order to}} study the lining {{longitudinal}} deformation rule {{under the influence of}} the lining transverse deformation in the process of long-term settlement of operating metro shield tunnel with straight joint, based on the field test monitoring data of Tibet Road-Zhongxing Road shield tunnel in the M 8 of shanghai, and considering the tunnel convergence, this problem is studied by amending equivalent continuous model. Then there is a comparison between the existing theoretical methods and this calculation method. The results showed that, in the <b>ring</b> <b>joints,</b> no considering shearing, the maximum of <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> open, the tension and compression stress of segment, and bolt stress slightly decrease with the increase of deformation of tunnel convergence under the bending. The smaller the curvature radius of the shield-tunnel longitudinal deformation is, the larger the <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> open under the influence of tunnel convergence is...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of surface {{roughness}} appearing on a turned sealing surface on compressive stress and compressive force of copper gaskets (a fiat gasket, a <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> gasket and a copper wire gasket) was studied. The results obtained can be summarized as follows : (I) In {{the case of a}} flat gasket or a <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> gasket, in order to ignore both the surface roughness appearing on a turned sealing surface and the cross section of gasket, the compressive stress for sealing had to be nearly equal to 1. 3 times the tensile strength of the copper gasket. (2) In the case of a <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> gasket or a copper wire gasket, the values of maximum heigh roughness, in which the minimum compressive force for sealing applied, were found in the region between 2 μm and 20 μm or not less than 110 μm respectively...|$|R

40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> flange of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique. The cracks encompassed approximately 180 deg of circumference and were located at both the inner and outer radius of the flange <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> groove. The crack depth was 1. 0 in. ~ 25. 4 mm! on the innermost radius of the depths located at the base of the <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> groove to evaluate the change in the crack tip driving force. Both elastic and elastic-plastic analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of crack tip plasticity in the resulting J-integral calculation. Metallurgical Testing. A small sliver was removed from the cracked flange. A chemistry analysis was performed to assess the potential for temper embrittlement and a microstructural specimen was prepared to examine the microstructure and to perform a mi-crohardness test to assess the potential for hydrogen-assisted crack growth.

In the second step, the minor rings and the band rings are detected. The third step of detection algorithm works as a feedback step. It checks whether there remains any ring artifact after applying the correction algorithm. If such artifacts are identified, the correction algorithm is applied again on those artifacts. This process continues until all the artifacts are corrected. The three step detection algorithm is described in the following subsections.|$|R
40|$|The {{reported}} {{investigation has}} the objective to examine both the morphology and morphometry {{of several of}} the freshest lunar basins including Orientale, Imbrium, Nectaris, Crisium, and Humorum, and to compare the characteristics of their three most <b>prominent</b> <b>rings</b> to features in smaller craters. On the basis of comparisons it is concluded that the outer basin ring forms within the region where significant structural uplift of the basin rim is to be expected. Therefore the formation of the outer ring scarp may be closely associated with structural uplift of the inner portion of the crater rim flank. According to a model suggested for the origin of the outer two rings, the cratering event formed two inner rings, a central peak ring, and an uplifted crater rim crest, with deposition of ejecta during the process...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of Desmoscolecoidea {{are characterized by}} ring-shaped accumulations of mineral particles on the cuticle resulting in {{the impression of a}} peculiar body articulation. Live observations made during the extraction of desmoscolecoids from mud sampled in the Swedish Gullmar fjord suggested new ideas pertinent to the particle accretion and the likely functional significance of the <b>prominent</b> <b>rings.</b> Undisturbed desmoscolecoids were observed to perform perpetual, vigorous, stationary undulations with their body. In our opinion these undulations affect the distribution of particles adhering to the cuticle by pushing them from soft, pliable cuticular sections to comparably stiff rings thus generating distinct concretion rings and naked interzones. The <b>prominent</b> concretion <b>rings</b> are assumed to increase positive mechanical effects of the undulations on the productivity of ubiquitous microbial populations residing on ambient sediment particles. The microbial production boosted by this kind of bioturbation may be of nutritional importance for the desmoscolecoids. An electron-microscopic investigation (TEM) of Tricoma sp. from the Gullmar fjord revealed the concretion rings to consist of stacks of clay mineral platelets in the submicrometer size range. A perusal through contributions of other authors suggests that such clay mineral aggregates are the basic component (granular component sensu Timm 1970) in the concretion rings of all desmoscolecoids. In a number of species these aggregates contain a specifically determined admixture ofconspicuous other mineral grains...|$|R
