25|$|Devolving {{power to}} consumers. Some proponents have {{suggested}} that ethical food markets – and the PGS framework directly – has furthered a 'cash till' form of <b>political</b> <b>democracy,</b> whereby consumer spending power can masquerade as a legitimate governance structure and mechanism (i.e. democratically voted, representative, and therefore accountable). This {{is part of a}} broader shift from forms of 'government' to 'governance' seen in a neoliberalizing world, where a raft of non-state actors, arguably, make informed decisions about where and what to purchase.|$|E

Since 1993, he also has served as chairman of the International Republican Institute, a U.S. government-funded organization involved in supporting <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> around the world.|$|E

25|$|Student demonstrators, taking {{advantage}} of the loosening political atmosphere, reacted to a variety of causes of discontent. The diverse demands of protesters included greater economic liberalization, <b>political</b> <b>democracy,</b> media freedom, freedom of speech and association, rule of law, and to have the legitimacy of the movement recognized. Some protest leaders spoke against official corruption and speculation, price stability, social security, and the democratic means to supervise the reform process. Ironically, some of the original invective was also directed against Zhao. Party hardliners increasingly {{came to the conclusion that}} the demonstrations were due to Zhao's rapid pace of reform, which they believed caused a sense of confusion and frustration among college students. The protesters may have been encouraged by the imminent collapse of other Communist governments in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Membership of the Socialist Party of Great Britain {{has been}} {{conditional}} on {{acceptance of the}} Party's Object and Declaration of Principles. All applicants for membership are required to undertake a short written or verbal ‘test’ designed {{to enable them to}} demonstrate an understanding of – and agreement with – this Object and Principles and also of the Party's basic political positions not otherwise directly covered in the Declaration. There has been a sound reason for this as all members, once admitted, have full democratic rights and stand in basic equality to one another. This kind of <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> can only work on the basis of agreement around fundamental principles and, according to the Party, there would be no point in a socialist organisation giving full democratic rights to those who, in any significant way, disagreed with the socialist case.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{proposal}} for <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> {{calls for a}} high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of {{the party in power}} to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} said that the great {{weakness}} of the military dictatorships in Latin America was their tremendous inability to face the three most important state mediations: nation, citizenship and populace. In this article, the author contends that the dictatorships failures are still present in the Latin American <b>political</b> <b>democracies</b> restored during the last twenty years of 20 th century. In spite of the changes that we observe in the process of the dictatorships dismantling, these failures essentially spoil the new democratic institutions in the Latin American region...|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} some event-specific debates too – such as over the Party's precise {{attitude}} to the Spanish Civil War in 1936, to the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 {{and then to the}} movements for <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> in the Soviet bloc states in the 1980s. On other, far fewer, occasions, small groups of Party members, sometimes concerned by the Party's pace of growth (or lack of growth in some periods) have developed ideas which have challenged the Party's basic, core positions more clearly. Having initially agreed with the Party's principles and analysis they developed a political critique which challenged these positions at a more fundamental level. But even in these instances, only a handful of disputes have been so serious that they have led to organisational breakaways, and for a political body that has seen thousands of members join over a century of activity, this is remarkable. While sometimes damaging to the Party, these have always involved very small numbers of dissidents who have either left the organisation voluntarily or who have been expelled by a Party Poll. In each case they have been more an instance of splintering than splitting. For the historical record, six splinters of the various kinds discussed above can be readily identified. They are detailed below in chronological order.|$|E
25|$|Though these {{contributions}} to Dutch literature were a happy {{byproduct of the}} controversy, more important {{from the standpoint of}} enduring political science were the key publications by the democratic republican theorists around Baruch Spinoza that were published {{at the end of the}} 1660s. Franciscus van den Enden, Spinoza's mentor, went beyond the De la Court brothers in his espousal of <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> in his Free Political Propositions, published in 1665, which is one of the first systematic statements of democratic republicanism in the western world. Van den Enden argued that government should not only be in the interest of the citizens (as De la Court had proposed), but should create equality of opportunity and be controlled by the people, not the regent oligarchy. Van den Ende acknowledged only two writers that had preceded him with such ideas to his knowledge: Johan de la Court (Pieter's brother with his Consideratiën van Staat of 1660), and Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy, whose English-language pamphlet A way propounded to make the poor in these and other nations happy (published in London in 1659) also took aristocrats and priests to task. Plockhoy and Van den Ende first tried to implement their ideas in New Netherland in the early 1660s.|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of the 1991–1993 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, chaired by fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat, John Kerry, McCain {{investigated}} the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War. The committee's unanimous report stated there was [...] "no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia." [...] Helped by McCain's efforts, in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam. McCain was vilified by some POW/MIA activists who, unlike the Arizona senator, believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia. Since January 1993, McCain has been Chairman of the International Republican Institute, an organization partly funded by the U.S. government that supports the emergence of <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced <b>political</b> <b>democracy.</b> Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E
2500|$|In {{relation}} to democracy, PROUT argues that <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> {{is not enough}} to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality. [...] As Roar Bjonnes, a known PROUTist states, „ Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change - we {{will never be able to}} solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> is not enough“.|$|E
2500|$|Socialist Studies, on {{the other}} hand, regards the {{struggle}} by workers living under a dictatorship to establish some measure of <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> as a reformist struggle which socialists should oppose. [...] They believe {{that the difference between}} democratic capitalist governments and dictatorial capitalist governments is of no significance to workers, that <b>political</b> <b>democracy</b> is not essential for the propagation of socialist ideas, and that workers in dictatorships should not directly confront the forces of suppression. [...] Instead, Socialist Studies believes that they must be [...] "hostile to such movements for democracy and to call on workers to form instead a socialist political party based on [...] principles".|$|E
