5|$|There {{were other}} folk-music records, {{commercial}} folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, I liked the Kingston Trio.

5|$|This is the Ottoman {{development}} of the composite bow, presumably brought from the steppes. Turkish bows evolved, after the decline of military archery, into <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> traditional flight bows. Their decoration often included delicate and beautiful multicoloured designs with gold.|$|E
5|$|We wrote 'Mama' when I {{was going}} through a bad phase with my mum. The sentiments are really that your mum's <b>{{probably}}</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> friend that you've got. Whether she's an over-protective mother or a bit of a landmine, she probably knows you better than yourself in some ways.|$|E

5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{precious}} objects served an important {{aid in the}} religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces {{as a means to}} guarantee salvation in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the Cambrai Madonna is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known {{pictorial}} {{representation of}} Accum was an engraving by James Thomson made in July 1820 for the English journal European Magazine. It shows Accum {{sitting at a}} table close to a gas lamp. Thomson's engraving was probably based on an oil painting by the London portrait painter Samuel Drummond (1765–1844), who had shown Accum in a similar pose in a painting produced a few years prior to this. In addition, Accum's brother-in-law, the artist Wilhelm Strack, painted an oil portrait that shows Accum as a young man.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} Brooklyn Preparatory, a Jesuit school, on {{a scholarship}} and graduated as class valedictorian in 1946. He later attended Georgetown University on a scholarship, where {{he earned his}} bachelor's degree in English in 1950. Those years at Georgetown were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> years of my life, Blatty said in 2015. Until then, I’d never had a home. While studying for his master's degree at George Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially {{unable to find a}} job in teaching, he worked as a vacuum cleaner door-to-door salesman, a beer truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master's in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head of the Policy Branch of the USAF Psychological Warfare Division.|$|E
5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E
5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy said of his and his brother's rides that they were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by {{a minute and a half}} with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E
5000|$|According to Everest {{expedition}} leader Lou Whittaker, Hoey was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> world's <b>best</b> female high-altitude mountaineer at {{the time}} of her death. [...] She had scaled Washington's Mount Rainier over 100 times and led expeditions on Alaska's Denali.|$|R
50|$|The Ginebra-Shell rivalry is {{the early}} 1990s PBA rivalry that {{followed}} the San Miguel-Purefoods rivalry and Añejo-Purefoods rivalry and <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> decades' <b>best</b> rivalry before Sunkist and Alaska battled in the PBA championship for three straight conferences in the mid-1990s.|$|R

25|$|The Servant {{passages}} in Isaiah, and especially Isaiah 53, may {{be compared with}} Psalm 44. Psalm 44 directly parallels the Servant Songs, making it, <b>probably,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> defense for reading Isaiah 53 as applicable to the nation of Israel.|$|E
25|$|Kircher's {{interpretation}} of the hieroglyphs is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known early modern European attempt at 'decipherment', not least for {{the nature of his}} claims. Another early attempt at translation was made by Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century.|$|E

30|$|This {{study of}} subfreezing storage of Phalaenopsis pollinia {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility of}} long-term preservation of at least 96  weeks.

25|$|Talleres de Córdoba were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> team ever {{to suffer}} relegation. They {{finished}} third in the 2004 Clausura, but were relegated by the points aggregate system, which relegates the teams with the worst points averages over the last three seasons.|$|E
25|$|Oncostatin M {{triggers}} {{the formation of}} receptor complexes by binding to receptors via two binding sites named site II and site III. The nomenclature of these sites is taken by direct analogy to Growth Hormone, <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> studied of four helix bundle cytokines.|$|E
25|$|The most {{spectacular}} cactus displays are the 500 bright yellow-spined Golden Barrel Cactus (Echinocactus grusonii), the largest being more than 85 years old.

25|$|The {{scientific}} {{need for}} simple, stable and internationally accepted systems for naming objects {{of the natural}} world has generated many formal nomenclatural systems. <b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known of these nomenclatural systems are the five codes of biological nomenclature that govern the Latinized scientific names of organisms.|$|E
25|$|Ole Henrik Mortensen (born 29 January 1958 in Vejle, Jutland) is a Danish cricketer, <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{his country}} has produced.
