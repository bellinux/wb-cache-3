5|$|The {{fourth and}} the last edition of Plain Introduction was {{prepared}} and edited posthumously by Edward Miller (1825–1901). The book was edited by George Bell & Sons. It contains 15 <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> the texts of 40 manuscripts in facsimile (the 1st edition had 12 <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> 36 manuscripts). Some facsimiles were replaced. Instead of 2,094 manuscripts, as recorded in the third edition under six classes, no less than 3,791 were recorded in this edition, an increase of 236 beyond the 3,555 of Gregory, without counting the numerous vacant places which had been filled inp.|$|E
5|$|Many {{methods of}} {{decreasing}} the response time of ALFs have been developed. Even {{in the late}} 1980s, certain gases were used to catalyze the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell. In 1989, Eric Korevaar had developed his Fast ALF design which detected emitted fluorescence without photosensitive <b>plates.</b> <b>With</b> such methods employed, gigahertz frequencies are easily attainable.|$|E
5|$|Published in 1876 by Louis Prang and {{illustrated}} by Henry Mitchell, State Arms of the Union contains a chromolithographed title page depicting the Great Seal of the United States and seven color <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> 45 state and territorial coats of arms. The book was likely published for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.|$|E

5|$|Burial 21 was {{the first}} corbel-vaulted tomb to be {{constructed}} in the Mundo Perdido; it was placed within Structure 5D-86. The deceased was interred upon the east-west axis running through {{the centre of the}} E-Group during the transition between the Late Preclassic and the Early Classic periods. The tomb was elite-status and was perhaps the earliest royal burial in the Mundo Perdido. Any funerary offerings were removed during the 6th century AD during remodelling of the temple, at which time the offerings were redeposited under the third chamber of the shrine. The offerings included three polychrome <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> mammiform legs; the painted designs on the plates perhaps have astronomical significance.|$|E
5|$|Silurian rocks {{form the}} Southern Uplands of Scotland, which were pushed {{up from the}} sea bed during the {{collision}} with Baltica/Avalonia. The majority of the rocks are weakly metamorphosed coarse greywacke. The Highlands were also affected by these collisions, creating a series of thrust faults in the northwest Highlands including the Moine Thrust, the understanding of which {{played an important role}} in 19th century geological thinking. Volcanic activity occurred across Scotland as a result of the collision of the tectonic <b>plates,</b> <b>with</b> volcanoes in southern Scotland, and magma chambers in the north, which today form the granite mountains such as the Cairngorms.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} types of belts produced for the Confederate Military during the Civil War. There were literally dozens {{of types of}} buckles used and produced by or for the Confederacy. The buckles ranged from single <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> hooks, to two piece interlocking buckles, to simple roller buckles and countless other variations. Many buckles use plates that bore the state seal or motto of their home states. The vast majority used simple roller buckle plates of the type found on a common dog collar. As the War progressed, more and more men used captured US belt plates, often wearing them upside down.|$|E

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{method is}} extended for analyzing the free vibration problem of simply supported orthotropic square <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> a square hole. In this paper, a square <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> a square hole {{is transformed into}} an equivalent square <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> non-uniform thickness by considering the hole as an extremely thin part of the equivalent plate. Therefore, the dynamic characteristics of a <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> a hole {{can be obtained by}} analyzing the equivalent plate. The Green function, which is the discrete solution for the deflection of the equivalent plate, is used to obtain the characteristic equation of the free vibration. The effects of the side to thickness ratio, hole side to plate side ratio and the variation of the thickness on the frequencies are considered. Some numerical analyses are carried out for the simply supported orthotropic square <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> a square hole. The efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solutions by the present method are investigated.

5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|The Waldorf State Apartments, {{consisting}} of nine suites, were {{located on the}} second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, featured 16th and 17th century French and Italian antiques which Boldt {{and his wife had}} brought back from Europe. Francois V Bedroom was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, and over the years was occupied by the likes of Li Hung-Chang of China, Chowfa Maha Rajiravuth, Prince of Siam, and Albert of Saxe-Coburg. The apartments had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> European portraits. There were about 6,000 lights in the hotel, with as many as 1,000 were small candelabra lamps mounted in specially designed fixtures. The electric fixtures were all furnished by the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company, of New York, while the contract for the general installation work was carried out by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, of New York, the actual work of wiring being done by the Eastern District of the General Electric Company. The building was wired throughout on the system of the Interior Conduit and Insulation Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} feature of Scelidosaurus is its armour, {{consisting}} of bony scutes {{embedded in the}} skin. These osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel rows down the animal's body. Osteoderms are today found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The osteoderms of Scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape. Most were smaller or larger oval <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> a high keel on the outside, the highest point of the keel positioned more to the rear. Some scutes were small, flat and hollowed-out at the inside. The larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal rows. There were three rows of these along {{each side of the}} torso. The scutes of the lowest, lateral, row were more conical, rather than the blade-like osteoderms of Scutellosaurus. Between these main series, one or two rows of smaller oval keeled scutes were present. There were in total four rows of large scutes on the tail: one at the top midline, one at the midline of the underside, and one at each tail side. Whether the midline tail scutes continued over the torso and neck to the front is unknown and unlikely for the neck, though Scelidosaurus is often pictured this way.|$|E

5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license <b>plates,</b> <b>with</b> Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities, to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in the shed by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E

40|$|CrN/Cr {{multilayer}} coating {{is prepared}} on 316 L stainless steel as bipolar plates for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) by pulsed bias arc ion plating (PBAIP). Interfacial conductivity of the bipolar <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> CrN/Cr multilayer is improved obviously, presenting an interfacial contact resistance (ICR) of 8. 4 m Omega cm(- 2) under 1. 4 MPa. The results tested by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic measures in simulated PEMFC environments {{show that the}} bipolar <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> CrN/Cr multilayer has good anticorrosion performance. The corrosion current density of the bipolar <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> CrN/Cr multilayer is approximately 10 (- 8. 0) A cm(- 2) at 0. 6 V (vs. SCE) in a 0. 5 M H(2) SO(4) + 5 ppm F(-) solution at 70 degrees C with pressured air purging. The results of SEM and ICR before and after corrosion tests indicate that the bipolar <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> CrN/Cr multilayer is considerably stable electrochemically. The bipolar <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> CrN/Cr multilayer combined the prominent interfacial conductivity and the excellent corrosion resistance, showing great potential of application in PEMFC.
