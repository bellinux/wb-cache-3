50|$|The Rimlock (B8A) base is an 8-pin {{design with}} a <b>pin</b> <b>circle</b> {{diameter}} close to noval, {{and uses a}} nub {{on the side of}} the envelope to engage with a guide and retaining spring in the socket wall. This provides pin registration (since the pins are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a metal skirt around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by 'skirtless' versions which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, rimlock tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, e.g. EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and noval (B9A) base types.|$|E

40|$|Exploiting the {{increasingly}} wide use of {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) lighting, {{in this paper we}} propose a reversed indoor positioning system (IPS) based on LED visible light communication (VLC) in order to improve indoor positioning accuracy. Unlike other VLC positioning systems, we employ two annular receivers with multi-photodiodes installed on the ceiling to locate the persons who carry LEDs. The basic idea is using multi-photodiodes to calculate the angle while using the received signal strength (RSS) method to calculate the distance. The experiment results show that the effective positioning range of the proposed system is 1. 8 m when the distance between two receivers is 1. 2 m. Moreover, a positioning error less than 0. 2 m can be achieved under the condition that the radius of the <b>PIN</b> <b>circle</b> is between 0. 16 m and 0. 2 m, and the distance of the transmitter-receiver plane is less than 1. 8 m, which will be effective in practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Alden turbine was {{developed}} through industry-U. S. Department of Energy collaborative funding to provide safe turbine passage for fish at hydropower projects. The turbine {{was designed to}} minimize the probability and consequence of blade strike and keep pressure changes and shear forces within limits tolerable by fish. Suitability for retrofit was not a design criterion, and application of the Alden fish friendly turbine has historically focused on new powerhouse development {{in order to provide}} flexibility in arranging the larger Alden unit. After evaluating typical Francis and Kaplan turbine geometries and completing a basic Alden turbine retrofit study, it was found that matching the <b>pin</b> <b>circle</b> diameter of the Alden turbine distributor to that of the existing turbine will lead to minimal physical reconstruction but a relatively low power output. Increasing the size of the Alden turbine will provide an improvement to the power output but also increase the needed physical reconstruction between the existing and proposed systems. An evaluation of energy generation was completed for a hypothetical, site-specific retrofit. Energy generation given the existing Alden unit design without a fish bypass flow was 1. 6 % less than the base case including a fish bypass flow. A re-designed Alden unit more suitable for the site head was predicted to yield a generation loss of only 0. 7 %. Improvements to fish passage survival with the Alden turbine retrofit are length dependent, yielding a predicted 23 % improvement (i. e., an increase from 79 % to 97 % predicted survival) for 300 mm fish...|$|E

A specialized 7-pin socket (Septar or B7A), with all <b>pins</b> in a <b>circle</b> with one <b>pin</b> wider than the others, {{was used for}} transmitting tubes. Subminiature tubes with long wire leads, introduced in the 1950s, were often soldered directly to printed circuit boards.

40|$|A {{solution}} {{method is}} given to the problem of plane wave propagation through one- and two-dimensional platonic arrays. The problem is formulated in terms of boundary integral equations and a solution is constructed using boundary element methods. Previous work has been restricted to simple geometries such as <b>circles,</b> <b>pins</b> and squares, and here the framework is extended to consider scatterers of arbitrary shape subject to clamped-edge boundary conditions at the edge. This is done by constructing scattering matrices for a single grating and using Bloch's theorem to form an eigenvalue problem which connects the grating problem to the array problem. The associated eigenvalues then permit the construction of band surfaces which reveal the flexural wave filtering capabilities of different geometries, as well as the behaviour of Bloch waves within the array. Multiple geometries are investigated and the first band surfaces are computed for these specific cases...|$|R
5000|$|In 1905 {{a variant}} called rubber band duckpins was {{introduced}} in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area by William Wuerthele, in which the <b>pins</b> are <b>circled</b> with hard rubber bands to increase action and scoring. Wuerthele observed bowlers wasting their third ball as well as flying pins injuring pin boys, so, according to a defunct publication called The Ducks, Wuerthele added the rubber band to increase scoring. The American Duckpin Congress was formed in the 1920s to govern the game of rubber band duckpins. The organization later became the American Rubber Band Duckpin Bowling Congress in 1945 and became an affiliate of the National Duckpin Bowling Congress. The rubber band game is now almost extinct, with most of the lanes located in private clubs. Rubber band duckpin is the only version of duckpin played in the province of Quebec, where it has retained a certain degree of popularity. The rubber band game is also played in at least one dual tenpin/duckpin bowling centre in Markham, Ontario. A family entertainment center and resort in Hayden, Idaho offers two lanes of rubber band duckpins alongside its normal tenpin facility. Bowlers tend to throw slowly with their fingers facing forward to give the ball backspin. There have been perfect games bowled in rubber band duckpin, including the largest duckpin prize ever won on television, C$50,000 in 1994. [...] Since it is easier to knock down pins in rubber band duckpin, its rules are identical to those of standard ten-pin bowling.|$|R

50|$|Dandi Biyo {{is played}} by two or more players. The wooden pin is laid across a four-inch-deep hole in the ground. One player puts {{one end of the}} stick inside the hole and holds the other end. The player jerks the stick against the pin to launch the pin into the air while other players called 'fielders' try to catch the pin. If one of the fielders catch the pin in the air, the turn is over and the catcher takes the stick. If the pin instead hits the ground, that player plays to score. One of the fielders then throws the pin into the hole while the player tries to hit and throw the pin away. If the pin goes into the hole, the player's turn is over and the points {{accumulated}} by the player automatically becomes zero. If the pin doesn't go into the hole, the player plays to score by hitting the pin at one end by the stick. In another version of the game, a circular boundary of about one-meter diameter is drawn on the ground. The player throws the <b>pin</b> into the <b>circle</b> from a distance of about two meters. If the pin lies within the circle the player continues to play and score.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{enhancement}} {{method of}} fatigue {{life and the}} crack initiate and growth behavior of a holed specimen was investigated by using the 2024 Aluminum alloy and 0. 45 % Carbon steel. The purpose of present study is to propose a simple technical method for enhancement of fatigue life in a notched specimen. Also, the effect of local plastic deformation by cold work on fatigue crack initiation behavior was examined. This paper presents a basic experimental kinematic cold expansion method by inserting and removing a pin through the specimen hole. The shape of cross-section of <b>pin</b> was a <b>circle</b> or an ellipse. It was shown that the fatigue life of the specimen with the cold-worked hole was longer {{than that of the}} specimen with non-cold-worked hole for the case of same stress level in aluminum alloy and carbon steel.

25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb <b>circle</b> <b>pins</b> by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the <b>circle</b> <b>pins,</b> with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|R
40|$|Sketches are {{hand-drawn}} informal figures often {{created as}} a way of thinking about or working through a problem. Sketch-understanding systems let users interact with computers by drawing naturally, offering a freedom not available with traditional CAD systems. Sketching is ubiquitous: We draw {{as a way of}} thinking, solving problems, and communicating {{in a wide variety of}} fields, for both design (such as sketches of conceptual designs) and analysis (such as sketches drawn to help puzzle through problems in physics or electronic circuits). Unfortunately in todayâs technology, sketches are deadâtheyâre either graphite on slices of dead trees, or, if captured on a PDA or tablet computer, simply pixels of digitized ink. The Sketch Understanding Group at MIT has been working toward a kind of âmagic paperââthat is, a surface thatâs as natural and easy to draw on as paper, yet that understands what you draw. What does it mean for the paper to âunderstandâ? One example, in Figure 1, shows some of our earliest work. We use Assist (A Shrewd Sketch Interpretation and Simulation Tool) to sketch simple 2 D physical devices, then watch them behave. 1 Assist understands the raw sketch shown in Figure 1 a in the sense that it interprets the ink the same way we do (Figure 1 b), that is, as an inclined plane with a wheeled cart. As Figure 1 c shows, it hands this interpretation to a physics simulator, which animates the device, giving the user the experience of drawing on intelligent paper. One detail helps illustrate the sense in which the system understands the sketch in a manner similar to a human observer. The wheels (blue circles) are attached to the carâs body with <b>pin</b> joints (pink <b>circles),</b> yet the user draws both the wheels and pin joints with the same geometric shapeâa circle. The system interprets a circle differently based on contextâa circle can be a pin joint only if itâs drawn over two bodies that are already overlapping (in this case the car body and the wheel).

40|$|Theoretical {{background}} for calculation of k-h-v type cycloid reducers was developed relatively long ago. However, recently the matters of cycloid reducer design again attracted heightened attention. The {{reason for that}} is that such devices are used in many complex engineering systems, particularly, in mechatronic and robotics systems. The development of advanced technological capabilities for manufacturing of such reducers today gives the possibility for implementation of essential features of such devices: high efficiency, high gear ratio, kinematic accuracy and smooth motion. The presence of an adequate mathematical model gives the possibility for adjusting kinematic accuracy of the reducer by rational selection of manufacturing tolerances for its parts. This makes it possible to automate the design process for cycloid reducers with account of various factors including technological ones. A mathematical model and mathematical technique have been developed giving the possibility for modeling the kinematic error of the reducer with account of multiple factors, including manufacturing errors. The errors are considered in the way convenient for prediction of kinematic accuracy early at the manufacturing stage according to the results of reducer parts measurement on coordinate measuring machines. During the modeling, the wheel manufacturing errors are determined by the eccentricity and radius deviation of the <b>pin</b> tooth centers <b>circle,</b> and the deviation between the pin tooth axes positions and the centers circle. The satellite manufacturing errors are determined by the satellite eccentricity deviation and the satellite rim eccentricity. Due to the collinearity, the pin tooth and pin tooth hole diameter errors and the satellite tooth profile errors for a designated contact point are integrated into one deviation. Software implementation of the model makes it possible to estimate the pointed errors influence on satellite rotation angle error and reasonable selection of accuracy parameters for technological processes related to reducer parts manufacture. Additionally, it gives the possibility for estimation of the reducer kinematic error according to measurements by means of a coordinate measuring machine and diagnostics of reducer parts manufacturing errors by means of its kinematogram analysis. The model is implemented as a program developed in Microsoft Visual C++ 6. 0 environment. Obtained results have found their application in CAD of cycloid reducers...|$|R
