5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
25|$|Self-acting {{machine tools}} that {{displaced}} hand dexterity {{so they could}} be operated by boys and unskilled laborers were developed by James Nasmyth in the 1840s. Machine tools were automated with Numerical control (NC) using <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> in the 1950s. This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC).|$|E
25|$|Purely {{electronic}} circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{embroidery}} factories {{the designs}} are coded on <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tapes.</b> The code (<b>punched</b> holes or no holes) is proprietary by the manufacturer. This paper describes {{a method that}} reads those <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> into files, converts them to graphical representation, modifies and exports them to the required needlework format. The production stages benefit from this, since the produced outcome (graphic design) will be known in real time, enabling the user to perform corrections or alterations, {{with the aid of}} standard graphical tools available in the toolbars of the original design, including creation of new designs. The new or modified designs are saved in the appropriate code format required from each different embroidery machine.

25|$|For {{acoustic}} hydrography and bathymetry, {{the ship}} had a deep-water echosounder, a shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, and a hydrographic survey sounder. To process data, she had the National Ocean Services Hydrochart system, which employed a PDP/8E computer to acquire and process hydrographic data in real time, generate a real-time position-corrected plot of sounding data, provide steering commands to the helmsman, and generate a <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> for shore-based processing of sounding dara.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{reason for}} the use of one-pass assemblers was speed of assembly – often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading the program source on tape or rereading a deck of cards or <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process (or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.|$|E
2500|$|Cray {{was born}} in 1925 in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to Seymour R. and Lillian Cray. His father was a civil {{engineer}} who fostered Cray's interest in science and engineering. As early as the age of ten {{he was able to}} build a device out of Erector Set components that converted <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> into Morse code signals. The basement of the family home was given over to the young Cray as a [...] "laboratory".|$|E

5000|$|A Model 20 Teletype {{machine with}} a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> ("reperforator") was {{installed}} at subscriber newspaper sites. Originally these machines would simply <b>punch</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> and these tapes {{could be read}} by a tape reader attached to a [...] "Teletypesetter operating unit" [...] installed on a Linotype machine. The [...] "operating unit" [...] was essentially a box full of solenoids that sat on type of the Linotype's keyboard and pressed the appropriate keys {{in response to the}} codes read from the tape, thus creating type for printing in newspapers and magazines.|$|R
5000|$|In {{information}} handling, the U.S. Federal Standard 1037C (Glossary of Telecommunication Terms) {{defines a}} hard copy {{is a permanent}} reproduction, or copy, {{in the form of}} a physical object, of any media suitable for direct use by a person (in particular paper), of displayed or transmitted data. Examples of hard copy include teleprinter pages, continuous printed tapes, computer printouts, and radio photo prints. On the other hand, physical objects such as magnetic tapes diskettes, or non-printed <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> are not defined as hard copy by 1037C.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1940s, the {{earliest}} electronic digital systems had no operating systems. [...] Electronic systems {{of this time}} were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plug boards. [...] These were special-purpose systems that, for example, generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper cards. [...] After programmable general purpose computers were invented, machine languages (consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape)</b> were introduced that sped up the programming process (Stern, 1981).|$|E
2500|$|... "Bill" [...] Griffith P. Taylor in 1937 and {{published}} in Meccano Magazine, March 1938. The crane-like device was built almost entirely using Meccano parts, and powered by a single electric motor. [...] Five axes of movement were possible, including grab and grab rotation. Automation was achieved using <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> to energise solenoids, which would facilitate {{the movement of the}} crane's control levers. The robot could stack wooden blocks in pre-programmed patterns. The number of motor revolutions required for each desired movement was first plotted on graph paper. This information was then transferred to the paper tape, which was also driven by the robot's single motor. Chris Shute built a complete replica of the robot in 1997.|$|E
50|$|Backing {{store was}} {{magnetic}} drum and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column punched cards and optionally 160-column punched cards and <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> Output was to 80-column punched cards, line printer, and optionally to <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E

50|$|The bulletins {{and look}} angles were {{initially}} typed by hand by airmen in the communications office and sent by teletypewriter {{to all the}} participating sensors. The teletypewriter machines used <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> before the invention of chadless tape.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} little {{agreement}} on the precise definition of automatic programming, mostly because its meaning has changed over time. David Parnas, tracing the history of [...] "automatic programming" [...] in published research, noted that in the 1940s it described automation of the manual process of <b>punching</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> Later it referred to translation of high-level programming languages like Fortran and ALGOL. In fact, {{one of the earliest}} programs identifiable as a compiler was called Autocode. Parnas concluded that [...] "automatic programming has always been a euphemism for programming in a higher-level language than was then available to the programmer." ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, the programmer, who {{was also}} the operator, would write a program and run it.After the program {{finished}} executing, the output may have been printed, or {{it may have been}} <b>punched</b> onto <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> or cards for later processing.More often than not the program did not work.|$|R
50|$|Data input {{required}} intermediate processing via <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> or {{punched card}} and separate input to a repetitive, labor-intensive task, removed from user control and error-prone. Invalid or incorrect data needed correction and resubmission with consequences for data and account reconciliation.|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{additional}} difference: Monotype must use a <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> and the [...] "reading frame" [...] is always backwards (right-to-left) {{in order to achieve}} justification, as justification is not an inherent capability of the machine (however, [...] "flush left" [...] is an inherent capability); whereas Linotype may use a <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> although this option is seldom-used outside of daily newspapers, and whether a tape is used, or not, the [...] "reading frame" [...] is always forwards (left-to-right), with justification being an inherent capability of the machine (and, [...] "flush right", [...] "centered" [...] and [...] "flush left" [...] may be very easily accommodated manually, or automatically using a [...] "quadder" [...] attachment).|$|E

50|$|The main {{operating}} {{systems for the}} 1700 were the Utility System, which usually {{took the form of}} several <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> (resident monitor plus utilities), a similar Operating System for larger configurations (often including punched cards and magnetic tape), and the Mass Storage Operating System (MSOS) for disk-based systems. A Fortran compiler was available. Pascal was also available, via a cross compiler on a CDC 6000 series host. The Cyber 18 series, exploiting the extended instruction set, ran a disk-based OS, the Interactive Terminal Oriented System (ITOS). This system supported Fortran, Cobol, and UCSD Pascal. ITOS was a foreground/background system with multiple users connected via serial CRT terminals; user tasks ran in the background while the operating system itself ran in the foreground.|$|R
