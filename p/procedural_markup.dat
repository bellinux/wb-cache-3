Inline {{commands}} called control words, {{indicated by}} {{a period in}} the first column of a logical line, describe the desired appearance of the formatted text. SCRIPT originally provided a 2PASS option to allow text to refer to variables defined later in the text, but subsequent versions allowed more than two passes.|$|E
40|$|A {{central issue}} in the {{development}} of multimedia systems is the presentation of the information to the user of the system and how to best represent that information to the designer of the system. Typically, the designers create a system in which content and presentation are inseparably linked; specific presentations and navigational aids are chosen for each piece of content and hard-coded into the system. We argue that the representation of content should be decoupled from the design of the presentation and navigational structure, both to facilitate modular system design and to permit the construction of dynamic multimedia systems that can determine appropriate presentations in a given situation on the fly. We propose a new markup language called PML (<b>Procedural</b> <b>Markup</b> Language) which allows the content to be represented in a flexible manner by specifying the knowledge structures, the underlying physical media, and the relationships between them using cognitive media roles. The PML des [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Markup {{practices}} {{can affect}} the move toward systems that support scholars {{in the process of}} thinking and writing. Whereas <b>procedural</b> and presentational <b>markup</b> systems retard that movement, descriptive markup systems accelerate the pace by simplifying mechanical tasks and allowing the authors to focus their attention on the content...|$|R
40|$|The {{software}} lexicon is {{an important}} source of information during program comprehension activities and {{it has been in the}} focus of several recent case studies. Identifiers and comments, which constitute a lexicon in software, encode domain concepts and design decisions made by programmers. The paper presents an exploratory study that investigates regularities in the software lexicons of open-source projects by analyzing distributions of tokens in diverse software artifacts. The study examined source code of 142 systems from different domains, written in 12 different programming languages, as well as bug reports and external documentation. We discover that distributions of lexical tokens in studied artifacts follow the Zipf-Mandelbrot law, which is an empirical law in statistical natural language processing. Furthermore, the study reveals that the Zipf-Mandelbrot law is not confined to program lexicons in object-oriented languages, as shown in the previous studies, but also emerges in source code written using <b>procedural,</b> functional and <b>markup</b> languages, as well as other software artifacts. Our study also indicates that a previously devised software science equation does not hold for describing the program vocabulary–length relationship and more studies are necessary. 1...|$|R
40|$|Text mining is {{a growing}} {{innovative}} field that endeavors to collect significant information from natural language processing term. It might be insecurely distinguished as the course of examining texts to extract information that is practical for particular purposes. In this case, the mining model can detain provisions that identify the concepts of the sentence or document, which tends to detect {{the subject of the}} document. In an existing work, the concept-based mining model is used only for normal text documents clustering and clustered the text parts of the documents and efficiently discover noteworthy identical concepts among documents, according to the semantics of the sentences. But the downside of the work is that the existing work cannot be linked to web documents clustering and the text classification for the documents is an unreliable one. To make the text clustering more consistent, in our work, we plan to present a Conceptual Rule Mining On Text clusters to evaluate the more related and influential sentences contributing to the document topic. In this paper, the conceptual text clustering extends to web documents, containing various markup language formats associated with the documents (term extraction mode). Based on the markup languages like presentations, <b>procedural</b> and descriptive <b>markup,</b> the web document's text clustering is done efficiently using the concept-based mining model. Experiments are conducted with the web documents extracted from the research repositories to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed consistent web document's text clustering using conceptual rule mining with an existing A...|$|R
40|$|What SGML (and T E X) is {{all about}} is given in a nutshell. Markup of example {{document}} elements, by SGML and L A T E X, are provided. Coupling SGML to T E X is considered by direct translation and by the intermediate <b>procedural</b> <b>markup</b> phase. Interfacing SGML to (La) T E X is also addressed. Some guidelines are provided in order to decide when SGML, or T E X (alone, both, or neither) might be beneficial. It is a 3 -in- 1 paper: what is SGML and T E X all about, examples of marked up copy in SGML and (La) T E X and the coupling issues, finished up with a literature compilation. What is a Document? The Association of American Publishers (AAP) Reference Manual on Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup defines a document as: A document is an organized collection of smaller pieces of text (such as chapters) and images (such as figures) that are called elements. The elements in a document have a relationship to each other which gives the document a definite organization called document str [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a detailed {{overview of the}} principal languages for the representation, interchange and exploitation of data, both textual and graphical. In particular, a detailed discussion is made of the procedure of text encoding. The approach taken in the article emphasises {{the importance of the}} World Wide Web for data dissemination and the fundamental issue of standards: HTML, XML and its derivate languages are analysed in detail. Importance has been given to the languages that represent not only the characters that textual sources contain but also the structure, content and appearance of the data. Two types of markup languages are presented: procedural and descriptive. A <b>procedural</b> <b>markup</b> specifies how the document should be presented. Descriptive (or logical) markup languages describe the structure of a document, such as SGML. The article considers the topics of international standards as the TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange for the description of marked-up electronic texts and the RDF metadata recommendation. The first section concludes with a presentation of the innovative aspects of the Semantic Web. The second part focuses on spatial, graphical and multimedia data, and their display and exchange over the Web. The development of the Geography Markup Language (GML) is introduced and discussed, as well as other vector formats derived by XML, such as SVG, to construct structured spatial and non-spatial information for data sharing over the Web. Importance has also been given to the virtual reality languages such as VRML, an ISO standard, and the XML-based X 3 D. In conclusion the article aims to present a broad view not only of the technical aspects of data encoding but also the analysis of the standards, which are fundamental in the light of data interoperability and exchange...|$|E
40|$|Markup {{language}} {{is the combination}} of text and information (about text s structure and presentation style) about the text. A language that has codes for indicating layout and styling of a document (such as boldface, italics, paragraphs, placement of graphics, etc.) within a text file is called a Markup language. Widely used markup languages include SGML (Standard General Markup Language) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language. In other words, when we format text to be printed (or displayed on a computer), we need {{to distinguish between the}} text itself and the instructions for printing the text. The markup is the instructions for the text. Markup can also indicate information about the text. For example, many students in school highlight certain phrases in their text books. This indicates that the highlighted text {{is more important than the}} surrounding text. The highlight color is markup. Markup Text added to the data of a document to convey information about the document; for example: tags, processing instructions, and hyperlinks. Markup language-History ✦ A text-formatting language designed to transform raw text into structured documents, by inserting <b>procedural</b> and descriptive <b>markup</b> into the raw text. ✦ A language designed to describe or transform in space or time data, text, or objects into structured data, text, or objects, for example: SGML, HTML, and VRML. The concept of Markup was introduced by William W. Tunnicliffe, in 1967, as Generic Code but working implementation was actually done in 1980 by Brian Reid. However, Charles Goldfarb is known as father of Markup Languages due to his contributions in development of IBM GML and SGML. SGML is first widely used Markup System developed by International Organization fo...|$|R
