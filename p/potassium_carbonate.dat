5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E

5|$|Techniques to {{preserve}} birds were attempted {{even from the}} early 16th century {{as shown in the}} writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (<b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate),</b> salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, ground pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E

Sodium potassium niobate (K 0. 5 Na 0. 5) NbO 3 is a prototype material of lead-free alkaline-transition metal ferroelectrics with perovskite structure. Processing procedures for KNN-based ceramics are however challenging due to the hygroscopic behavior of sodium- and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates</b> and the evaporation of alkalines at the elevated processing temperatures, which make it difficult to control the stoichiometry of the ceramics.

25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates</b> aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|R
30|$|Alkaline {{reagents}} are preferred, {{especially by}} Cantonese people, for making alkaline noodles [32]. It {{is believed that}} the original purpose of adding alkaline in noodles is to prolong the noodle shelf life by retarding the mold growth [37]. Sodium <b>carbonates,</b> or <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> or the mixture of the two (typically 9 : 1, kansui) {{are the most common}} alkaline salts used in alkaline noodles [43]. The addition rate of alkaline salts depends on the noodle types. Specifically, the optimum dosage is 1.0 – 1.5 % for fresh alkaline noodles and 0.3 – 0.5 % for steamed alkaline noodles [37]. The quantity of sodium hydroxide is usually 0.3 – 1.0 % for the partially boiled alkaline noodles. Alkaline–flour interactions are responsible for several effects, including strengthening of the dough texture [44]; reducing the dough development time and dough stability; improvement in both the firmness and chewiness of noodles [45]; retardation of starch gelatinization and increase in starch paste viscosity [44, 46]; inhibition of enzyme activity and enzymatic browning [43, 47]; and also contribution to the bright yellow color, aroma and flavor [47].|$|R
50|$|Salt {{is added}} when making the flour dough to {{strengthen}} gluten structures {{and enhance the}} sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is {{to slow down the}} activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures, and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because flavonoid pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese ramen, this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.|$|R

40|$|To avoid {{problems}} related to the discharge of sulfidic spent caustics, a biotechnological process is developed {{for the treatment of}} gases containing both hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol. The process operates at natron-alkaline conditions (> 1 mol L- 1 of sodium- and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates</b> and a pH of 8. 5 – 10) to enable the treatment of gases with a high partial CO 2 pressure. In the process, methanethiol reacts with biologically produced sulfur particles to form a complex mixture predominantly consisting of inorganic polysulfides, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS). The effect of these organic sulfur compounds on the biological oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur was studied with natron-alkaliphilic bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Biological oxidation rates were reduced by 50 % at 0. 05 mM methanethiol, while for DMDS and DMTS, this was estimated to occur at 1. 5 and 1. 0 mM, respectively. The inhibiting effect of methanethiol on biological sulfide oxidation diminished due to its reaction with biologically produced sulfur particles. This reaction increases the feasibility of biotechnological treatment of gases containing both hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol at natron-alkaline condition...|$|R
