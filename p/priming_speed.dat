Because L 2 primes activate only a subset of the L 1 translations senses, priming is not observed. In this study we test the predictions of the Sense Model by using Japanese-English cognates, which allow us to manipulate the number of senses that words have in each language. Contrary to the predictions of the Sense Model, our results replicated the typical asymmetrical priming effects, suggesting {{that it is not the}} total activation of senses that drives the priming effect.

As a consequence, priming a travel goal (i. e., going to a place) in memory {{increases}} the accessibility of the associated travel mode among habitual users of this transportation mode. We posit that individual differences in attention to present moment and experience (dispositional mindfulness construct; Brown & Ryan, 2003) could moderate the interaction between travel goal priming and habit strength.

40|$|Pictures of handled {{objects such}} as a beer mug or frying pan are shown to <b>prime</b> <b>speeded</b> reach and grasp actions that are {{compatible}} with the object. To determine whether the evocation of motor affordances implied by this result is driven merely by the physical orientation of the object's handle as opposed to higher-level properties of the object, including its function, prime objects were presented either in an upright orientation or rotated 90 ˚ from upright. Rotated objects successfully primed hand actions that fit the object's new orientation (e. g., a frying pan rotated 90 ˚ so that its handle pointed downward primed a vertically oriented power grasp), but only when the required grasp was commensurate with the object's proper function. This constraint suggests that rotated objects evoke motor representations only when they afford {{the potential to be}} readily positioned for functional action. It is well known that handled objects like beer mugs and frying pans evoke hand action representations even when such affordances are not demanded by task requirements (e. g., Handy, Grafton, Shroff, Ketay, & Gazzaniga, 2003).

But if attention can selectively enhance our response to an unseen stimulus then attention cannot be a sufficient precondition for awareness. Kentridge, Heywood & Weiskrantz [Kentridge, R.

Neuropsychologia, 42, 831 – 835. ] demonstrated just such a dissociation in the blindsight subject GY. Here, we test whether the dissociation generalizes to the normal population. We presented observers with pairs of coloured discs, each masked by the subsequent presentation of a coloured annulus. The discs acted as <b>primes,</b> <b>speeding</b> discrimination of the colour of the annulus when they matched in colour and slowing it when they differed.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of simple goal setting in airport security control. As outcome, crew performance in terms of productivity (Experiment 1, field setting) was studied. Furthermore, the moderating role of negative and positive priming due to a previous task {{on the impact of}} goals (Experiment 2, laboratory setting) was analyzed. This research builds a bridge from goal setting theory to practice and prepares the grounds for its application in security or emergency organizations. In Experiment 1, supervisors of Security Officers at a large European airport communicated goals to their subordinates without any prior intervention or training. Goals were applied to a short “peak” time span (40 min). Dependent variables were objective team-level measures of productivity, namely passenger density and throughput. Experiment 2 featured two different tasks that <b>primed</b> <b>speed</b> (negative priming: puzzle; positive priming: car race). The Frankfurter Aufmerksamkeitsinventar served as main task for obtaining speed and accuracy measures.

5000|$|Priming effects {{occur when}} the prime {{influences}} the motor response to the target: consistent <b>primes</b> <b>speed</b> responses to the target, whereas inconsistent primes slow responses (Fig. 2). Priming effects in response times are calculated by taking the difference between response times in inconsistent and consistent trials. Apart from their effects on response <b>speed,</b> <b>primes</b> can greatly affect the rate of response errors (i.e., erroneous responses to the target): consistent primes rarely lead to errors, whereas error rates can become very high for inconsistent primes. In response times as well as error rates, priming effects typically increase with SOA, leading to the typical response priming patterns in Fig. 2. This implies that the more time is elapsing between prime and target, the larger the prime's influences on the response. For average response times of 350-450 ms, the response priming effect can become as large as 100 ms, {{making it one of}} the numerically largest effects in response time research. Results from many experiments show that the increase of priming with SOA occurs because the prime has an increasing amount of time to influence the response process before the actual target stimulus can come into play and control the motor response on its own. This is evident from the time-course of motor activity in the EEG, from primed pointing responses, from measurements of response force, and from simulation studies, which all suggest that motor activation first occurs in the direction specified by the prime, and only then proceeds in the direction specified by the actual target. Therefore, the ultimate size of the priming effect depends both on properties of the stimuli and on properties of the task. Primes with high stimulus energy (e.g., higher contrast, longer duration) and tasks with easy stimulus discriminations lead to large priming effects, whereas primes with low stimulus energy and tasks with difficult discriminations lead to smaller effects. [...] Priming effects can be amplified by visual attention directed to the prime's position or to its relevant features just in time for the prime's appearance.|$|R
40|$|Memory {{theories}} {{assume that}} unconscious processes influence conscious remembering, but {{the exact nature}} of the relationship between implicit and explicit memory remains an open question. Within the context of episodic recognition tests research typical shows that priming impacts behavioural and neural indices of familiarity. By this account, implicit memory leads to enhanced fluency of processing, which is then attributed to 'oldness' in the context of recognition judgments. Recently, however, behavioural and neuroimaging evidence has emerged to suggest that priming can also influence recollection, suggesting that the rate of recollection increases following priming. Here, we examine the relationship between priming and recollection, using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to assess changes in the timecourse of processing. Participants studied a series of words, and episodic memory was assessed using a standard item recognition test, but masked repetition priming preceded half of the test cues. Results confirmed that implicit memory was engaged: priming produced robust facilitation of recognition Reaction Times (RTs), with larger effects for studied than unstudied words. Mapping onto the RT data, ERPs recorded during recognition testing over centro-parietal electrodes revealed N 400 -like priming effects (250 - 500 ms) that were larger in magnitude for studied than unstudied words. More importantly, priming also had a clear impact on explicit memory, as measured by recollection- related left-parietal old/new effects. While old/new effects for unprimed trials were present during the typical 500 - 800 ms latency interval, the old/new effects seen for primed trials were equivalent in magnitude and topography, but onset ~ 300 ms earlier. ERPs reveal that repetition <b>priming</b> <b>speeds</b> the onset of recollection, providing a novel demonstration that unconscious memory processes can have a measureable, functional, influence on conscious remembering...|$|R

Throughout {{the globe in}} last three to four decades generation of electricity out of these renewable sources has created wide interest. Induction generators are widely preferable in wind farms because of its brushless construction, robustness, low maintenance requirements and self protection against short circuits. However poor voltage and frequency regulation and low power factor are its weaknesses. The magnitude of terminal voltage and frequency is completely governed by the rotor speed, excitation and load.

Priming consisted in active listening to either masculine, feminine, or neutral words coming from the car radio while driving in a high-end driving simulator. Results showed that when the concept of masculinity was activated by <b>priming,</b> participants' driving <b>speed</b> increased significantly from the beginning to the end of the driving simulation as compared to the neutral and the feminine condition. Results are discussed with respect to real life health implications...|$|R

Our {{problem is}} to find a {{rational}} f mction n/d E F(x) where n / d = g mod f: gcd(f, d) = gcd(n, d) = 1 and deg n + deg d deg 12 and D > deg d satisfying N + D < m are known, then bhe problem is solved by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm in F[z]. If degree bounds are not known it is still possible to find n/d with high probability. One way is to use rnaximal q otient rational f mction reconstruction. We have implemented the algorithm for F[x] = Zp[x], with p a <b>prime.</b> To <b>speed</b> up the algorithm, our implementation uses Karatsuba 2 ̆ 7 s algorithm for multiplication in Z,[z] and a Fast Extended Euclidean Algorithm. As an application, we have modified Brown 2 ̆ 7 s modular GCD algorithm to use the maximal quotient algorithm. The modification reduces the number of evaluation points needed by the algorithm...|$|R
