5|$|Grenville and the G class {{spent the}} bulk of their time before the start of World War II {{assigned}} to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla (DF) in the Mediterranean Fleet, where they made a number of neutrality patrols during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. With the exception of Garland which was under repair at Malta after a <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> of her depth charges, they returned home in October–November after {{it became clear that the}} Italians would not enter the war. Hardy and the H-class ships were assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla and joined the Gs in the Mediterranean after commissioning for similar duties.|$|E
5|$|HMS Garland, {{also known}} by her Polish {{designation}} ORP Garland, was a G-class destroyer {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Shortly after World War II began, she was badly damaged by the <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> of her own depth charges and required over six months of repairs. Before these were completed, Garland was loaned to the Polish Navy in May 1940. The ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet afterwards and escorted convoys there before being assigned to the Western Approaches Command in September for escort duties. She escorted a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta during Operation Halberd in September 1941 and escorted Convoy PQ-16 from Iceland to Murmansk in May 1942. She was badly damaged by a near miss from a German bomber during that operation and required three months of repairs.|$|E
5|$|Like the infantry, the {{engineers}} {{had been pushed}} off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations. Three teams came in {{where there were no}} infantry or armor to cover them. Working under heavy fire, {{the engineers}} set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles—work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40%.|$|E

25|$|Between February and October 1972 the Provisional IRA {{carried out}} two bombings against sand barges at Lough Neagh. Two IRA members {{were killed by}} the <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> of one of the devices, while two of the barges were sunk in a second incident, with a loss of £80,000. These barges were {{probably}} the Lough Neagh and the Ballyginniff.|$|E
25|$|Military {{preparations}} for the campaign included a series of attacks on British customs houses in Northern Ireland. On 28 and 29 November 1938, British customs posts along the border were demolished using explosives. The only fatalities were three IRA volunteers, Jimmy Joe Reynolds from Leitrim, John James Kelly from Donegal, and Charlie McCafferty from Tyrone, killed by the <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> of a mine at a house in Castlefin, County Donegal on 28November 1938.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> types {{could result}} from the {{magnetic}} influence exploder. If a torpedo was still turning to get on course or had not stabilized its depth when the warhead armed, the exploder could see a magnetic field change and detonate. As the warhead approached the target, it could sense a change due to the ship's effect on the earth's magnetic field. That's a desired effect if the torpedo is set to run under the ship, but not a desirable effect when the torpedo is set to hit {{the side of the}} ship.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} common types of <b>premature</b> <b>explosions.</b> In the first, the warhead {{exploded}} {{just as it}} armed. These <b>premature</b> <b>explosions</b> were easily discerned by the submarine because the torpedo exploded before it {{had a chance to}} reach its target. In the second, the warhead exploded just before reaching the target ship but far enough away that it did no damage. The skipper, looking through the periscope, could see the torpedo run right to the ship and see the explosion; the crew could hear the high order explosion. Everything would look OK except that the target ship would get away with little or no damage. Sometimes the submarine command would hear about these <b>premature</b> <b>explosions</b> from intercepted enemy communications.|$|R

25|$|After {{his return}} to Ireland, Emmet began to prepare a new rebellion, with fellow revolutionaries Thomas Russell and James Hope. He began to {{manufacture}} weapons and explosives {{at a number of}} premises in Dublin and developed a folding pike fitted with a hinge that allowed it to be concealed under a cloak. Unlike in 1798, the revolutionaries concealed their preparations, but a <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> at one of Emmet's arms depots killed a man. Emmet was forced to advance the date of the rising before the authorities' suspicions were aroused.|$|E
25|$|The Dragon ambushes Ripley and Clemens in {{the prison}} infirmary, where it kills Clemens. It {{initially}} threatens Ripley but then mysteriously spares her and retreats. Andrews orders Aaron to take {{her back to the}} infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into the vents and killed by the monster. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the extraterrestrial. However, its intervention causes a <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and discovers the embryo of a xenomorph queen growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the Aliens into biological weapons.|$|E
25|$|It {{deployed}} to Port Moresby in New Guinea in October 1942 where it flew {{in support of}} Australian Army operations against the Japanese around Buna and Gona. Initial losses were high, partially due to malfunctioning ordnance, the <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> of {{which resulted in the}} loss of three aircraft in separate incidents in the space of two months. Operating in conjunction with the Beaufighter-equipped No. 30 Squadron RAAF, in December the squadron undertook several low-level attack missions, and also damaged a Japanese destroyer. In March 1943 the squadron {{played an important role in}} the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, an air-sea battle which resulted in significant losses for the Japanese. A member of the squadron, Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC)– the Commonwealth's highest military decoration– for his actions while flying a Boston on two separate missions between 16 and 18 March 1943.|$|E

500|$|In January 1966, Eastwood met {{producer}} Dino De Laurentiis in New York City {{and agreed}} to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named Le Streghe ("The Witches") opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress Silvana Mangano. Eastwood's nineteen-minute installment took {{only a few days}} to shoot, but his performance did not please the critics, one writing that [...] "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'." [...] Two months later Eastwood began work on the third Dollars film, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with Eli Wallach portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. [...] "I know about these things," [...] he said. [...] "Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can." [...] Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word [...] "Vaya!" [...] resulted in a <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> that could have killed Wallach.|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} British Army and the {{residents}} had steadily decayed {{since the first}} appearance of troops in August 1969. [...] In September, after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds {{that led to the}} death of a Protestant man, William King, the British Army erected a 'peace ring' to enclose the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled. [...] Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets. [...] Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary, there was anger among young people. [...] Clashes between youths and troops became more frequent. [...] The riot following the Officials' Easter parade in March 1970 marked {{the first time that the}} army used 'snatch squads', who rushed into the Bogside wielding batons to make arrests. [...] The snatch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations. [...] There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random, sometimes days after the alleged offence, and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance. [...] The rioters were condemned as hooligans by moderates, who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation. [...] The Labour radicals and Official republicans, still working together, tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations—one such organization was named the Young Hooligans Association—but to no avail. [...] The Provisionals, while disapproving of riots, viewed them as the inevitable consequence of British occupation. [...] This philosophy was more attractive to rioters, and some of them joined the Provisional IRA. [...] The deaths of two leading Provisionals in a <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> in June 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization. [...] Nevertheless, up to July 1971 the Provisional IRA remained numerically small.|$|E

2500|$|Centaur was sailing past Cap des Salinés, Martinique, {{early in}} the morning of 26 November when a battery fired at her. Hood had Maxwell anchor in Petite Anse d'Arlette. Then a landing party made up of Centaurs marines and about 40 sailors {{destroyed}} the battery. They also threw its six 24-pounders over the cliff. [...] The militia guarding the battery had a brass 2-pounder gun but fled without putting up any resistance even though the landing party had to climb a steep, narrow path. Unfortunately, the <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> of the battery's magazine cost Centaur one man killed, and three officers and six men wounded, the only casualties from the operation. Then Centaur discovered another battery, this one armed with two 42-pounders and a 32-pounder, between the Grande and Petite Anse d'Arlette. The French abandoned the battery when a landing party approached. Once again, Centaurs men threw the guns over the cliff and destroyed a barracks and the ammunition stored there.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October Hazard and [...] were {{in company}} {{when they came}} upon the French {{privateer}} schooner Général Ernouf moored under the guns of the battery of St. Marie {{on the east coast}} of the southern part of Guadeloupe. Hazard and Pelorus attempted to send in a cutting out party during the night, but the boats could not find a channel. The British went in again in the daylight despite fire from the battery and the schooner's long 18-pounder pivot-gun and two swivels. Fire from Hazard and Pelorus silenced the batteries but as the British came alongside the French crew, an estimated 80-100 men, fled ashore. There two field guns joined them in firing on the cutting-out party. Because the schooner was aground and chained to the shore the boarding party could not bring her out; instead, they set fire to her. However, a <b>premature</b> <b>explosion</b> injured some of them. In all, Hazard lost three men killed and four wounded; Pelorus lost three killed and five wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Brisbane {{returned}} to operations in II Corps on 15 July.

On the ship's return to Subic on 3 August, the damaged turret was removed, but as the replacement turret would not arrive until September, Brisbane would complete the deployment with only a single gun turret. After the completion of maintenance, Brisbane {{returned to}} duty on 23 August, but instead of gunline duties, was assigned {{as the head of the}} escort screen for the aircraft carrier [...] The ships were deployed to Yankee Station, with Brisbane and [...] (plus other destroyers on occasion) performing escort and plane guard duties.
