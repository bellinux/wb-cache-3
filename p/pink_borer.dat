The objectives of this work were to determine the level of resistance in different sweet corn inbreds and to identify sources of resistance to ear feeding by the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer.</b> Twenty-eight sweet corn (su(1) and su(1) se(1)) inbreds and four resistant field corn (Su(1) Se(1)) inbreds were evaluated for ear resistance at different sowing dates, under two methods of artificial infestation. There were significant differences between infestation methods for ears with damaged grain, husks, cobs, and shanks. The inbred×infestation method interaction was significant for general appearance of the ear. The most resistant inbreds were identified by using mean comparisons and principal component analysis of ear damage traits. All inbreds were damaged. Hence, resistance was incomplete and in need of improvement. EP 59, H 3, I 5125, IL 767 b, and V 7726 were the most resistant sweet corn inbreds, which did not differ significantly from A 635, the most resistant field corn inbred.

40|$|The <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> (Sesamia nonagrioides Lef.) is {{the most}} {{important}} pest of maize (Zea mays L.) in northwestern Spain. The objective of this work was to evaluate defense mechanisms against Sesamia in 10 inbred lines and the 10 -parent diallel among these inbreds. Hybrids and inbred lines were tested over 2 yr in northwesternSpain under natural and artificial infestations. Yield of infested and non infested plants per plot were computed to calculate yield loss caused by the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> attack. Principal component analyses for stem damage traits and for ear damage traits were made for each infestation condition. From the principal component analysis, an index was computed to measure stem damage and ear damage. Damage index under artificial infestation was used to evaluate antibiosis while antixenosis was detected when damage index of each genotype was compared under artificial and natural infestation. The regressions of yield loss on the damage index were used to separate the genotypes into four groups according to the possession of antibiosis and/or tolerance mechanisms. A 509, A 661, EP 31, F 7, PB 60, and Z 77016 showed stem antibiosis. A 637, A 661, EP 31, F 7, and PB 60 exhibited stem tolerance. A 509, A 661, and EP 31 stood out by their ear antibiosis. A 637, A 661, F 7, and PB 60 were tolerant to ear damage. We conclude that the three mechanisms of defense to the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> attack (antixenosis, antibiosis, and tolerance) were found among inbred lines and hybrids.

40|$|The <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer,</b> Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} insect pests of maize (Zea mays L.) in northwestern Spain. The objectives of this work were to evaluate, at different times during the growth of maize, structural traits related to the entry point and tissues on which larvae feed and to determine the relationship between these structural traits and the stem borer resistance. Six inbred lines with different levels of stem resistance to S. nonagrioides were evaluated in several trials. Potential structural resistance factors included rind and pith puncture resistance (RPR and PPR), rind thickness, length of the meristematic area (LMA), and pith parenchyma interlumen thickness (PPIT). Surprisingly, the inbred lines that showed the strongest stalks, EP 42 and EP 47, were not stem resistant to <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> attack, while the stem resistant inbreds A 509, CM 151, and PB 130 were among the least resistant to rind puncture. There were no significant differences among resistant and susceptible inbreds for the rind thickness. However, the susceptible inbred EP 42 had the softest internode pith, and the resistant inbred PB 130 showed the hardest, as was expected. Susceptible inbred lines in general showed higher values for the LMA, while the PPIT was important for individual inbreds. The results suggest that the usefulness of these characters as estimators of <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> resistance is limited to some genotypes. Besides, even among those genotypes, other mechanisms of resistance that do not involve stalk strength could be present. Among the traits considered, the LMA was the most promising as an indicator of resistance to <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer,</b> although further experimentation is necessary.

All generations, either per se or crossed to testers, were evaluated in a 10 × 10 triple lattice design under artificial infestation with S. nonagrioides in 2005 and 2006. Most traits fit an additive–dominance model; but evidence for epistasis for resistance and yield under infestation was shown. Epistasis, in general, did not appear {{to play an important role}} in the inheritance of yield under <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> infestation.

A field experiment was conducted in 1997 at Sakha Agricultural Research Station, Kafr El-Sheikh governorate, North of the Nile delta, where heavy natural infestation by #S. cretica$ is of frequent occurrence on early plantations. The experimental design was randomized blocks with seven replications and five treatments. Treatments were control (T 1), the currently recommended chemical insecticide (methomyl, 640 g active ingredient per hectare) (two sprayings, three and five weeks after sowing) (T 2), and three treatments with highly purified suspensions of virus in water at three different doses (two sprayings, three and five weeks after sowing). The lowest dose of the virus insecticide (T 3) was 60 g of granules per hectare (i. e. 7. 4 x 10 to the 15 th power I. B. /ha).

For all stem damage traits, GCA was significant, while SCA and reciprocal effects were not significant. This indicated that, for this set of inbreds, only additive effects were important for stem antibiosis. GCA and SCA effects were significant, {{in at least one}} trial, for yield under both infestation conditions and for yield loss. Reciprocal effects were significant for yield of infested and non infested plants in 1995. The lack of concordance among lines that exhibited the most favorable GCA effects for stem antibiosis, yield loss, and yield under infested conditions and the low correlation coefficient between SCA effects for yield under infested and non infested conditions showed that yield under infested conditions is the best trait for evaluating the level of defense against <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> attack.

The {{objective of this}} work was to identify sources of resistance to stem and ear damage by the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer.</b> One hundred twenty-one inbreds from seven germplasm groups (American, Argentine, European, Lancaster, Northern Flint, Reid, and Other), divided according to their maturity grouping (very early, early, midscason, and late), were evaluated for several years under artificial infestation at Pontevedra (northwestern Spain). Twelve traits were recorded to measure stem and ear damage. Stem and ear damage resistance traits were not correlated, therefore simultaneous selection for {{the two types of}} resistance within the same population should be carried out. Eight very early, two early, seven midseason, and four late inbreds were resistant to stem-damage. The Reid germplasm group was more resistant to stem attack than the other groups. Therefore, the best Reid inbreds could be used to form a stem-damage resistant Reid synthetic, which could be a source of new stem-damage resistant varieties. Simultaneously, the best non-Reid inbreds could be used for making a non-Reid stem-damage resistant synthetic. Thirteen very early, 10 early, two midseason, and three late inbreds performed better than the others against ear attack.

The maize composite EPS 12 has been chosen as the base population for a breeding program based on its resistance to <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer,</b> with the main selection criterion being resistance to stem tunneling. Yield was taken as a secondary selection criterion to avoid any unwanted negatively correlated response on this character. The aims of investigation were: (1) to monitor the effects of selection for resistance to <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> on allele frequency at 70 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and their impact on the genetic structure of EPS 12 and (2) to identify loci at which allelic frequencies changed significantly due to directional selection. Genetic diversity was reduced during the selection process (as expected since random genetic drift as well as selection could reduce genetic variability), but not significantly so. Although the loss of genetic variation was generally consistent with that expected in a model in which random genetic drift acts alone on neutral alleles, the changes observed in the frequency of five alleles were significantly greater than expected. Further, the linear trend of the departure from the random genetic drift model was significant for some allelic versions of two SSR markers, umc 1329 and phi 076; directional selection was therefore acting on these loci. The significant effect of directional selection on those markers suggests the presence of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for tunnel length and/or for yield under artificial infestation with Sesamia nonagrioides on the long arm of chromosome 4.

A ten inbred-line diallel was evaluated for two years for ear resistance. Inbred parents and hybrids were tested in adjacent trials under artificial infestation conditions. In both types of trials, ear damage trails were recorded at han esl. The correlation coefficients between grain and coh damage traits were very low. General appearance of the ear had the highest correlations with the other grain damage traits. Therefore, this trait appeared as a good indicator of grain resistance to Sesamia nonagrioides attack. General combining ability was significant for all traits, while specific combining ability and reciprocal effects were significant only for the percentage of ears with damaged cob. It will be necessary to breed jointly for grain resistance and cob resistance to obtain ear resistance. Since, for this set of lines, only additive effects were significant for grain damage trails, the inbreds with favorable GCA for these trails could he used as donors of grain resistance for making a synthetic population that could be bred by a intrapopulational recurrent selection program for grain resistance. However, the breeding of cob resistance should use GCA, SCA and reciprocal effects. So, an interpopulational recurrent selection program for cob resistance could be carried out.

40|$|The most {{important}} pest of maize (Zea mays L) in North America and Europe is the European com borer (Os¬trinia nubilalis Hbn). However, in southern Europe another com <b>borer</b> species, the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> (Sesamia nonagri¬oides Lef.), also causes significant damage to maize. The dam¬age {{caused by the}} <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> in the northwest of Spain was not important a few years ago, but today this damage has increased considerably. Few studies about this pest have been made thus far. The first objective of this work was to study the population quantity and seasonal appearance of Sesamia non¬agrioides in this area. Two trials were carried out in two years under natural field conditions with different sowing dates, thus covering the damage at different stages where the plant-insect relationship could change. The {{results showed that the}} attacks varied in intensity depending on the year and sowing date. Early sowing could be a good method for cultural control of Sesamia nonagrioides because the material is too mature and escaped borer attack. Although cultural control could be effec¬tive in preventing or reducing the damage, genetic resistance is another alternative that could be used alone or joined with other control components for integrated pest management. The first step in this insect-resistance breeding program is to identify sources of resistance. Consequently, the second objec¬tive was to study the resistance/tolerance of twenty maize in¬bred lines under artificial infestation conditions with Sesamia nonagrioides. The inbred lines were evaluated for resistance and other agronomic traits. Significant differences were found for all traits. The inbred lines were divided according to matur¬ity groups: early and late. Early maturing inbreds had the greatest damage. The early inbreds EP 37, W 153 R and CMI 05 and the late inbreds Va 26 and w 64 A showed the best resis¬tance to the pest. Thus, they could be promising sources of re¬sistance or tolerance to <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer.</b> These lines may be suitable for use directly in the formation of resistant hybrids and new resistant inbred lines.

N 547 is a yellow endosperm maize inbred germplasm with resistance to stalk and shank tunneling damage caused by the second generation of the European corn borer (ECB) Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner). N 547 was derived by selfing a selected full-sib family from MBITA, a tropical population developed by CIMMYT, Mexico. MBITA was created to recombine sources of resistance to temperate and subtropical stalk borers. These insects included ECB, southwestern corn borer (SWCB) Diatraea grandiosella (Dyer), sugarcane borer (SCB) D. sacharallis (F.), spotted stem borer Chilo partellus Swinhoe, <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> Sesamia calamistis Hampson, sugarcane borer (African) Eldana saccharina Walker, and African maize stalk borer Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Smith et al., 1989) ...|$|R
40|$|The European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn) is an {{important}} insect pest of maize (Zea mays L.) in Europe. However, the larvae of <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> (Sesamia nonagrioides Lef.) produce important damage to the stems, especially in Southern Europe. The first step in an insect-resistance breeding program is to identify sources of resistance. The objective of this work was to study the resistance/tolerance of several populations of maize to attack by corn borers in general, and of Sesamia nonagrioides in particular. Twenty landraces of maize were evaluated for two years at two locations under natural infestation. In one location most of the larvae that were found belonged to Sesamia while in the other location the larvae of Ostrinia were more abundant. Agronomic and resistant traits were analyzed in all trials and the best varieties for resistance. along with new material, were evaluated further under artificial infestation conditions with Sesamia nonagrioides. The extraearly and early material suffered less borer damage than the late and midseason material, because the early populations probably escaped the second brood of borers. Moreover, the varieties with small proportion of damaged stems come from the Ebro valley. The germplasm of this area. then, {{could be a good}} source of resistance or tolerance to the borers. However, it showed a low yield. The EPS 7 (S) C 2 synthetic also had good resistance under artificial infestations with Sesamia nonagrioides. Further, it showed better yield than the landraces because two cycles of S 1 recurrent selection for yield have been carried out in this synthetic. Therefore EPS 7 (S) C 2 could be the base material in a breeding program to obtain resistant varieties to the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer.</b> This work was supported by the Committee for Science and Technology of Spain (Project AGR 89 - 0537) and the Department of Education of the Autonomous Government of Galicia (Project XUGA 40301 A 90).

40|$|Stem borers {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{constraints}} limiting maize productivity in Africa. The most important species reducing maize yield in West and Central Africa are Sesamia calamistis, Eldana saccharina and Busseola fusca. Both the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> (Sesamia calamistis Walker (Pyralidae) and the sugarcane borer Eldana saccharina Hampson (Noctuidae) infest and reduce maize yields in the lowlands of West and Central Africa. Host pant resistance is very effective in managing the pests and researches conducted in the sub-region have identified promising genotypes with resistance to the two borer species. Such genotypes have been utilised to develop improved varieties with better levels of resistance. Genetic studies revealed that both additive and non-additive gene actions are important in varying degrees for the different components of resistance. The improved varieties are being strategi- cally deployed on-farm while other adapted varieties are being improved for resistance to enhance their usefulness. Progress made in screening and breeding for stem borer resistance in the region is discussed. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Flint maize, Zea mays L., {{varieties}} {{provide some}} interesting agronomic characteristics and kernels that possess a better ability than other kernels for developing high-quality flour. The <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer,</b> Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre, {{is an important}} constraint for the maize crop in Mediterranean regions. The objective of this work was to identify a >flint X flint> heterotic pattern that would perform well under artificial infestation by S. nonagrioides. A 10 -population diallel was evaluated under infestation by S. nonagrioides in 2 yr. Variety effects were the only significant effects involved in stem and ear resistance to S. nonagrioides attack. Variety effects and average heterosis effects were the only significant effects for grain yield under artificial infestation conditions. Considering variety effects and cross-performance, the heterotic pattern Basto/Enano levantixo X Longfellow (BA/EL X LO) would be recommended for obtaining flint maize hybrids tolerant to S. nonagrioides attack because BA/EL had the most favorable variety effects for stem resistance, LO exhibited the most positive variety effects for grain yield, and the cross BA/EL X LO yielded significantly more than the remaining crosses.

40|$|The {{bioactivity}} of the aqueous extracts of {{the leaf}} and stem bark of the medicinal plant, Alstonia boonei De Wild (Apocyanaceae), against the <b>pink</b> stalk <b>borer,</b> Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was studied in a laboratory bioassay. The extracts were incorporated into artificial diet {{at a rate of}} 0. 0 % (control), 1. 0 %, 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, and 10. 0 % (w/w). Both extracts significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced larval survival and weight in a dose dependent manner. The concentrations that killed 50 % of the larvae (LC 50) for the stem bark extract were 2. 8 % and 2. 1 % at 10 and 20 DAI (days after introduction), respectively, while those for the leaves extract were 5. 6 % and 3. 5 %. The weights of the larvae also varied significantly (P< 0. 05) between the treatments in a dose dependent manner. We conclude that both leaf and stem bark extracts of A. boonei are toxic, used as growth inhibitors to S. calamistis larvae, and hold good promise for use as alternative crop protectants against S. calamistis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer,</b> Sesamia inferens (Walker), {{is a major}} pest of {{rice and}} is endemic in China {{and other parts of}} Asia. Small heat shock {{proteins}} (sHSPs) encompass a diverse, widespread class of stress proteins that have not been characterized in S. inferens. In the present study, we isolated and characterized three S. inferens genes that encode members of the α-crystallin/sHSP family, namely, Sihsp 21. 4, Sihsp 20. 6, and Sihsp 19. 6. The three cDNAs encoded proteins of 187, 183 and 174 amino acids with calculated molecular weights of 21. 4, 20. 6 and 19. 6 kDa, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of the three genes showed strong similarity to sHSPs identified in other lepidopteran insects. Sihsp 21. 4 contained an intron, but Sihsp 20. 6 and Sihsp 19. 6 lacked introns. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that Sihsp 21. 4 was most strongly expressed in S. inferens heads; Whereas expression of Sihsp 20. 6 and Sihsp 19. 6 was highest in eggs. The three S. inferens sHSP genes were up-regulated during low temperature stress. In summary, our results show that S. inferens sHSP genes have distinct regulatory roles in the physiology of S. inferens...|$|R

40|$|In China, the <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> (PSB) Sesamia inferens (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) {{has become}} a rice pest in some rice-producing regions. The cause of this shift from {{secondary}} to major pest is unknown. The major {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of five commonly used pesticides in rice fields on reproduction of PSB and on biochemical substances of rice plants. The results showed that the weight of pupae developed from 1 st instar larvae treated with 2 mg/L triazophos and the number of eggs laid by emerged females from the treatment were significantly greater than those of the control, increasing by 26. 2 % and 47 %, respectively. In addition, a nontarget insecticide, pymetrozine 100 mg/L, and a target insecticide, chlorantraniliprole 2 mg/L, stimulated reproduction of PSB. Biochemical measurement showed that foliar sprays of these pesticides resulted in significant reductions of contents of resistant substances, flavonoids and phenolic acids, in rice plants. For example, flavonoids and phenolic acids of rice plants treated with triazophos reduced by 48. 5 % and 22. 4 %, respectively, compared to the control. Therefore, we predicted that the application of some pesticides, eg triazophos and chlorantraniliprole, may be the cause of the increase in the population numbers of PSB in rice fields...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> (PSB) (Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre) and the European corn borer (ECB) (Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner) are {{the major}} insect pests of corn (Zea mays L.) in Mediterranean countries, {{although}} larvae of other insects can also cause damage. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of sweet corn hybrids, planting time, and environment on damage by various insects. Data were recorded on the number of larvae of each of the aforementioned pests and damage produced in the ear 20 days after pollination and in the ear and stem when plants were dry. PSB was the most abundant pest, followed by ECB. Other insects, such as Mythimna unipuncta (Haworth) and Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) were rarely found in sweet corn plants. ECB was constant over time, PSB had larger seasonal variation, and M. unipuncta and H. armigera were highly variable over time. There were significant differences among planting dates and growing cycles for damage traits in each environment. Interactions among hybrids, planting dates, and environments were significant. Dry ears were damaged more than fresh ears and stems had more larvae than ears. The economic value of the crop was seriously affected because most fresh ears had some damage, and seed production would be severely affected by PSB. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The rice water weevil (RWW) Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an {{invasive}} {{insect pest}} of rice Oryza sativa L. in China. Little {{is known about}} the interactions of this weevil with indigenous herbivores. In the present study, adult feeding and population density of the weevil, injury level of striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and <b>pink</b> stem <b>borer</b> Sesamia inferens (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to rice, as well as growth status of their host plants were surveyed in a rice field located in Southeastern Zhejiang, China, in 2004 with the objective to discover interspecific interactions on the rice. At tillering stage, both adult feeding of the weevil and injury of the stem borers tended to occur on larger tillers (bearing 5 leaves) compared with small tillers (bearing 2 ~ 4 leaves), but the insects showed no evident competition with each other. At booting stage, the stem borers caused more withering/dead hearts and the weevil reached a higher density on the plants which had more productive tillers and larger root system; the number of weevils per tiller correlated negatively with the percentage of withering/dead hearts of plants in a hill. These observations indicate that interspecific interactions exist between the rice water weevil and the rice stem borers with negative relations occurring at booting or earlier developmental stages of rice...|$|R
