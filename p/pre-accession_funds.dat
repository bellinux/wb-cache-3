50|$|The Government of Macedonia did not {{demonstrate}} sufficient progress in protecting trafficking victims in 2009. Macedonia’s victim identification procedures require that first-line responders liberally identify people, such as illegal migrants and foreign {{women and girls}} in prostitution, as potential victims until they can be formally vetted by a trained anti-trafficking authority. Of the 157 potential trafficking victims identified by authorities in 2009, seven were confirmed as trafficking victims; all were children. Eighteen victims were identified in 2008. With IOM assistance, the government organized a series of trainings reaching 280 front-line responders on proactive victim identification. These trainings were funded with the government’s EU <b>pre-accession</b> <b>funds,</b> earmarked for trafficking. Additionally, {{in conjunction with the}} OSCE, the government trained all of the country’s labor inspectors on proactive victim identification in the labor sector. Macedonian law exempts victims from criminal prosecution for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked. While the government’s standard operating procedures mandate a multi-disciplinary approach to identifying victims, NGOs and international organizations should be more systematically included in this process. The government continued to fund and operate a transit center for foreign migrants and trafficking victims with the help of a local NGO that specializes in victim rehabilitation, especially children. The government provided in-kind contributions to the NGO assisting foreign victims in this center. All potential victims are offered a two-month reflection period during which time they are offered victim assistance services, regardless of whether they choose to testify for the state. At any time during the reflection period, if they decide to cooperate with authorities in the investigation of the crime, an additional six-month residency permit can be granted. As an undocumented foreigner, until a foreign trafficking victim receives a legal residency status, his or her movement is restricted to within the shelter. During the reporting period, one foreign victim stayed in the transit center under the reflection period. No foreign victims to date have requested the six-month residency permit.|$|E

The field research regarding PHARE grant scheme beneficiaries was focused on a number of dimensions of the absorption and management capacity such as: identification of organizational profile, impact of PHARE programs on organizations, perceptions concerning management of the project and relationship with the managing authority, perspective on applying to ESF funding.

Drawing on new-institutionalist theories we make an attempt to asses the impact of Europeanization on the domestic policies, which will also eventually affect the domestic institutional governance structures. The conclusion is that Europeanization has been a major driving force behind the changes in Czech regional policies.

In this context, the EU allocates part of its budget to support the economic and social development objectives of third countries. This assistance is channeled into these countries through a large number of instruments designed according to the specific circumstances and needs of individual groups of countries. The main objective of the cohesion policy is to help reduce economic and social disparities within the EU Member States, and to help prepare the EU-accession countries for effective and efficient implementation of this policy once they become full EU Member States. By promoting cohesion, the EU contributes to a harmonious and sustainable development of the economic activities in the Member States, and also offers structural help to the EU-accession states within the framework of programmers of pre-accession support. Pre-accession programmes – PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD – which de-facto play the role of “external” instruments of economic and social cohesion, finance various programmes in the fields of infrastructure, industry, environment, services, agriculture, rural development and small business.
