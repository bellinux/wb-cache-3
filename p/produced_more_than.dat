Having previously acted in television, he began acting in films; {{he made his}} directorial debut with Reality Bites. Throughout his career he has written, starred in, directed, or <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 films, including The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Zoolander, The Cable Guy, There's Something About Mary, the Meet the Parents trilogy, , Tropic Thunder, the Madagascar series, and the Night at the Museum trilogy.

5|$|CFS {{was inaugurated}} at Point Cook, Victoria, in March 1913, and trained over 150 pilots of the Australian Flying Corps during World WarI. It was disbanded in December 1919, {{and the newly}} formed RAAF's No.1 Flying Training School took on its {{function}} in 1921. Re-formed under EATS at Point Cook in April 1940, CFS relocated to New South Wales the following month, based first at Camden, then at Tamworth from April 1942, and finally at Parkes from January 1944. It returned to Point Cook in September 1944. By the end of World WarII, the school had <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3,600 instructors. It transferred to East Sale in November 1947.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the United States <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while {{extraction}} {{plants in}} Canada, Poland, Russia, {{and other nations}} produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption {{and the costs of}} producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich was a {{prolific}} artist who <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 500 attributed works. In {{line with the}} Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as The Stages of Life, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted {{during one of the}} revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to technological advances, competition from other materials and an economic slowdown. Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the few major operations, {{the first decade of}} the boom was {{dominated}} by numerous small producers. As production expanded and new companies were formed, consolidation occurred. By the late 1920s, ten companies <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of the oil in the state: Gulf Production Company, Humble Oil and Refining Company, Southern Crude Oil Purchasing Company (later absorbed by Amoco which was later absorbed by BP), the Texas Company, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Yount-Lee Oil Company, Magnolia Petroleum Company, J. K. Hughes Oil Company, Pure Oil Company, and Mid-Kansas Oil and Gas Company (later Marathon Oil).|$|E
5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E

5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E
5|$|The Bilbie {{family of}} bell founders and clockmakers {{lived and worked}} in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest {{surviving}} bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E

5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.|$|E
5|$|In {{connection}} with his {{background as a}} musician, Lee founded the record label Monster Music in 1999, signing Van Morrison's daughter Shana. Monster created numerous divisions as it diversified into other products, such as Monster Performance Car, Monster Game, Monster Photo and Monster Computer. By 2003, Monster <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1,000 products, including power cords, gaming accessories and cooling products. According to a 2005 USA Today article, Lee and his company were developing furniture with high-end electronics built-in, wireless products to replace audio cords and a user interface to consolidate the consumer's control of their electronics. Lee and his son worked with Dr. Dre to collaborate on the Beats brand of headphones, which was later acquired by Apple for $3 billion in 2014. According to Business Insider, Beats Electronics denies that Monster {{had a role in}} the design of the headphones. Lee said Beats had no engineers on staff and it spent millions in research and development to get the product started, but that their contract was poorly constructed, giving all the intellectual property to Beats when it wasn't renewed.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in September 1941 that the Squadron {{received}} the proto-type Lancaster bomber, the first squadron of the RAF to receive the new aircraft. On {{a visit to the}} Squadron in December, Guest and Meredith were taken on a flight in the new plane. Although the order was given in December to cease operations in the Hampdens, it was not until 3 March 1942 that the Lancaster was put on active service on its first battle mission for the entire RAF. The Squadron, with its Lancasters, was given key targets to bomb: on 17 April 1942, six Lancasters from 44 Squadron alongside six from 97 Squadron, bombed the MAN diesel engine factory, which <b>produced</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of the German U-boats, as well as engines for ships, tanks and transport vehicles. The success – at a cost of five planes and crew to 44 Squadron – earned the thanks of the Prime Minister himself. The Squadron was further involved in the obliteration of Rostock on 8 May and took part in the 1,000-aircraft attack on Cologne on 30 May.|$|E
