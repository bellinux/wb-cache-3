25|$|Instead {{of a pair}} of {{horizontal}} bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt</b> located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|E
500|$|The gun {{ports of}} the Warrior-class ships were built [...] wide, which allowed the 68-pounders to {{traverse}} 52°. While the ships were building the directing bar was developed {{which consisted of}} an iron bar that fastened to a <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt</b> in the sill of the gun port. After the gun carriages were modified, this allowed them to pivot {{much closer to the}} gun port than had previously been possible and meant that the gun ports could be narrowed to a width of [...] while retaining the same arc of fire. The gun ports were narrowed to the new width by [...] of wrought iron. Another delay was the modification of the armour plates with tongue and groove joints to lock the plates together and increase their resistance to armour-piercing shells. All together these modifications delayed the completion of Warrior by a year past her contract completion date.|$|E

5000|$|The visor swung up {{to uncover}} the wearer's face {{when he was not}} in combat, to grant him better {{visibility}} and unrestricted ventilation. This was accomplished in one of two ways. The most common form of visor in Central Europe was held on by a single hinge fastened {{to the center of the}} top of the visor, called a Klappviser. The other version had two <b>pivot</b> <b>bolts</b> on either side of the visor attaching it to the bascinet at the temples, and this was the most common form found in Southern, Western and Northwestern Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{damping force}} of a {{friction}} shock absorber is adjusted with the central <b>pivot</b> and clamping <b>bolt.</b> A star-shaped spring applies a force to the stack of disks. The damping force is roughly proportional to this force and the clamping nut is provided with a pointer arm to indicate the approximate setting.|$|R
50|$|A center <b>pivot</b> pin is <b>bolted</b> to {{the body}} bolster. The center pivot pin runs down {{vertically}} {{through the center of}} the bogie bolster through the center pivot. It allows for rotation of the bogie when the coach is moving on the curves. A silent block, which is cylindrical metal rubber bonded structure, is placed in the central hole of the bogie bolster through which the center pivot pin passes. It provides the cushioning effect.|$|R
50|$|They {{also came}} with rear heel guards that {{required}} a few {{minor changes to the}} frame, footpegs, and swingarm <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|E
50|$|Softail style suspension, {{where the}} shock {{absorbers}} are mounted horizontally {{in front of}} the swingarm, below the swingarm <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt</b> and operate in extension.|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} supports the swingarm, which is attached via the swingarm <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt</b> {{to the frame}} and holds the axle of the rear wheel. The {{rear suspension}} can consist of several shock arrangements: ...|$|E
60|$|She nodded, while Bob pricked up {{his ears}} to the {{knowledge}} {{that he had a}} strange rider on his back. The fun came quickly enough--too quickly for Dede, who found herself against Bob's neck as he <b>pivoted</b> around and <b>bolted</b> the other way. Daylight followed on her horse and watched. He saw her check the animal quickly to a standstill, and immediately, with rein across neck and a decisive prod of the left spur, whirl him back the way he had come and almost as swiftly.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrical}} {{servo actuator}} {{is mounted on}} a support arm which is allowed to <b>pivot</b> on a <b>bolt</b> through a fixed mounting bracket. The actuator is pivotally connected {{to the end of}} the support arm by a bolt which has an extension allowed to pass through a slot in the fixed mounting bracket. An actuator rod extends from the servo actuator to a crank arm which turns a control shaft. A short linear thrust of the rod pivots the crank arm through about 90 for full-on control with the rod contracted into the servo actuator, and full-off control when the rod is extended from the actuator. A spring moves the servo actuator and actuator rod toward the control crank arm once the actuator rod is fully extended in the full-off position. This assures the turning of the control shaft to a full-off position. A stop bolt and slot are provided to limit pivot motion. Once fully extended, the spring pivots the motion...|$|R

50|$|The gun {{ports of}} the Warrior-class ships were built 46 in wide, which allowed the 68-pounders to {{traverse}} 52°. While the ships were building the directing bar was developed {{which consisted of}} an iron bar that fastened to a <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt</b> in the sill of the gun port. After the gun carriages were modified, this allowed them to pivot {{much closer to the}} gun port than had previously been possible and meant that the gun ports could be narrowed to a width of 24 in while retaining the same arc of fire. The gun ports were narrowed to the new width by 7 in of wrought iron. Another delay was the modification of the armour plates with tongue and groove joints to lock the plates together and increase their resistance to armour-piercing shells.
