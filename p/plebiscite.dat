The <b>plebiscite</b> was the second in as many years. In 2015, a similar <b>plebiscite</b> was held that also included a fifth village, Lac Baker. The residents of all communities involved voted in favour of incorporation as a rural community with the exception of Lac Baker's residents, thereby defeating the proposal.|$|E

5|$|In {{this very}} tense {{atmosphere}} {{it was decided}} that a <b>plebiscite</b> would be held in the area asking people which country this territory should join. <b>Plebiscite</b> commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920, and after analysing the situation {{declared a state of emergency}} in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the area remained very tense, with mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings. A <b>plebiscite</b> could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a <b>plebiscite</b> and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually, on 28 July 1920, by a decision of the Spa Conference, Czechoslovakia received 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, containing 67.9% of the population. It was this territory that became known from the Polish standpoint as Zaolzie – the Olza River marked the boundary between the Polish and Czechoslovak parts of the territory.|$|E

5|$|India {{believed}} that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, the communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, and {{refused to accept the}} accession. The government pointed out that the state was 80% Hindu, and called for a <b>plebiscite</b> to decide the question of accession. Simultaneously, they cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and reoccupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India. Pakistan agreed to discuss a <b>plebiscite,</b> subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected. On 26 October, the Nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Government of India agreed. A <b>plebiscite</b> was conducted in February 1948, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India.|$|E
5|$|National referendums, or plebiscites, are {{elections}} whereby {{citizens can}} {{determine whether a}} specific legal text can become official law or not. For this to take place, {{one of the following}} conditions must be met: The president wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one, or the citizens petition for it. If the National Assembly calls for a <b>plebiscite,</b> a majority is needed in both chambers for it to be official. If the citizens request a <b>plebiscite,</b> they must gather 430,000 signatures from eligible voters across the country. Additionally, over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital Minsk. Once either condition is met, the president must issue a decree setting the date of the national <b>plebiscite.</b> The <b>plebiscite</b> must take place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if ten percent of the local population ask for it.|$|E

5|$|The Allied powers {{referred}} {{the problem}} of Upper Silesia to the League after they {{had been unable to}} resolve the territorial dispute. After the First World War, Poland laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of Prussia. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a <b>plebiscite</b> in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A <b>plebiscite</b> took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 percent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experiment where 48 Indonesian villages {{were randomly assigned}} to choose development projects through either representative-based meetings or direct election-based <b>plebiscites.</b> <b>Plebiscites</b> resulted in dramatically higher satisfaction among villagers, increased knowledge about the project, greater perceived benefits, and higher reported willingness to contribute. Changing the political mechanism had much smaller effects on the actual projects selected, with some evidence that <b>plebiscites</b> resulted in projects chosen by women being located in poorer areas. The results show that direct participation in political decision making can substantially increase satisfaction and legitimacy, even when it has little effect on actual decisions. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{minister}} {{in charge of}} the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits, and {{the country as a whole}} was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the <b>plebiscite,</b> Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm Miklas to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the <b>plebiscite</b> was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.|$|E
