5|$|A {{sound film}} is a motion <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> {{synchronized}} sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work as a designer for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place {{all day on}} Saturday before transmission.

It {{was one of the last}} major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality <b>picture,</b> <b>with</b> areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|E

5|$|The quarterback {{controversy}} between Smith and Sanchez {{was settled}} when Sanchez {{was injured in}} the 2013 preseason; he subsequently had surgery that ended his year. The Jets were inconsistent behind Smith, and finished 8–8, though knocking the Dolphins out of the playoff <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> a final-week victory. Ryan's contract was due to expire after 2014, but the head coach was given a multi-year extension on January 16 of that year. Sanchez was released on March 21, 2014, allowing the Jets to sign controversial former Falcons and Eagles quarterback Michael Vick. In 2014, the Jets went 4–12, last in passing until a final-game victory at the Dolphins. Both Idzik and Ryan were fired on December 29, 2014, {{the day after the}} season ended.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
