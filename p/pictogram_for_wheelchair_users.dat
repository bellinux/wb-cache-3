50|$|<b>For</b> <b>wheelchair</b> <b>users,</b> {{prolonged}} sitting {{can have}} similar adverse effects and health issues as <b>for</b> the able-bodied. <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>users</b> are perhaps at even greater risk since {{their bodies are}} already limited due to their health condition.

40|$|Both the {{percentage}} and raw {{number of people}} in need of wheelchairs are increasing every year. Unfortunately, <b>wheelchair</b> <b>users</b> are much more limited in access to conventional IT resources such as home computers and Internet, than their non-disabled counterparts. Moreover, no computer systems specifically designed and optimized <b>for</b> <b>wheelchair</b> <b>users</b> exist today that match the powerful desktop PC systems. In this research, we envision a wheelchair-worn computing system that is as effectively usable by <b>wheelchair</b> <b>users</b> as other conventional high-performance PC systemsfor general users. We call the system Ubiquitous Computing and Health-monitoring System <b>for</b> <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>Users</b> (u-CHS). As a preliminary study {{for the development of the}} u-CHS, we surveyed the needs and usages of the computing and health-monitoring system <b>for</b> <b>wheelchair</b> <b>users</b> in order to fully identify and understand the design requirements for the u-CHS. We received 97 enthusiastic responses from <b>wheelchair</b> <b>users</b> via a voluntary online survey and developed some key design concepts about the input/output, CPU, and health-monitoring modules...|$|R
