He denied that the jury had been packed, reiterated the offences mentioned in the indictment, and concluded by saying:— [...] "I wish you to understand [...] that we have, with the utmost anxiety, and {{with a view to}} come to a decision upon the measure of punishment which it would be our duty to impose, postponed the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> upon you till this morning. We have with the utmost deliberation, examined the matter, with an anxiety to duly discharge the duty which we owe on all hands— the duty which we owe the prisoner of not meting out punishment beyond the just measure of the offence, and the duty we owe to the public that the degree of punishment will be such as to carry out the object of all punishment, which is not the mere infliction of the penalty upon the person convicted, but the prevention of crime—that that punishment should carry with it a security to the country, as far as possible, that one who has offended so perseveringly—that so deliberate a violator of the law shall not be permitted to continue his course of conduct to the disturbance of its peace and prosperity. We had to consider all this—to look at the magnitude of the crime, and to look also at the consideration that if this were not the first case brought under the Act, our duty might have obliged us to carry out the penalty it awards to the utmost extent; but taking into consideration {{that this is the first}} conviction under the Act—though the offence has been as clearly proved as any offence of the kind could be—the sentence of the court is that you, John Mitchel, be transported beyond the seas for the term of fourteen years." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} of legality was also of importance here. Ackermann J agreed with Snyman: In criminal law this principle [...] "fulfils," [...] as Snyman put it, [...] "the important task of preventing the arbitrary punishment of people by state officials, and of ensuring that the determination of criminal liability and the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> correspond with clear and existing rules of law." [...] In this respect Snyman distinguished between a legal norm, a criminal norm and a criminal sanction, and illustrated the differences as follows: ...|$|E

50|$|Every {{enactment}} conferring {{power on}} {{a court to}} <b>pass</b> a <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> penal servitude in any case must be construed as conferring power to <b>pass</b> a <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment for a term not exceeding the maximum term of penal servitude for which a sentence could have been passed in that case immediately before 12 June 1950. But this does not empower any court, other than the High Court, to <b>pass</b> a <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment for a term exceeding three years.|$|R
60|$|At that time, it was {{the custom}} (as I learnt from my terrible {{experience}} of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sentences,</b> {{and to make a}} finishing effect with the <b>Sentence</b> <b>of</b> Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated, that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.|$|R
50|$|In Director of Public Prosecutions, KZN v P, the respondent, a fourteen-year-old girl, {{had been}} convicted of the murder of her grandmother. The <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> was {{postponed}} for a period of 36 months, on the condition that the respondent complied with the conditions of a sentence of 36 months' correctional supervision in terms of section 276(1)(h) of the Criminal Procedure Act. On appeal, the State argued that the sentence was too lenient, considering the gravity of the offence. It contended that, despite the young age of the respondent, direct imprisonment should have been imposed.|$|E
50|$|Most accused {{persons are}} {{released}} {{at the time}} of arrest on a promise to appear. Where the police decide to hold the accused, the police must produce the accused before a Justice of the Peace within 24 hours. At that point a bail hearing will be held. An accused person generally does not bear the onus justifying release, subject to a few exceptions, such as if the accused is charged with murder, trafficking in narcotics, terrorism offences (see Bail in Canada). An accused may be released or detained pending the trial and, if found guilty, the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{test for}} {{interference}} by an appeal court {{is whether the}} sentence imposed by the trial court is vitiated by irregularity or misdirection or is disturbingly inappropriate. The strongest mitigating factor in favour of the respondent in casu was her youthfulness: She had been twelve years and five months {{old at the time}} of the offence. A second factor was that she had no previous conviction. The aggravating factors, however, were overwhelming. The postponement of the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> was therefore inappropriate in the circumstances, and caused a sense of shock and a feeling that justice was not done.|$|E
50|$|Postponement <b>of</b> the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sentence,</b> or {{suspension}} <b>of</b> a <b>sentence,</b> {{usually on}} conditions (such as good conduct, compensation, correctional supervision, instruction or treatment, {{or any other}} condition the court thinks appropriate), is permitted in terms of section 297(1). The maximum period of postponement or suspension is five years.|$|R
50|$|Every {{enactment}} conferring a {{power on}} {{a court to}} <b>pass</b> a <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> penal servitude in any case must be treated as an enactment empowering that court to <b>pass</b> a <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment for a term not exceeding the maximum term of penal servitude for which a sentence could have been passed in that case immediately before the commencement of the Criminal Law Act 1997.|$|R

50|$|People {{charged with}} a {{criminal}} offence in Canada have {{a constitutional right to}} reasonable bail unless there is some compelling reason to deny it. These reasons can be related to the accused's likelihood to skip bail, or to public danger resulting from the accused being at large. In stark contrast to many other jurisdictions granting a constitutional right to bail, in Canada the accused may even be denied bail because the public confidence in the administration of justice may be disturbed by letting the individual, still legally innocent, go free pending the completion of the trial or <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> (Criminal Code, s. 515 (10)(c)). Sureties and deposits can be imposed, but are optional.|$|E

Then followsthe description of the German Rechtspfleger, an institution almost completelyunheard-of in our country, which settled 80 % of the procedures inthe German courts of first instance and which has been the key for efficiencypromotion in the German courts.
