The fluctuating wind velocity time series are simulated by the method of HSM (harmony superposition method).

40|$|Smooth {{and safe}} {{traffic on the}} highway system is crucial for a modern society. As the {{backbone}} of a highway system, key long-span suspension bridges as well as moving high-sided vehicles on the bridges are vulnerable to strong wind. Excessive vibration of bridges and vehicles may cause the bridge aerodynamic instability and vehicle accidents. When wind is strong, the excessive torsional response of the bridge also contributes to the discomfort of drivers or the occurrence of overturning accidents of vehicles moving on it. Potentials of adopting the tuned-liquid-damper (TLD) system as an enhancement measure for the stability of suspension bridges with high-sided vehicles are evaluated. Firstly, a general shallow water sloshing model in rectangular containers under off-axle rotation, lateral and vertical excitations is developed. The analytical platform of the general 3 -D bridge-vehicle-TLD system under wind and road roughness excitations is introduced. Secondly, a parametric study of the off-axle TLDs in controlling torsional motion of a simple single torsional mode bridge model under broadband white noise excitation is conducted to investigate the effectiveness and mechanism of the TLD on torsional motion. Finally, a numerical analysis of TLDs installed on a real suspension bridge-vehicle-wind system in time history is carried out considering interactions between the multimode bridge structure, multiple vehicles and the wind excitation. The {{results suggest that the}} off-axle TLD system can effectively suppress the torsional response of the suspension bridge through acting as a <b>pendulum</b> <b>damper</b> in addition to a typical sloshing damper, but has little direct suppression effect on the vibrations of vehicles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a semi-active vibration absorber (SVA) concept {{based on a}} real-time controlled magnetorheological damper (MR-SVA) for the enhanced mitigation of structural vibrations due to harmonic disturbing forces. The force of the MR damper is controlled in real-time to generate the frequency and damping controls according to the behaviour of the undamped vibration absorber for the actual frequency of vibration. As stiffness and damping emulations in semi-active actuators are coupled quantities the control is formulated to prioritize the frequency control by the controlled stiffness. The control algorithm is augmented by a stiffness correction method ensuring precise frequency control when the desired control force is constrained by the semi-active restriction and residual force of the MR damper. The force tracking task is solved by a model-based feed forward with feedback correction. The MR-SVA is numerically and experimentally validated for the primary structure with nominal eigenfrequency and when de-tuning of − 10 %, − 5 %, + 5 % and + 10 % is present. Both validations demonstrate that the MR-SVA improves the vibration reduction in the primary structure by up to 55 % compared to the passive tuned mass damper (TMD). Furthermore, it is shown that the MR-SVA with only 80 % of tuned mass leads to approximately the same enhanced performance while the associated increased relative motion amplitude of the tuned mass is more than compensated be the reduced dimensions of the mass. Therefore, the MR-SVA is an appropriate solution for the mitigation of tall buildings where the pendulum mass can be up to several thousands of metric tonnes and space for the <b>pendulum</b> <b>damper</b> is limited...|$|E
40|$|We {{illustrate}} a computational approach to practical nonlinear balancing via the forced <b>damped</b> <b>pendulum</b> example. 1 Introduction The theory of balancing, introduced by Moore [1], was extended by Scherpen [2] {{to a class}} of stable finite [...] dimensional systems in the nonlinear setting x = f(x) + g(x) u (1) y = h(x) (2) where x = (x 1,..., xn) are local coordinates for a smooth state manifold, f, g, and h are of class C #, f(0) = 0, and h(0) = 0. The existence of e#cient computational methods has been crucial in making balancing an e#ective and important tool for model reduction of linear systems. The balancing change of coordinates can be computed using established matrix equation and decomposition algorithms. In contrast, Scherpen's procedure for nonlinear balancing presents computational di#culties.

40|$|Tuned mass dampers (TMDs) {{supplement}} existing structures with damping {{while preserving}} stability. As evolutions {{of the structure}} to be controlled may pull down the performance {{of this kind of}} device, large bridges under construction in windy areas are rather equipped with active devices such as AMDs that prove efficient (7 th International Seminar on Seismic Isolation, Passive Energy Dissipation and Active Control of Vibrations of Structures, Assisi, Italy, 2001). However, active devices suffer from several drawbacks such as the necessity to carefully prevent from instability, {{especially in the case of}} noncollocated control. Therefore, a natural question arises: how to adapt a TMD in such a way to make its performance independent of the structural evolution? A new type of semi-active control system matching this requirement is presented. It builds upon a TMD of pendulum type. In order to damp the torsional mode of a bridge under construction, a gear with an alternator would connect the pendulum to the structure. As the bridge starts vibrating, the pendulum begins to oscillate and the alternator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy to be dissipated through an exterior resistor via the Joule effect. Given an optimal design of a passive tuned <b>pendulum</b> <b>damper</b> (TPD) for the structure in its current configuration, the semi-active control strategy consists in changing the resistor in real-time in such a way to lock the apparent stiffness and damping of the real TPD at their desired optimal values no matter the current construction step. Resistor tuning is mandatory even when only one construction step is considered since a constant resistor within the alternator would yield a time-varying effective damping coefficient of the pendulum, whereas the desired optimal damping assumes a given value, which does not change until the structure or load type changes. The semi-active control law easily adapts to any change of the structure provided this change is known. The control algorithm relies on the knowledge of the pendulum rotation, of the frequency of the mode to be controlled and of its modal participation factor at the TPD location. These modal parameters are computed during the construction process, or can be viewed as outputs of a SHM system. How to get these parameters has already received a lot of attention in the SHM literature and is not discussed here. Experimental validations on a small-scale bridge mock-up confirm the interest of the approach...|$|E
40|$|New {{techniques}} {{being employed}} by Orion guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) using a reaction control system (RCS) under parachutes are described. Pendulosity {{refers to a}} pendulum-oscillatory mode that can occur during descent under main parachutes {{and that has been}} observed during Orion parachute drop tests. The pendulum mode reduces the ability of GN&C to maneuver the suspended vehicle resulting in undesirable increases to structural loads at touch-down. Parachute redesign efforts have been unsuccessful in reducing the pendulous behavior necessitating GN&C mitigation options. An observer has been developed to estimate the pendulum motion as well as the underlying wind velocity vector. Using this knowledge the control system maneuvers the vehicle using two separate strategies determined by a wind velocity magnitude threshold; at high wind velocities the vehicle is aligned with the wind direction and for cases with lower wind velocities the vehicle is aligned such that it is perpendicular to the swing plane. <b>Pendulum</b> <b>damping</b> techniques using RCS thrusters are discussed but have not been selected for use onboard the Orion spacecraft.

40|$|On 20 August 2010 an {{energetic}} disturbance triggered damped large-amplitude longitudinal (LAL) oscillations in almost an entire filament. In the present work we analyze this periodic {{motion in the}} filament to characterize the damping and restoring mechanism of the oscillation. Our method involves placing slits along the axis of the filament at different angles {{with respect to the}} spine of the filament, finding the angle at which the oscillation is clearest, and fitting the resulting oscillation pattern to decaying sinusoidal and Bessel functions. These functions represent the equations of motion of a <b>pendulum</b> <b>damped</b> by mass accretion. With this method we determine the period and the decaying time of the oscillation. Our preliminary results support the theory presented by Luna and Karpen (2012) that the restoring force of LAL oscillations is solar gravity in the tubes where the threads oscillate, and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Following an earlier paper, we have determined the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic flux tubes hosting a thread along the filament, as well as the mass accretion rate of the filament threads, via the fitted parameters.

40|$|The {{configuration}} of long span cable-stayed bridge varies at different construction stages {{and so does}} its natural frequencies. The vibration control performance of a multi-stage <b>pendulum</b> mass <b>damper</b> (MPMD), whose natural frequency can be altered by controlling the pendulum wire length, was studied for mitigation of the wind-induced vibration of a long span cable-stayed bridge tower during construction. A theoretical framework for predicting the buffeting response of the coupled MPMD-bridge system was first developed. Four different construction stages of the bridge were selected for study. The effectiveness of MPMD was further examined by an experimental investigation. A 1 : 100 scale model of the bridge tower together with a two-stage <b>pendulum</b> mass <b>damper</b> were designed and manufactured. Two kinds of excitations, harmonic and white noise excitation, were applied respectively in the lateral direction of the bridge tower (le in the direction normal to the bridge longitudinal axis), which was considered as the most critical loading direction. The effect of various parameters, including damping ratio, mass ratio, and frequency tuning ratio of the damper, was considered in this study. Both the theoretical and experimental investigations showed that the MPMD can significantly reduce the displacement responses of the bridge tower for the concerned construction stages and the total damping of the tower was enhanced significantly by the MPMD.

40|$|In {{this article}} Denis Diderot's Fifth Memoir of 1748 {{on the problem}} of a <b>pendulum</b> <b>damped</b> by air {{resistance}} is discussed. Diderot wrote the Memoir in order to clarify an assumption Newton made without further justification in the first pages of the Principia in connection with an experiment to verify the Third Law of Motion using colliding pendulums. To explain the differences between experimental and theoretical values of momentum in the collision experiments he conducted Newton assumed that the bob was retarded by an air resistance F_R proportional to the velocity v. By giving Newton's arguments a mathematical scaffolding and recasting his geometrical reasoning in the language of differential calculus, Diderot provides a step-by-step solution guide to the problem and proposes experiments to settle the question about the appropriate form of F_R, which for Diderot quadratic in v, that is F_R ∼ v^ 2. The solution of Diderot is presented in full detail and his results are compared to those obtained from a Lindstedt-Poincare approximation for an oscillator with quadratic damping. It is shown that, up to a prefactor, both coincide. Some results that one can derive from his approach are presented and discussed for the first time.
