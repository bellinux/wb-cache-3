40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{fundamental}} assumption, this being that the production of high-quality postgraduate research depends on the proper application of appropriate research methods. A second assumption is that the <b>postgraduate</b> <b>researcher,</b> in attempting to draw up a sound research design and apply appropriate research methods, requires sound guidance and supervision. The hypothesis for this article is, consequently, that the choice of appropriate research methods strongly relates to the topic and purpose of the research and the unit of observation. For the purposes of this article, the authors used the subject of Public Administration. An analysis of 54 doctoral theses in Public Administration validates this hypothesis, because the analysis reveals that there is a definite association between, on the one hand, the topic and purpose of the research and the units of observation, and, on the other hand, the research methods used.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} the {{perception}} of undergraduate researchers towards science and technology research activities. The activity is {{carried out in the}} form of a research project in their final year of studies at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, which is a requirement for graduation. Responses from these students are the most important component in determining whether the Faculty of Science and Technology is producing future graduates suited for postgraduate research. In this study, 41 respondents were surveyed to determine their perception towards the scientific process they had experienced during their research. It found that a research process consists of the deduction of a suggested idea; execution of an experimental protocol and data acquisition based on a predetermined methodology; and a conclusion of the hypothesis, which in itself is a significant metamorphosis in shaping the mind of a student into a <b>postgraduate</b> <b>researcher.</b> The approach of this research considers the basic scientific competency of the students and by doing so, confirms that students are no longer technophobic, and boost the confidence to observe the aspects researched through a global overview through the utilization of the internet, before and after experimentation.

40|$|Derek Jarman's Angelic Conversations {{is neither}} a book {{exclusively}} focused on the 1985 film The Angelic Conversation, nor a study of Derek Jarman's interviews and correspondence. Rather, Jim Ellis attempts a broad, sweeping overview {{and analysis of the}} director's feature film oeuvre. This is done by taking the kind of 'queer theory ' approach which has increasingly gained in popularity amongst academics since Foucault's The History of Sexuality was published in 1984. The seven chapters and coda are just as accessible to the general reader and postgraduate alike, written with a great clarity and lucidity. Ellis, however, does not share Foucault's ubiquitous prolixity, keeping the book's argumentation transparent and concise. Derek Jarman was indeed a Homo Universalis or universal man, {{in the sense of a}} Renaissance polymath. Thus the book reflects Jarman's manifolds talents as an artist, director, political activist and landscape gardener. For the general reader and as a basic, thematic introduction to Jarman (as a provocative director par excellence) the book is successful. For the <b>postgraduate</b> <b>researcher,</b> the lucidity perhaps oversimplifies the deeper complexities of Jarman's artistic philosophies. Alas, 'nothing is more difficult than simplicity ' we are reminded in Jarman's Caravaggio, which seems to be the approach and merit of Derek Jarman's Angelic Conversations.

40|$|A {{biomaterial}} is {{a natural}} or synthetic substance that is engineered to take a form which, alone or in combination, interacts with components of a living system to provide a beneficial effect. They are often used in medical applications, to perform, augment or replace a natural function – think heart valves, cochlear implants and hip replacements. A broad range of physical, biological and chemical sciences underpin the design of biomaterials and the clinical disciplines {{to which they are}} relevant. These include polymer synthesis and characterisation, drug and gene vector design, biology of the host response, immunology and toxicology and self-assembly at the nanoscopic scale. This textbook is aimed at undergraduate engineering, bioscience and medical students but would equally provide a valuable primer for a <b>postgraduate</b> <b>researcher</b> new to biomedical engineering. The opening chapters introduce and outline the basic properties of the materials – metals, polymers, ceramics, composite and naturally occurring substances. The preparatory techniques of surface modification, sterilisation and cell matrix compatibility testing are considered before concluding by discussing in detail diverse applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and specific medical and dental functions. This well compiled book is readily accessible to a wide readership as the authors do not assume background knowledge of any particular field of study. Moreover, a pleasing balance is struck between life science and engineering, so that both scientific principles and engineering applications are presented with a view to blending theory and practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a research methodology and interim findings concerning the investigation, through ethnographic case-based research, of the impact within a construction project of the partial implementation of a value stream approach. It is intended that by undertaking research of this nature, a contribution can be made to the understanding of the cultural aspects of both lean construction and associated construction process theory. The research was undertaken within the wider context of the Movement for Innovation in the UK and in particular as one of a number of demonstration project trialling the ideas expressed by the Construction Industry Task Force in 1998 (DETR 1998). It traces the development of a model for identifying and implementing the value stream approach during project implementation, mapping planned construction processes and subsequently comparing planned with actual for the purposes of developing a target baseline for continuous process improvement. Through a pilot study to test the model, a qualitative analysis methodology is used and some propositions put forward relating to culture, the value stream framework and process mapping. It is intended to develop these through a major ethnographic case study.

40|$|Northern California has {{extensive}} {{areas of}} irrigated pasture, which provide critical summer forage for livestock. In {{many of these}} systems, water is diverted directly from a stream into ditches or pipes and transported to individual pastures, where it is applied as flood surface irrigation. Our case study of discharges from irrigated pastures on Willow and Lassen creeks in Modoc County illustrates an assessment and monitoring approach for land managers and natural-resources professionals working to resolve water-quality impairments related to agricultural discharges from similar systems. We report correlations between four indicator variables measured {{in the field and}} the variables determined in the laboratory, to evaluate the potential for employing a strategic combination of the two. Northern California has extensive areas of irrigated pasture, which provide critical summer forage for livestock. The irrigation season on these pastures can last from April through September, depending upon factors such as elevation, annual precipitation and site-specific water rights. In many of these irrigatedpasture systems, water is diverted directly from a stream into ditches or pipes and transported to individual pastures, where it is applied as flood surface irrigation. Irrigation frequency varies from continuous to regularly scheduled applications. It is common for a significant amount of runoff to be generated from pastures during flood irrigation. In Irrigated pasture provides critical summer forage for California livestock, but the environmental impacts on fish of diverting streams to pastures are coming under increasing regulatory scrutiny.

40|$|In t roduct ion Many {{authors have}} drawn {{attention}} to {{the increased use of}} qualitative techniques by commercial marketing researchers over the last decade (Greenberg et al., 1977; Cooper and Branthwaite, 1977; Goodyear, 1978; de Groot, 1986). These methods have been recommended for use in both consumer (Goodyear and Vineall, 1976) and more recently in industrial settings (Welch, 1985). Despite their importance, qualitative research methods are frequently misunderstood and even ignored by students of marketing. Fahad (1986) stressed this omission and advocated the use of one kind of qualitative research, namely, the focus group interview, at least by the <b>postgraduate</b> <b>researcher.</b> This, however, seems over-cautious. The benefits obtained from qualitative research methods render them worthy of consideration by all students engaged in research projects. These techniques can be used to conduct a preliminary exploration of an under-researched area, to sort and screen ideas as the project progresses, to explore complex behaviour or to experience a consumer's eye view of the world. The accepted advantages of speed, flexibility and economy, together with the rich data generated, make qualitative methods eminently suitable for student research at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. Of all the techniques available, the focus group is probably the most familiar, having provoked a wealth of comment from both commercial and academic researchers; as such, it offers a realistic starting-point for the study of qualitative research. Focus group interviews are a qualitative method in which a small sample of respondents discuss elected topics as a group for approximately one to two hours. A moderator focuses the discussion onto relevant subjects in a non-directive manner. The method is a development of the group discussion. This article presents a practical guide to the procedures for conducting focus groups. A full discussion of the theory, role, uses, advantages and disadvantages of qualitative research in general, and focus groups in particular, can be found in Drayto...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{autonomy}} underlies many other issues in {{moral and political}} philosophy. This dissertation states that contemporary debates within Shi’i thought view autonomy as individualistic, and that this individualism brings it into conflict with tradition. It then argues that autonomy is not equivalent to individualism, and argues for an understanding of autonomy that is socially and historically embed- ded and discursive. This {{makes it possible to}} rethink the relationship between autonomy and tradition. This rethinking is done through a method of reflective equilibrium, where various ideas from various fields are brought into a coherent whole. There are two phases to this rethinking. The first is in clarifying the concept of autonomy and the second is bringing this concept of autonomy and Shi’i tradition into equilibrium. The dissertation begins by stating that Shi’i thought has already made room for autonomy, but that the concept of autonomy that is dominant is individualistic. An understanding of autonomy as socially and historically embedded is defended. The second phase is to reconcile this embedded notion of autonomy with Shi’i tradition. It is argued that autonomy is important for both the internalisation of tradition and the formation of tradition. Empirical evidence is provided through positive psychology that shows that the most effective means of internalising a belief is through contexts that support autonomy. This understanding of internal- isation is brought into equilibrium with the Shi’i concept of forbidding wrong. It is argued that one of the conditions of forbidding wrong is the condition of efficacy. Approaches to forbidding wrong that support autonomy meet this condition, while those that deny autonomy generally do not. Finally, it is argued that autonomy should be considered within the process of ijtihād because it has an epistemic gain. Autonomous individuals gain a certain level of expertise through their life experiences that are necessary to be incorporated in the ijtiḥād.
