Despite the rainfall, no damage {{was reported in}} Alabama or Mississippi. In Mobile Bay in Alabama, one man died while attempting to secure his boat — the only direct fatality related to the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Isis first {{affected}} Baja California Sur on September 2 as {{a tropical}} storm. Shortly after making landfall, a {{weather reporting station}} at San José del Cabo recorded sustained winds of 26mph (42km/h), and gusts reaching up to 46mph (74km/h). A station on the Islas Marías also reported sustained winds of 54mph (87km/h). The winds left widespread areas without power or telephone. The storm produced heavy rainfall in the southern portion of the peninsula, including a 24‑hour total of 12.99inches (330mm) at Los Cabos and a <b>peak</b> <b>rainfall</b> total of 24.02inches (610mm) at Santiago. A married couple was killed after attempting to cross a flooded stream in Los Cabos. Initially, reports indicated a family was missing in La Paz, though they were later proven false. Flooding from the storm closed all roads {{to the north of}} Los Cabos and caused damage to the roads in the area. Mudslides from the rain buried at least 120cars in the area.|$|E
25|$|Tabubil has a {{tropical}} rainforest climate. The town is known unofficially {{as one of}} the wettest places on earth, with an average annual rainfall of 8 metres per annum, and a <b>peak</b> <b>rainfall</b> of 10 metres per annum. The unique weather conditions have caused much adaptation in the local jungle flora and fauna, causing Tabubil to be particularly interesting to the scientific community.|$|E
40|$|A {{meteorological}} data {{set of the}} downpour on July 15 th, 2012 was recorded by automatic meteorological observation equipment at Kyoto Prefecture University in a time interval of 5 minutes. This data shows three <b>peaks</b> of <b>rainfall.</b> The first and second <b>rainfall</b> <b>peaks</b> were accompanied with strong northward wind and cooling down of the air. At {{the time of the}} third <b>rainfall</b> <b>peak,</b> the strongest southward wind was observed, but cooling down of the air was not observed. After the rain stopped, a pressure down with a cooling down for a period of one hour followed by a calm was observed...|$|R

25|$|Time of Concentration is {{the time}} {{required}} for runoff from the most distant point of the upstream drainage area to reach {{the point of the}} drainage channel controlling flooding of the area of interest. The time of concentration defines the critical duration of <b>peak</b> <b>rainfall</b> for the area of interest. The critical duration of intense rainfall might be only a few minutes for roof and parking lot drainage structures, while cumulative rainfall over several days would be critical for river basins.|$|E
25|$|The Neuse River, Roanoke River, Waccamaw River, and New River {{exceeded}} 500-year flood levels, although {{damage was}} lower {{in these areas}} (compared to the Tar River) because of lower population densities. Because most of the Cape Fear River basin was west of the <b>peak</b> <b>rainfall</b> areas, the city of Wilmington was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall; however, the Northeast Cape Fear River (a tributary) did exceed 500-year flood levels. Of the state's eastern rivers, only the Lumber River escaped catastrophic flooding.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until about}} 1850 Sonoma Creek was {{unchanged}} from its natural state. Adverse erosion and bank cutting were at sustainable levels {{and did not}} add enough turbidity to the creek system to discourage aquatic species. Flooding in the downstream reaches did not realize the modern frequencies since all the creek reaches could absorb more excess water from <b>peak</b> <b>rainfall</b> events. The Kenwood area existed {{in the form of}} a large marsh effectively blocked by a natural earthen dam from penetrating the course of the creek as it flows west out of Kenwood toward Glen Ellen.|$|E

25|$|Later that week, a {{slow moving}} area of low {{pressure}} from the west of Biscay moved east across the British Isles. At the same time, an associated occluded front moved into Northern England, becoming very active as it did so with the <b>peak</b> <b>rainfall</b> on 15 June. Rainfall records were broken across the region, leading to localised flooding. As it weakened, the front moved north into Scotland on 16 June and left England and Wales with a very unstable airmass, frequent heavy showers, thunderstorms and cloudy conditions. This led to localised flash flooding and prevented significant drying where earlier rains had fallen.|$|E
500|$|For several days, Komen dropped heavy {{rainfall}} across the northern Bay of Bengal {{and onto the}} adjacent coastlines of northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and eastern India.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{graphical}} and mathematical representations of some important hydrological datasets (annual and monthly mean flow, flood hydrographs) available for Dragoia hydrometric station, situated {{in the south of}} the upper sector of Desnățui river basin, the biggest first order tributary of Danube river between Jiu river and Cerna river. The data entries were evaluated after the frequential hydrology principles, the temporal scenario revealed by the calcula being correlated to the geographical features of the river basin, especially the climatic regime and the particularities of flow. The results of this research proved useful for the watershed management, constituting a scientific way to demonstrate the scarce of the surface water resources in this area of Getic Plateau, along with the uncertainty which rises when we try to predict the flood effects during <b>peak</b> <b>rainfalls</b> or the etiage flow intervals...|$|R
