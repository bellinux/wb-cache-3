This study examines whether physical inactivity, and other wellness indicators, {{have an impact on}} the Human Development Index (HDI) of a county. The variables examined are <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the population <b>that</b> is physically inactive, <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the population <b>that</b> is obese, <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> population with access to exercise opportunities, number of fast food restaurants per 1000 population, <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> population <b>that</b> is African American, and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> population <b>that</b> is Hispanic. We find <b>that</b> the <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the population <b>that</b> is inactive and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the population <b>that</b> is obese both have a negative impact on the HDI of a county. The number of fast food restaurants per 1000 has a positive impact on the HDI of a county. None of the other variables used have a significant impact on HDI. Together, the three significant variables can explain about 43. 5 % of the variation in HDI. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R

5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E

However, the statements have been frequently misinterpreted in various media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a common misperception about the game's actual global audience.

In December 1936, for example, Nahum Goldmann visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Beck, but this demarche did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic affects of the ban on kosher slaughter (Shechita), the WJC Economic Department prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted. The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland.|$|E
