In case of redundant prolapse, the prolapsed mucosal membrane is lifted and sutured (with the last suture minimum 5 mm above the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line),</b> repositioning hemorrhoidal cushions in situ.This is different from a traditional hemorrhoidectomy, which focused on excising the hemorrhoidal bundle. In this procedure there is no tissue that is excised. Because the suture line is above the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line,</b> post-operative pain is minimized for patients.

Johannesburg, 2013 A thorough description and cladistic analysis of the Antetonitrus ingenipes type material sheds further light on the stepwise acquisition of sauropodan traits {{just prior to the}} Triassic/Jurassic boundary. Although the forelimb of Antetonitrus and other closely related sauropododomorph taxa retains the plesiomorphic morphology typical of a mobile grasping structure, the changes in the weight-bearing dynamics of both the musculature and the architecture of the hindlimb document the progressive shift towards a sauropodan form of graviportal locomotion. Nonetheless, the presence of hypertrophied muscle attachment sites in Antetonitrus suggests the retention of an intermediary form of facultative bipedality. The term Sauropodiformes is adopted here and given a novel definition intended to capture those transitional sauropodomorph taxa occupying a contiguous position on the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line</b> towards Sauropoda. The early record of sauropod diversification and evolution is re-examined in light of the paraphyletic consensus that has emerged regarding the ‘Prosauropoda’ in recent years...|$|E
40|$|A patient {{found to}} have ectopic Cushing's {{syndrome}} three months after surgical resection of cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal was studied with serial plasma cortisol and ACTH measurements. The effects of therapy on plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were noted. An autopsy was performed immediately after death and liver metastatic tumor tissue was assayed for "small " ACTH, "big " ACTHI, PTH, and alpha sub-unit of hCG. Clinical Cushing's syndrome was observed along with nonsuppressible plasma cortisol level. Plasma ACTH only reached the highest normal level but tumor ACTH ("small"), "big " ACTH, alpha sub-unit and PTH were markedly elevated. It was concluded that a case of classic cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal produced ectopic Cushing's syndrome. Elevated tumor alpha sub-unit and PTH were not associated with appreciable biologic activity. Ectopic Cushing's syndrome in this disease may imply poorer prognosis. A case of classic basaloid or cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal that developed below the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line,</b> {{found to be associated}} with clinical Cushing's syndrome, was studied and data supporting ectopic Cushing's syndrome are presented.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Intestinal {{neuronal}} dysplasia (IND) is {{a complex}} alteration of the enteric nervous system (ENS) that may involve rectum, colon, or the whole intestine. This disorder is a frequent cause of intestinal dysmotility and pseudo-obstruction in the first 3 years of life. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify possible associations and correlations of IND with other gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal anomalies. METHODS: From 1986 to 2000, 95 cases of IND type B without aganglionosis were diagnosed. Fifteen cases were diffuse IND, whereas the remaining 80 were rectocolonic neuronal dysplasia. The diagnosis was performed on rectal suction biopsy specimens taken 2 to 10 cm above the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line.</b> Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemical techniques were performed on serial cryostatic sections. We used Schärli and Meier-Ruge criteria (1981) for the diagnosis of IND until 1992, when we adopted Borchard et al criteria (1991). A retrospective analysis of the clinical data was performed to identify IND-associated anomalies. RESULTS: These anomalies included anorectal malformations (9 cases), intestinal malrotation (8), megacystis (5), congenital short small bowel (4), hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (3), necrotizing enterocolitis (2), mental retardation (2), short stature (2), facial dysmorphism (2), Down syndrome (1), intestinal atresia (1), diffuse intestinal angiomatosis (1), histiocytosis (1), microvillus agenesia (1), and hearing loss (1). Overall, 43 associated anomalies were found in 29 IND cases (30. 5...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We report our {{experience}} involving {{a case of}} relatively rare anorectal malignant melanoma with skipped lesion. Presentation of case: The patient was a 72 -year-old man who had visited a local clinic complaining of a mass in the anal region, whereupon he was referred to our hospital on suspicion of a malignant melanoma. Close examination revealed a 25 -mm black type 1 tumor one-third {{the size of the}} circumference of the anal canal and located externally to it. We performed transanal resection of the tumor and confirmed a diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Notably, multiple macular black lesions spaced away from the main lesion were observed during surgery in half of the circumference of the anal canal, from the tumor to the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line.</b> A biopsy of the area also revealed malignant melanoma; therefore, we performed abdominoperineal resection. Pathological diagnosis indicated a submucosal depth; the patient was thus diagnosed with T 4 N 2 c M 0 stage IIIb malignant melanoma and was followed on an outpatient basis. Discussion: Patients with anorectal malignant melanoma have very poor prognoses owing to early lymph node metastasis and hematogenous metastasis. Our case illustrates that small anorectal malignant melanoma lesions can spread from the main lesion and invade the mucosa; examinations may sometimes miss such skipped lesions. Conclusion: Skipped lesions can occur in anorectal melanomas; thus, careful scrutiny of such lesions is required. Moreover, lesion resection is critical for anorectal malignant melanomas...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{prognosis}} {{on treatment}} of the cancer of the rectum has not {{changed in the last}} fifty years. Survival rates of 50 % to 55 % seems immutable in several published series. The main cause for those results is the high incidence of re-currence, either local or widespread. Local recurrence {{is directly related to the}} number of undifferentiated cells and to the grade of wall invasion. Widespread recurrence depends specifically on the lymphatic and vascular spreading. So any kind of treatment that would diminish the number of undifferentiated cells and the size or the tumor wall penetration would certainly decrease the local recurrence rate, lengthening the interval free from cancer and, perhaps, modifying the long term survival rate. Between 1978 and 2009, a total of 538 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (from the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line</b> to 10 cm above) were treated by preoperative radiotherapy. Methodology: The same protocol was used in all the patients – 400 cGy, 200 cGy/day, during 4 consecutive weeks (anterior and posterior pelvic fields) by means of a Linear Megavoltage Accelerator (25 MeV). Surgery was performed 2 months after completion of the radio-therapy. Results: Statistical analysis of the whole group showed that preoperative radiotherapy does decrease frequency of undifferentiated cells. Moreover, the incidence of local recurrence diminished after irradiation by 3. 4 %. Preoperative radiotherapy reduces tumor volume (ERUS) and wall invasion, as well as the mortality rate due to local recurrence (2. 4 %) and alters long-term survival rate (80. 1 %). Conclusion: Preoperative radiotherapy is really effective in reducin...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The goal of {{a rubber}} band {{ligature}} is to promote fibrosis of the submucosa with subsequent fixation of the anal epithelium to the underlying sphincter. Following this principle, a new technique of ligature was developed based on two aspects: 1. macro banding: {{to have a better}} fibrosis and fixation by banding a bigger volume of mucosa and 2. higher ligature: to have this fixation at the origin of the hemorrhoidal cushion displacement. METHODS: 1634 patients with internal hemorrhoidal disease grade II or III were treated by the technique called high macro rubber band. There was no distinction as to age, gender or race. To perform this technique a new hemorrhoidal device was specially designed with a larger diameter and a bigger capacity for mucosal volume aspiration. It is recommended to utilize a longer and wider anoscope to obtain a better view of the anal canal, which will facilitate the injection of submucosa higher in the anal canal and the insertion of the rubber band device. The hemorrhoidal cushion must be banded higher in the anal canal (4 cm above the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line).</b> It is preferable to treat all the hemorrhoids in one single session (maximum of three areas banded). RESULTS: The analysis was retrospective without any comparison with conventional banding. The period of evaluation extended from one to twelve years. The analysis of the results showed perianal edema in 1. 6 % of the patients, immediate tenesmus in 0. 8 %, intense pain (need for parenteral analgesia) in 1. 6 %, urinary retention in 0. 1 % of the patients and a symptomatic recurrence rate of 4. 2 %. All patients with symptomatic recurrence were treated with a new session of macro rubber banding. None of the patients developed anal or rectal sepsis. Small post-ligature bleeding was observed only in 0. 8 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The high macro rubber banding technique represents an alternative method for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease grades II or III, with good results at a low cost. The analysis of the observed results showed a small incidence of minor complications, with a high index of symptomatic relief...|$|E
40|$|Surgery for anal fistula {{is often}} {{associated}} with continence disorders due to the transection of sphincter muscles. Extensive knowledge of anal canal anatomy and anal fistula can help prevent this outcome. Objective:Correlate the anatomical conformation of the anal canal, fistula track and the internal opening according to gender and hemicircumference (anterior vs. posterior) using 3 -D ultrasonography. Methods: 165 patients with fistula were evaluated with 3 -D ultrasound and grouped according to gender, fistula type, internal opening and track position. Fistulae were transsphincteric in 128 and intersphincteric in 37 subjects. The study measured the external and internal anal sphincter, the puborectalis, the distance from the internal opening to the distal edge of the external and internal sphincter, the length of the internal and external sphincter compromised by the track and the percentage of compromised muscle. Results:Muscles were longer in males. The distance from the internal opening to the internal sphincter was greater for the posterior hemicircumference. The point where the fistulous track crossed the anterior external sphincter was similar for the two genders but the compromised muscle percentage was greater in females. The point where the fistulous track crossed the internal sphincter was similar for the two genders but the percentage of compromised internal sphincter was greater in males for the posterior hemicircumference. The study was limited by the absence of testing for interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Conclusion:The anal canal muscles are longer in males and the <b>pectinate</b> <b>line</b> is asymmetrical. In females, the percentage of compromised external sphincter was greater in the anterior hemicircumference due to the shorter external sphincter, while in males the percentage of compromised internal sphincter was greater in the posterior hemicircumferenceA cirurgia para fÃstula anal Ã muitas vezes associada a distÃrbios de continÃncia, devido Ã transecÃÃo do esfÃncter. Amplo conhecimento da anatomia do canal anal e fÃstula anal podem ajudar a evitar esse resultado. O objetivo deste estudo foi correlacionar a conformaÃÃo anatÃmica do canal anal, trajeto fistuloso e o orifÃcio interno de acordo com sexo e hemicircumferÃncia (anterior versus posterior), utilizando ultrassonografia 3 D. MÃtodo: 165 pacientes com fÃstula foram avaliados com ultra-som 3 -D e agrupados de acordo com gÃnero, tipo de fÃstula, orifÃcio interno e trajeto fistuloso. FÃstulas foram transesfinctÃricas em 128 e interesfinctÃrica em 37 pacientes. O estudo mediu o esfÃncter anal externo e interno, o puborretal, a distÃncia a partir do orifÃcio interno para a borda distal do esfÃncter externo e interno, o comprimento do esfÃncter interno e externo comprometido pelo trajeto e a percentagem de massa muscular comprometida. Resultados: mÃsculos no sexo masculino apresentaram-se mais longos. A distÃncia a partir do orifÃcio interno para o esfÃncter interno foi maior para a hemicircunferÃncia posterior. O ponto onde o trajeto fistuloso cruzou o esfÃncter externo anterior foi semelhante para os dois sexos, mas a porcentagem de mÃsculo comprometido foi maior no sexo feminino.
