40|$|Abstract This paper models an {{original}} approach where the monopolist firm no longer uses <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> with weights 1 : 1. The {{decisions of the}} firm {{take place in a}} two-step optimisation process. In the first stage, using port-folio optimisation it decides whether to bundle and also sets the optimal weight for each good. In the second stage, it sets the profit maximising bundle price {{on the basis of the}} chosen weights. We compare the profit, consumer and welfare implications of our <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> model to the usual 1 : 1 <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> model, and comment on the competition policy making implications...|$|E
50|$|Price {{bundling}} (also {{known as}} product bundling occurs where {{two or more}} products or services are priced as a package with a single price. There are several types of bundles: <b>pure</b> <b>bundles</b> where the goods can only be purchased as package or mixed bundles where the goods can be purchased individually or as a package. The prices of the bundle is typically less than when the two items are purchased separately.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{economic}} implications of <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> under the settings of monopoly and duopoly. We show that under monopoly and <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> of goods with independent demands, the bundled price is strictly {{less than the}} sum of the unbundled prices. In the setting of duopoly and Nash prices, we examine whether bundling {{can be used as a}} tool to deter entry. In contrast to the findings of previous studies, we show that with low entry costs, entry is deterred by unbundled as opposed to bundled sales. With high entry costs, however, the incumbent chooses to bundle. <b>Pure</b> <b>Bundling,</b> Monopoly, Duopoly, Entry Costs,...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I show numerically that a {{multi-product}} firm compet-ing against single-product {{firms will}} use linear pricing or <b>pure</b> <b>bundling.</b> Contrasted to the bundling strategy of monopolist, mixed bundling {{is dominated by}} either linear pricing or <b>pure</b> <b>bundling.</b> The complementar-ity or integrability between the products supplied by the multi-product firm cannot change this result. Even though the multi-product firm is better off from the enhanced product complementarity, mixed bundling will not be utilized as an optimal pricing strategy. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a problem at}} the interface of auctions and bundling. Our revenue-maximizing seller seeking to auction one unit each of two complements or substitutes in the best-of-three formats: the auction of the bundle, separate auctions of the individual items, and a combinatorial auction. We draw on an analytical model to address the following questions: (i) Which of the auctioning strategies is optimal under the second-price, sealed-bid format? (ii) What is the optimal strategy for the bidders? (iii) When the objects are asymmetrically valued (e. g., Super Bowl ticket versus souvenir), what is the optimal auctioning sequence under the pure components strategy? Our results suggest that separate auctions of the two objects are superior to the auction of the bundle for most substitutes and even moderate complements when {{there are at least}} four bidders. The auction of the <b>pure</b> <b>bundle</b> is better suited for strong complements or with too few bidders. When the combinatorial auction is an available option, it weakly dominates the auction of the <b>pure</b> <b>bundle</b> but has domains of inferiority relative to the separate auctions. When the objects are asymmetric in value, it is optimal to auction the higher-valued object first. auctions, bidding, bundling, game theory, price discrimination, pricing...|$|R

Customers can buy cellular phones at a discount price if they subscribe to a service plan with the price above a threshold. We have proposed using nonlinear mixed-integer programming to determine the optimal price to maximize the total profit of the service providers. An efficient algorithm has been presented {{to solve this problem}} when discrete demand data is available. We have compared the profits from three strategies: individual sale, mixed <b>bundle</b> and <b>pure</b> <b>bundle.</b> Our analysis suggests the condition under which the mixed bundle strategy outperforms other strategies. We have also studied the impact of parameters on the solution. The results of the analysis may help the service providers adjust their pricing schemes according to changes in the market.

40|$|We study {{bundling}} by {{a dominant}} multi-product firm facing competition from a rival multi-product firm. Compared to competition under independent pricing, competition under <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> reduces (increases) each firm's profit for low (high) levels of dominance, while for intermediate levels of dominance, {{it increases the}} dominant firm's profit but reduces the rival's profit.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{comparative}} results for alternative pricing strategies, the distribution of buyers ' reservation prices in the Adams-Yellen framework {{is assumed to be}} bivariate normal. <b>Pure</b> <b>bundling</b> then operates by reducing effective buyer diversity, thus facilitating capture of consumers ' surplus. It apparently always makes buyers worse off than unbundled sales; it is more profitable if average reservation prices are high enough. Mixed bundling combines advantages of both <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> and unbundled sales, and it is apparently generally more profitable than either. Bundling policies, which treat both goods symmetrically, seem most attractive under symmetric reservation price distributions...|$|E

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{traditional}} literature on bundling and the burgeoning literature on two-sided markets by presenting a theoretical monopoly model of mixed bundling {{in the context}} of the portable video game console market [...] a prototypical two-sided market. It is shown that the monopoly platform 2 ̆ 7 s dominant strategy is to offer a mixed <b>bundle</b> rather than <b>pure</b> <b>bundle</b> or no bundle. Deviating from both traditional bundling literature and standard two-sided markets literature, we …find that, under mixed bundling, both the standalone console price on the consumer side and the royalty fee on the game developer side are lower than their counter- parts under independent pricing equilibrium. In our setting, mixed bundling acts as a price discrimination tool segmenting the market more efficiently as well as functions as a coordination device helping solve 2 ̆ 2 the chicken or the egg 2 ̆ 2 problem in two-sided markets. After theoretically evaluating the impact mixed bundling has on prices and welfare, we further test the model predictions with new data from the portable video game console market in the early to middle 2000 s, during which Nintendo was a monopolist. We employ a reduced-form approach similar to Jin and Rysman (2009), and …find empirical support for all theoretical predictions...|$|R

This class contains efficient auctions, <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> auctions, mixed bundling auctions, auctions with reserve prices and auctions with prepackaged bundles.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} bundling by a firm that sells in two national markets and faces entry by parallel traders. The firm can bundle its main product, - a tradable good- with a non-traded service. It chooses between the strategies of <b>pure</b> <b>bundling,</b> mixed bundling and no bundling. The paper shows that in the low-price country the threat of grey trade elicits a move from mixed bundling, or no bundling, towards <b>pure</b> <b>bundling.</b> It encourages a move from <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> towards mixes bundling or no bundling in the high-price country. The set of parameter values for which the profit maximizing strategy is not to supply the low price country is smaller than {{in the absence of}} bundling. The welfare effects of deterrence of grey trade are not those found in conventional models of price arbitrage. Some consumers in the low-price country may gain from the threat of entry by parallel traders although they pay a higher price. This {{is due to the fact}} that the firm responds to the threat of arbitrageurs by increasing the amount of services it puts in the bundle targeted at consumers in that country. Similarly, the threat of parallel trade may affect some consumers in the hight-price country adversely. rallel trade, bundling, arbitrage...|$|E

40|$|Bundling under {{monopoly}} {{tends to}} increase demand and market efficiency, but likely {{at the expense}} of transferring consumers' surplus to firms. Public utilities can use this increase in demand to reduce the monthly fee per consumer. To demonstrate it, I conduct a numerical analysis of the effects of bundling under breakeven price regulation for the Japan Broadcasting Corporation. I estimate the willingness-to-pay for broadcasting services and simulate consumer choices under <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> and a-la-carte pricing with breakeven price regulation. Comparing <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> and a-la-carte pricing of terrestrial television and satellite television, the increase in demand caused by bundling is very slight due to the strong positive correlation of WTPs.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} firms' {{choice between}} a merger and a strategic alliance in bundling their product with other complementary product. We consider a {{framework in which}} firms can improve profits only from product bundling. While mixed bundling is not profitable, <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> is because <b>pure</b> <b>bundling</b> reduces consumers' choices, and thus, softens competition among firms. Firms benefit the most from this reduced competition if they form an alliance. Firms do not gain as much from a merger because, internalizing the complementarity between the two products, a merged firm is inclined to pursue aggressive pricing to gain market share. Yet, firms may be motivated to choose a merger over an alliance because of foreclosure possibility as foreclosure is not possible under strategic alliance. However, in response, unmerged rivals can use a strategic alliance to avert foreclosure. Hence, the possibility of counter-bundling via strategic alliance by rivals reduces the incentives for merger. In equilibrium, bundling is offered only through strategic alliances. ...|$|E
