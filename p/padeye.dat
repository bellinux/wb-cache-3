40|$|The {{objective}} of the master thesis {{is to use the}} failure envelope approach to determine the ultimate capacities of a suction anchor, and to establish a strain-hardening elasto-plastic model in terms of loads and displacements at <b>padeye.</b> Numerical analysis in Plaxis 3 D has been executed for the suction anchor, which has formed a capacity surface in terms of combined loading at the <b>padeye.</b> General loading at <b>padeye</b> will result in six force components, which can be expressed by three independent variables due to constrained loading conditions. Empirical yield surfaces, that take all six force components into account, have been curve-fitted to the Plaxis results. The yield surfaces have been used together with load-displacement relations to establish an elasto-plastic formulation with respect to loads and displacements in terms of the <b>padeye.</b> The results were further generalized, and can be used to estimate the response of other suction anchors. The elasto-plasticity has been implemented by isotropic hardening, governed by a curve-fitting hyperbola. The formulation was implemented in Excel as a spreadsheet that provided accurate results for most load combinations. The sheadsheet is applicable for both tensile and compression forces, and laod histories for up to 10 steps can be applied. Each load step in the spreadsheet was divided into 100 load increments. The spreadsheet was made in a general way, where the input parameters were the ultimate force components, the eccentricities to the neutral planes, the elastic stiffness coefficients and empirical curve-fitting coefficients with respect to both the yield surface and the hardening law. Mesh refinements and hand calculations have been applied. Comparisons show that most load cases have an adequate convergence; however the torsional capacity was overestimated with about 50 %. Analysis without an activated <b>padeye</b> showed that the overestimation was caused by the flow around mechanism close to the <b>padeye.</b> The author will recommened to model the anchor without a <b>padeye</b> for later studies, and rather apply a set of force vectors that give the same load. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a {{numerical}} study on the behaviour of caisson foundations subjected to various combinations of loading are presented. A typical caisson has been used in this study with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2. The caisson is assumed to be embedded in a homogeneous soil deforming under undrained conditions. The performance of the caisson under separate axial, lateral and torsional forces was investigated first, followed by the interaction of these forces with each other. The ultimate capacity of the caisson under combined loading is presented in the form of failure envelope in the axial-torsional loading plane and axial-lateral, and lateral-torsional loading surfaces along the skirt of the foundation. It is shown that, although lateral capacity of the caisson is dependent on the location of the <b>padeye,</b> a unique normalised failure surface can be used to represent the capacity of the caisson under all combinations of axial, lateral and torsional loads regardless of the location of the <b>padeye.</b> KEY WORDS: Caisson foundations; undrained soils; failure envelope, finite element analysis...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the potential of}} plate anchors as an anchoring option for offshore renewable energy devices such as wave energy converters and floating offshore wind turbines. In this study {{the performance of a}} plate anchor vertically installed in sand and subjected to vertical loading has been investigated experimentally. Particular focus was placed on the unrecoverable loss of embedment during the keying process, where the orientation of the plate evolves from vertical to perpendicular to the direction of loading. This is particularly significant for offshore plate anchors as an unrecoverable loss in anchor embedment corresponds with a loss in potential anchor capacity. The loss in embedment during keying was examined for six anchors, all with the same plate geometry, but with anchor padeyes (or load attachment points) that were at differing eccentricities from the plate. The experiments were conducted at model scale using the geotechnical centrifuge at the Institute of Technology Sligo. To facilitate observation of the anchor orientation and quantification of the loss in embedment during the test, anchor tests were conducted adjacent to a Perspex panel on the centrifuge strongbox. Vertical loading was achieved by pulling a mooring line attached to the anchor <b>padeye</b> at a constant velocity. The location and orientation of the anchor during each anchor test was captured using a high resolution digital camera mounted {{directly in front of the}} Perspex panel. The experimental data show that the loss in embedment of the plate anchor during keying is inversely proportional to the <b>padeye</b> eccentricity, with a <b>padeye</b> eccentricity equal to at least the breadth of the anchor plate giving minimal loss in embedment and hence highest potential anchor capacity. The magnitude of the loss in embedment is very similar to previous findings for clay. The peak anchor capacity was observed before the end of keying, at a plate orientation between 50 and 80 degrees to the horizontal. Particle image velocimetry was employed to reveal the failure mechanisms during the keying process. These analyses showed that the peak load corresponds with a sudden transition from a deep localised failure mechanism to a shallow mechanism that extends to the soil surface. The anchor capacity, expressed in terms of a dimensionless capacity factor, was shown to be in good agreement with previously reported experimental data on pipelines and strip anchors, but only after the peak anchor capacity is exceeded and the anchor behaves like a horizontally oriented anchor subjected to vertical loading. The particle image velocimetry analyses show that the inclination of the slip planes in the shallow failure mechanism are at an angle that is much lower than would be reasonable for a mobilised friction angle. This clearly shows that the normality condition, in which the dilation angle and the friction angle are equal, was not met in these tests and explains why the experimental data are in good agreement with predictions from a limit equilibrium method based on similar principles...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket or dart shaped anchor that comprises a removable central shaft {{and a set}} of four flukes. Similar to other dynamically installed anchors, the DEPLA penetrates to a target depth in soft seabed sediments by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall in water and the self-weight of the anchor. In this paper DEPLA performance was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests conducted at 200 times earth?s gravity. The results show that the DEPLA exhibits similar behaviour to other dynamically installed anchors during installation, with tip embedments of 1. 6 – 2. 8 times the anchor length. After anchor installation the central shaft of the DEPLA, termed a follower, is retrieved and reused for the next installation, leaving the DEPLA flukes vertically embedded in the soil. The load–displacement response during follower retrieval is of interest, with mobilisation of frictional and bearing resistance occurring at different rates. The load required to extract the DEPLA follower is typically less than three times its dry weight. The vertically embedded DEPLA flukes constitute the load bearing element as a circular or square plate. The keying and pullout response of this anchor plate is similar to other vertically embedded plate anchors, with an initial stiff response as the anchor begins to rotate, followed by a softer response as the rotation angle increases, and a final stiff response as the effective eccentricity of the <b>padeye</b> reduces and anchor capacity is fully mobilised. For the <b>padeye</b> eccentricity ratios considered (0. 38 – 0. 63 times the plate breadth or diameter), the loss in plate anchor embedment is between 0. 50 and 0. 66 times the corresponding plate breadth or diameter. Finally, the bearing capacity factors determined experimentally are typically in the range 14. 2 – 15. 8 and are higher than numerical solutions for flat circular and square plates. This is considered to be due to the cruciform fluke arrangement which ensures that the failure surface extends {{to the edge of the}} orthogonal flukes and mobilises more soil in the failure mechanism...|$|E

This paper presents and considers field data on the embedment depth loss due to the plate anchor keying process and the subsequent bearing capacity factor of the plate anchor element. The loss in plate anchor embedment {{was significantly higher than}} that reported from corresponding centrifuge tests and is reflected in the larger <b>padeye</b> displacements required to mobilize peak capacity in the field tests. Measured plate capacities and plate rotations during keying indicate that the end of keying coincides with the peak anchor capacity. Experimental bearing capacity factors are in the range Nc = 14. 3 – 14. 6, which is appreciably higher than existing solutions for vanishingly thin circular plates. The higher Nc for the DEPLA is considered to be due to a combination of the cruciform fluke arrangement and the fluke (or plate) thickness...|$|E
40|$|Floating Production Storage Offloading vessels (FPSOs) {{are widely}} used in {{offshore}} {{oil and gas industry}} in harsh environments reach at the Grand Banks. Vessels working at an offshore site must be held in position despite the effects of wind, waves, and current. Many FPSOs are keeping position using seafloor anchors which are commonly secured using anchor piles. Anchor piles are very effective in many soils. The pile can either be drilled in and grouted, using an offshore mobile drilling rig, or driven in with an underwater hammer or a follower. The anchor pile resists pullout by a combination of bending plus passive resistance and skin friction shear. [...] Correctly designed pile anchors should transfer the environmental loads on the floating platforms to the seabed safely. In-service, these anchor piles are subjected {{to a wide range of}} monotonic and cyclic lateral to oblique pull forces. The large cyclic forces applied during extreme storm will tend to govern the design. [...] The presented work aims at identifying the behavior and capacity of anchor piles used for anchoring offshore floating structures in dense sand. As full-scale experimental verification is not always possible, this raises up the need to design a physical model which can simulate the behavior of the full-scale case. To simulate the important gravitational component, the physical model tests were conducted using the geotechnical centrifuge to investigate the anchor piles response to mooring forces in saturated dense sand. Two centrifuge tests setup were carried out. In each test setup four model pipe piles were jacked in flight in homogeneous saturated sand and subjected to monotonic and cyclic pull-out forces with inclination angle 0 ° (pure lateral loading), 16 °, 30 °, and 90 ° (pure tension loading) with the horizontal. The soil pile interaction behavior was monitored through the strain gauges attached on the pile. While the undisturbed soil stiffness distribution with depth will be measured using a shear wave measurement system of bender elements which can provide soil shear modulus distribution with depth. [...] To study many factors that are affecting the model, a 3 -D finite element model (FEM) was validated from the experimental centrifuge results. The validated FEM was used to do a parametric study to get design procedures and provide better understanding of the response of anchor piles to a variety of loading conditions. The parameters that will affect the pile behavior as suggested from the previous researchers and will be studied here are pile diameter, pile flexibility, load inclination angle, and <b>padeye</b> depth on the pile. [...] From the present study, it was found that there is a significant interaction between lateral and tension loading. A design method was proposed to predict the ultimate capacity of offshore anchor pile depending on pile flexibility, loading angle and <b>padeye</b> depth.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{oil and gas}} mining has moved into {{increasingly}} deeper water in search of undeveloped fields. As water depths approach and exceed 3000 m conventional offshore foundation systems become inefficient and ineffective in stabilising platforms and floating production storage units. The trend of supporting structure design in deep water has been to install catenary and taut leg mooring systems. Consequently, many types of anchoring systems are being developed and used in order to withstand large mooring forces. The SEPLA (Suction Embedded Plate Anchor) is ideal for use in this situation. This project has employed advanced numerical techniques and centrifuge testing to study pullout behaviour of plate anchor foundations in different soil profiles and suction caisson installation effect {{with the aim of}} generating a robust framework for design. The behaviour of strip and circular plate anchors during vertical pullout in uniform and normally consolidated clays has been studied by means of small strain and large deformation finite element analyses. Both fully bonded (attached), and ‘vented’ (no suction on rear face), anchors have been considered. The current numerical results were compared with existing laboratory test data, finite element results and analytical solutions. This study showed that the ultimate pullout capacity factors (Nc) for deep embedment were 11. 6 and 11. 7 for smooth and rough strip anchors and 13. 1 and 13. 7 for smooth and rough circular anchors respectively. When the anchor base was vented, the soil stayed attached to the anchor base for deep embedment, and the pullout capacity was therefore the same as for the attached anchor. The separation depth ratio, Hs/B or Hs/D was found to increase linearly with the normalised strength ratio, su/γ'B or su/γ'D. Numerical simulation has been conducted to assess the bearing capacity for inclined pullout plate anchors. This bearing capacity analysis was performed by embedding the anchors in clay with different initial inclinations and different embedment ratios. Both the attached anchor base and vented base were evaluated. The results showed that the bearing capacities of the inclined plate anchors were associated with the inclination angles and base conditions. The separation depth of the plate anchors can be assessed by a simple equation from vertically pulled out plate anchors. Large deformation finite element analyses of plate anchor keying in clay has been performed. The effects of anchor thickness, anchor <b>padeye</b> eccentricity, anchor-soil interface roughness, soil shear strength, anchor submerged weight and soil disturbance have been studied with anchors in uniform or normally consolidated clays. The numerical results were compared with transparent soil test and existing centrifuge test data. The study showed that the RITSS method works well in simulating the anchor keying process. Anchor <b>padeye</b> eccentricity {{played an important role in}} anchor keying. A normalised anchor geometry ratio was used to estimate the loss in embedment during plate anchor’s keying. Both finite element analysis and centrifuge tests have been conducted to study the suction caisson installation effect. In finite element analysis, the soil disturbed zone varied from 3 times the caisson wall thickness to a full area inside a caisson. Centrifuge tests of suction embedded plate anchors were conducted in normally consolidated kaolin clay and transparent uniform soil. It can be concluded that the reduction in anchor capacity due to soil disturbance after suction caisson installation depends on re-consolidation time and soil sensitivity. The soil disturbance also reduced the loss of embedment during the anchor keying process...|$|E
40|$|Suction Embedded Plate Anchors (SEPLA) are {{vertically}} loaded anchors {{which are}} installed {{by using a}} suction caisson to the required embedment depth. The cost effectiveness, ease of installation and {{the accuracy of the}} installation makes it an attractive choice for deep to ultra-deep waters. After installation, SEPLAs are tensioned by mooring lines which will cause the anchor to move from its initial vertical orientation to its final orientation perpendicular to the loading direction. The keying process results in the loss of embedment which reduces the holding capacity of the plate anchors. A plasticity model was created to predict the keying trajectory, tension capacity and the embedment loss for a plate anchor. The soil is assumed to be normally consolidated undrained clay that obeys associated flow rule. The interaction of the anchor with the surrounding soil, interaction of the anchor chain and the interaction of the anchor chain with the soil is also considered in the model to predict the keying trajectory of the anchor. The results obtained from the model are compared to existing centrifuge tests and finite element models. The model was found to have very good agreement with the finite element data and it had reasonable agreement with the centrifuge test results.

40|$|Drag {{embedment}} anchors (DEA) {{are widely}} used for the temporary, {{and to a lesser}} extent the permanent mooring of offshore structures. While they can provide an effective mooring solution, the most commonly used design method, the empirical design charts, leave a high level of uncertainty in prediction of the capacity and trajectory of installed anchors. While this is partially alleviated through the standard of proof loading installed anchors, improved models are needed to help predict the complete capacity and trajectory of the anchors. The presence of layered soils presents an especially complex challenge, which is beyond the scope of most current models. Instead, designers must rely on past experience in the region and designer judgment to estimate if the anchor will be able to penetrate through these challenging soils. Plastic limit analysis (PLA) allow the incorporation of analytical solutions and geotechnical principles into the design of DEA. In PLA models, the behavior of the anchor is governed by a yield locus, which combined with an incremental kinematic model it can be used to estimate the capacity and movement of the anchor as it advanced through the soil. The model proposed here is a simplified PLA that assumes a steady state condition as the anchor is embedded. In this state, the anchor load angle or <b>padeye</b> angle is assumed to align with the anchors fluke-shank angle resulting in a condition of zero moment and simplified rotational behavior. The model is then compared to a series of existing design charts, and results from full-scale field installations. To address the issue of layered soils the framework of the model is then expanded to allow for the inclusion of stiff layers of clays. The stiff layers are analyzed through the use of area transformations and multipliers equivalent to the area of the anchor embedded into the layer. As no non-proprietary data is available to validate the model at this time, the model is then simulated through a number complex configurations to see how it captures known behavior...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the applications of plastic limit analysis to offshore foundations and anchors, including the drag embedment anchors (DEAs) for mobile offshore drilling units (MODU?s) and spudcan foundations for jack-up platforms. In deep waters, drag embedment anchors are an attractive option for mooring of semisubmersible platforms due to low installation cost and high holding capacity; {{on the other}} hand, jack-up platforms are more stable than semisubmersible platforms but only can be placed in shallow waters. The analyses of anchor capacities are developed for an idealized anchor comprising a rectangular fluke, a cylindrical shank, and a metal chain connected to the shank at the <b>padeye.</b> The anchor trajectory prediction during drag embedment is also developed by considering anchor behavior {{in conjunction with the}} mechanics of the anchor line. The results of simulations show that anchors approach at equilibrium condition rapidly during the embedment and both the normalized holding capacity and the anchor line uplift angle remain constants in this stage. Besides the geometry of the fluke, the properties of the shank and soil are also crucial factors in the anchor-soil interaction behavior. Partial failure of mooring systems for floating structures will subject drag anchors to loads having an appreciable component outside of the intended plane of loading. Partial failure of mooring systems during hurricanes in recent years have generated an interest in understanding drag anchor performance under these conditions. The analysis {{presents the}} simulations of three dimensional trajectories of an anchor system subjected to an out-of-plane load component. For the conditions simulated in the example analyses, the anchor experienced a modest amount of continued embedment following partial failure of the mooring system; however, the ultimate embedment and capacity of the anchor is much less than what would have developed if the anchor had continued in its original trajectory within the plane of intended loading. The analyses of the spudcan foundation of jack-up units include preloading, bearing capacity, and the displacement assessment. When the contribution of the soil moment resistance is considered, a three-stage assessment procedure is recommended: superposing environmental forces on the plot of yield surface, determining the value of yield function corresponding to the external forces, and computing the factor of safety of the spudcan. The results of the assessment may be ambiguous while the different yield functions are employed to analyze the spudcan in soft clay...|$|E

Global and local analysis covers the ultimate limit state and is carried out in accordance with prevailing design rules and standards. The global analyses are performed by using the Sesam software package and local analysis are performed by a combination of finite element analysis, analytical stress analysis and code checks. The lifting operation is defined as a heavy lift operation. Data from the Saipem S 7000 semi-submergible crane vessel is used for defining load input for lifting and transportation of the M 32 module. In this study the lifting arrangement is defined as a single crane lift with 3 loose spreader bars. The first global analysis showed failure of columns connected to the lifting points. To maintain the structural integrity of the module during lifting, these columns were reinforced by adding reinforcement plates to the failing structural elements. After that the reinforcements for the lifting operation are made the transportation condition is the governing condition for the global analysis of the M 32 module, however it does not have a significant effect on the analysis result for the transportation condition, if the padeyes are top or bottom mounted. Analysis of the padeyes was performed as an analytical stress and showed that the <b>padeye</b> design has the sufficient strength to carry the lifting load. The joints in the module are analyzed and found to have the required strength to withstand all forces during lifting and transport of the module. Based on the analysis and considerations performed in this report, I consider it possible to perform the lift of the M 32 module with a lifting arrangement situated at the top of the module. I consider all collected data and sources used in this thesis accurate and reliable. If errors of any kind occur I can assure that this is not of my intention as my aim is to present the results as accurate and realistic as possible. If however any inaccuracies have occurred it is my hope that these are minor and do not effect the final conclusion of this thesis...|$|E
