40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An instrument for high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) has been assembled with equipment designed for high performance liquid chromatography separations. The pump was a syringe-type giving uniform <b>pulseless</b> <b>flow</b> from 0. 05 to 6. 0 cm 3 min- 1 at pressures up to 3000 p. s. i [...] Low dead-volume septum and septumless injection heads {{have been used for}} single columns and multiple column sets. Two ultraviolet detectors and a refractometer having low cell volumes were used to detect the low weights of solute which were separated. Narrow distribution silica gels of varying particle size and porosity, as supplied by A. E. R. E. Harwell, have been packed into columns. Efficiencies of permeating and non-permeating polystyrenes determined with this HPGPC instrument gave an assessment of chromatogram broadening due to mass transfer as a function of eluent flow rate and polystyrene molecular weight. The results show that fast separations can be obtained in several minutes and that the most precise measurements of polydispersity are accomplished at very slow rates. A further assessment of chromatogram broadening was made by deactivating the surface of the silica particles with a hydrophilic bonded phase and examining the column efficiency and polydispersity of proteins in aqueous buffer. Results show that even after surface modification the composition of the aqueous eluent used must be adjusted, e. g. by careful selection of pH and ionic strength, to minimize interactions. When interactions occur, they can be explained in terms of a thermodynamic representation of a mixed mechanism. A comparison of retention data for proteins, which do not participate in interaction effects with the stationary phase, dextrans, which are considered as "non-ionic" macromolecules, and polystyrenes suggest that solute diameter is a reasonable universal size parameter for the representation of macromolecules separating by a steric exclusion mechanism operating close to equilibrium conditions...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The pulsatile {{blood flow}} in the {{internal}} spermatic artery of the ram is changed by the arterial coils in the spermatic cord so that the testis receives a relatively <b>pulseless</b> blood <b>flow</b> at a lower mean pressure. The major pulse-pressure reduction occurs in the proximal one-third of the coiled length of the artery; in the distal two-thirds, {{the character of the}} coiling and structure of the artery change. These observations are discussed particularly in relation to the thermo-regulatory function pre¬ viously suggested for the internal spermatic artery...|$|R
40|$|An implantable left {{ventricular}} assist device (LVAD) {{interacts with the}} recipient’s organism on the anatomical, cellular and biochemical levels. Mechanical circulatory support is currently facing the important challenges of LVAD-associated hemolysis due to continuous contact of the patient’s blood with the foreign surfaces of the LVAD, changes in the arterial wall due {{to the influence of}} the <b>pulseless</b> continuous <b>flow</b> of an LVAD, and aortic valve pathology in LVAD recipients and its treatment. Three independent studies were performed to explore these problems. 66 LVAD and BVAD (biventricular assist device) recipients were included. Pre- and postoperative laboratory parameters, clinical outcomes and tissue speciments were retrospectively analyzed. No significant differences were observed in hemolysis parameters after 2 and 5 weeks or after 3 and 6 months of support between LVAD and BVAD recipients {{with the exception of the}} haptoglobin level, which was significantly lower in the BVAD group after 3 months of support (p< 0. 05). The histological analysis revealed no differences in arterial wall changes of the end organs between patients with pulsatile and nonpulsatile assist devices. Simultaneous aortic valve replacement in hemodynamically instable patients was followed by a significantly higher incidence of right ventricular failure with the need for mechanical right ventricular support in 43 % (p= 0. 09), longer intensive care unit stay (p= 0. 025) and a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate (p= 0. 038) than in LVAD recipients without simultaneous aortic valve procedure. Modern implantable centrifugal blood pumps can be a good alternative to other extracorporeal assist devices or the Total Artificial Heart. The use of two pumps as a BVAD does not lead to greater blood cell damage. The levels of free hemoglobin and LDH could be used as reference parameters for patient follow-up and VAD-function checks. Continuous blood flow does not seem to significantly influence the changes in the arterial wall of LVAD recipients. An individual treatment strategy for LVAD candidates with aortic valve pathology should be determined according to the hemodynamic condition of the patient at the time of the LVAD implantation. A quicker surgical technique should be used in hemodynamically instable patients in order to prevent right ventricular failure and ensure better outcomes...|$|R
