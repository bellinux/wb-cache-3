5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel {{with the use of}} daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of the}} 1850s, were <b>produced</b> <b>on</b> salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E
60|$|The {{published}} reports do not <b>produce</b> <b>on</b> me any such impression.

It is unnecessary to wax eloquent on this head; and the curious can consult the writings of Dr. Hodgson for themselves. Meanwhile we have only to notice that an American 'possessed' woman <b>produces</b> <b>on</b> a highly educated and sceptical modern intelligence the same impression as the Zulu 'possessed' <b>produce</b> <b>on</b> some Zulu intelligences.|$|R

5|$|Another {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which {{is distinct from}} C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) <b>produced</b> <b>on</b> the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has noted a general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E

5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930.

It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E

5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen <b>produced</b> <b>on</b> Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period, the Book of the Dead {{started to}} appear in hieratic script, {{as well as in}} the {{traditional}} hieroglyphics.

5|$|In {{the early}} Eastern Han, Emperor Ming passed laws which {{prohibited}} {{those involved in}} agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade.
