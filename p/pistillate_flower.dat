25|$|Ragweeds are monoecious, most {{producing}} inflorescences {{that contain}} both staminate and pistillate flowers. Inflorescences {{are often in}} the form of a spike or raceme made up mostly of staminate flowers with some pistillate clusters around the base. Staminate flower heads have stamens surrounded by whitish or purplish florets. <b>Pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> heads have fruit-yielding ovules surrounded by many phyllaries and fewer, smaller florets. The pistillate flowers are wind pollinated, and the fruits develop. They are burs, sometimes adorned with knobs, wings, or spines.|$|E
50|$|All female (<b>Pistillate)</b> <b>flower</b> heads contain {{only one}} flower, while all male (staminate) heads may contain 5-15 flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Stamens: Ten, five {{long and}} five short, free, included; {{filaments}} thread-like; anthers orange colored, in the <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> small and sterile.|$|E
30|$|Monoecy {{has arisen}} twice in Oryzeae (Fig.  3). Zizaniopsis has staminate and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> in {{separate}} inflorescences {{on the same}} plant, a characteristic that also appears in seven of the nine species of Luziola (including Hydrochloa). In the other two species of Luziola (L. caespitosa and L. brasiliensis), staminate and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> {{are in the same}} inflorescence, with the staminate ones distal to the pistillate. Zizania also has staminate and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> in the same inflorescence, but is somewhat peculiar among monoecious species in that the <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> are borne in the distal branches whereas the staminate ones are more proximal (lower).|$|R
50|$|Pollination {{requirements}} {{should be}} considered when planting black walnuts. As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, Juglans nigra trees tend to be dichogamous, i.e.. produce pollen first and then <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> or else produce <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> and then pollen. An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> so all varieties benefit from overlap. Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio. A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} dioecious, with {{individual}} plants bearing either male (staminate) or female (<b>pistillate)</b> <b>flowers,</b> both {{only a few}} millimeters across. The staminate flowers are tiny cups filled with thready yellowish stamens and the <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> are the rounded, lobed immature fruits surrounded by tiny pointed sepals.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinctive}} flower is hairy and glandular and has {{a central}} nectar disc with a bright red appendage with scalloped edges and a light yellow fringe. The style in the <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> extends outward and is divided at the tip. The anthers are bright yellow.|$|E
50|$|Euphorbia fendleri is {{a species}} of euphorb known by the common name Fendler's sandmat. It is native {{to much of the}} southwestern and central United States and {{northern}} Mexico, where it grows in scrub and woodland habitat in desert and plateau regions. This is a mat- or clump-forming reddish-green plant with a crooked, creeping, hairless stem. The leaves are rounded, oval, or spade-shaped, smooth along the edges and generally coming to a point, and not much more than one centimeter in maximum length. The tiny inflorescence is a cyathium with white-edged, scalloped appendages surrounding the actual flowers. There is a ring of 25 to 35 staminate flowers around one <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower.</b> The ovary of the <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> enlarges into a lobed fruit about 2 millimeters long.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} dioecious, with {{male and female}} {{individuals}} producing different types of flowers. The staminate flowers occur in dense clusters, each flower with 7 to 9 lance-shaped sepals and 7 to 9 stamens. The <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> occurs singly. The bloom period is May and June.|$|E

50|$|The {{plant is}} dioecious, with {{male and female}} {{individuals}} producing different types of flowers. The staminate flowers occur in clusters, each flower with 4 to 6 rounded sepals and 4 to 8 erect stamens. The <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> occurs singly. Its bloom period is January through May, from the lower Sonoran to the higher Mojave deserts.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} may be solitary or borne in clusters. Each inflorescence is a cyathium, {{with flat}} white or red appendages surrounding the actual flowers. At {{the center of}} the array of appendages are several staminate flowers surrounding one <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower.</b> The latter develops into a fruit, which is a capsule about 2 mm wide.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{consists of}} terminal plumes of small, creamy white, bell-shaped, fragrant flowers, branching from the base. The flowers are usually bisexual, with a solitary <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> {{at the end}} of each major axis. The lateral cymes are staminate. There are five or six imbricate petals. The staminate flowers are mostly longer and thinner than the pistillate flowers, with 17-32 glabrous stamens in four whorls. The pistillate flowers have a superior ovary.|$|E

50|$|Fig {{plants can}} be {{monoecious}} (hermaphrodite) or gynodioecious (hermaphrodite and female). Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences (syconium) with long styled <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers,</b> {{and other plants}} with staminate flowers mixed with short styled <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers.</b> The long flowers styles tend to prevent wasps from laying their eggs within the ovules, while the short styled flowers are accessible for egg laying.|$|R

5000|$|Sexuality of {{the flower}} can be {{highlighted}} by ☿ or [...] for hermaphrodite (bisexual), ♂ for male (staminate) and ♀ for female (<b>pistillate)</b> <b>flower.</b> The symbols are usually placed {{at the beginning of}} the formula, after or before the symmetry symbol. Prenner et al. recommend to use the corresponding symbols (♀ and ♂) only for flowers of separate sexuality. Ronse De Craene utilizes the words [...] "pistillate" [...] or [...] "staminate" [...] instead of the symbols.|$|E
50|$|Carex leporina is {{a species}} of sedge known in the British Isles as oval sedge and in North America as eggbract sedge. It is native to Eurasia and eastern and western North America, where it grows in {{seasonally}} wet habitat, such as meadows and fields. This sedge produces many thin stems and narrow leaves. The inflorescence is an open cluster of several flower spikes. The <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> has a reddish or brownish bract with a gold center and white tip.|$|E

40|$|The floral biology, pollinators and {{breeding}} system of Echinodorus longipetalus Micheli were studied in a marshy {{area of the}} district of Taquaritinga (State of Sao Paulo), southeastern Brazil. E. longipetalus is gynodioecious {{and as far as}} is known, this is the first record of unisexual flowers, besides perfect flowers, in Echinodorus. Proportion of female individuals in the studied population is 50 % and produces 31 % more flowers than hermaphrodites. Perfect and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> of E. longipetalus are similar in appearance and are pollinated by several species of Hymenoptera (mainly by Xylocopa (Neoxylocopa) suspecta Moure & Camargo). Perfect flowers offer pollen as a reward. <b>Pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> attract floral visitors by deceit with their staminodes that resemble the stamens of the perfect <b>flowers.</b> Visits to <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> are quick (1 - 2 s), while visits to perfect flowers last up to 120 s. The perfect flowers are self-compatible and produce fruits through spontaneous self-pollination (control <b>flowers),</b> whereas the <b>pistillate</b> ones only set fruits through cross-pollinations. Perfect and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> set more fruits under natural conditions than in manual treatments, respectively. Although the <b>pistillate</b> and perfect <b>flowers</b> bear a strong similarity, the selective pollinator behavior seems to be responsible for the increase of fruit set in perfect flowers.

40|$|Physic nut (Jatropha curcas L) {{seed oil}} {{is a natural}} {{resource}} for the alternative production of fossil fuel. Seed oil production is mainly depended on seed yield, which was restricted by the low ratio of staminate <b>flowers</b> to <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers.</b> Further, the mechanism of physic nut flower sex differentiation has not been fully understood yet. Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction is a reliable and widely used technique to quantify the gene expression pattern in biological samples. However, for accuracy of qRT-PCR, appropriate reference gene is highly desirable to quantify the target gene level. Hence, {{the present study was}} aimed to identify the stable reference genes in staminate and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> of J. curcas. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes were selected and evaluated for their expression stability in staminate and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers,</b> and their stability was validated by five different algorithms (ΔCt, BestKeeper, NormFinder, GeNorm and RefFinder). Resulting, TUB and EF found to be the two most stably expressed reference for staminate flower; while GAPDH 1 and EF found to be the most stably expressed reference gene for <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers.</b> Finally, RT-qPCR assays of target gene AGAMOUS using the identified most stable reference genes confirmed the reliability of selected reference genes in different stages of flower development. AGAMOUS gene expression levels at different stages were further proved by gene copy number analysis. Therefore, the present study provides guidance for selecting appropriate reference genes for analyzing the expression pattern of floral developmental genes in staminate and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> of J. curcas...|$|R
50|$|Brasenia {{exhibits}} wind pollination. The flowers have {{a two-day}} blooming period. On the first day, the functionally female, or <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower,</b> extends {{above the surface}} of the water and exposes the receptive stigmas. The flower then recedes below the water surface and on the following day emerges as a functionally male, or staminate flower. It is elevated higher than on the previous day and the anther-bearing filaments are extended beyond the female carpels. The anthers dehisce, releasing the pollen, and the flower is then withdrawn below the water where the fruit develops.|$|E
5000|$|Of note is {{the damage}} which is {{present on the}} <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower.</b> One side of the flower is preserved, having the peranth ripped off exposing {{the center of the}} flower and the {{developing}} fruit, which has two scratches on the exposed side. [...] Dr Poinar proposes that the damages may have occurred due to an herbivore seizing the flower and subsequently dropping it in the soft tree resin, which afterward fossilized. This is supported by many of the modern Roystonea species having oily fruits that are eaten by a number of bird and bat species.|$|E
50|$|Euphorbia schizoloba (syn. Euphorbia incisa) is {{a species}} of euphorb known by the common name Mojave spurge. It is native to the southwestern United States, where it grows in desert hills and mountains. It is a {{perennial}} herb producing upright stems up to 40 centimeters tall, sometimes with coats of sparse hairs. The stems are lined with alternately arranged leaves which are oval with pointed tips and measure up to 2 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a cyathium with bell-shaped bracts surrounding four tiny glands with flat, fringed appendages. At {{the center of this}} arrangement are several staminate flowers and one long <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Caricaceae is a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} trees and herbs in which most species are dioecious. In the present study, we extend our previous work on dioecy in the Caricaceae, characterising the morphological variation in sexual expression in flowers of the dioecious tree Jacaratia mexicana. We found that, in J. mexicana, female plants produce only <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers,</b> while male plants are sexually variable and can bear three different types of flowers: staminate, pistillate and perfect. To characterise the distinct types of flowers, we measured 26 morphological variables. Our results indicate that: (i) <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> from male trees carry healthy-looking ovules and are morphologically similar, although smaller than, <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> on female plants; (ii) staminate flowers have a rudimentary, non-functional pistil and are the only flowers capable of producing nectar; and (iii) perfect flowers produce healthy- looking ovules and pollen, but have smaller ovaries than <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> and fewer anthers than staminate flowers, and do not produce nectar. The restriction of sexual variation to male trees {{is consistent with the}} evolutionary path of dioecy from hermaphrodite ancestors through the initial invasion of male-sterile plants and a subsequent gradual reduction in female fertility in cosexual individuals (gynodioecy pathway), but further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis...|$|R
5000|$|This sedge grows {{from a long}} rhizome bearing {{clumps of}} stems. The leaves are glaucous, 2-6 mm wide, with {{papillae}} between and sometimes over the veins. The inflorescence consists of 2-3(-5) spikelets. The terminal spikelet is usually staminate, occasionally androgynous, gynecandrous, or pistillate. Staminate terminal spikes are 1.3-2.7 cm long, 2-5 mm wide, with 40-190 flowers. Lateral spikelets are pistillate, (0.6-)1.5-2.5 cm long, 4-7 mm wide, the uppermost usually 1.5-6 cm or more below the terminal spike, but sometimes attached as close as 0.3 cm below the terminal spike. <b>Pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> bracts are reddish brown, dark brown, or rarely gold, the midrib and surrounding area green, white, or light brown, the edges sometimes pale, 1.9-2.8 mm long excluding awn.|$|E

50|$|Lilaea is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of aquatic}} plants containing the single species Lilaea scilloides, {{which is known}} by the common names flowering quillwort, awl-leaf lilaea, and simply lilaea. The taxonomy of this plant has been in debate, with some authors assigning it to a family of its own named Lilaeaceae, and others keeping it in the small arrowgrass family, Juncaginaceae. It is native throughout the Americas {{and it can be}} found elsewhere as an introduced species, particularly in Australia. This is an annual herb growing in or just next to water in several types of shallow aquatic habitat, including vernal pools, mudflats, and ditches. The plant {{takes the form of a}} tuft of basal leaves around a very short stem. Each onionlike leaf is very narrow, long and pointed, reaching 25 to 40 centimeters long. It is wrapped in a translucent sheath at the base. The inflorescences include clusters of staminate and bisexual flowers at the tip of a narrow stalk as well as pistillate flowers in underwater axils. The <b>pistillate</b> <b>flower</b> is composed of a threadlike style which may be up to 20 centimeters long tipped with a stigma which floats on the water surface. The fruit is a beaked, ribbed nutlet up to a centimeter long.|$|E

40|$|Trioecy, the {{co-occurrence of}} the males, females, and {{hermaphrodite}} morphs in natural populations, {{is a rare}} and poorly studied breeding system. It is expressed in Coccoloba cereifera, an endemic, and endangered species from the rupestrian fields of Serra do Cipó, southeastern Brazil. Male individuals produce staminate flowers but no fruits. Female individuals produce <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> and set fruits. Both staminate and <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> present non-functional organs {{of the opposite sex}} that simulate perfect flowers. Hermaphrodite individuals produce two different perfect flowers, each one belonging to distinct individuals, and set fruits. Perfect flowers differ in the amount of pollen produced, in pollen viability, and in some morphological traits. Two Hymenoptera species visited the flowers sporadically. The low natural fructification indicated a limited pollination, while the fruit set recorded in bagged <b>pistillate</b> <b>flowers</b> indicated agamospermy.
