50|$|The U.S. <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Department's</b> {{management}} was outdated and, according to workers, haphazard. Postal union lobbying of Congress to obtain higher pay and better working conditions had proven fruitless.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{bankruptcy}} the United States <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Department</b> began investigating him for mail fraud, and Brinkley became a patient himself, having suffered three {{heart attacks and}} the amputation {{of one of his}} legs due to poor circulation. On May 26, 1942, Brinkley died penniless of heart failure in San Antonio; the mail fraud case had not yet come to trial. He was later buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|During June–August 1906, the {{government}} proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Department</b> for $300million (USD), {{claiming that he}} would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent. This offer was rejected by {{the government}}, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase.|$|E

It was centered near the intersection of West Sioux Lane and Depot Valley Road, now located within the present-day corporate boundaries of Romney. Valley developed in 1884 following {{the completion of the}} South Branch line when the rail line's original southern terminus and corresponding Romney Depot were built there. The United States <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Department</b> established a post office at Valley on May 19, 1928, remaining in operation until its disestablishment on June 15, 1937.

5|$|Despite the {{banning of}} their paper, the Golos Truda group {{continued}} on, however, and issued a final edition {{in the form of}} a journal, in Petrograd and Moscow in December 1919. During the New Economic Policy period (1921–1928), it released a number of works, including the publication of the collected works of pre-eminent anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin from its bookstore and publishing house in Petrograd between 1919 and 1922. What little anarchist activity the regime tolerated ended in 1929, after the accession of Joseph Stalin, and the bookshops of the Golos Truda group in Moscow and Petrograd were closed permanently amidst an abrupt and violent wave of repression. The newspaper was also suppressed by the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Department</b> in the United States, where it was succeeded by the widely circulated Khleb i Volya (Bread and Freedom), first published on February 26, 1919, which in turn was banned from the United States and Canada for its anarchist position.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} along the Rogue River {{and its tributaries}} for at least 8,500years. European explorers made first contact with Native Americans (Indians) {{toward the end of}} the 18thcentury and began beaver {{trapping}} and other activities in the region. Clashes, sometimes deadly, occurred between the natives and the trappers and later between the natives and European-American miners and settlers. These struggles culminated with the Rogue River Wars of 1855–56 and removal of most of the natives to reservations outside the basin. After the war, settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River. They were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895, when the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Department</b> added mail-boat service along the lower Rogue. As of 2010, the Rogue has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the United States.|$|E

While holding that position, Greigg's name again surfaced in Iowa in the summer of 1968, when the leading candidate in the Democratic primary race for his former seat withdrew without explanation {{on the eve of the}} district convention. Griegg was hesitant to jump into the race, however, and his party's support went to his former legislative aide, Jerry O'Sullivan, who won the nomination but lost to Mayne in a landslide.|$|R

25|$|Bradley's {{service to}} the country as {{assistant}} postmaster general is regarded as influential. Bradley's postal routes and schedules, enforced rigidly over a thirty-year period, gave the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Department</b> a rapid and reliable engine for delivering information across vast distances, instilling in citizens {{the importance of the}} connectedness they shared with their distant neighbors.
