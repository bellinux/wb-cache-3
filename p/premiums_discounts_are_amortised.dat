While adverse selection and moral hazard in crop insurance have been extensively studied in the past, discount systems or bonus–malus incentives have not, to our knowledge, been investigated. Our empirical analysis indicates that a crop insurance <b>discount</b> system could <b>be</b> implemented based on a measure of favorable past insurance experience. The estimated average discounts based on the rating methods developed in this study ranged from 5 % to 9 % (depending on the crop being considered).

The issue of providing <b>premium</b> rate <b>discounts</b> based on favorable insurance experience {{has been in the}} economic literature since the early 1980 s. 1 These <b>premium</b> rate <b>discounts</b> <b>are</b> usu-ally justified by the presence of asymmetric in-formation between the policyholders and the insurers (i. e., adverse selection and moral haz-ard). <b>Premium</b> rate <b>discounts</b> based on past insurance performance are a way of adjust-ing the insurance contract to better reflect the policyholder’s risk and reduce asymmet-ric information problems due to adverse se-lection (Boyer and Dionne, 1989; Dionne and Vanasse, 1989, 1992).

40|$|Exchange Traded Funds are equity {{issues of}} {{companies}} whose assets consist entirely {{of cash and}} shares of stock approximating particular indexes. These companies resemble closed end funds except for the unique feature that additional shares can be created or redeemed {{by a number of}} registered entities. This paper investigates the extent and properties of the resulting <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> of ETFs from their fair market value. Measured <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> can <b>be</b> misleading because the net asset value of the portfolio is not accurately represented or because the price of the fund is not accurately recorded. These features are incorporated into a model with errors-in-variables that accounts for these effects and measures the standard deviation of the remaining pricing errors. Time variation in this standard deviation is investigated. Both domestic and international ETFs are examined, each from an end-of-day perspective and from a minute-by-minute intra-daily framework. The overall finding is that the premiums/discounts for the domestic ETFs are generally small and highly transient, once mismatches in timing are accounted for. Large premiums typically last only several minutes. The standard deviation of the premiums/discount is 15 basis points on average across all ETFs, which is substantially smaller than the bid-ask spread. For international ETFs, the findings are not so dramatic. <b>Premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> <b>are</b> much larger and more persistent, frequently lasting several days. The spreads are also much wider and are comparable to the standard deviation of the premiums. This finding is insensitive to the timing of overlap with the foreign market, the use of futures data, or different levels of time scale. In fact there are {{only a small number of}} trades and quote changes in a typical day for most of these funds. An explanation for this difference may rest with the higher cost of creation and redemption for the international products. Nevertheless, when compared with closed end funds where there are no opportunities for creation or redemption, the ETFs have smaller and less persistent <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts.</b> The implication <b>is</b> that the pricing of ETFs is highly efficient for the domestic products and somewhat less precise for the international funds since they face more complex financial transactions and risks. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess cutout and value differences in Yield Grade 4 beef carcasses by evaluating impacts of gender, fatness, muscling, and weight. USDA Choice, Yield Grade 4 carcasses (n = 60) were selected according to gender: heifers (n = 20) and steers (n = 40), and weight groups: lightweight heifers (315. 5 - 362. 9 kg) and steers (362. 9 - 408. 2 kg), and heavy weight heifers (362. 9 - 408. 2 kg) steers (408. 2 - 453. 6 kg). Within weight classes, carcasses were separated according to ribeye area per 45. 36 kg of HCW ratio (REAcm 2 : 100 kg) : heifers (> 21. 76) and (< or equal to 21. 76); steers (greater than 20. 07) and (less than or equal to 20. 07) based on analysis from NBQA- 2005 (National Beef Quality Audit - 2005). Data in this study showed that within yield grade 4 carcasses, there are both conformational and value differences associated with different types of yield grade 4 's, particularly when sex-class is considered due to the biological differences associated with fat and muscle deposition between genders. As expected, carcasses from heifers had more trimmable fat than steers, and steers had higher yields of certain cuts from the chuck and in bone differences than did heifers. In this demonstration, applied estimated discounts out-weighted the value differences found in cutout values. There were no clear associations in carcass traits {{that could be used to}} more accurately sort value differences in Yield Grade 4 carcasses with exception to sex-class.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsGlynn T. TonsorThe {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to examine two aspects of price analysis in the stocker industry {{in order to better}} assist producers making purchasing decisions. One analysis looks at forecasting value of gain, while the second looks at drivers of price differentials between calves and yearlings. When analyzing forecasts on value of gain, weekly data was collected to compare a naïve approach and futures market implied basis-adjusted approaches that include one to five years of historical average basis. This allowed for the assessment of five different models for nine scenarios. The conclusions from this were inconsistent with what was hypothesized and the naïve approach was either worse or no better when compared to using the futures market implied basis-adjusted approaches to forecast value of gain. The drawback to this analysis was that it was solely influenced by error on forecasting the selling price and in future work a forecasting horizon will be incorporated on the buying price. In order to analyze the price <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> between calves and yearlings, a confirmation, update and expansion were completed following monthly models by Marsh (1985). Three elements are considered when predicting price <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> between two weight classes; cost of gain (proxied by corn price), slaughter price, and seasonality. Estimated models in the confirmation for years 1972 to 1982 and the update for years 1973 to 2013, show that <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> <b>are</b> influenced by expected changes in corn price and/or slaughter price, but not highly affected by seasonality. However, in the expansion for years 1993 to 2013, corn price, slaughter price, and seasonality were all significant to the models and in higher magnitude when compared to those results in the confirmation and update.

40|$|Distributed lags {{are used}} to {{estimate}} monthly prices and price <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> between steer calves and steer yearlings. The statistical results show that <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> <b>are</b> not highly seasonal but are affected by expected changes in fed slaughter prices and cost of gain in the feedlot. The effects of these variables are sensitive to time, thus the latter {{should be taken into}} account for future marketing decisions. Also, price flexibility coefficients indicate that profitability risk in cattle finishing is shifted more to price-weight differences of cattle placed on feed than to changes in the individual prices themselves. Key words: cost of gain, dynamic adjustments, fed slaughter prices, feeder calves, feeder yearlings, price flexibilities, price premiums. Historically, the price of steer calves has usu-ally commanded a premium over the price of yearling feeder steers. The variation in this price difference has been significant. For ex-ample, from 1972 to 1982 monthly data on Kansas City prices showed a mean difference of $ 4. 16 per hundredweight (cwt) with a stan-dard deviation of nearly $ 5. 00 per cwt. During this period <b>premiums</b> and <b>discounts</b> ranged from a calf price premium of $ 19 per cwt in December of 1980 to an actual calf price dis-count of nearly $ 6 per cwt in December of 1974. Though part of the variation is random, the greatest portion should reflect quality fac-tors; that is, the variation reflects the relative demand for and supplies of cattle of different weights and grades (Tomek and Robinson). The anticipated premium-discount relation-ship for stockers and feeders plays an impor-tant role in a rancher's decision to either sell or retain ownership (Marsh 1983 b). For exam-ple, in some areas calves may be marketed in late fall or early winter or they may be win-tered at light to moderate rates of gain to be sold or kept for grazing the following summer. In other areas calves may be backgrounded at heavier rates of gain over the winter period and then sold to cattle feeders or placed on feed directly the following spring. Thus, th...|$|R
