The numberplate for No. 36001 {{is located in the}} National Railway Museum, {{although}} a locomotive builder's plate intended for the locomotive, but never fitted in service, was sold at auction in 2008. The Leader was a bold attempt at <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> the boundaries of contemporary steam locomotive design and, if successful, would have prolonged the life of steam on Britain's Railways.|$|E

5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces {{attempted}} to envelop the Pusan Perimeter. The 4th and 6th North Korean (NK) Infantry Divisions advanced south {{in a wide}} flanking maneuver. The two divisions were forced to spread their units along a thin line, but managed to penetrate the UN's left flank with armor and superior numbers, repeatedly <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> US and South Korean forces. American forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance {{in a series of}} engagements in the southern section of the country. The 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, sustained massive casualties at Hadong in a coordinated ambush on July 27 that opened a pass to the Pusan area.

This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

The brigade performed well against Austrian cavalry in two distinct actions {{at the end of}} May of that year. General of Division Michaud, the commander-in-chief of France's Army of the Rhine, noted in his report that Delmas's two regiments showed bravery and intrepidity every time they faced the enemy.

5|$|Following the June 25, 1950, {{outbreak}} of the Korean War {{as a result of}} the invasion of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), the United Nations committed troops to the conflict in support of South Korea. The United States, a member of the UN, subsequently dispatched ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. However, the number of US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength however, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea.|$|E

5|$|In Saxony, a joint {{force of}} Austrians and Brunswickers {{under the command}} of General Kienmayer was far more successful, {{defeating}} a corps {{under the command of}} General Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the capital, Dresden, and <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had been agreed. The Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December 1991, another ceasefire {{was agreed}} and the JNA force besieging Dubrovnik became largely inactive. In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed by}} representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and {{fighting}} was paused. The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. Serbia continued to support the RSK. The conflict largely passed onto entrenched positions and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. The only exception was the Dubrovnik area, where the JNA attacked westward from Dubrovačko Primorje, <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> elements of the HV's 114th and 116th Infantry Brigades and reaching the outskirts of Ston {{by the beginning of}} 1992.|$|E
5|$|South Korean forces, meanwhile, had emplaced in {{the wrong}} position, a mile too far south, and were not in contact with 19th Infantry. The South Korean forces were {{subsequently}} hit with friendly and enemy fire, and in the confusion the 19th Infantry attempted to block the South Koreans from advancing, thinking them enemy forces. North Korean snipers were able to infiltrate {{the rear of the}} position and kill five UN soldiers with shots {{to the back of the}} head. However American forces repelled several advances on the right flank. The M4 Shermans gave the American force a superiority in armor over the North Koreans for the first time, and were crucial in <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> each attempted North Korean advance.

The 1st Guards Brigade was tasked with advancing to link up with the Ston Company guarding access to the Pelješac Peninsula and advance to Slano. The 4th Guards Brigade was ordered to secure the hinterland of the Dubrovačko Primorje by advancing along {{the rim of the}} Popovo field. At the same time, the JNA was pressured by the international community to pull back east of Dubrovnik to Konavle.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, historians {{tended to}} think ancient Egypt {{was the site}} of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian {{paintings}} about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> the earliest known feline–human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat, rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the Fertile Crescent {{around the time of the}} development of agriculture, and then were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.|$|E
