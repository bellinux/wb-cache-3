The school's staff include the sneaky Principal Peststrip (Jeff Bennett), pompous Mr. Bugspit (Curtis Armstrong) and gruff Mrs. Wingston (Candi Milo). The Buzz on Maggie uses a slapstick comedy style and relies {{slightly}} on gross-out humor. It also includes several insect aspects, such as flies' appetite for spoiled and rotten food. The show features various references to pop culture and common themes, such as sibling rivalry and <b>peer</b> <b>pressure,</b> from a fly's point of view.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Finnish troops {{on each side}} varied from 70,000 to 90,000 and both had around 100,000 rifles, 300-400 machine guns and a few hundred cannons. While the Red Guards {{consisted}} mostly of volunteers (wages paid {{at the beginning of}} the war), the White Army contained only 11,000–15,000 volunteers, the remainder being conscripts. The main motives for volunteering were economic factors (salary, food), idealism, and <b>peer</b> <b>pressure.</b> The Red Guards included 2,600 female troops, mostly girls recruited from the industrial centres and cities of southern Finland. Urban and agricultural workers constituted the majority of the Red Guards, whereas land-owning farmers and well-educated people formed the backbone of the White Army.|$|E
40|$|Ethical ideology, {{subjective}} norm, {{and peer}} reporting intentions using an individual-situation moderator Chieh-Peng Lin * and Cherng G. Ding** Peer reporting {{is a specific}} form of whistleblowing in which an individual discloses the unethical behavior of wrongdoing by a peer. This study examined peer reporting from the pos-sible moderating aspect, and demonstrated a significant moderating impact on the causal relationships of ethical decision-making process. The findings of this investigation suggest that the intentions involved in reporting peer wrongdoing differs among individuals, and are influ-enced directly by ethical judgments, attitudes, and subjective norms, while also being influenced indirectly by idealism, relativism, and subjective norms. Besides, compared with externals under high <b>peer</b> <b>pressures,</b> internals under low <b>peer</b> <b>pressures</b> display a stronger rela-tionship between ethical judgment and peer reporting intentions, and between the subjective norm and peer reporting intentions. Last, the relationship between attitudes and peer reporting intentions is similar for both internals under low <b>peer</b> <b>pressures</b> and externals under high <b>peer</b> <b>pressures.</b> Implications of this situation are discussed...|$|R

5|$|From 1918, Burnet {{attended}} the University of Melbourne, {{where he lived}} in Ormond College on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and {{was influenced by the}} ideas of science and society in the writings of H. G. Wells. He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by <b>peer</b> <b>pressure</b> to enlist in the military, which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted {{by the end of the}} war. In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural {{research}} generally {{indicates that}} teenagers begin their smoking habits due to <b>peer</b> <b>pressure,</b> and cultural influence portrayed by friends. However, {{one study found}} that direct pressure to smoke cigarettes played a less significant part in adolescent smoking, with adolescents also reporting low levels of both normative and direct pressure to smoke cigarettes. Mere exposure to tobacco retailers may motivate smoking behaviour in adults. A similar study suggested that individuals may play {{a more active role in}} starting to smoke than has previously been thought and that social processes other than <b>peer</b> <b>pressure</b> also need to be taken into account. Another study's results indicated that <b>peer</b> <b>pressure</b> was significantly associated with smoking behavior across all age and gender cohorts, but that intrapersonal factors were significantly more important to the smoking behavior of 12- to 13-year-old girls than same-age boys. Within the 14- to 15-year-old age group, one <b>peer</b> <b>pressure</b> variable emerged as a significantly more important predictor of girls' than boys' smoking. It is debated whether <b>peer</b> <b>pressure</b> or self-selection is a greater cause of adolescent smoking.|$|E

In terms of behavioural control, the expected difficulty in finding a satisfactory job does not influence the intention.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the correlation between}} <b>peer</b> group <b>pressure</b> and eating disorder behavior symptoms in Jakarta Senior High School students. Many of studies talk about it, but the discussion about eating disorder behavior on sociology was rarely found. In this article, gender {{was used as a}} control variable while many of studies only focused on the woman. The earlier studies that only focused on female have a lack of peer group influence analysis because it is biased. Therefore the author argues that <b>peer</b> group <b>pressure</b> influences the emergence of eating disorder behavior symptoms not only to female students but also to male students. This article was written based on a study which uses quantitative methods with stratified probability random sampling on 235 students from a state senior high school in Jakarta.

50|$|As a pejorative term, {{indoctrination}} implies forcibly or coercively causing {{people to}} act and think {{on the basis of}} a certain ideology. Some secular critics believe that all religions indoctrinate their adherents, as children, and the accusation is made in the case of religious extremism. Sects such as Scientology use personality tests and <b>peer</b> <b>pressures</b> to indoctrinate new members. Some religions have commitment ceremonies for children 13 years and younger, such as Bar Mitzvah, Confirmation, and Shichi-Go-San. In Buddhism, temple boys are encouraged to follow the faith while young. Critics of religion, such as Richard Dawkins, maintain that the children of religious parents are often unfairly indoctrinated.|$|R
