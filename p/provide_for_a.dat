5|$|When Ferdinand Marcos {{declared}} martial law, {{the sitting}} vice-president, Fernando Lopez, {{was removed from}} the office. Marcos ruled without a vice-president until 1986. The 1973 constitution initially did not <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vice-president, but subsequent amendments restored the office. A vice-president was able to sit after the 1986 election when the Marcos-Arturo Tolentino ticket was proclaimed winners by the Batasang Pambansa.|$|E
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} {{laying out}} the Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the Convention. As Pinckney did not write it down, the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. The House would have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The House would elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{following}} {{a study by}} Alexander Hamilton, Congress passed a joint resolution calling {{for the establishment of}} a national mint. Later that year, in his third State of the Union address, President George Washington urged Congress to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mint, which was officially authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. Despite the authorization, silver and gold coins were not struck until 1794. The Flowing Hair dollar, designed by Robert Scot, was initially produced in 1794, and again in 1795. In October 1795 the design was replaced by the Draped Bust dollar.|$|E
5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E

After the polling results {{for a general}} election have been released, the opposition candidates receiving {{the highest percentage of}} votes in their electoral divisions but not elected into Parliament will be offered NCMP seats. However, this is subject to several conditions. There must be less than nine opposition members voted into Parliament, and the candidate must have garnered at least 15% {{of the total number of}} votes polled at the election in the electoral division he or she contested in. In addition, there can be no more than two NCMPs from one Group Representation Constituency ("GRC") and no more than one NCMP from an electoral division that is not a GRC.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{settlement}} in Pearsall's Flats, which was later the location of Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans {{for the establishment of}} schools and churches. A log structure, which served as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. To <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of their children would attend the school and the type of payment the teacher would expect. By the time Romney was surveyed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron laid out the town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence. That year, a stone school building was erected on the site to the immediate north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy.|$|E
