50|$|The term Integrated Asset Modeling {{was first}} used by British Petroleum (BP). Historically the terms Integrated <b>Production</b> <b>Modeling</b> and Integrated Asset Modeling have been used interchangeably. The modern use of Integrated <b>Production</b> <b>Modeling</b> was coined when Petroleum Experts, Ltd. joined their MBAL {{modeling}} software with their GAP and Prosper modeling software to form an Integrated <b>Production</b> <b>Model.</b>|$|R
5|$|After several modifications, {{the first}} {{production}} variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most {{closely associated with}} the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000hp for the first <b>production</b> <b>models,</b> most late war versions produced just under 1,800hp, and the very latest version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000hp. Lancasters were known to fly entire missions with their engines running at full power with no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into <b>production</b> <b>models.</b> Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to <b>production</b> <b>models.</b> Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E

5|$|Hitler envisioned {{widespread}} car ownership {{as part of}} the new Germany and {{he arranged}} for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that every German citizen could afford. A prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. No <b>production</b> <b>models</b> were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).|$|E
5|$|<b>Production</b> <b>models</b> in {{development}} have included convertibles, crossovers, and dedicated hybrids. Under the F marque, Lexus plans to produce high-performance vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and the LFA. Lexus officials have also discussed standard production model usage of varying platforms. The LS uses a dedicated platform, while the entry-level Lexus ES had {{been criticized for}} being too similar to the Toyota Camry, with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation, in both styling and powertrain design. The Nürburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later <b>production</b> <b>models,</b> such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E

5|$|The Ikarus IK-2 was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft of Yugoslav design {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the desirability of a developing a home-grown aircraft industry. A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 <b>production</b> <b>models</b> were built, as the aircraft was obsolescent {{at the time it}} was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{first batch}} of Phantoms {{produced}} for the UK received serials in the XT range, {{with a total}} of 44 <b>production</b> <b>models</b> (20 FG.1s and 24 FGR.2s), as well as the four prototypes and two pre-production models being given XT serial numbers. The bulk of the UK's specially built Phantoms were delivered with XV serials (94 FGR.2s and 28 FG.1s), while the two cancelled sets of airframes (32 FGR.2 and 7 FG.1) also received XV numbers. The second-hand examples (15 F.3) obtained in 1984 received serials in the ZE range.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} was registered G-ALVG {{just before}} it was publicly displayed at the 1949 Farnborough Airshow {{prior to the start}} of flight trials. A year later, the second prototype G-5-2 made its maiden flight. The second prototype was registered G-ALZK in July 1950 and it was used by the BOAC Comet Unit at Hurn from April 1951 to carry out 500 flying hours of crew training and route proving. Australian airline Qantas also sent its own technical experts to observe the performance of the prototypes, seeking to quell internal uncertainty about its prospective Comet purchase. Both prototypes could be externally distinguished from later Comets by the large single-wheeled main landing gear, which was replaced on <b>production</b> <b>models</b> starting with G-ALYP by four-wheeled bogies.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early <b>production</b> <b>models.</b> Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E
5|$|By late 1944, rocket {{development}} and testing work began to taper off, and <b>production</b> <b>models</b> started {{to reach the}} Navy and USAAF in quantity. The director of the OSRD, Vannevar Bush saw an opportunity {{to use some of}} the expertise at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with, the Manhattan Project. Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen, the head of the rocket team at Caltech, to visit the Los Alamos Laboratory, and meet with the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the laboratory director, Robert Oppenheimer, and senior scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory. Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war. In addition to its scientists, Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team, headed by Trevor Gardner. This group worked closely with its counterpart at Los Alamos, which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Lockridge.|$|E
5|$|Lexus <b>production</b> <b>models</b> {{are named}} alphanumerically using two-letter designations {{followed}} by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E

5|$|Such a large glider {{had never}} been {{constructed}} before by the British military, and to test the design, a half-scale prototype model was first designed; designated GAL. 50 it still required an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber {{to act as a}} tug to get it airborne, and was first flown in September 1941. However, it only flew once; the test pilot approached the landing area too low, attempted to raise the flaps for extra glide, and instead crashed the prototype and wrecked it. However, the trial was considered to be a success and the first full-scale prototype model was finished at GAL's works in Hanworth, Middlesex in March 1942. The Hamilcar was transported to RAF Snaith in Yorkshire, as GAL's airfield at Hanworth was too short for the glider to take off from; moving the glider to a secure military airfield would also ensure that it remained secret. Its first flight was conducted on 27 March 1942, towed by a Handley Page Halifax bomber. A second prototype was completed in June 1942, and further testing and development took place at a number of different airfields, including the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment at RAF Beaulieu; all flight trials appear to have been successful, and there were few differences between the prototypes and the <b>production</b> <b>models.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{variants}} on the Hamilcar Mark I were planned, {{although only}} one was actually produced. The Hamilcar Mark X, {{also known as}} the GAL. 58, was designed to specification X 4/44 in an attempt to allow Hamilcars {{to be used in the}} tropical climate of the Pacific, where high temperatures and the high altitudes of many airfields reduced the efficiency of piston-engined aircraft. This meant that Halifax bombers could not tow Hamilcars without a drastically reduced fuel load, which in turn narrowed the range of the Hamilcar. Two initial solutions were proposed to correct this problem; the first was to convert a Hamilcar into a rocket-assisted take off (RATO) aircraft. Two cylindrical steel cylinders filled with twenty-four three-inch rockets were attached to either side of the glider to provide it with 20,000lbs of mean thrust as it took off; they would then be jettisoned once the glider was airborne. Initial trials conducted in January 1943 proved to be successful, but was not pursued any further for unknown reasons. The second solution was double towing, where two Halifax aircraft, one stripped of all unnecessary equipment, attached tow ropes to a Hamilcar and then took off from an airfield; once airborne the normal Halifax would then detach its towrope and land, and the modified Halifax would tow the glider to its destination. However, this idea went no further than initial trials in England, as it was considered to be a high risk operation with a high probability of a serious accident occurring. As such, a powered version of the Hamilcar, the Mark X, was decided upon, as it offered the possibility of long-range airborne operations and the ability to retrieve the glider once it had been used. The decision was taken to start developing the Mark X in November 1943 when the potential for airborne operations against Japan itself began to be considered by the Allies; however, for some reason a relaxed view was taken to the development of the <b>production</b> <b>models,</b> and the first was not available until the early months of 1945.|$|E
5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first <b>production</b> <b>models.</b> Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E
