5000|$|The {{community}} {{is home to}} around 188 people as of 2008 and has been subject to a general decline in the late 20th century continuing into the early 21st century. The closure of the Glendaruel Hotel, a 17th-century coaching inn housing the only local pub, was in particular described as [...] "a body blow." [...] The hotel closed not long after a widely publicized legal case was won by three Polish former employees who had been described as [...] "Polish Slaves" [...] by the hotel proprietors. Over {{the past two decades}} a number of facilities within the community have been lost, notable examples include the post office, general store and tearoom with even Kilmodan Church becoming <b>part-time,</b> <b>holding</b> services only 2 Sundays in a month.|$|E
50|$|After Tom Nolan {{left the}} head {{coaching}} position {{after the end}} of the previous season to focus on coaching the Georgetown baseball team, Georgetown hired his assistant, O'Keefe, as his replacement. O'Keefe had been a stand-out on Hoya teams from 1946 to 1950. After that, the National Basketball Associations Washington Capitols selected him in the fourth round of the 1950 NBA draft, and he played for one season in the NBA, splitting it between the Capitols and the Baltimore Bullets. He later served under Nolan as assistant coach at Georgetown from 1956 to 1960. Georgetowns head coaching position paid so little that during his six seasons as head coach, he could coach the Hoyas only <b>part-time,</b> <b>holding</b> a full-time job time outside of coaching in order to make ends meet, and this impaired his ability to spend time on recruiting players. The team would never have a losing record during his tenure as head coach, but also would make no post-season tournament appearances.|$|E
