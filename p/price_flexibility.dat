There are, however, problems with Ramsey pricing. A profit-maximizing operator will choose Ramsey prices only if all markets are equally monopolistic or equally competitive. If markets are not equally monopolistic or competitive, then the regulator has an interest in ensuring that the extent to which the operator can use Ramsey pricing is limited to groups of services that are subject to similar degrees of competition.

This paper seeks to identify the generic forces behind the trade credit oﬀer and to explore the empirical support for 20 propositions on credit motives derived from the literature {{and the implications of}} such motives to credit policies. The paper reports ﬁndings from a survey of senior ﬁnance oﬃcers involved in credit management in large UK companies. It assesses the degree to which theoretical explanations for granting trade credit are experienced in practice and whether observed diﬀerences attaching to credit motives among ﬁrms are associated with variations in credit policies and debtor days. The study found strong empirical support for seven propositions linked to competitiveness, pricing, investment and ﬁnancing, and weaker support for a number of other theoretically- derived motives for trade credit extension. Factor analysis suggested a more insightful approach to classifying trade credit motives, covering investment in customers, customer’s operating and ﬁnancial beneﬁts, supplier’s marketing/operational beneﬁts and market pressure to conform. In addition, two factors - customer relations and <b>pricing</b> <b>ﬂexibility</b> - were extracted as motives for varying credit terms. Consistent with our hypothesis average debtor days were found to be signiﬁcantly higher for those ﬁrms emphasising the ﬁnancing, investment, and <b>pricing</b> <b>ﬂexibility</b> propositions.

40|$|In {{conventional}} macroeconomic thought, <b>price</b> <b>flexibility</b> stabilizes thc economy. The {{more quickly}} prices fall (or inflation decreases) in a demand-induced recession, the faster output returns to its full-employment level. An alternative tradition, however, suggests that <b>price</b> <b>flexibility</b> can be destabilizing. If a recession reduces expectations of Jitlzre prices, this can raise current real {{interest rates and}} dampen aggregate demand. In addition, as actual current prices fall in a recession, real debt burdens rise which can reduce aggregate demand due to financial distress or the response of capital markets. This paper presents simulations from a dynamic macroeconomic model designed to examine the empirical effects of <b>price</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Our results show that, for credible specifications and parameter values 7 the destabilizing effects of greater <b>price</b> <b>flexibility</b> can be larger than the conventional stabilizing channels.
