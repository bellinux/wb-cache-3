50|$|Each emitter is aligned {{behind a}} colored <b>phosphor</b> <b>dot,</b> and the {{accelerated}} electrons strike the dot and {{cause it to}} give off light in a fashion identical to a conventional CRT. Since each dot on the screen is lit by a single emitter, {{there is no need}} to steer or direct the beam as there is in an CRT. The quantum tunneling effect which emits electrons across the slits is highly non-linear, and the emission process tends to be fully on or off for any given voltage. This allows the selection of particular emitters by powering a single horizontal row on the screen and then powering all of the needed vertical columns at the same time, thereby powering the selected emitters. The half power received by the rest of the emitters on the row is too small to cause emission, even when combined with voltage leaking from active emitters beside them. This allows SED displays to work without an active matrix of thin-film transistors that LCDs and similar displays require in order to precisely select every sub-pixel, and further reduces the complexity of the emitter array. However, this also means that changes in voltage cannot be used to control the brightness of the resulting pixels. Instead, the emitters are rapidly turned on and off using pulse width modulation, so that the total brightness of a spot in any given time can be controlled.|$|E
50|$|In CRT or {{computer}} terminology, a triad {{is a group}} of three <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> coloured red, green, and blue {{on the inside of the}} CRT display of a computer monitor or television set. By directing differing intensities of electron beams onto the three <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots,</b> the triad will display a colour by combining the red, green and blue elements. Each triad forms one pixel of the displayed image.|$|R

50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} was the difficultly in correctly focussing {{the beam}} on the correct color, a problem RCA solved with their shadow mask system. The shadow mask {{is a thin}} metal foil with small holes photoetched into it, positioned so the holes lie directly above one triplet of colored <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots.</b> Indeed, the mask served to expose photosensitive material to deposit the <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots,</b> one color at a time. Three separate electron guns are individually focussed on the mask, sweeping the screen as normal. When the beams pass {{over one of the}} holes, they travel through it, and since the guns are separated by a small distance from each other {{at the back of the}} tube, each beam has a slight angle as it travels through the hole. The <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> are arranged on the screen such that the beams hit only their correct phosphor. A variant, the Sony Trinitron, used an array of vertical metal strips; the electron guns were side by side. Some major parts of the guns' electron optics were common to all three beams, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|Later, Sony {{changed the}} whole game, {{replacing}} the shadow mask with an aperture grille and the <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> with vertical <b>phosphor</b> stripes. They cleverly implemented a single electron gun with three independent cathodes, {{all of which}} greatly simplified convergence.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{solution to}} this problem was introduced by RCA in 1950, with their shadow mask system. The shadow mask is a thin steel sheet with small round holes cut into it, positioned so the holes lie directly above one triplet of colored <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots.</b> Three separate electron guns are individually focussed on the mask, sweeping the screen as normal. When the beams pass over one of the holes, they travel through it, and since the guns are separated by a small distance from each other {{at the back of the}} tube, each beam has a slight angle as it travels through the hole. The <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> are arranged on the screen such that the beams hits only their correct phosphor.|$|R
50|$|The beam-index tube is a color {{television}} {{cathode ray tube}} design, using phosphor stripes and active-feedback timing, rather than <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> and a beam-shadowing mask as developed by RCA. Beam indexing offered much brighter pictures than shadow-mask CRTs, and used a single electron gun rather than three, {{making it easier to}} build and reducing power consumption.|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} video-display terminals (VDTs) {{in the mid-1970s}} ushered {{in the second phase}} of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> of a screen more quickly than a printer head or carriage can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|Pixel for pixel, {{monochrome}} monitors produce sharper {{text and}} images than color CRT monitors. This is because a monochrome monitor {{is made up}} of a continuous coating of phosphor and the sharpness can be controlled by focusing the electron beam; whereas on a color monitor, each pixel {{is made up of}} three <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> (one red, one blue, one green) separated by a mask. Monochrome monitors were used in almost all dumb terminals and are still widely used in text-based applications such as computerized cash registers and point of sale systems because of their superior sharpness and enhanced readability.|$|R
5000|$|Dot pitch: This is {{the size}} of an {{individual}} pixel, which includes the length of the subpixels and distances between subpixels. It can be measured as the horizontal or diagonal length of a pixel. A smaller dot pitch generally results in sharper images because there are more pixels in a given area. In the case of CRT based displays, pixels are not equivalent to the <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots,</b> as they are to the pixel triads in LC displays. Projection displays that use three monochrome CRTs do not have a dot structure, so this specification does not apply.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of {{arranging}} the guns, and phosphors, in a triangle, their system arranged them side-by-side. This {{meant that the}} phosphors {{did not have to}} be displaced from each other in two directions, only one, which allowed much-simplified convergence adjustments of the three beams, compared to the conventional delta shadow mask tube. This differed sufficiently from RCA's design to allow GE to circumvent the patents. It is important to realize that the GE 11" [...] tube still had round mask holes and <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots,</b> not rectangular ones as in the later slot-mask tubes. The innovation here was with the in-line guns as opposed to the triad arrangement.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of the aperture grille was that {{the distance between the}} wires remained constant vertically across the screen. In the shadow mask design, the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> on the screen, which was constant. However, the distance from the guns to the holes changed; for dots {{near the center of the}} screen, the distance was its shortest, at points in the corners it was at its maximum. To ensure that the guns were focused on the holes, a system known as dynamic convergence had to constantly adjust the focus point as the beam moved across the screen. In the Trinitron design, the problem was greatly simplified, requiring changes only for large screen sizes, and only on a line-by-line basis.|$|R
50|$|The guns, {{arranged}} in a delta pattern {{at the back of}} the tube, were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal. For much of the time during the scan, the beams would hit the back of the plate and be stopped. However, when the beams passed a hole they would continue to the phosphor in front of the plate. In this way, the plate ensured that the beams were perfectly aligned with the colored <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots.</b> This still left the problem of focusing on the correct colored dot. Normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen. The mask helped by mechanically attenuating the beam to a small size just before it hit the screen.|$|R
50|$|Another {{change that}} was widely {{introduced}} in the early 1970s {{was the use of}} a black material in the spaces around the inside of the phosphor pattern. This paint absorbed ambient light coming from the room, lowering the amount that was reflected back to the viewer. In order to make this work effectively, the <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> were reduced in size, lowering their brightness. However, the improved contrast compared to ambient conditions allowed the faceplate to be made much more clear, allowing more light from the phosphor to reach the viewer and the actual brightness to increase. Grey-tinted faceplates dimmed the image, but provided better contrast, because ambient light was attenuated before it reached the phosphors, and a second time as it returned to the viewer. Light from the phosphors was attenuated only once. This method changed over time, with TV tubes growing progressively more black over time.|$|R
40|$|As {{a simple}} and {{high-efficient}} genetic transformation approach, floral dip method has been widely used for the studies of gene function in Arabidopsis and other plant species. However, there is no report about its applications in maize. In this study, the floral-dip method of transformation by immersed maize female inflorescences in Agrobacterium suspension was firstly applied in the maize transformation. We found that the best transformation period of corn silk size is 5 - 10 cm and the optimal cell concentration of Agrobacterium transformation is OD 600 = 1. 0. A large number of green <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> by Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) were observed in the T 0 transformed seeds indicating that the T-DNA-carried gfp gene integrated and expressed in the receipt plant genome. The hygromycin selection and PCR assay of exogenous gene hpt displayed that 3. 3 % produced plantlet were positive.

40|$|The optical {{performance}} of a virtual image display system is evaluated. Observation of a two-element (unachromatized doublet) refractive system led {{to the conclusion that}} the major source of image degradation was lateral chromatic aberration. This conclusion was verified by computer analysis of the system. The lateral chromatic aberration is given in terms of the resolution of the <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> on a standard shadow mask color cathode ray tube. Single wavelength considerations include: astigmatism, apparent image distance from the observer, binocular disparities and differences of angular magnification of the images presented to each of the observer's eyes. Where practical, these results are related to the {{performance of}} the human eye. All these techniques are applied to the previously mentioned doublet and a triplet refractive system. The triplet provides a 50 -percent reduction in lateral chromatic aberration which was the design goal. Distortion was also reduced to a minimum over the field of view. The methods used in the design of the triplet are presented along with a method of relating classical aberration curves to image distance and binocular disparity...|$|R
40|$|A shadow mask, {{the primary}} {{component}} of a cathode ray tube (CRT), is used to prevent the outer edges of electron beams from hitting incorrect <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots.</b> It is fabricated {{by means of a}} photo-etching process consisting of a few hundred/thousand process parameters. A primary concern in the management of the process is to determine the optimal process parameter settings necessary to sustain the desired levels of product quality. The characteristics of the process, including a large number of process parameters and collinear observed data, make it difficult to accomplish the primary concern. To cope with the difficulties, a two-phase approach is employed that entails the identification of a few critical process parameters, followed by determination of the optimal parameter settings. The former is obtained through the operator’s domain knowledge and the NNPLS-based prediction model built between process parameters and quality defects. The latter is obtained by solving an optimization problem using a genetic algorithm (GA). A comparative study shows that the proposed approach improves product quality greatly in the shadow-mask manufacturing process.

5000|$|A {{shadow mask}} is a metal plate punched with tiny holes that {{separate}} the colored phosphors in the layer {{behind the front}} glass of the screen. Three electron guns {{at the back of}} the screen sweep across the mask, with the beams only reaching the screen if they pass through the holes. As the guns are physically separated {{at the back of the}} tube, their beams approach the mask from three slightly different angles, so after passing through the holes they hit slightly different locations on the screen. The screen is patterned with <b>dots</b> of colored <b>phosphor</b> positioned so that each can only be hit by one of the beams coming from the three electron guns. For instance, the blue <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> are hit by the beam from the [...] "blue gun" [...] after passing through a particular hole in the mask. The other two guns do the same for the red and green dots. This arrangement allows the three guns to address the individual dot colors on the screen, even though their beams are much too large and too poorly aimed to do so without the mask in place.|$|R
30|$|The {{abovementioned}} quantum <b>dot</b> <b>phosphors</b> utilize an absorption-reemission {{process to}} emit light. This {{process is not}} efficient enough than another process called Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). An effective FRET requires two conditions: a short center-to-center separation distance between the two interacting composites and a spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption. The second condition is usually fulfilled for the quantum <b>dot</b> <b>phosphor</b> coupled with traditional semiconductor LEDs. But to satisfy the first condition (distance within 10  nm), special architectures are needed to bring quantum dot {{close enough to the}} emission media.

5000|$|A {{long string}} of [...] "faced" [...] letters (i.e. turned to allow the address to be read) is {{presented}} to a keyboard operator at a coding desk, who types the postcodes onto the envelopes in coloured <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots.</b> The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each delivery round receives only its own letters. This feature depends upon {{whether or not it}} is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled. When postcodes are incomplete or missing, the operator reads the post town name and inserts a code sufficient for outward sorting to the post town where others can further direct it. The mail bags of letter bundles are sent by road, air or train, and eventually by road to the delivery office. At the delivery office the mail that is handled manually is inward sorted to the postal walk that will deliver it, and it is then [...] "set in", sorted into the walk order that allows the deliverer the most convenient progress in the round. The latter process is now being automated, as the rollout of walk sequencing machines continues.|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study investigates {{the feasibility of}} using a lens-less charge-coupled device (CCD) {{for the detection of}} organic and inorganic fluorophores. The study further investigates the feasibility of this device as a detection sensor in a hand-held Point-of-Care (POC) microfluidic Lab-on-Chip (LOC) detector. ^ The use of microfluidic LOC technology now allows the miniaturization of standard laboratory equipment and helped reduce the time necessary to achieve an accurate result. However, current Point-of-Care (POC) devices are still relatively large and are not easily transportable. For these reasons, the design of a space saving imager has become the target of this study. ^ In the study, several CCD cameras similar to a webcam with the lens removed were tested for the detection of organic and inorganic fluorophores. Of these, a Fire I CCD lens-less imager, having the ability to return a true representation of the detection site, was successfully used for the detection of three common fluorophores (fluorescein, <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots,</b> and quantum dots). Thus it was shown that the lens-less CCD imager is accurate enough to detect quantum dots in alcohol with a Limit of Detection (LOD) at 0. 028 2 ̆ 6 eegr;M, and quantum dots in buffer solution at 6. 38 µM. It was also proven that <b>phosphor</b> <b>dots</b> could be detected to a concentration of 23. 10 µM. The Fire I lens-less CCD was able to detect C-reactive protein (CRP) with a LOD of 5. 65 µM which is just above the 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 clinical range 3 – 5 µM. ^ Having proven that the lens-less CCD can detect fluorophores so near to clinical values for C - reactive protein (CRP), a proof of concept Hand Held Biological Lens-less Detector (HBLD) was designed and built to show how it could be used in a Point-of-Care/Lab-on-Chip (POC/ LOC) application. ^ A custom iPhone application was created to connect to a central data base in order to provide up-to-date and accurate results and to control and monitor the progress of the C-reactive protein/Lab-on-Chip test being performed. The Hand-held Biological Lens-less Detector (HBLD) was also connected to a central server, which upon completion of a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, interpreted the test results, generated a custom, patient-specific report in PDF form, and set either a text message or an e-mail. A custom server program also sent the results to a smartphone so that the results could be reviewed. ^ Through this {{experimental study}} it was found that indeed a lens-less charge-couple device (CCD) can be used for the detection of organic and inorganic fluorophores. Furthermore, this device can be miniaturized into an effective, hand-held Point-of-Care (POC) microfluidic Lab-on-Chip (LOC) detector. ^ To be an effective POC device, a detector needs to be connected in some way to a central database to provide up to date and accurate results. To display the results a custom iPhone application (App) was created to control and monitor the progress of CRP LOC test that is being performed. The HBLD is wirelessly connected via a router to a smartphone, such as an iPhone. The HBLD is also connected to a central server that upon completion of a CRP test interprets the test results and generates a custom patient specific report in PDF form and sends either a text message or an email.

30|$|The {{requirements}} of quantum dot {{to serve as}} phosphor is mainly the emission wavelength, quantum efficiency, and the chemical stability. As an initial step, phosphors with different colors (compared to the available phosphor) can serve as add-ons to boost white light emission reaching higher CRI value. As a second step to replace main stream phosphors, quantum efficiencies of quantum <b>dot</b> <b>phosphors</b> need to reach comparable values with current competitors. The chemical stability at elevated temperature is also a key parameter to be evaluated which could be improved by selecting appropriate surface ligands.

50|$|The beam-index tube bears some {{resemblance}} to two {{other types of}} television tubes which also used vertical stripes of colored <b>phosphor</b> instead of <b>dots</b> or grids. The Chromatron used two sets of fine wires suspended behind the display area to electrically focus its single beam, one set of wires pulling the beam towards the red side and the other towards the blue. The grids were aligned so the beam would normally focus onto the green stripe in the middle, but by varying the relative voltage between the two the beam could accurately hit the colored stripes. In practice the wires were difficult to keep aligned with the phosphors, and gave off electrical noise that interfered with the radio receivers in a television application. It saw some use in military settings, including some commercial television use in the Yaou, Sony 19C 70 and the Sony KV 7010U.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possibility}} for increased efficiency is {{to convert the}} frequency of light down towards the bandgap energy with a fluorescent material. In particular, to exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit, {{it is necessary for}} the fluorescent material to convert a single high-energy photon into several lower-energy ones (quantum efficiency > 1). For example, one photon with more than double the bandgap energy can become two photons above the bandgap energy. In practice, however, this conversion process tends to be relatively inefficient. If a very efficient system were found, such a material could be painted on the front surface of an otherwise standard cell, boosting its efficiency for little cost. In contrast, considerable {{progress has been made in}} the exploration of fluorescent downshifting, which converts high-energy light (e. g., UV light) to low-energy light (e. g., red light) with a quantum efficiency smaller than 1. The cell may be more sensitive to these lower-energy photons. Dyes, rare-earth <b>phosphors</b> and quantum <b>dots</b> are actively investigated for fluorescent downshifting. For example, silicon quantum dots enabled downshifting has led to the efficiency enhancement of the state-of-the-art silicon solar cells.|$|R
50|$|A {{new method}} to further improve the color gamut of LED-backlit LCD panels {{is based on}} blue LEDs (such as GaN) {{illuminating}} a layer of nanocrystal <b>phosphors,</b> so-called Quantum <b>Dots</b> (QD), which convert the blue wavelengths to the desired longer wavelengths as narrow-bandwidth green and red colors for optimal illumination of the LCD from behind. The manufacturer, Nanosys, claims that the color output of the dots can be tuned precisely by controlling {{the size of the}} nanocystals. Other companies pursuing this method are Nanoco Group PLC (UK), QD Vision and 3M, a licensee of Nanosys.Sony has adapted Quantum Dot technology from the US company QD Vision to introduce LCD TVs with an improved edge-lit LED backlight marketed under the term Triluminos in 2013. With a blue LED and optimized nanocrystals for green and red colors in front of it, the resulting combined white light allows for an equivalent or better color gamut than that emitted by a more expensive set of three RGB LEDs. At the Consumer Electronics Show 2015, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, the Chinese TCL Corporation and Sony showed QD-enhanced LED-backlighting of LCD TVs.|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{quantum dot}} {{application}} in solid-state lighting mainly {{lies in the}} phosphor usage in white LED applications. The current main stream technology for white light emission couples blue LED and color-converted phosphors to produce white light. Commercially available phosphors show high quantum efficiency of above 90  % for yellow (yttrium aluminum garnet, YAG) and 80  % for red (CaAlSiN, CASN). Quantum dots need more improvement in solid-state form to match those values. However, quantum dots could still serve as useful substitutes or add-ons of those phosphors for enhanced performance due to several reasons. First of all, their size-tunable emission property makes the multiple color emission easy to achieve without employing multiple compositions. This could reduce the chemical compatibility and aging problem when intermixture of different compositions is inevitable. Second, the continuous tunable color of quantum dot enables them to be added in to reach a high color rending index (CRI) value. By adding more phosphors with different colors, the white light source shows richer color, broader emission spectrum, and higher CRI value. Third, nanocrystals are very light and tiny so they could relief the phosphor settling problem due to the gravity. Finally, commercially available phosphors could be restricted by the abundance of rare earth elements. Quantum <b>dot</b> <b>phosphor,</b> if selected with right material systems, will not face such kind of problems.|$|R

Furthermore, the unique possibility to tune the emission spectrum of quantum dots allows to optimize the resulting LED spectrum in order to achieve optimal color rendering properties for the light source. However, finding the optimal quantum dot properties to achieve optimal efficacy and color rendering is a non-trivial task. Instead of simply summing up the emission spectra of the blue LED, <b>phosphor</b> and quantum <b>dots,</b> we propose a complete simulation tool that allows an accurate analysis of the final performance for a range of different quantum dot synthesis parameters. The recycling of the reflected light from the wavelength conversion element by the LED package is taken into account, as well as the re-absorption and the associated red-shift. This simulation tool is used to vary two synthesis parameters (core size and cadmium fraction) of InP/Cd[x]Zn[1 -x]Se quantum dots.
