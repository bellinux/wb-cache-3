40|$|Oral or intragastric {{administration}} of antigens such as foreign proteins or erythrocytes {{is known to}} cause the appearance of circulating antibodies which frequently are predominantly of the IgA class (1). Some of this antibody is made locally in the immunized gut wall (2, 3), but an additional, as yet unspecified, fraction originates in extraintestinal lymphoid tissues, particularly the spleen. In this organ, many PFC, chiefly ofthe IgA class, can be identified 1 wk after a 4 day course of intragastric immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (4). Reasons for attributing this preference for IgA to the colonization of the spleen and lymph nodes by IgA-committed cells triggered by antigen in the gut wall have been set forth in recent reviews (1, 5). While exploring the immunologic memory {{of this type of}} immune response, we encountered a second striking feature of the systemic effects of enteric (mucosal?) immunization.

40|$|Describe a few {{specific}} Solution. The paradoxes {{of material}} implication mainly concern phenomena which {{arise from the}} semantics of classical material implication. The reason why those are regarded as paradoxes is that the material implication is somehow different interpreted in logic than in natural language (at least sometimes). We’ll list a few here: • Ex falso sequitur quodlibet: From a false proposition, arbitrary propositions follow (i. e. are materially implied). This amounts to the theorem: ⊥ ⊃ ϕ for every formula ϕ. I. e. if there is inconsistent knowledge, everything can be concluded from it. • If some formula is true, then it is implied by every other formula: this amounts to the valid sentence ϕ ⊃ (ψ ⊃ ϕ) for every formulae ϕ, ψ. • The disjunction of ¬ϕ and ϕ is implied by every ψ: this amounts to the validity of ψ ⊃ (ϕ ∨ ¬ϕ). Given any valid sentence, any other sentence implies this valid sentence. These are somehow “redundant ” assumptions. For example, we may modify Euclid’s theorem as follows: If Gerald Berger is the richest person in the world, then there exist infinitely many <b>primes.</b> Of <b>course</b> the assumption is redundant, but the theorem still remains valid. From a mathematical point of reasoning, this does not present any problem. However, in natural language this statement might be interpreted differently.

Second, all morphological effects were specific, that is, in none of the ROIs could morphology effects be explained by pure orthographic or pure semantic overlap. Third, the ventral route was sensitive to both the orthographic and semantic " part " of the morphological priming effect in the M 350 time window. Fourth, the earliest effects of morphology occurred in left superior temporal gyrus around 250 msec and reflected the semantic contribution to morphological facilitation.

Most MBP-reactive encephalitogenic T cells recognize an immunodominant NH 2 -terminal peptide, Ac 1 - 9, and predominantly use the T cell receptor (TCR) V beta 8. 2 gene segment.

40|$|Introduction: Neuropsychological {{studies on}} people withneuropsychological {{symptoms}} (e. g. memory deficits) indicate dissociation consisting of some deficits in explicit(declarative) memory and absence of difficulties in rememberingand recalling on the priming procedure. In the fewstudies so far of nondeclarative memory in the MS groupit was shown that priming makes possible recollection ofinformation which cannot be remembered intentionally. It {{is suggested that}} there is dependence between theimplicit recalling and the clinical factors of MS. The aim of our research was to analyse the effect ofpriming in MS compared to a control group, defininga relation between effects of reminding and kind ofpriming, course of MS and duration of disability. Material and methods: In the research work 27 peoplewith clinically probable MS (multiple sclerosis) and 30 people from a control group took part. The level ofprocessing stimulus on the phase of presentation(perceptual versus semantic) and kind of priming(perceptual versus semantic) were manipulated. In thatway there were created 4 kinds of experimental tasks. Results: The people suffering from MS, compared withthe control group, showed significant difficulties in primingtasks which perform perceptual processing in the learningphase and in the recalling phase, and a comparable levelof results in semantic <b>priming.</b> Clinical factors (<b>course</b> ofillness and disease duration) did not differentiate the resultsof the MS group, but patients with PPMS (primaryprogressive MS) exhibited a deficit in perceptual priming. Conclusions: The results indicate a dissociation in implicitmemory: normal semantic priming and pathologicalperceptual priming.
