5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to <b>patronage</b> positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the <b>patronage</b> system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on <b>patronage</b> kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} saw the {{beginnings}} of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had its foundation in the Reformation. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and <b>patronage,</b> but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party over fears of fanaticism by the former and the acceptance of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. Ecclesiastical <b>patronage,</b> the right of local lairds or other notables to appoint ministers to a parish, had been abolished at the Glorious Revolution, but it was reintroduced in the <b>Patronage</b> Act of 1711, resulting in frequent protests from the kirk.|$|E

5|$|He was {{pastor of}} the church of Calder Comitis, Midlothian, by September 1296. Both churches were {{indirectly}} under the <b>patronage</b> of the Bishop of St Andrews, William Fraser.

Soon {{they find out}} that Teach is after Daniel alone; however, with the application of trigonometry, the ship is able to escape the bay and the pirate band.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in <b>patronage.</b> As a result of the added <b>patronage,</b> the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine consumer views of general pharmacy <b>patronages</b> and pharmacist consultation services offered by the Ubon Rajathanee University Drug Store (UUDS). This study is exploratory research. The research design applied for this study was cross-sectional via a self-administered questionnaire completed by customers who purchase medication at UUDS. A convenience sample of 100 customers using UUDS was selected. For an in-store survey, subjects were asked about their views of the 13 general pharmacy <b>patronages</b> and six pharmacist consultation services using a uni-polar importance scale (with the scale ranging from 1 =not important to 5 =most important). They also were asked questions about drug purchases and demographic information. The mean importance scores of all the 13 general pharmacy <b>patronages</b> and all the six pharmacist consultation services were rated above three (of moderate importance) and above four (of considerable importance) consecutively.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how strong Matilda's {{personal}} piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong preference to be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs.

Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established Benedictine monastery of Cluny alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the Victorines and Premonstratensians. As part of this <b>patronage,</b> she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near Cherbourg.|$|E
