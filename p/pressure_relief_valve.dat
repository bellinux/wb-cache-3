25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, blow-off valve (BOV), or dump valve. It is a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|E
25|$|In another design, {{a rubber}} housing is {{fitted with a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> that determines {{the speed of a}} vehicle. If the vehicle is {{traveling}} below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the inter-stage pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the excess pressure, the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> on the first stage opens, or a low pressure hose or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To break the cycle it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source to thaw the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the cylinder drops to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|E

2500|$|The GT-R's {{success in}} motor racing was formidable, {{particularly}} in the annual [...] race at the Mount Panorama circuit in Bathurst, Australia, where the winner in 1991 and 1992 was a GT-R (despite receiving additional [...] in weight penalties and a turbo <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> in 1992, and crashing). It took the overall win of the 1991 Spa 24 Hours, after getting the pole position and fastest lap time, ahead of the Porsche 911 and BMW M3 Evolution. It remained dominant in the Japanese GT series for many years. The Skyline GT-R line was retired from the JGTC series (later changed Super GT Series) in 2004. Its successor, the Nissan GT-R, competed and dominated the 2008 Super GT season, winning the GT500 (see details below).|$|E
2500|$|A {{downstream}} {{demand valve}} {{serves as a}} fail safe for over-pressurization: if a first stage with a demand valve malfunctions and jams in the open position, the demand valve will be over-pressurized and will [...] "free flow". Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without inflating buoyancy devices. The effect of unintentional inflation might be to carry the diver quickly to the surface causing the various injuries that can result from an over-fast ascent. There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's breathing bag, a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} demand valves. Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no demand valve is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> unless it has a built in over pressure valve, so that over-pressurization does not inflate any buoyancy devices connected to the regulator.|$|E
