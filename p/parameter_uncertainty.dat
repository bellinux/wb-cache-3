The <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in the rise velocity for both hydrate coated and hydrate free droplets are estimated from experiment data. Thereafter the rise velocity is coupled with a mass transfer model to simulate the fate of dissolution of a single droplet. The assessment shows that <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are highest for large droplets. However, it is also shown that in some circumstances varying the temperature gives significant change in rise distance of droplets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust saturation control approach for active vibration attenuation of building structures involving <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and input time delay. The <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> {{are described in}} both polytopic and norm-bounded forms and represent the variations of floor masses, stiffnesses and damping coefficients. The input time delay can be time-varying within a known bound. In terms of the feasibility of certain delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), a state feedback controller can be designed to guarantee the robust stability and performance of the closed-loop system {{in the presence of}} <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties,</b> actuator saturation, and input time delay. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated by numerical simulations on the vibration control of a three-storey building structure subject to seismic excitation. It is validated that the designed robust saturation controller can effectively suppress the structural vibration and keep the system stability when there are <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and input time delay...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to calibration is statistical estimation, thereby accounting for <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Many frequentist and Bayesian {{methods have been}} proposed and implemented, typically for {{a subset of the}} abovementioned models.

50|$|Informally, a {{controller}} {{designed for}} {{a particular set of}} parameters is said to be robust if it also works well under a different set of assumptions. High-gain feedback is a simple example of a robust control method; with sufficiently high gain, the effect of any parameter variations will be negligible. From the closed loop transfer function perspective, high open loop gain leads to substantial disturbance rejection in the face of system <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several methodologies for inverse {{uncertainty}} quantification exist {{under the}} Bayesian framework. The most complicated direction is {{to aim at}} solving problems with both bias correction and parameter calibration. The challenges of such problems include not only the influences from model inadequacy and <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> but also the lack of data from both computer simulations and experiments. A common situation is that the input settings {{are not the same}} over experiments and simulations.|$|E

Firstly, the spacecraft mathematical model {{is transformed into}} a cascading system by introducing an adaptive variable.

Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the resulting closed-loop attitude system is proven to be stable in finite time without <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and asymptotically stable with <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> Finally, numerical simulation examples are also presented to demonstrate that the control strategy developed is feasible and effective for spacecraft attitude stabilization mission...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well-known}} that standard predictive techniques {{are not very}} robust to <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and to external disturbances. Furthermore, they require the exact knowledge of the delay. In practice, these constraints are rarely satisfied. In this paper, solutions are presented to allow the use of predictive control in presence of external disturbances, <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and an unknown input delay. First, a recent predictive control method developed to attenuate the effect of external disturbances is shown to be also robust to <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> In addition, a delay estimator is presented to estimate unknown time-varying delays.

50|$|This {{work was}} the first to satisfactorily address the then open problem on robust {{stability}} and performance problems for constant real <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in the literature via parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. The work provided a fundamental generalization of mixed-μ analysis and synthesis in terms of Lyapunov functions and Riccati equations. This unification between mixed-μ and parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions resulted in new machinery for mixed-μ controller synthesis by providing the basis for a reliable, fully automated μ-synthesis procedure while, for the first time, simultaneously capturing H2 performance while avoiding suboptimal multiplier-controller iteration and curve-fitting procedures. This research has produced advanced theoretical breakthroughs directly supporting engineering practice.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{problems}} in uncertainty quantification: one is the forward propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) {{and the other is}} the inverse assessment of model uncertainty and <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.|$|E
5000|$|Vector autoregressions are {{flexible}} {{statistical models}} that typically include many free parameters. Given the limited length of standard macroeconomic datasets, Bayesian methods {{have become an}} increasingly popular {{way of dealing with}} this problem of over-parameterization. The general idea is to use informative priors to shrink the unrestricted model towards a parsimonious naïve benchmark, thereby reducing <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and improving forecast accuracy (see [...] for a survey). A typical example is the shrinkage prior proposed by Robert Litterman, and subsequently developed by other researchers at University of Minnesota, which is known in the BVAR literature as the [...] "Minnesota prior". The informativeness of the prior can be set by treating it as an additional parameter, based on a hierarchical interpretation of the model.|$|E

50|$|When {{developing}} a parametrisation scheme, many new parameters {{are introduced to}} represent simplified physical processes. These parameters may be very uncertain. For example, the 'entrainment coefficient' represents the turbulent mixing of dry environmental air into a convective cloud, and so represents a complex physical process using a single number. In a perturbed parameter approach, uncertain parameters in the model's parametrisation schemes are identified and their value changed between ensemble members. While in probabilistic climate modelling, such as climateprediction.net, these parameters are often held constant globally and throughout the integration, in modern numerical weather prediction it is more common to stochastically vary {{the value of the}} parameters in time and space. The degree of parameter perturbation can be guided using expert judgement, or by directly estimating the degree of <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for a given model.|$|E

"The {{pairing of}} {{significant}} {{uncertainty about the}} behaviour and response of ecological systems with urgent calls for near-term action constitutes a difficult reality, and a common lament" [...] for many environmental resource managers. Scientific analysis of the environment deals with several dimensions of ecological uncertainty. These include: structural uncertainty resulting from the misidentification, or lack of information pertaining to the relationships between ecological variables; <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> referring to [...] "uncertainty associated with parameter values that are not known precisely but can be assessed and reported {{in terms of the}} likelihood…of experiencing a defined range of outcomes"; and stochastic uncertainty stemming from chance or unrelated factors.

50|$|Parameter {{estimation}} {{in forest}} gap models is a challenging process. Manual calibration and sensitivity {{analysis of these}} models require {{a large number of}} simulations, leading to a time-consuming computational demand. Thus, for the automatic calibration of uncertain parameters, when direct measurements are missing or made under specific conditions (e.g., climate, soil), a collection of rapid stochastic search methods have been developed and applied in FORMIND. These methods automatically minimize the difference between simulation results and field observations by running the model a thousand times. Additionally, for the assessment of <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> approximate Bayesian methods can be used in combination with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. These methods can also be used for forest sites where a limited number of observations in time and space are available. After careful examination of the model and available observation data, a combination of manual and automatic calibrations leads to the successful parameterization of forest gap models.|$|E

Using a VAR {{model of the}} UK economy and an assumed quadratic loss function for the policy-maker, an optimal interest rate rule is calculated first ignoring <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> then assuming that the <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is given by the estimated standard errors on the VAR coefficients.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{deals with}} {{decentralized}} robust vibration {{control of a}} smart composite panel with <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> The composite panel with four collocated piezoelectric actuators and velocity sensors is modeled using finite element method, and then {{the size of the}} model is reduced in the state space using Modal Hankel Singular Value. The <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> presented by natural frequencies and modal damping ratios are considered in controller design process. To suppress the vibration induced by external distur-bance, a decentralized robust H 1 controller is developed using linear matrix inequality tech-niques. Numerical simulation for the smart panel is performed in order to investigate the effectiveness of decentralized vibration control (DVC). When the system is subjected to an initial displacement field or distributed white noise disturbance, numerical results show that the DVC system is very effective. Although there are 20 % <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainties</b> for modal frequencies, damping ratio, and control input, the decentralized controller can effectively suppress the vibration excited by the external disturbance. Furthermore, the decentralized controller composed of four three-order systems can be practically implemented well.
