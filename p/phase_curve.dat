25|$|The {{history of}} {{observation}} {{and analysis of}} the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> of Venus {{is similar to that of}} Mercury. The best set of modern observations and interpretation was reported by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard. They used the LASCO instrument on SOHO and ground based CCD equipment to observe the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> from 2 to 179°. As with Mercury, these new data are the major source of the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> used in the Astronomical Almanac for predicting apparent magnitudes.|$|E
25|$|Only about 50° of {{the martian}} <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> can be {{observed}} from Earth because it orbits farther from the Sun than our planet. There is an opposition surge but it is less pronounced than that of Mercury. The rotation of bright and dark surface markings across its disk and variability of its atmospheric state (including its dust storms) superimpose variations on the <b>phase</b> <b>curve.</b> R. Schmude obtained many of the Mars brightness measurements used in a comprehensive <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> analysis performed by A. Mallama.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} flat <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> of Venus {{is characteristic}} of a cloudy planet. In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, {{as opposed to the}} narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the <b>phase</b> <b>curve.</b> Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin crescent, due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of sulfuric acid that are above the planet's cloud tops. Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.|$|E
25|$|Programs for characterizing planets {{outside of}} the solar system depend largely on {{spectroscopy}} to identify atmospheric constituents and states, especially those that point to the presence of life forms or which could support life. However, brightness can be measured for very distant Earth-sized objects that are too faint for spectroscopic analysis. A. Mallama has demonstrated that <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> analysis may be a useful tool for identifying planets that are Earth-like. Additionally, J. Bailey has pointed out that <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> anomalies such as the brightness excess of Venus could be useful indicators of atmospheric constituents such as water, which might be essential to life in the universe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> of the Earth has {{not been}} {{determined}} as accurately as those for Mercury and Venus because its integrated brightness is difficult to measure from the surface. Instead of direct observation, earthshine reflected from {{the portion of the}} Moon not lit by the Sun has served as a proxy. A few direct measurements of the Earth's luminosity have been obtained with the EPOXI spacecraft. While they do not cover much of the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> they reveal a rotational light curve caused by the transit of dark oceans and bright land masses across the hemisphere. P. Goode and colleagues at Big Bear Solar Observatory have measured the earthshine and T. Livengood of NASA analyzed the EPOXI data.|$|E

25|$|Early visual {{observations}} {{contributing to}} the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> of Mercury were obtained by G. Muller in the 1800s and by André-Louis Danjon in the mid-twentieth century. W. Irvine and colleagues used photoelectric photometry in the 1960s. Some of these early data were analyzed by G. de Vaucouleurs, summarized by D. Harris and used for predicting apparent magnitudes in the Astronomical Almanac for several decades. Highly accurate new observations covering the widest range of phase angles to date (2 to 170°) were carried out by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. They also obtained new CCD observations from the ground. These data are now {{the major source of}} the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> used in the Astronomical Almanac for predicting apparent magnitudes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> of Mercury is very steep, {{which is}} {{characteristic}} of a body on which bare regolith (soil) is exposed to view. At phase angles exceeding 90° (crescent phase) the brightness falls off especially sharply. The shape of the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> indicates a mean slope {{on the surface of}} Mercury of about 16°, which is slightly smoother than that of the Moon. Approaching phase angle 0° (fully illuminated phase) the curve rises to a sharp peak. This surge in brightness is called the opposition effect because for most bodies (though not Mercury) it occurs at astronomical opposition when the body is opposite from the Sun in the sky. The width of the opposition surge for Mercury indicates that both the compaction state of the regolith and the distribution of particle sizes on the planet are similar to those on the Moon.|$|E
25|$|The phase {{curves of}} many asteroids {{have also been}} {{observed}} and they too may exhibit opposition surges. Asteroids can be physically classified in this way. The effects of rotation can be very large {{and have to be}} factored in before the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> is computed. An example of such a study is reported by R. Baker and colleagues.|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the solar <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> in B, V, and I for 18 Trans-Neptunian Objects, 7 Centaurs, and Nereid and determined the rotation curves for 10 of these targets. For each body, {{we have made}} ~ 100 observations uniformly spread over the entire visible range. We find that all the targets except Nereid have linear <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> at small <b>phase</b> angles ( 3 deg, the Centaurs (54598) Bienor and (32532) Thereus have <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> that flatten. The recently discovered Pluto-scale bodies (2003 UB 313, 2005 FY 9, and 2003 EL 61), like Pluto, have neutral colors compared to most TNOs and small phase coefficients (< 0. 1 mag/deg). Together these two properties are a likely indication for large TNOs of high-albedo, freshly coated icy surfaces. We find several bodies with significantly wavelength-dependent <b>phase</b> <b>curves.</b> The TNOs (50000) Quaoar, (120348) 2004 TY 364 (47932), and 2000 GN 171 have unusually high I-band phase coefficients (0. 290 +/- 0. 038, 0. 413 +/- 0. 064, 0. 281 +/- 0. 033 mag/deg, respectively) and much lower coefficients in the B and V bands. Their phase coefficients increase in proportion to wavelength by 0. 5 - 0. 8 mag/deg/um. The <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> for TNOs with small B-band phase coefficients (< 0. 1 mag/deg) have a similar but weaker wavelength dependence. Coherent backscatter is the likely cause for the wavelength dependence for all these bodies. We see no such dependence for the Centaurs, which have visual albedos ~ 0. 05.

40|$|International audienceWe present Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods (MCMC) for the {{derivation}} {{of empirical}} model parameters for photometric and polarimetric <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> of asteroids. Here we model the two <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> jointly at <b>phase</b> angles 25 ° using a linear-exponential model, {{accounting for the}} opposition effect in disk-integrated brightness and the negative branch {{in the degree of}} linear polarization. We apply the MCMC methods to V-band <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> of asteroids 419 Aurelia (taxonomic class F), 24 Themis (C), 1 Ceres (G), 20 Massalia (S), 55 Pandora (M), and 64 Angelina (E). We show that the photometric and polarimetric <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> can be described using a common nonlinear parameter for the angular widths of the opposition effect and negative-polarization branch, thus supporting the hypothesis of common physical mechanisms being responsible for the phenomena. Furthermore, incorporating polarimetric observations removes the indeterminacy of the opposition effect for 1 Ceres. We unveil a trend in the interrelation between the enhancement factor of the opposition effect and the angular width: the enhancement factor decreases with decreasing angular width. The minimum polarization and the polarimetric slope at the inversion angle show systematic trends when plotted against the angular width and the normalized photometric slope parameter. Our new approach allows improved analyses of possible similarities and differences among asteroidal surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Context: Accurate {{measurements}} of diameters of trans-Neptunian objects are extremely complicated to obtain. Thermal modeling can provide good results, but accurate absolute magnitudes {{are needed to}} constrain the thermal models and derive diameters and geometric albedos. The absolute magnitude, Hv, {{is defined as the}} magnitude of the object reduced to unit helio- and geocentric distances and a zero solar phase angle and is determined using <b>phase</b> <b>curves.</b> <b>Phase</b> coefficients can also be obtained from <b>phase</b> <b>curves.</b> These are related to surface properties, yet not many are known. Aims: Our objective is to measure accurate V band absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients for a sample of trans-Neptunian objects, many of which have been observed, and modeled, within the 'TNOs are cool' program, one of Herschel Space Observatory key projects. Methods: We observed 56 objects using the V and R filters. These data, along with those available in the literature, were used to obtain <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> and measure V band absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients by assuming a linear trend of the <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> and considering magnitude variability due to rotational light-curve. Results: We obtained 237 new magnitudes for the 56 objects, six of them with no reported previous measurements. Including the data from the literature we report a total of 110 absolute magnitudes with their respective phase coefficients. The average value of Hv is 6. 39, bracketed by a minimum of 14. 60 and a maximum of - 1. 12. In the case of the phase coefficients we report 0. 10 mag per degree as the median value and a very large dispersion, ranging from - 0. 88 up tp 1. 35 mag per degree.

25|$|In {{astronomy}} a <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> {{describes the}} brightness of a reflecting body {{as a function of}} its phase angle. The brightness usually refers the object's absolute magnitude, which, in turn, is its apparent magnitude at a distance of one astronomical unit from the Earth and Sun. The phase angle equals the arc subtended by the observer and the sun as measured at the body.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> of the Moon {{approximately}} {{resembles that}} of Mercury due to the similarities of the surfaces {{and the lack of}} an atmosphere on either body. Clementine spacecraft data analyzed by J. Hillier, B. Buratti and K. Hill indicate a lunar opposition surge. The Moon's apparent magnitude at full phase is −12.7 while at quarter phase it is less than 10 percent as bright.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus {{as seen from}} Earth does not occur at phase angle zero. Since the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> of Venus is relatively flat while its distance from the Earth can vary greatly, maximum brightness occurs when the planet is a crescent, at phase angle 125°, at which time Venus can be as bright as magnitude −4.9. Near inferior conjunction the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3 although the exact value depends on the phase angle. The typical range in apparent brightness for Venus {{over the course of}} one apparition is less than a factor of 10 or merely 1% that of Mercury.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Rosetta {{spacecraft}} flew by 21 Lutetia on July 2010. This event {{provides a}} unique opportunity to enhance our knowledge of solar system small bodies, by comparing the surface properties measured in situ and the properties deduced from the linear polarization of scattered light, and prepare future observations. The linear polarization is studied {{as a function of the}} phase angle at different wavelengths and compared to <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> of M-type and C-type asteroids. In a second part of the work, 21 Lutetia's polarization <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> are compared to <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> measured in the laboratory for powdered carbonaceous chondrites suggested as eventual analogs by spectroscopic studies.

25|$|The phase {{function}} of the giant planet is also a {{function of}} its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the <b>phase</b> <b>curve</b> may constrain other planet properties, such as the size distribution of atmospheric particles. When a planet is found transiting and its size is known, the phase variations curve helps calculate or constrain the planet's albedo. It is more difficult with very hot planets as {{the glow of the}} planet can interfere when trying to calculate albedo. In theory, albedo can also be found in non-transiting planets when observing the light variations with multiple wavelengths. This allows scientists to find the size of the planet even if the planet is not transiting the star.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Although {{the problem}} of dynamic {{locomotion}} in very rough terrain {{is critical to the}} advancement of various areas in robotics and health devices, little progress has been made on generalizing gait behavior with arbitrary paths. Here, we report that perturbation theory, a set of approximation schemes that has roots in celestial mechanics and nonlinear dynamical systems, can be adapted to predict the behavior of nonintegrable state-space trajectories of a robot’s center of mass, given its arbitrary contact state and center of mass (CoM) kinematic path. Given an arbitrary kinematic path of the CoM and known step locations, we use perturbation theory to determine <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> of CoM behavior. We determine step transitions as the points of intersection between adjacent <b>phase</b> <b>curves.</b> To discover intersection points, we fit polynomials to the <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> of neighboring steps and solve their differential roots.

With similar amplitudes to occultations but far longer baselines, {{they have a}} higher sensitivity to planetary photons {{at the expense of}} a more challenging data reduction in terms of long-term stability. In this work, we introduce a novel non-parametric algorithm dubbed "phasma" to produce clean, robust exoplanet <b>phase</b> <b>curves</b> and apply it to 115 Neptunian and 50 Terran exoplanets observed by Kepler. We stack the signals to further improve signal-to-noise, and measure an average Neptunian albedo of Ag < 0. 23 to 95 % confidence, indicating a lack of bright clouds consistent with theoretical models. Our Terran sample provides the first constraint on the ensemble albedo of exoplanets which are most likely solid, constraining Ag < 0. 42 to 95 % confidence. In agreement with our constraint on the greenhouse effect, our work implies that Kepler's solid planets are unlikely to resemble cloudy Venusian analogs, but rather dark Mercurian rocks.
