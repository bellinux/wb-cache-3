40|$|Abstract Background The {{reliable}} {{extraction of}} features from mass spectra {{is a fundamental}} step in the automated analysis of proteomic mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. Results This contribution proposes a sparse template regression approach to peak picking called NITPICK. NITPICK is a Non-greedy, Iterative Template-based <b>peak</b> <b>PICKer</b> that deconvolves complex overlapping isotope distributions in multicomponent mass spectra. NITPICK is based on fractional averagine, a novel extension to Senko's well-known averagine model, and on {{a modified version of}} sparse, non-negative least angle regression, for which a suitable, statistically motivated early stopping criterion has been derived. The strength of NITPICK is the deconvolution of overlapping mixture mass spectra. Conclusion Extensive comparative evaluation has been carried out and results are provided for simulated and real-world data sets. NITPICK outperforms pepex, to date the only alternate, publicly available, non-greedy feature extraction routine. NITPICK is available as software package for the R programming language and can be downloaded from [URL]. </p...|$|E
40|$|Matched Field Processing (MFP) is a {{beamforming}} technique {{which allows}} for the detection and localization of an acoustic source in range and depth using passive sonar. The performance of MFP in shallow water environments using a short aperture horizontal line array is investigated. Shallow water test cases are utilized to evaluate the effects of frequency, bottom type, relative target bearing, and sound speed profile on MFP performance. Data from RANGEX 1 - 92 is also utilized to test {{the performance of the}} eight nearest neighbor <b>peak</b> <b>picker</b> (ENNPP) and M of N tracker for a horizontal line array in a real ocean environment. It is shown that MFP performance is significantly better for higher frequencies, for more reflective, bottom types, and for relative target bearings away from the broadside beams. lt is also shown that the performance of plane wave beamformers is severely degraded in shallow water for relative bearings away from the broadside beams, particularly at higher frequencies. Finally, the MFP algorithm in conjunction with the ENNPP and M of N tracker are shown to perform well in the real ocean environment. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
5000|$|The northernmost {{and highest}} {{peak of the}} range is the 1469 m Mount Murchison {{overlooking}} the Buller River. The southern endpoint of the range is Mount Hutton (1400 m) above the Tiraumea Saddle. The higher Ella Range lies to the south. Other <b>peaks</b> include Mount <b>Pickering</b> (1249 m), Mount Cotton (1256 m), Mount Baring (1127 m), and Twins (1152 m). [...] The bush line is around 1350 m in this area, so only the two highest peaks are not covered in bush. There is a radio and television transmission mast on top of Mount Murchison.|$|R
