40|$|As {{part of a}} wider {{research}} programme of experimental archaeology at Calanais Farm, Isle of Lewis, Scotland, a number of experimental hearths were constructed, based on excavated evidence from the Late Iron Age houses at Bostadh, Lewis. Controlled and repeated burning of different fuel sources (well-humified <b>peat,</b> fibrous upper <b>peat,</b> <b>peat</b> turf and wood) was carried out {{over a number of}} burning episodes, each of three days duration. A range of mineral magnetic measurements, including remanences and the variation of susceptibility with high temperature, were taken from the resulting ash samples. The high temperature susceptibility measurements show that the fibrous upper <b>peat</b> and <b>peat</b> turf have a single magnetic component, with a drop in magnetic susceptibility at ca. 600 &# 176;C. In comparison the well-humified <b>peat</b> and wood have one, sometimes two, distinct magnetic components characterized by drops in susceptibility at ca. 330 and ca. 550 &# 176;C. Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed on the room temperature magnetic data. A biplot of the resulting two main variables distinguishes the well-humified <b>peat</b> and wood. Some overlap is observed between the fibrous upper <b>peat</b> and <b>peat</b> turf.
