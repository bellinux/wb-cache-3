40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{impact of}} serial lumbar {{punctures}} on association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and prognosis in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis; to explore time course and relationship of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> with neurological findings, CSF fungal burden, immune response, and CD 4 cell count. DESIGN: Evaluation of 163 HIV-positive ART-naive patients enrolled in three trials of amphotericin B-based therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in Thailand and South Africa. METHODS: Study protocols required four lumbar punctures with measurements of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{over the first}} 2 weeks of treatment and additional lumbar punctures if <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> raised. Fungal burden and clearance, CSF immune parameters, CD 4 cell count, neurological symptoms and signs, and outcome at 2 and 10 weeks were compared between groups categorized by <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> at cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients with higher baseline fungal burden had higher baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> High fungal burden appeared necessary but not sufficient for development of high <b>pressure.</b> Baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was not associated with}} CD 4 cell count, CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines, or altered mental status. Day 14 <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was associated with day 14 fungal burden. Overall mortality was 12 % (20 / 162) at 2 weeks and 26 % (42 / 160) at 10 weeks, with no significant differences between <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> groups. CONCLUSION: Studies are needed to define factors, in addition to fungal burden, associated with raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> Aggressive management of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> through repeated CSF drainage appeared to prevent any adverse impact of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> on outcome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. The results support increasing access to manometers in resource-poor settings and routine management of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in patients with cryptococcal meningitis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Shunting {{systems are}} {{implanted}} for draining cerebrospinal fluid to treat hydrocephalus, intracranial cysts, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Most shunt systems include a valve which regulates drainage. A differential pressure valve opens when intracranial pressure exceeds the valve’s <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> The difficulty with these valves is selecting and predicting {{the most suitable}} valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for the individual patient after insertion. Using a valve with a non-adjustable <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> requires surgery to change the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> Potentially, an adjustable valve, such as the Codman Hakim programmable valve, allows non-invasive valve pressure-adjustment for managing over- and underdrainage {{by being able to}} fine-tune the valve's <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> to the patient’s changing intracranial hydrodynamics. Objective: To evaluate the use of an adjustable valve in a consecutive, non-selected group of patients. To evaluate its reliance, spectrum of complications, use and effects of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> adjustments and economical impact. Results and conclusions: An adjustable valve has the advantage of enabling trans-cutaneous alterations of the valve's <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> as the patients’ clinical course changes during the postoperative period. Pressure-adjustment optimized treatment, and clinical outcome improved following the majority of adjustments. Subdural fluid collections could be managed with pressure-adjustment. The rate of shunt complications was similar to other studies. Valve malfunction was uncommon. Accidental pressure-resetting, other than that caused by magnetic resonance imaging, was rare. Avoided shunt revisions reduce cost. Because we cannot predict which patient will need pressure-adjustment, our preference is to use an adjustable valve for all conditions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Lumbar {{puncture}} is {{a procedure}} that at times can be difficult where it may take multiple attempts to obtain a fluid sample and an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> While {{it is recommended that}} the patient be placed in the lateral recumbent position, many physicians find that placing patients in an upright or sitting position provides an easier access. The theoretical concern is that obtaining an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in the sitting position may be altered. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if there is no difference in <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in cerebrospinal fluid in patients placed in a flexed lateral position vs. upright sitting position during lumbar puncture. Methods: 20 consenting patients were entered into a prospective, crossover study who required a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Opening pressure was measured in both recumbent and sitting positions.

40|$|Abstract Background The new Certas™ shunt for the {{treatment}} of hydrocephalus has seven standard pressure settings that according to the manufacturer range from 36 to 238 mmH 2 O, and an additional “Virtual Off” setting with an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> > 400 mmH 2 O. Information on actual pressure response and reliability of shunt performance is important in clinical application, especially the “Virtual Off” setting as a non-surgical replacement for shunt ligation. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the in-vitro hydrodynamic performance of the Certas™ shunt. Methods Six new Certas™ shunts with proximal and distal catheters were tested with an automated, computerized test system that raised the pressure from zero to a maximum pressure and back to zero at each valve setting. Opening pressure and flow resistance were determined. Results For settings 1 – 7 the measured <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> range was 26 to 247 mmH 2 O, and the mean change in <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for a one-step adjustment was between 33 and 38 mmH 2 O. For setting 8 (“Virtual Off”) the measured mean <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was 494 [*]±[*] 34 mmH 2 O (range 451 to 556 mmH 2 O). The mean outflow resistance was 7. 0 [*]mmHg/ml/min (outflow conductance 17. 9 μl/s/kPa). Conclusions The six shunts had similar characteristics and closely matched the manufacturer’s specifications for <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> at settings 1 – 7. The <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for the “Virtual Off” setting was nearly 500 mmH 2 O, which is 100 mmH 2 O higher than the manufacturer’s specification of “> 400 ” and should be functionally off for most patients with communicating hydrocephalus.

40|$|Amid {{concerns}} of global warming, {{it has become}} necessary to reduce the emissions produced by engines. One method of achieving this is by controlling the air/fuel mixture formed by the spray of the injector within the combustion chamber. In comparing previous experimental results and the equations which describe the spray structure disagreement was found, {{which is expected to}} be caused by having insufficient information of the injection pressure; a required input of the equation. The aim of this research is to predict this injection pressure by modelling a mechanical injector, and testing and modelling a common rail injector. The mechanical injector simulations show that the injection pressure is lower than the line and <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and is dependent on the number of discharge orifices, throttling condition and <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> of the injector. Consequently, the line and <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> are not sufficient approximations of the injection pressure and must not be used to predict spray properties. The simulations showed the injected flow rate is higher for a three hole injector at high engine loads and higher <b>opening</b> <b>pressures,</b> resulting in a more atomised and penetrating spray.

The etiology is split on 15 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, 9 patients with hydrocephalus malresorptivus, 9 patients with hypertensive hydrocephalus, 6 patients with secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus and one patient with pseudotumor cerebri. The primary <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> varied between 5 and 8 cm H 2 O, the gravitational unit was chosen depending on the body height of the patient. The clinical outcome according to the NPH-Recovery-Rate proves, that a total of 89, 3 % of the patients benefitted from a shunt therapy. According to the scale of Stein & Langfitt only 10, 8 % of the patients were able to manage their household on their own before the operation, after the operation the percentage increased to 67, 6 %. According to the scale of Black a total of 97, 3 % showed an improvement, 75, 7 % demonstrated an even very good or good postoperative developing. All in all the neuro-imaging showed a tendency to only a minimal reduction of the ventricle width. We found a correlation between the radiologically noticed reduction of the ventricle width and the clinical outcome according to Stein & Langfitt, {{but there was no}} correlation found between the reduction of the ventricle width and the clinical outcome based on the Kiefer-Score. We observed one malposition of the ventricle catheter and two shunt infections (5, 3 %) in terms of valve-unrelated complications. There were no obstructions of the valve. During the survey three patients died from their underlying disease independent from the shunt therapy. In terms of valve-related complications we observed overdrainage in 5 cases (13, 16 %, four hygromas and one subdural hematoma), of which two were regressing spontaneously. The other three patients were helped by adjusting the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> In 14 cases (36, 8 %) we observed a functional underdrainage. Of these 14 patients a considerable improvement of the pathology could be achieved in seven cases by adjusting the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> There were a total of 0, 73 adjustments of the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> per patient and - considered differently - 1, 5 adjustments per patient, whose <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was adjusted at least once. Concerning the clinical outcome - including the adjustments of the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> - 43, 2 % of our patients had a good or very good result immediately after the operation. After the adjustments the percentage increased to 75, 7 % (good or very good according to Black).

However an accurate comparison is not possible until now - on the one hand because of the still to small sample size, on the other hand because of the internationally non-standardized study-design and the different definitions.

40|$|AbstractDoppler echocardiographic transmitral peak early {{velocity}} normalized to the time-velocity integral during diastole {{is equivalent}} to volumetric peak filling rate normalized to stroke volume. To compare the pathophysiologic validity of normalized and nonnormalized peak early flow velocity, pulsed Doppler echocardiography with simultaneous high fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements was performed in 52 patients with coronary artery disease. Left ventricular loading conditions were changed by intravenous administration of norepinephrine in 15 patients and synthetic atrial natriuretic polypeptide in 15 others. Norepinephrine increased nonnormalized and normalized peak early flow velocities in association with significantly elevated end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> and decelerated the time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decline. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide did not change either nonnormalized or normalized peak early flow velocity, despite significant reductions in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and an accelerated time constant. Normalized peak early flow velocity showed the highest univariaite correlation with long-term change in mitral valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> (n = 52, r = 0. 67, p < 0. 0001). It provided a modest univariate correlation (n = 30, r = 0. 74, p < 0. 0001) with immediate change in mitral valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> during norepinephrine infusion, whereas this correlation was lower (n = 30, r = 0. 57. p < 0. 001) during polypeptide infusion. However, multivariate regression analysis relating normalized peak velocity with long- and short-term changes in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressures,</b> time constant and constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness improved the correlation coefficiepts (r = 0. 80 to 0. 85. all p < 0. 0001). In contrast, neither univariate nor multivariate correlations of nonnormalized velocity with long- and short-term changes in these hemodynamic variables were satisfactory. Thus, nonnormalized peak early flow velocity does not directly reflect underlying hemodynamic changes in humans. Normalization to mitral stroke volume clarifies the dependence of peak early flow velocity on the determinants of early diastolic filling. When left ventricular early diastolic filling is evaluated by Doppler echocardiography, normalized peak early flow velocity {{should be taken into}} consideration...|$|R

The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two {{remotely}} adjustable check-valves with an electrochemical {{release mechanism for}} implantable biomedical microsystems. These valves allow one to vary the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> set-point and flow resistance {{over a period of}} time. The first design consists of a micromachined check-valve array using a SU- 8 polymer structural layer deposited {{on the top of a}} gold sacrificial layer. The second design is based on a variable length cantilever beam structure with a gold sacrificial layer. The adjustable cantilever-beam structure is fabricated by gold thermo-compression bond of a thin silicon wafer over a glass substrate. In both designs, the evaporated gold can be electrochemically dissolved using a constant DC current via a telemetry link. In the first design the dissolution simply opens up individual outlets, while in the second design, gold anchors are sequentially dissolved hence increasing the effective length of the cantilever beam (reducing the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure).</b> A current density of 35 mA/cm(2) is used to dissolve the gold sacrificial layers. Both gravity and syringe-pump driven flow are used to characterize the valve performance. A multi-stage fluidic performance (e. g. flow resistance and <b>opening</b> <b>pressure)</b> is clearly demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{presents}} computational models {{to investigate the}} poststenting hemodynamic stresses and internal stresses over/within the diseased walls of coronary arteries which are in different states of atherosclerotic plaque. The finite element method is applied to build the axisymmetric models which include the plaque, arterial wall, and stent struts. The study {{takes into account the}} mechanical effects of the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and its association with the plaque severity and the morphology. The wall shear stresses and the von Mises stresses within the stented coronary arteries show their strong dependence on the plaque structure, particularly the fibrous cap thickness. Higher stresses occur in severely stenosed coronaries with a thinner fibrous cap. Large stress concentrations around the stent struts cause injury or damage to the vessel wall which is linked to the mechanism of restenosis. The in-stent restenosis rate is also highly dependent on the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure,</b> to the extent that stenosed artery is expanded, and geometry of the stent struts. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that the restenosis is to be viewed as a consequence of biomechanical design of a stent repeating unit, the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the severity and morphology of the plaque...|$|R
40|$|Background: Modern valves for the shunt-therapy of {{hydrocephalus}} {{reduce the}} risk of overdrainage but increase the risk of underdrainage. The valve system proGAV combines a gravitational unit with an adjustable differential pressure valve for a non-invasive regulation of the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> We evaluated if over- or underdrainage can effectively be regulated by means of a proGAV adjustment. Material and methods: We analysed the data of 114 consecutive patients (63. 2 % male, 36. 8 % female) aged between 15 and 93 years (55. 9  ±  17. 5 years) who underwent the implantation of a shunt with proGAV because of different etiologies: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH, 35. 1 %), posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (postHHC, 28. 1 %), hypertensive/pediatric hydrocephalus (HHC, 21. 1 %), secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus (SNPH, 10. 5 %), and pseudotumour cerebri (PTC, 5. 3 %). 22 patients (27. 1 %) had been revised after complications following the implantatation of a conventional valve system. The follow-up was 30. 8  ±  11. 5 months. Results: For the majority of patients we initially chose an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> of 5  cmH 2 O at the programmable unit except for the patients suffering from pseudotumour cerebri with an initial <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> up to 14  cmH 2 O. The initial <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> could be maintained in 53. 5 % of all patients during the entire observational period. In the remaining 46. 5 % the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was adjusted once to three times due to a primary overdrainage (11. 4 %) or underdrainage (35. 1 %). Despite of cautious adjustment settings some secondary underdrainages (n = 5) or overdrainages (n = 6) occured. All of them could be intercepted by repeated adjustments. The need for a consecutive adjustment of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was independent from patient parameters like height and weight and largely also from the hydrocephalus etiology. Radiologically 42. 6 % of patients showed no regression of their extended ventricles. However, the clinical results were excellent or good in 73. 6 % of patients, and only in 4. 4 % they were bad. There was no correlation between the clinical and the radiological results neither for the entire group nor for the subgroups of different hydrocephalus types. Conclusions: Similar to other valve systems the use of a proGAV valve may result in an overdrainage or functional underdrainage. These shunt complications are easy to treat by simple epicutaneous adjustments without the previously required revision surgery, particularly in overdrainages which are more dangerous as compared to underdrainage. The valve adjustment may result in a secondary under-/overdrainage, therefore in the majority of cases the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> should be regulated in small steps. Because of the frequent gap between clinical and radiological results and because of the small sample sizes of subgroups we cannot conclude which patients will benefit most of this adjustable hydrostatic valve. Prospective randomized multicenter studies with large numbers of cases are meaningful and necessary...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Some {{patients}} with SIH have fast CSF leaks requiring dynamic CTM for localization; however, patients generally undergo conventional CTM before a dynamic study. Our {{aim was to}} determine whether findings on head MR imaging, spine MR imaging, or <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements can predict fast spinal CSF leaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 151 consecutive patients referred for CTM to evaluate for spinal CSF leak. Head MR imaging was evaluated for diffuse dural enhancement and “brain sag, ” and spine MR imaging for presence of an extradural fluid collection. The <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded. The CTM was scored as no leak, slow leak localized on conventional CTM, or fast leak that required dynamic CTM. RESULTS: Fast CSF leaks were identified in 32 (21 %), slow leaks in 36 (24 %), and no leak in 83 (55 %) of 151 patients on initial CTM. There was significant association between spinal extra-arachnoid fluid on MR imaging and the presence of a fast leak (sensitivity 85 %, specificity 79 %, P. 0001). There was not significant association between fast leak and findings on head MR imaging (P. 27) or <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> (P. 30). CONCLUSIONS: If all {{patients with}} spinal extra-arachnoid CSF on MR imaging had been sent directly t...|$|R
