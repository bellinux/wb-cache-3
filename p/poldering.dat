Kats grew very slowly and was blighted by the plagues of 1603 to 1605 and 1650. By 1629 a windmill had been built and 30 years later in 1659 enough people were living there to establish a reformed church parish.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the nature and state of geomorphic environment changes occurred in a southwestern coastal river basin of Bangladesh over a period of three decades (1967 - 2003). The study concentrates on the Kholpetua river basin, which receive fresh water flow from Betna in the upstream and tidal flow in the middle from Morichapa and finally drains to the Bay of Bengal through Kapotakshi River. The whole Kholpetua basin may be divided into three distinct parts: fresh water upstream, brackish water middle part and saline lower part. Large-scale population increase, both in the up and middle stream section; infrastructure development, in the form of road network and introduction of HYV rice in the floodplain of Betna and shrimp farming on the brackish water have lead to the loss of both quality and extent of wetland resources in the basin area, endangering the geomorphological systematic balance in terms of input and output between upstream and downstream. A large section of Betna has dried-up, and most of the tributaries and distributaries of the Morichapa have been silted up, partly because of extensive <b>poldering</b> effect of the sub-basin. As a result, energy exchange (through tide) between basin plains and channels ways has lost vitally. Multi-spectral remote sensing data, in conjunction with topographical maps and ancillary data analysis reveals that throughout the basin, a wide range of anthropogenic interference have physically altered the characteristic ecosystem of the basin. Such physical alteration has been initiated with the <b>poldering</b> of middle brackish water part of the basin and later with the introduction of extensive shrimp cultivation. Attempt has been made to explore the linkage of upstream landuse activities and drainage alteration to the hydrological and geomorphological behavior of the downstream basin areas, so that ecological sensitivity of the basin may be understood...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} centuries the tidal regime of the Scheldt estuary has seriously changed. This {{is due to}} {{different}} natural processes and human interventions in the estuary. An important question for the safety management in the Scheldt estuary is how the safety level changes on a long term, {{taking into account the}} historical and present human impacts (such as <b>poldering,</b> enlargement, etc.) and natural changes (sea level rise). An important aspect from viewpoint of safety management is the change of the high water levels during the coming decades. The changes in hydrodynamics and morphology of the estuary are related to each other. Within this report an analysis of both tidal and topo-bathymetric characteristics in the Lower Sea Scheldt since 1900 has been performed.

40|$|In 1999, Flanders and The Netherlands {{agreed to}} set up a common {{strategy}} for managing the Scheldt River in its estuarine reach. In 2002, both parties signed a memorandum of understanding in which was defined a ‘Long Term Vision’ strategy and its objectives. One of these is the preservation in the Western Scheldt of a dynamic and complex flood and ebb channel network, the so-called ‘multi-channel system’. The present trend, a continuation of past natural morphological evolutions combined with human interference (<b>poldering,</b> dredging and other river works) may jeopardise this objective. An expert team appointed by the Port of Antwerp proposed the idea of morphological dredging for curbing this negative trend, aiming at steering the estuarine morphology. In a first phase, sediment from dredging works could be used to reshape sandbars where needed. One case study is discussed in this paper, the aim being to reconstruct the eroded tip of a sandbar at a bifurcation so that the flood and ebb flows would be perseved, a condition to maintain the multi-channel system in the reach. The strategy would not only cut back on the ongoing degradation of the ecological and morphological values of the estuary, but it could also possibly help reducing the quantity of material to be dredged on the crossings by increasing the scouring or self-dredging capacity of the flow. A diffuser-type device was used to disperse the dredged material in a controlled way in shallow water along the sandbar edges. In 2002 - 2003, the new disposal strategy has been investigated by Flanders Hydraulics Research as a pilot project (Plaat van Walsoorden). The research programme combined three tools: field measurements, physical scale models and 3 D numerical models. The results of the research work confirmed the feasibility of the idea. However, the Port of Antwerp Experts concluded that a real life (in situ) disposal test was required to give final proof of the feasibility of this new disposal strategy. At the end of 2004, 500, 000 m³ of sand was disposed at the seaward tip of the shoal of Walsoorden using a diffuser. The main idea was to modify the morphology of this sandbar by disposing dredged material very precisely. The amount of 500, 000 m³ was chosen because it is large enough to see an effect of the disposed sediment, while it is small enough to be reversible if something would go wrong. To evaluate the success of this in situ test, an extensive monitoring programme was set up, including bathymetric surveys, ecological monitoring, sediment tracing tests and sediment transport measurements. After one year of monitoring the disposed sediments, it can be concluded that the experiment is very successful. The morphological monitoring showed that almost 80 % of the disposed sediments is still on the disposal location after one year. The ecological monitoring did not reveal any significant negativeimpact, neither in the intertidal areas, nor in the subtidal areas. This in situ test confirmed the feasibility of the proposed disposal strategy. An estimated volume of 4 to 5 million m³ could be disposed here to reach the proposed objectives, representing {{more than half of the}} volume dredged yearly in the Western Scheldt...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The PhD {{thesis is}} {{inspired}} by the rapid rise in political attention on climate change from 2005 onwards, followed by the media hype known as ‘climategate’ and the subsequent fall in attention afterwards. The polarisation in the public debate between so-called activists and deniers shows that climate change is a classroom example of what scholars in policy and planning define as a wicked or unstructured problem. This type of problem is characterised by {{a wide variety of}} societal understandings or frames through which new knowledge is interpreted. Governing wicked problems is a tricky process and has a history of policy conflict and controversy. In this thesis, I aim to elucidate the process and outcomes of governing adaptation to climate change. I do so by focusing on the social interactions of public and private players in governance and how they develop meanings and related policy outcomes through their frame interactions. The thesis starts with the notion that adapting to the long-term and uncertain character of climate change results in a special type of governing, especially {{in the context of the}} little institutionalised policy domain and the wide variety of societal frames involved. Governing adaptation to climate change involves careful monitoring of policy direction, speed, and societal current in relation to scientific projections and societal sensemaking of what climate impacts might be ahead. Navigating climate change therefore metaphorically boils down to a form of dead reckoning, a systemised method of monitoring course, speed, and current through which sailors in the 15 th century used to navigate their ships into the unknown. Navigating hierarchically organised ships, however, is different from steering plural democratically organised societies. In policy sciences, this process of governing long-term policy issues in plural societies is traditionally defined as a dynamic process of both puzzling over what the issue means to society and powering to get things done. Puzzling and powering are broadly defined as interrelated; new meanings might alter actors’ positions and corresponding policy outcomes, and changing power positions might alter societal understandings of what is at stake. Processes of puzzling and powering are considered to vary across traditions of state organisation and related institutional arrangements. In the climate adaptation governance literature however, the governance process is differently defined. Scholars define governance of adaptation to climate change as a matter of getting the knowledge system right to design the right policies, and getting the institutional system right to enforce the policies. This static approach does not show an interrelated or dynamic understanding of actor-centred processes based on sensemaking and positioning. Other scholars define climate adaptation as a matter of developing the right knowledge, creating legitimacy, or enhancing justness through deliberative or participatory approaches to governing, but seem to neglect the need for power organisation to get things done. To be able to contribute to both the policy sciences and the climate adaptation governance literature, the thesis opens up the black box of climate adaptation governance by zooming in on the actual policy deliberations in four concrete governance cases in different institutional arrangements and traditions of state organisation. To do so, I propose frame interactions as a means for better understanding the traditionally defined interplay between processes of puzzling over meaning and powering over positions in different institutional contexts. This results in the following central research question: In what way do frame interactions construct interplaying processes of puzzling over meaning and powering over positions in different institutional arrangements occupied with governing societal adaptation to climate change? Research design To investigate and compare the frame interaction processes in different institutional arrangements and state traditions, I started with a distant view towards frame developments in official water policy proposals over time. Using longitudinal frame analysis, I discussed these developments against the backdrop of a rise and fall in societal attention to climate change. Subsequently, I systematically assessed the scholarly approaches in making sense of climate adaptation governance. Inspired by both the developments in official policy framing over time and the different theoretical approaches to governance of adaptation to climate change, I opened the black box of frame developments and frame interactions in concrete governance practices. I adopted explorative case study research to get an in-depth understanding of the governance processes. By participatory observation, semi-structured interviews, and longitudinal frame analysis of policy deliberations in four different case studies, I was able to get in-depth understanding of governance processes in different institutional contexts. Because my research was embedded in the Dutch research programme Knowledge for Climate, which centres on climate adaptation governance challenges in the Dutch context, I took this Dutch context as my point of departure. The lowland delta nature of most of the Dutch territory makes the country potentially vulnerable to climate- related issues. Climate change poses governance challenges to delta regions in general, for which the Dutch delta might be an interesting illustration and an interesting case for academic inspiration and cross-national comparison. In terms of institutional arrangements, Dutch adaptation to climate change empirically shows continuities as well as discontinuities with the traditional Dutch cornerstone of dealing with collective action problems through <b>poldering.</b> In two selected case studies, climate adaptation is mainstreamed in existing <b>poldering</b> approaches and follows what is traditionally defined as a neo-corporatist state tradition. In neo-corporatism, a limited number of traditionally defined organised interests negotiate with the state in an institutionalised fashion. One selected case study shows signs of discontinuity with this traditional approach, allowing for more ad hoc deliberation with a much wider and less organised array of stakeholders and societal actors, known as deliberative governance. This approach follows the pleas in the contemporary climate adaptation governance literature for more participation. To understand the implications of state traditions for framing processes, I compare the selected case studies with a fourth selected case study of a similar deliberative governance initiative in the pluralist state tradition of the UK. Pluralism entails less state involvement in policymaking, but more central coordination of societally initiated policy actions through national legislation. Findings From a distant view, I show how policy frames evolve over time as an ongoing long-term conversation between policy proposals. Zooming in on four case studies reveals a wide array of frames in governance processes, which can be classified according to the scales addressed in the frames, and the nature of the issues framed. In relation to framing the nature of the issue, two archetypical frames can be defined: technical frames and political frames. Frame interactions shape learning processes, but due to the inclusion and exclusion effect of frames they can never be viewed without more conflict-based notions on policymaking. Counterintuitively, technical frames appear to change power positions, but, in the same counterintuitive way, political frames allow for puzzling over roles and responsibilities as well. Therefore, the thesis shows how meaning alters power positions and frame interactions affect substantial and relational outcomes. I show how these insights complicate what I define as the system assessment approach, which is dominant in the climate adaptation governance literature. Frames appear to do things in climate adaptation governance processes, from which I conclude that frames navigate climate adaptation. In addition to frame interactions as a puzzling and powering interplay, I show how a second interplay might be defined between institutions and frame interactions. Different institutional arrangements yield different frame interactions and outcomes. Institutional arrangements determine the rules of what can be defined as a framing game over wicked problems. Institutions also determine who is playing what framing game and therefore determine player dependencies. Institutions interplay with frame interactions, and may create the preconditions for effectively navigating the wide array of frames in climate adaptation governance. Without institutional demarcation of roles and responsibilities, the framing game might allow for new players and knowledge, but risks becoming gratuitous. In little institutionalised deliberative governance contexts without central coordination, frame interactions are likely to yield a dominant self-referential technical framing which empowers experts and promises technical efficiency solutions to a wicked problem. These contexts might yield the preconditions for what I define as a political bystander effect in deliberative governance. In addition, I show how state traditions play a role in what institutional arrangements yield what type of frame interactions. Therefore, I conclude that institutional arrangements in combination with state traditions play a role in how the variety of climate adaptation frames can be navigated. These findings point towards my most important recommendations. For future research, I would suggest further investigation of: (1) the possible emergence of a dominant technical framing in deliberative governance; (2) the extent to which this framing might point towards what other scholars have labelled self-reinforcing frames; (3) related political bystander effects in specific combinations of governance arrangements, policy issues, and state traditions. In relation to that, my most important recommendations to policymakers are: (1) be aware of the variety of frames in governance, (2) be aware of state traditions, (3) choose the right institutional arrangement, and (4) be modest in depoliticising wicked problems. In general, my recommendation would be to frame climate adaptation as an ongoing process of dead reckoning, which allows for explaining uncertain events, anticipating changing societal currents, and learning-by-doing.  ...|$|E

To maintain a stable water table in the <b>polders,</b> the surplus of relatively clean rainwater has to be pumped away during the cold seasons into canals or rivers, which are located on a higher level. During the summer relatively polluted water from these waterways is led into the <b>polders</b> to top up the declining water levels. This procedure leads to various problems regarding water quantity and water quality. The described existing system is not adaptable to climate change and includes the risk of flooding, particularly from torrential rain. Therefore it is crucial to develop, preferably self-sufficient, rainwater management systems in the <b>polders.</b> They should allow the fluctuation of the water levels inside the <b>polders</b> for seasonal storage and flood control. The described concept is adopted in the present water policy in the Netherlands as well as in research and recent urban development projects in Dutch <b>polders.</b> UrbanismArchitectur...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of {{flooding}} disasters, water boards called waterschap (when situated more inland) or hoogheemraadschap (near the sea, mainly used in the Holland region) were set up to maintain {{the integrity of the}} water defences around <b>polders,</b> maintain the waterways inside a <b>polder,</b> and control the various water levels inside and outside the <b>polder.</b> Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such they are the oldest democratic institution in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain <b>polder</b> integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of third way politics—the <b>Polder</b> Model.|$|R
5000|$|The Dutch have a {{long history}} of {{reclamation}} of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 <b>polders</b> nationwide. About half the total surface area of <b>polders</b> in north-west Europe is in the Netherlands. The first embankments in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first <b>polders</b> were constructed in the 11th century.|$|R
