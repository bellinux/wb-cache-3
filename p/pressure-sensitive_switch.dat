5000|$|Monkgomery has a rear {{opening that}} allows {{manipulation}} of mouth movements by hand. This opening also gave {{access to a}} <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> {{on the top of}} the mouth and a solid mass at the bottom to engage the switch mechanism. Engagement triggers the electronic speech integrated circuit TMS5110ANL. Speech consisted of a set of 400 pre-recorded words (100 phrases), in voiceover format (performed by Bill Cochran), stored in Texas Instrument CM62060N2L, CM62059N2L, E7CL04N2L ICs. The words played out on an 8 Ω, 0.25 watt F.S.T F05702 mono speaker. The board contained a never-used nine pin edge connector for expansion modules. These parts were built into a brown plastic box with a 4-AA battery holder. The brown box was zipped inside the back of the monkey's back with two snaps for fastening inside and a removable eight pin connector cable for interactions with mouth switch, [...] "tickle" [...] sensors, right ear and right foot.|$|E
50|$|Around 1946, {{the first}} system of traffic warning signal lights on school buses {{was used in}} Virginia. This system {{comprised}} a pair of sealed beam lights similar to those employed in American headlamps of the time. Instead of colorless glass lenses, the warning lights utilized red lenses. A motorized rotary switch applied power alternately to the red lights mounted at {{the left and right}} of the front and rear of the bus, creating a wig-wag effect. Activation was typically through a mechanical switch attached to the door control. However, on some buses (such as Gillig's Transit Coach models and the Kenworth-Pacific School Coach) activation of the roof warning lamp system was {{through the use of a}} <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> on a manually controlled stop paddle lever located to the left of the driver's seat below the window. Whenever the pressure was relieved by extending the stop paddle, the electric current was activated to the relay. Plastic lenses for warning lights were developed in the 1950s, though sealed beams—now with colorless glass lenses — were still most commonly used behind them until the mid-2000s, when light-emitting diodes (LEDs) began supplanting the sealed beams.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a flame-radiation-powered trigger device to explosively activate suppression barriers to quench gas and coal dust explosions. The major component of the device is a silicon solar panel, which converts radiation from the developing explosion into electrical energy to initiate an electric detonator, which releases an extinguishing agent into the advancing flame front. Solar panels that are rated to produce 20 W of electrical power when exposed to the sunlight are producing about 200 W when exposed to a full-scale dust explosion. The solar panel is electrically isolated from the detonator by a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> until {{the arrival of the}} precursor pressure pulse, which always precedes a deflagration. This combination of pressure arming and flame-powered photogenerator prevents false barrier activation and requires no external power supply...|$|E
40|$|Auditory {{communication}} displays {{within the}} NextGen data link system may use multiple synthetic speech messages replacing traditional ATC and company communications. The design of an interface for selecting amongst multiple incoming messages can impact both performance (time to select, audit and release a message) and preference. Two design factors were evaluated: physical <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>switches</b> versus flat panel "virtual switches", {{and the presence}} or absence of auditory feedback from switch contact. Performance with stimuli using physical switches was 1. 2 s faster than virtual switches (2. 0 s vs. 3. 2 s); auditory feedback provided a 0. 54 s performance advantage (2. 33 s vs. 2. 87 s). There was no interaction between these variables. Preference data were highly correlated with performance...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{geometrical}} {{approach to}} treat the constraints associated with the continuum description of uniaxial nematic elastomers, we develop the general constitutive framework for such materials. We also provide a variational formulation of equilibrium and use that formulation to discuss the response of a tubular specimen pressurized internally. The analysis demonstrates {{the existence of a}} pair of disconnected solution branches. Of these branches, one is stable at low pressure and the other is stable at high pressure. An intemediate regime within which both branches are stable indicates that during loading the specimen may undergo a discontinuous jump from one solution branch to another and thus suggests the possibility of using nematic elastomers for <b>pressure-sensitive</b> optical <b>switches.</b> published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} three {{different}} methods of gait event detection (toe-off and heel strike) using miniature linear accelerometers and angular velocity transducers {{in comparison to}} using standard <b>pressure-sensitive</b> foot <b>switches.</b> Detection was performed with normal and spinal-cord injured subjects. The detection of end contact (EC), normally toe-off, and initial contact (IC) normally, heel strike was based on either foot linear accelerations or foot sagittal angular velocity or shank sagittal angular velocity. The results showed that all three methods were as accurate as foot switches in estimating times of IC and EC for normal gait patterns. In spinal-cord injured subjects, shank angular velocity was significantly less accurate (p < 0. 02). We conclude that detection based on foot linear accelerations or foot angular velocity can correctly identify the timing of IC and EC events in both normal and spinal-cord injured subjects...|$|R
