40|$|This article {{examines}} how politics and science interacted {{against a background}} of uncertainty to shape policy in the case of environmental contamination by <b>polybrominated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PBB)</b> in Michigan. In 1973, between 500 and 1, 000 pounds of the flame retardant PBB were accidentally shipped and used instead of the dairy feed additive magnesium oxide, resulting in the widespread contamination of animal feeds, animals, and human food products. The contamination was initially perceived as the private trouble of a single farmer. The problem next became a public issue as public and private institutions grappled with questions of illness, safety, and disposal. To gain influence over those institutions, dissatisfied individuals and groups then turned the PBB contamination into a political controversy. The final section of the present article analyzes how science and politics interacted in: the ways bureaucratic organizations defined the three problems of contamination; the role political controversy played in redefining problems and influencing policy; and the political roles of scientists in controversies over environmental contamination...|$|E

Serum PBB levels were related to the quarantine status of the farm but not to the method of invitation into the study.

A quantification technique based on selected ion monitoring of bromine anions, obtained in negative chemical ionization, permitted determination of 10 - 35 pg of individual PBB congener per mL serum, a 20 -fold improvement over electron capture gas chromatography. An in vitro spiked system was established and shown to be a representative model of environmentally contaminated blood. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric quantification determined that the distribution of PBB among plasma, erythrocytes, mononucleocytes and polymorphonucleocytes was 89 : 9 :less than 1 :less than 1. In plasma 80 % of the PBB was bound to apolipoproteins B and A in a 3 : 1 ratio. No preferential absorption of PBB congeners was found in the blood compartments suggesting that changes in the relative abundances of PBB congeners observed in longitudinal studies on Michigan subjects reflect differences in excretion rates or metabolism.

DNA, RNA, and protein accumulation rates were not affected by a 4 -hr previous maternal administration either at the beginning or following cultivation. At the beginning of cultivation for embryos exposed to PBB 24 hr before dissection, {{there was a significant}} reduction in DNA and total embryonic protein but RNA values were not affected. At 24 hr cultivation, protein values were no longer significantly different. DNA values remained significantly lower throughout culture.

After 42 hr in culture, the only significant anatomical differences were a {{reduction in the number of}} embryos developing anterior limb buds and a decrease in the number of somites added.

This study was designed to determine if this increase in intestinal and hepatic microsomal enzyme activity affected the hepatic response to <b>polybrominated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PBB).</b> After three weeks of consuming either a semipurified or 25 % cauliflower leaf-supplemented diet (CLD), male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained for an additional 20 days on their respective diets containing either 0, 1, or 50 ppm PBB. A significant decrease in body weights, but not feed efficiency, was observed over all levels of PBB in animals consuming CLD compared to semipurified diets; {{consumption of}} up to 50 ppm of PBB had no effect on body weights with either diet. Relative liver weights (RLW), hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), N- and O-demethylase, as well as intestinal AHH were all increased in CLD-consuming animals before the addition of PBB. While PBB supplementation alone resulted in increased RLW, hepatic AHH, N- and O-demethylase, microsomal protein, and cytochrome P- 450, rats consuming cauliflower diets + PBB had even higher RLW and N- and O-demethylase activity and microsomal protein concentrations. Hepatic PBB residue and total hepatic lipids were significantly reduced in CLD groups receiving 50 ppm PBB.
