5|$|Agnes Fay Morgan (May 4, 1884 – July 20, 1968) was an American chemist and academic. She was the {{longtime}} {{chair of the}} home economics program at the University of California. Her program was strongly grounded in science, and students admitted into the program were required to have a level of science education that was not typical of home economics programs at the time. Morgan {{was one of the}} earliest married female college <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1934 of a {{professor}} of technical inorganic chemistry at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, Tronstad was appointed his successor on 17 April 1936, effective from 1 May. At the time, {{he was one of}} the youngest <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> Norway. He was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, and in early 1940 he became vice president of the Norwegian Chemical Society. During his short scientific career, Tronstad penned about eighty scientific publications, including fourteen on heavy water-related topics.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{position}} as a professor was at Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1963. The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues {{because she had a}} husband with a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than twenty female law <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
50|$|She {{then joined}} the Department of Computer Science at Texas A&M University as an {{assistant}} <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 1995. She was promoted to associate <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 2000, to <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 2004, and to Unocal <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 2011.|$|R
50|$|Adler {{returned}} to the University of Wisconsin-Madison to join {{the faculty of the}} Departments of Biochemistry and Genetics as an assistant <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 1960. He was promoted to associate <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 1963 and became <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 1966. He became an emeritus <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 1997.|$|R
25|$|At Berkeley, {{he rose to}} be Assistant <b>Professor</b> <b>in</b> 1891, Associate <b>Professor</b> <b>in</b> 1904, <b>Professor</b> <b>in</b> 1913, and {{was named}} Emeritus Professor upon his {{retirement}} in 1930.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the major}} {{accounting}} scandals, new reforms, regulations, {{and calls for}} increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior. By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve {{the credibility of the}} accounting profession. Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> educating students.|$|E
5|$|In late 1937, Stalin {{appointed}} Khrushchev {{as head of}} the Communist Party in Ukraine, and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, {{again the}} Ukrainian capital, in January 1938. Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated. All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced. During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty.|$|E
5|$|The {{succeeding}} year, {{the only}} time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement. Members of the senior class had decided {{to make fun of}} the <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> the Green Bag—City College's year book since 1896. When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the Green Bag and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, {{became a member of the}} school board in 1926.|$|E

25|$|Pieri {{was totally}} {{dedicated}} {{to science and}} teaching. He was an untiring worker, honest, and of a singular modesty. When, some twenty years ago, the <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> Italy agitated for higher salaries, Pieri declared that their salaries were already above the work they did and their merit.|$|E

The well-respected, German philologist, professor of ancient languages Kurt von Fritz praised Carathéodory, saying that from him one could learn an endless amount {{about the old}} and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics. Fritz had numerous philosophical discussions with Carathéodory.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{was at its}} founding granted four faculties: law, theological, medicine and philosophy. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards {{the end of the}} 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> the early days were Samuel Pufendorf, a juridical historian; and Canutus Hahn and Kristian Papke in philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Within the report, <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> {{economics}} Ginsburgh and Weber further {{show that}} of the Brussels' residents, 95% declared they can speak French, 59% Dutch, and 41% know the non-local English.

In each region, Belgium's third official language, German, is notably less known than those.|$|E

25|$|Lang {{engaged in}} several efforts to {{challenge}} anyone he believed was spreading misinformation or misusing science or mathematics {{to further their}} own goals. He attacked the 1977 Survey of the American Professoriate, an opinion questionnaire that Seymour Martin Lipset and E. C. Ladd had sent to thousands of college <b>professors</b> <b>in</b> the United States, accusing it of containing numerous biased and loaded questions. This led to a public and highly acrimonious conflict.|$|E
