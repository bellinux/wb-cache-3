5000|$|The <b>principal</b> <b>ray</b> or {{chief ray}} (sometimes {{known as the}} b ray) in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts {{at the edge of}} the object, and passes through the center of the {{aperture}} stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. As such chief rays are equivalent to the rays in a pinhole camera. The distance between the chief ray and the optical axis at an image location defines the size of the image. The marginal and chief rays together define the Lagrange invariant, which characterizes the throughput or etendue of the optical system. Some authors define a [...] "principal ray" [...] for each object point. The <b>principal</b> <b>ray</b> starting at a point on the edge of the object may then be called the marginal <b>principal</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{sagittal}} ray or transverse ray from an off-axis object {{point is}} a ray that propagates in the plane that is perpendicular to the meridional plane and contains the <b>principal</b> <b>ray.</b> Sagittal rays intersect the pupil along a line that is perpendicular to the meridional plane for the ray's object point and passes through the optical axis. If the axis direction is defined to be the z axis, and the meridional plane is the y-z plane, sagittal rays intersect the pupil at yp=0. The <b>principal</b> <b>ray</b> is both sagittal and meridional. All other sagittal rays are skew rays.|$|E

40|$|An all [...] {{reflective}} and unobstructed optical relay {{to convey}} light from one real image {{to a second}} one can be obtained using two off [...] axis parabolae. It has been empirically stated that, when the <b>principal</b> <b>rays</b> of the optical relay lie in the same plane, the optimal configuration is given by a simple relationship between the magnification factor and the off [...] axis angles of the parabolae.

Its {{founding}} <b>principal</b> <b>Ray</b> Stanton {{set up a}} very different kind of school with no uniform, no bells (except to mark the end of breaks), no formal roll call classes and no formal assemblies. His education theory was to treat students as adults, in an attempt to prepare them for life. However, the school has moved away from these ideas since Mr. Stanton's retirement.|$|E
5000|$|A point O (fig. 2) at {{a finite}} {{distance}} from the axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced if the pencil of rays issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil. It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil {{does not meet the}} refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point). Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the axis of the pencil or <b>principal</b> <b>ray,</b> it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two focal lines, which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the <b>principal</b> <b>ray</b> and the axis of the system, i.e. in the first principal section or meridional section, and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section. We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focusing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O" [...] are separately formed (in neighboring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O" [...] a circle of least confusion. The interval O'O", termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the <b>principal</b> <b>ray</b> OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view. Two astigmatic image surfaces correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the focal lines of the first kind, on the other those of the second. Systems in which the two astigmatic surfaces coincide are termed anastigmatic or stigmatic.|$|E
50|$|The {{two species}} are morphologically very similar, but several {{distinguishing}} characters are seen, {{such as the}} number of longitudinal scales, <b>principal</b> <b>rays</b> in the dorsal and anal fins, and shape of eggs. Also, rosy bitterling has a silvery-white area anteriorly (white lines) on the ventral fin, but R. smithii does not. In comparison, the ventral fin of R. smothii is a dark color. Another notable difference is body size. R. smithii does not commonly exceed 60 mm in length, whereas rosy bitterling males are larger than 80 mm and females of the species commonly exceed 60 mm.|$|R

50|$|By {{opening the}} stop wider, similar {{deviations}} arise for lateral points as have been already discussed for axial points; {{but in this}} case they are much more complicated. The course of the rays in the meridional section is no longer symmetrical to the <b>principal</b> <b>ray</b> of the pencil; and on an intercepting plane there appears, instead of a luminous point, a patch of light, not symmetrical about a point, and often exhibiting a resemblance to a comet having its tail directed towards or away from the axis. From this appearance it takes its name. The unsymmetrical form of the meridional pencil—formerly the only one considered—is coma in the narrower sense only; other errors of coma have been treated by Arthur König and Moritz von Rohr, and later by Allvar Gullstrand.|$|E

5000|$|The Hoffman-Boston Program (founded in 1972) and the Woodlawn Program (founded in 1971), {{contained}} {{junior high}} and high school programs respectively, which both embraced the idea of alternative education. Originally, Hoffman-Boston had some 169 students. Woodlawn had 69 students, grades 11 and 12, in its first year of operation, adding 10th grade and expanding to some 169 students the second year. Donald Brandewie was the founding principal of Hoffman-Boston and served for three years, after which Margery Edson became principal. Woodlawn, which was then a haven for [...] "anti-establishment" [...] types, had no <b>principal.</b> <b>Ray</b> Anderson served as Head Teacher and served as administrator for the program. With dwindling school populations in Arlington County in the mid-1970s, there was a belief that 9th grade should be moved up from the (then) Junior High Schools to the High Schools. This move would have impacted negatively on the two programs, so a movement started to merge, which was ordered by the School Board to take place in the fall. After a year of careful planning, discussion, and hard work by administration, staff, students, and alumni of the two programs, a comprehensive merger plan and combined philosophy was adopted, and this document served as the [...] "blueprint" [...] for the initial years of the combined program. The two schools joined in the former Stratford Junior High School building on Vacation Lane in the fall of 1979. (In an unrelated note, Stratford Junior High School was the first racially integrated school in Arlington, bringing an end to [...] "Massive Resistance" [...] in the state in the 1960s).

50|$|This {{aberration}} {{is quite}} distinct {{from that of}} the sharpness of reproduction; in unsharp, reproduction, the question of distortion arises if only parts of the object can be recognized in the figure. If, in an unsharp image, a patch of light corresponds to an object point, the center of gravity of the patch may be regarded as the image point, this being the point where the plane receiving the image, e.g., a focusing screen, intersects the ray passing through the middle of the stop. This assumption is justified if a poor image on the focusing screen remains stationary when the aperture is diminished; in practice, this generally occurs. This ray, named by Abbe a <b>principal</b> <b>ray</b> (not {{to be confused with the}} principal rays of the Gaussian theory), passes through the center of the entrance pupil before the first refraction, and the center of the exit pupil after the last refraction. From this it follows that correctness of drawing depends solely upon the principal rays; and is independent of the sharpness or curvature of the image field. Referring to fig. 4, we have O'Q'/OQ = a' tan w'/a tan w = 1/N, where N is the scale or magnification of the image. For N to be constant for all values of w, a' tan w'/a tan w must also be constant. If the ratio a'/a be sufficiently constant, as is often the case, the above relation reduces to the condition of Airy, i.e. tan w'/ tan w= a constant. This simple relation (see Camb. Phil. Trans., 1830, 3, p. 1) is fulfilled in all systems which are symmetrical with respect to their diaphragm (briefly named symmetrical or holosymmetrical objectives), or which consist of two like, but different-sized, components, placed from the diaphragm in the ratio of their size, and presenting the same curvature to it (hemisymmetrical objectives); in these systems tan w' / tan w = 1.|$|E
