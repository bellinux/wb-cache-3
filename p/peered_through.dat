25|$|In March 1909, Roose {{travelled}} with Wales to play Ireland in a British Home Championship match. He {{appeared at}} Liverpool station {{with one hand}} heavily bandaged, telling the waiting press that he had broken two fingers but would nevertheless play in the match. Roose's Welsh team-mate Billy Meredith, suspecting trickery, <b>peered</b> <b>through</b> the keyhole of the goalkeeper's hotel room soon after their arrival in Belfast and saw his friend remove the bandage and wiggle his fingers {{with no sign of}} discomfort. News of Roose's disability having spread through the city, a huge and expectant crowd turned out next day in the hope of witnessing an Irish victory. Instead Wales won the game 3–2, Roose himself playing superbly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{apparatus}} used in {{the colour}} vision experiments is depicted in Fig. 1. [...] It was constructed by joining a 5-foot box (AK) with a 2-foot box (KN) at a 100-degree angle. [...] A mirror at M reflects light coming through the opening at BC towards a lens at L. [...] Two equilateral prisms at P diffract light coming from the three slits at X, Y, and Z. [...] This illuminated the prisms with {{the combination of the}} spectral colors created by the diffraction of the light from the slits. [...] This light was also visible through the lens at L. [...] The observer then <b>peered</b> <b>through</b> the slit at E while the operator adjusted the position and width of each slit at X, Y, and Z until the observer could not distinguish the prism light from the pure white light reflected by the mirror. [...] The position and width of each slit was then recorded.|$|E
