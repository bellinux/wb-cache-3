40|$|Recenty, {{polyethylene}} pots(PP) {{present a}} significant environmental issue for waste disposal. To develop bedding plant production system without PP, properties of compacted medium hardened by heat fusion polyester fiber were investigated. Effects of irrigation methods {{on the growth}} of vegetative propagated petunia grown in medium without PP were investigated. The effect of medium type was not as significant as the difference in water loss per pot. Water loss per <b>pot</b> of <b>medium</b> without PP was about two times greater than medium held in PP. No compacted medium disintegrated easily without root-ball formation, and in 20 days after cutting about half of non-compacted medium had disintegrated. Compacted medium did not disintegrate before rooting. Medium type did not significantly affect rooting rates, plant heights, leaf numbers and fresh weights when transplanted to medium. Also, cell or <b>pot</b> <b>medium</b> type did not significantly affect plant heights, flower numbers, leaf numbers and fresh weights. Non-compacted medium without PP easily disintegrated with overhead irrigation. Subirrigation and much overhead irrigation had similar effect on growth when planted in containers. However, less overhead irrigation had significantly lower growth. Moreover, in less overhead irrigation, non-compacted medium without PP had remarkably lower growth than compacted medium without PP. In, conclusions, compacted medium without PP {{did not affect the}} growth of bedding plants whenever water and nutrient regime was well regulated. Compacted <b>pot</b> <b>medium</b> was easy to transplant since it did not disintegrate. Therefore, it was considered practical and feasible to use compacted medium without PP for bedding plant production...|$|R

40|$|Water {{deficiency}} stress as {{the most}} important abiotic stress {{plays an important role in}} the yield suppression of plants worldwide. Considering physiological indices to improve drought resistance is of paramount importance. The objective of present study was to evaluate the effects of different irrigation intervals (irrigation after 5, 7, 9 and 11 days) and rates of superabsorbent polymer (Nil, 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4 and 0. 5 percent of <b>pot</b> <b>medium</b> weight) on some physiological parameters of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plant under greenhouse condition. The study carried out at College of Agriculture, Ilam University during 2009 - 2010 using a factorial layout in randomized complete blocks design (RCBD) with three replications. Statistical analysis showed significant effects of the irrigation and superabsorbent polymer on total yield and plant physiological parameters including leaf relative water content (RWC), water use efficiency (WUE), total soluble solids (TSS), chlorophyll, proline and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In drought conditions total yield, RWC, WUE and chlorophyll a reduced but MDA accumulation, proline content and TSS increased. Application of superabsorbent polymer significantly caused increasing of total yield, RWC, WUE, chlorophyll a and decreasing of MDA content, proline and TSS. Our results showed that superabsorbent polymers can absorb and retain extremely large amounts of water and decreased adverse effects of drought stress on the plants...|$|R

50|$|Leaf cutting is {{typically}} used once rosettes which have already flowered, {{in which case}} they and will no longer grow. Whole leaves can be cut from the rosette and set aside for several days to allow the cut to dry. At this point the leaf can be inserted cut-side down into moist porous <b>potting</b> <b>medium</b> to root. Over time, the leaf will produce roots and a stolon from the cut which will bear a new plant at its tip. Since variegation is produced through rare somatic mutations in the apical meristem, this is the preferred method for generating variegated specimens due to the volume of leaves which can be rooted simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|Coir {{does provide}} a {{suitable}} substrate for horticultural {{use as a}} soilless <b>potting</b> <b>medium.</b> The material's high lignin content is longer-lasting, holds more water, and does not shrink off {{the sides of the}} pot when dry allowing for easier rewetting. This light media has advantages and disadvantages that can be corrected with the addition of the proper amendment such as coarse sand for weight in interior plants like Draceana. Nutritive amendments should also be considered. Calcium and magnesium will be lacking in coir potting mixes, so a naturally good source of these nutrients is dolomitic lime which contains both. pH is of utmost importance as coir pith tends to have a high pH after some months of use, resulting in plant stunting and multiple deficiencies. Coir has as well the disavantage of being extremely sensitive to the Leucocoprinus greenhouse fungus. The addition of beneficial microbes to the coir media have been successful in tropical green house conditions and interior spaces as well.

No carnivorous plant should ever be fed mammalian meat - this will result not only in an unpleasant smell but also the probable rotting of the pitcher and potential death of the plant. The digestive enzymes present have not evolved to handle large prey items, and the rotting material gives opportunistic bacteria and fungi a chance to take hold.|$|E
50|$|Sinclair also {{corresponded with}} Sir James Edward Smith, {{founder of the}} Linnean Society, about various plants. By 1823 he was a Fellow of the Horticultural Society where he read a paper on the Woburn {{perennial}} kale. On 26 March 1824 he became {{a fellow of the}} Linnean Society, having been elected by Joseph Sabine and the Duke of Bedford. In 1822 the Duke of Bedford had begun a comprehensive collection of exotic and indigenous heaths as a way of recuperating from a very severe illness. In his Introduction to Hortus ericaeus Woburnensis which was published in February 1825 the Duke states that the collection was completed under the superintendence of his former gardener, George Sinclair. In Hortus Woburnensis, written later by Sinclair's successor James Forbes, the design of the heath parterres at Woburn is also attributed to Sinclair, and {{in a letter to the}} Duke, Sir George Hayter, who did the illustrations for Hortus ericaeus, made reference to Sinclair as having shown him around the greenhouse and parterres and selecting the specimens to be illustrated. To find the best possible growing conditions for the collection of heaths Sinclair began collecting different types of heath soils and analysing their constituents. After several years of systematic investigation he concluded that they were made up mainly of humus, which derived from decayed leaves, and sand. He also collected calcareous soils from around Luton and Dunstable and experimented in mixing them with various proportions of peat and ashes to try to find a <b>potting</b> <b>medium</b> suitable for the more exotic specimens of heaths. However, this proved unsuccessful, and in Hortus ericaeus … he recommended a natural heath soil for the growing of different species. By now Sinclair's brother, John, was working at Loddiges of Hackney where experimental work was being carried out in growing exotic species and in hybridisation. Sinclair purchased some of the Erica in the Woburn collection from here as well as personally collecting specimens from nurseries at Tooting (possibly William Rollison's Springfield Nursery), New Cross, Fulham, Woking, from George Whitworth of Acre House at Claxby by Normanby in Lincolnshire, and the Vineyard Nursery at Hammersmith, owned by James Lee and Lewis Kennedy. He also travelled to Southampton, where he bought hardy heaths from William Bridgewater Page, and to Bristol, where he made purchases of Cape Heaths from John Miller.|$|E

Inoculation of potted banana by drenching potting mix with a conidial suspension, consisting mostly of microconidia, few macroconidia and no chlamydospores, generated from one-quarter-strength potato dextrose agar + streptomycin sulfate, resulted in inconsistent infection. When a conidial suspension that consisted of all three spore types, microconidia, macroconidia and chlamydospores, prepared from spores generated on carnation leaf agar was used, all plants became infected, indicating that the spore type present in conidial suspensions may contribute to inconsistency of infection. Inconsistency of infection was not due to loss of virulence of the pathogen in culture. Millet grain precolonised by Foc {{as a source of}} inoculum resulted in consistent infection between replicate plants. Sorghum was not a suitable grain for preparation of inoculum as it was observed to discolour roots and has the potential to stunt root growth, possibly due to the release of phytotoxins.
