5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me in {{many ways}} was a pivotal film for the Bond franchise, and was plagued since its {{conception}} by many problems. The first was the departure of Bond producer Harry Saltzman, who was forced to sell his half of the Bond film franchise in 1975 for £20million. Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious promise and consequently was struggling through <b>personal</b> <b>financial</b> reversals unrelated to Bond. This was exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of his wife's terminal cancer {{and many of the}} symptoms of clinical depression in himself.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} Bayreuth Festival, Wagner {{began work on}} Parsifal, his final opera. The {{composition}} took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy for health reasons. From 1876 to 1878 Wagner also embarked on {{the last of his}} documented emotional liaisons, this time with Judith Gautier, whom he had met at the 1876 Festival. Wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing Parsifal, and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than Bayreuth. He was once again assisted by the liberality of King Ludwig, but was still forced by his <b>personal</b> <b>financial</b> situation in 1877 to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works (including the Siegfried Idyll) to the publisher Schott.|$|E

He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether higher levels of <b>personal</b> and <b>financial</b> stress and/or lower levels of social support {{at one point in}} time are associated with a higher risk of experiencing physical violence at a later point in time. Method: Logistic generalized estimating equations (GEE) and fixed effects modelling were used to examine the effect of <b>personal</b> stress, <b>financial</b> stress and social support on self-reported experiences of physical violence in the past year. The sample pooled 48, 368 records from 9, 393 women aged 15 years or more who participated in at least one wave of the Australian Household, Income and Labour Dynamics (HILDA) survey between 2002 and 2009. Alcohol consumption, age, marital status and whether pregnant in the previous year were controlled for in the analyses. Results: Women {{were more likely to have}} experienced physical violence if they reported <b>personal</b> or <b>financial</b> stress, poor social networks, heavy alcohol consumption, were not married (or widowed) or were young. These associations held up both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Changes in <b>personal</b> stress, <b>financial</b> stress and partner status were also found to be associated with changes in the risk of experiencing physical violence. Conclusion: Measures that reduce <b>personal</b> and <b>financial</b> stress or increase social support may help reduce the risk of women experiencing physical violence...|$|R

On September 1, Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline, who had operated on his son Albert, through Greg Simon of FasterCures. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions {{at the hospital and}} asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's <b>personal</b> <b>financial</b> commitment, two airlines each provided a plane with one flight latter underwritten by Larry Flax. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than <b>personal</b> <b>financial</b> gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E
