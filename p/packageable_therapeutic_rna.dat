40|$|A feature {{shared by}} all linear dsDNA viruses is that during their maturation, their genomes are {{translocated}} swiftly into the limited space of the procapsid and arranged into near crystal density. A DNA-translocating motor hydrolyzes ATP to perform this work. The phi 29 bacteriophage uses a virus-encoded 120 base RNA, called pRNA, that forms a hexameric complex and is an integral and indispensible component of its DNA translocating motor. The six pRNAs work sequentially during the DNA translocation process. Phi 29, including its functional DNA translocation motor, has been assembled and used to package its genome in vitro utilizing purified components synthesized by chemical or molecular biological approaches. To further {{the understanding of the}} phi 29 DNA packaging motor, the nonstructural component gp 16 was studied for its ATP hydrolysis activity. Three-dimensional computer models of pRNA structures were built using experimental data as limiting parameters. Using these constraints, the shapes of these computer models became very similar to the images of pRNA seen using cryo-AFM (atomic force microscopy). The pRNA hexamer docking with the connector crystal structure displays a remarkable match with the current data. pRNA 2 ̆ 7 s independent and tightly self-folded domains make it a great vector for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNAs.</b> The pRNA has two. pRNAs made using circularly permutation did not alter the folding of the independent pRNA domains, or hinder its function. The pRNA 52 ̆ 7 / 32 ̆ 7 ends were linked using various sequences. When using <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA,</b> two common problems encountered are exonuclease degradation and misfolding of the RNA in the cell. A vector was made using pRNA to harbor hammerhead ribozymes that cleaves the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polyA signal. The ribozyme targeting HBV was connected to the native pRNA 52 ̆ 7 / 32 ̆ 7 ends to produce a circularly permuted pRNA chimera. In vitro studies demonstrated the nearly complete cleavage of HBV polyA signal mRNA by the chimeric ribozyme. Cell culture studies demonstrated the increased inhibition of HBV replication by the chimeric ribozyme compared to the original ribozyme. This was demonstrated by Northern blot and e-antigen assays. These findings imply that pRNA can also harbor (hold and protect) other ribozymes, antisense, siRNA, and other <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules. ...|$|R

This thesis focuses on the synthesis of different receptor specific ligand conjugates of oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides are conjugated with different targeting ligands such as i) Galactose cluster, ii) Hyaluronic acid hexamer, and iii) Bisphosphonate derivative. Multi-galactose-conjugated 2 ’-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides showed remarkable galactose-dependent liver targeting of the conjugates monitored by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in healthy rats. Hyaluronic acid hexasaccharide oligonucleotide were conjugated efficiently by using copper free click reaction (SPAAC conjugation approach) and also studied by in vivo PET imaging in myocardial infarction rat models. Bone targeting bisphosphonate oligonucleotide conjugates were prepared by SPAAC conjugation approach and in vivo PET imaging exhibited enriched radioactivity accumulation to bones in healthy rats. Additionally, a straightforward method was described for the synthesis of solid supported porphyrin biomolecule conjugates. The whole-body distribution of the conjugates in rats was monitored by PET.

Gene expression is the required process in eukaryotes in which DNA is transcribed into pre-mRNA, spliced to produce "mature" mRNA and translated into proteins. Inaccuracies in splicing events are receiving more attention as there is the finding that nearly 59 % of all genes express alternative forms of mRNA. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) the disease that this project studies is not caused by alternative RNA splicing, but rather a duplicate gene product is skewed due to an inherent alternative splicing event. To expand on the knowledge of how a mirror copy of the causative gene (SMN 2) can be regulated, we developed multiple types of small RNA molecules to manipulate the alternative splicing process. This manipulation had an ultimate goal of increasing the inclusion of a required exon, exon 7. It is known in SMA if there is an increase in full length expression there is a correlative decrease in disease severity. To better understand how aberrant RNA processing events occur and how we could manipulate these signals, we identified two trans elements associated with survival motor neuron (SMN) premRNA splicing, and targeted <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> to this region. In addition, we used a translational approach to restore proper SMN pre-mRNA splicing by the development of bifunctional RNAs, antisense RNAs, and a multiple-antisense therapy targeting various regulator regions in and around the required exon. This work has shown the feasibility of multiple types of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> modalities in several assays both in vitro and in a disease-relevant context, the SMA mouse models...|$|R

EV loading under conditions that resulted in the highest siRNA retention percentage, incubating 15 molecules of cc-siRNA per EV at 37 °C for 1 hour in 100 µl, facilitated concentration dependent silencing of HuR, a therapeutic target in cancer, in EV-treated cells.

Image-guided therapies could be designed based on multifunctional nanocomposites having tunable surface plasmon resonance absorption in the near-infrared region, detectable by multiple imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear imaging, and photoacoustic imaging, etc. These novel nanostructures, once introduced, are expected to home in on solid tumors either via a passive targeting mechanism (i.e., the enhanced permeability and retention effect) or via an active targeting mechanism facilitated by ligands bound to their surfaces. Once the nanoparticles (NPs) reach their target tissue, their activity can then be turned on using an external stimulus. For example, photothermal-conducting NPs primarily act by converting light energy into heat. As a result, {{the temperature in the}} treatment volume is elevated above the thermal damage threshold, which kills the cells.

We introduced cholesterol-conjugated small interfering RNA duplexes (cc-siRNA) targeting human Htt mRNA (siRNA-Htt) into mouse striata that also received adeno-associated virus containing either expanded (100 CAG) or wild-type (18 CAG) Htt cDNA encoding huntingtin (Htt) 1 - 400. Adeno-associated virus delivery to striatum and overlying cortex of the mutant Htt gene, but not the wild type, produced neuropathology and motor deficits. Treatment with cc-siRNA-Htt in mice with mutant Htt prolonged survival of striatal neurons, reduced neuropil aggregates, diminished inclusion size, and lowered the frequency of clasping and footslips on balance beam. cc-siRNA-Htt was designed to target human wild-type and mutant Htt and decreased levels of both in the striatum.

40|$|<b>Therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> {{molecules}} such as siRNAs and {{antisense oligonucleotides}} have great {{potential to be}} used as future medicines in human patients, because they allow the modulation of virtually any protein in the body. Unfortunately, their application is hampered by their physicochemical properties that do not make them very ‘drug-like’. For example, these molecules are 10 - 25 times higher in molecular weight than conventional small molecule drugs and are highly negatively charged, which prevents their access to the intracellular site of action. Furthermore, they cannot be administered via the oral route because they would be degraded in the gastro-intestinal tract, but also after intravenous administration they are vulnerable to degradation in the bloodstream or rapidly excreted via the kidneys. All these factors together have made the application in human patients a significant challenge whereas in pre-clinical research and biomedical science in general, siRNAs and related molecules have made a huge impact. To also enable this technology for therapeutic applications, intracellular delivery systems have to be developed. In this PhD thesis, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been investigated for this purpose. These LNPs consist of lipid-like molecules that form small vesicles of approximately 100 nanometer in diameter, that encapsulate the RNA therapeutics in their core. This protects the RNA cargo against degradation by nucleases in the bloodstream and prevents rapid excretion. The goal of this research project was to improve lipid nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of RNA therapeutics after intravenous administration. Part of this work involved the modification of the surface of the LNPs with peptides that improve the therapeutic index of the LNPs, for example to improve their interaction with, and uptake by their target cells. Another example is the application of peptides that increase the fraction of the dose that eventually reaches the part within the cell where the drugs needs to exert its function. To this end, different types of coupling chemistries were explored, including the first ever report of copper-free click chemistry on the surface of a liposome and a novel type or pH-responsive conjugation that reacts to a spatiotemporal trigger inside the cell. Furthermore, variations in the composition of the lipid nanoparticles were investigated and how this could influence their ability to deliver <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules to different target tissues and after different routes of administration. Finally, the CRISPR-Cas 9 gene editing system was described, which could have even greater <b>therapeutic</b> impact than <b>RNA</b> editing/silencing systems, but seems to suffer from the same limitations as its counterparts. The lessons learned from the delivery of RNA therapeutics could also be applied to the delivery of CRISPR-Cas 9, as it has already become clear that it cannot be translated to the clinic without a sophisticated delivery system and lipid nanoparticles could also play an important role here...|$|R
40|$|SummaryOne of the {{advantages}} of nanotechnology is the feasibility to construct therapeutic particles carrying multiple therapeutics with defined structure and stoichiometry. The field of RNA nanotechnology is emerging. However, controlled assembly of stable RNA nanoparticles with multiple functionalities which retain their original role is challenging due to refolding after fusion. Herein, we report the construction of thermodynamically stable X-shaped RNA nanoparticles to carry four <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> motifs by self-assembly of reengineered small RNA fragments. We proved that each arm of the four helices in the X-motif can harbor one siRNA, ribozyme, or aptamer without affecting the folding of the central pRNA-X core, and each daughter RNA molecule within the nanoparticle folds into their respective authentic structures and retains their biological and structural function independently. Gene silencing effects were progressively enhanced as the number of the siRNA in each pRNA-X nanoparticles gradually increased from one to two, three, and four. More importantly, systemic injection of ligand-containing nanoparticles into the tail-vein of mice revealed that the RNA nanoparticles remained intact and strongly bound to cancers without entering the liver, lung or any other organs or tissues, while remaining in cancer tissue for more than 8 h...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDefects in {{mitochondrial}} DNA often cause neuromuscular pathologies, {{for which}} no efficient therapy has yet been developed. MtDNA targeting nucleic acids might therefore be promising therapeutic candidates. Nevertheless, mitochondrial gene therapy has never been achieved because DNA molecules can not penetrate inside mitochondria in vivo. In contrast, some small non-coding RNAs are imported into mitochondrial matrix, and we recently designed mitochondrial RNA vectors {{that can be used}} to address therapeutic oligoribonucleotides into human mitochondria. Here we describe an approach of carrier-free targeting of the mitochondrially importable RNA into living human cells. For this purpose, we developed the protocol of chemical synthesis of oligoribonucleotides conjugated with cholesterol residue through cleavable covalent bonds. Conjugates containing pH-triggered hydrazone bond were stable during the cell transfection procedure and rapidly cleaved in acidic endosomal cellular compartments. RNAs conjugated to cholesterol through a hydrazone bond were characterized by efficient carrier-free cellular uptake and partial co-localization with mitochondrial network. Moreover, the imported oligoribonucleotide designed to target a pathogenic point mutation in mitochondrial DNA was able to induce a decrease in the proportion of mutant mitochondrial genomes. This newly developed approach can be useful for a carrier-free delivery of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> into mitochondria of living human cells...|$|R

Therapeutic applications started amazingly fast and resulted in the first recent successes in therapy. Synthetic siRNAs are under evaluation for knocking down disease-associated target mRNAs, microRNA mimics for turning on or antagonists (antagomirs) for turning off microRNA activity. Modified oligonucleotides comprise a special class of therapeutics with a new chemical profile; the precise synthetic molecules are much smaller than protein or gene vector drugs, but they are larger than conventional drugs and thus cannot passively diffuse into their target cells. The main current strategies for solving the delivery problem are discussed.

Synthetic polymer and lipids as well as virus-based vectors are among the most widely explored vehicles for RNA delivery, but clinical progress has been limited as a result of issues related to toxicity, immunogenicity and low efficiency. Most recently, the discovery that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogenous RNA carriers, which may display better biocompatibility and higher delivery efficiency as compared with the synthetic systems, has provided a ray of hope in coping with the delivery dilemma, and EV-based gene therapy has already sparked general interest both in academia and industry.

Effectiveness of siRNA transfection using pNIPAAM formulated with either MgAl-LDH or MgFe-LDH platelets was investigated using osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) {{was used as an}} endogenous model gene to evaluate the extent of silencing. No significant adverse effects of pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogels on cell viability were noticed. Cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled siRNA was greatly enhanced (> 75 %) in pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogel constructs compared to alginate, hyaluronan and fibrin gels, and was absent in pNIPAAM hydrogel without LDH platelets. When using siRNA against GAPDH, 82 - 98 % reduction of gene expression was found in both types of pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogel constructs after 6 days of culturing. In the pNIPAAM/MgAl-LDH hybrid hydrogel, 80 - 95 % of GAPDH enzyme activity was reduced in parallel with gene.

The RDG effectively condensed shRNAs into stable nanoparticles, allowing for highly specific targeting of model human brain cancer cells (U- 87 MG-GFP) via the v 3 integrins-mediated endocytosis. The combined effects of endosomal escape (via the proton-sponge effect of the PEIs) and efficient cleavage of the disulfide-cross-linked DSPEIs by the high intracellular glutathione content triggered rapid cytoplasma shRNAs release resulted in excellent RNAi efficiency and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the high stability and prolonged blood circulation afforded by PEGylation allowed for highly effective, targeted tumor accumulation and internalization of the carriers, resulting in outstanding intra-tumor gene silencing efficiency in U- 87 MG-GFP tumor bearing BALB/c mice.

Virol. 70, 2154 - 2161) was modified {{to increase the}} copy number of the antisense molecule and to target the intra-cytoplasmic localization of the HIV genome. To this end, an anti-U 5 hammerhead ribozyme, engineered as a hybrid small adenoviral VAI RNA (VAIalpha), was inserted into the vector as a single molecule or {{in combination with the}} double copy anti-tat sequence. The retroviral vector expressing only VAIalpha (DC-VAlalpha) inhibited HIV- 1 replication to an extent comparable to that of DC-tRNA-AT. A more effective inhibition was produced by the vector expressing multiple copies of the anti-tat antisense (DC- 6 tRNA-AT). This higher effectiveness correlated with anti-tat stochiometry, i. e. with the absolute number of therapeutic molecules being produced on a per cell basis at the steady state. Surprisingly, when the tRNA-AT and VAIalpha genes were combined in the same vector (DGAT-VAIalpha), an enhancement of viral replication was noticed. This study indicates {{that it is possible to}} potentiate the antiviral activity of a retroviral vector by increasing the steady-state level of the therapeutic molecule.

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{intercellular}} communication are mediated through “sending” and “receiving” packets of information via the secretion and subsequent receptor-mediated detection of biomolecular species including cytokines, chemokines, and even metabolites. Recent evidence has now established a new modality of intercellular communication through which biomolecular species are exchanged between cells via extracellular lipid vesicles. A particularly important class of extracellular vesicles is exosomes, {{which is a}} term generally applied to biological nanovesicles ~ 30 – 200 nm in diameter. Exosomes form through invagination of endosomes to encapsulate cytoplasmic contents, and upon fusion of these multivesicular endosomes to the cell surface, exosomes are released to the extracellular space and transport mRNA, microRNA (miRNA) and proteins between cells. Importantly, exosome-mediated delivery of such cargo molecules results in functional modulation of the recipient cell, and such modulation is sufficiently potent to modulate disease processes in vivo. It is possible that such functional delivery of biomolecules indicates that exosomes utilize native mechanisms (e. g., for internalization and trafficking) that may be harnessed by using exosomes to deliver exogenous <b>RNA</b> for <b>therapeutic</b> applications. A complementary perspective is that understanding the mechanisms of exosome-mediated transport may provide opportunities for “reverse engineering” such mechanisms to improve the performance of synthetic delivery vehicles.

40|$|Since the {{realization}} of plant genetic modification, transgenic plants have been utilized as platform {{for the production of}} valuable recombinant proteins or also known as plant molecular farming (PMF). The plant offers an economical system to reduce cost, the possibility of large scale production and is free of pathogens. The plant also provides versatility o products to accumulate from industrial enzymes, peptides, and pharmaceuticals. Recent advancement of RNA as regulator of gene expression and antiviral responses has shown a new area of research where transgenic plants are used to accumulate <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNAs.</b> In this study, the reliability of transgenic plants as a platform for the production of industrial enzyme, subunit vaccine and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNAs</b> are being evaluated. Key factors that determine the success of molecular farming include 1) robustness of plant genetic transformation, 2) accumulation of large levels of recombinant product, 3) versatility of products to be accumulated, 4) stability of products, and 5) bioactivity of plant-derived products. The first study demonstrated the accumulation of starch-degrading enzyme, amylopullulanase (APU) derived from bacteria Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus in maize seed. Accumulation of thermostable APU in transgenic maize seed resulted in direct starch processing into glucose and simple sugars without the addition of exogenous enzyme. Subsequent fermentation reaction showed 40. 2 % conversion of starch into bioethanol. This study showed simplification of starch-based bioethanol production from maize grains using a biotechnology approach. The feasibility of the plant as the production system for the accumulation of antigen is demonstrated in the second study. Conserved nucleoprotein (NP) gene was expressed in maize seed. This conserved protein showed potential application as a universal vaccine for influenza virus. Our study suggested that maize-derived NP was immunogenic and could induce antibody responses upon administration in pigs and mice. Maize NP seeds remained stable and active at room temperature. This result showed that the plant is able to produce product and maintain immunogenicity. Thirdly, the plant was utilized as a production system for the accumulation of dsRNA as a vaccine for shrimp viral pathogen. Our result showed the accumulation of long dsRNAs specific to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV). Shrimp bioassay of soybean-derived dsRNA specific to WSSV showed moderate protection against viral challenge and indicated activity of plant-derived dsRNA. While the accumulation levels of dsRNAs in transgenic plants was far from economically efficient, our result showed that the plant was able to accumulate foreign dsRNA. Our result showed that accumulation level needs to be improved for plant use as an efficient platform for accumulation of therapeutics RNA. Concern over antibiotic or herbicide resistance selectable marker has brought attention for an alternative selectable marker. In the last study, a non-antibiotic selectable marker was assessed as a selection system for maize Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The ptxD gene conferring phosphite oxidoreducatase enzyme enables transformed cells to utilize phosphite as phosphorous source while non-transformed cells cannot.

It is now established that unmodified siRNA can acti-vate this innate immune response and therefore {{there is real}} potential for siRNA to elicit nonspecific thera-peutic effects {{in a wide range}} of disease models. Here we demonstrate that in a murine model of influenza in-fection, the antiviral activity of siRNA is due primarily to immune stimulation elicited by the active siRNA duplexes and is not the result of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> interference (RNAi) as previously reported. We show that the misinterpretation stems from the use of a particular control green fluorescent protein (GFP) siRNA that we identify as having unusually low immunostimulatory activity compared with the active anti-influenza siRNA. Curiously, this GFP siRNA has served as a negative control for a surprising number of groups reporting ther-apeutic effects of siRNA. The inert immunologic profile of the GFP sequence was unique among a broad panel of published siRNAs, all of which could elicit significant interferon induction from primary immune cells. This panel included eight active siRNAs against viral, angiogenic, and oncologic targets, the reported therapeutic efficacy of which was based on comparison with the nonimmunostimulatory GFP siRNA. These results em-phasize the need for researchers to anticipate, monitor, and adequately control for siRNA-mediated immune stimulation and calls into question the interpretation of numerous published reports of therapeutic RNAi in vivo.

Chimeric pRNAs with inserted moieties retain the properties of forming dimers or trimers via interlocking interaction between the right- and left-hand loops. Incubation of cancer cells with a pRNA dimer, in which one subunit harbors folate as a cancer recognition moiety and the other contains siRNA against anti-apoptotic gene survivin, resulted in the binding and entry of this RNA dimer into the cancer cells and subsequent gene silencing. The chimeric pRNA/siRNA can be processed by Dicer and release double-stranded siRNA duplex to silence the target gene via the mechanism of RNA interference. The specific recognition of cancer cells and the anti-tumor activity of the pRNA dimer were further confirmed by ex vivo delivery in animal trials. In a trimeric pRNA complex, RNA aptamer against CD 4 receptor mediated the binding and co-entry of the trivalent therapeutic particles into cells expressing CD 4, and subsequently modulated the apoptosis of leukemia lymphocytes. The assembly of protein-free 25 -nanometer RNA nanoparticles would allow for repeated long-term administration and avoid the problems of short retention time of small molecules and the difficulties in the delivery of particles larger than 100 nanometer. ...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{interference}} {{has potential}} therapeutic value for cardiac disease, but targeted delivery of interfering RNA is a challenge. Custom designed microbubbles, {{in conjunction with}} ultrasound, can deliver small inhibitory RNA to target tissues in vivo. The efficacy of cardiac RNA interference using a microbubble-ultrasound theranostic platform has not been demonstrated in vivo. Therefore, our objective was {{to test the hypothesis}} that custom designed microbubbles and ultrasound can mediate effective delivery of small inhibitory RNA to the heart. Microbubble and ultrasound mediated cardiac RNA interference was tested in transgenic mice displaying cardiac-restricted luciferase expression. Luciferase expression was assayed in select tissues of untreated mice (n = 14). Mice received intravenous infusion of cationic microbubbles bearing small inhibitory RNA directed against luciferase (n = 9) or control RNA (n = 8) during intermittent cardiac-directed ultrasound at mechanical index of 1. 6. Simultaneous echocardiography in a separate group of mice (n = 3) confirmed microbubble destruction and replenishment during treatment. Three days post treatment, cardiac luciferase messenger RNA and protein levels were significantly lower in ultrasound-treated mice receiving microbubbles loaded with small inhibitory RNA directed against luciferase compared to mice receiving microbubbles bearing control RNA (23 ± 7 % and 33 ± 7 % of control mice, p< 0. 01 and p = 0. 03, respectively). Passive cavitation detection focused on the heart confirmed that insonification resulted in inertial cavitation. In conclusion, small inhibitory RNA-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound directed at the heart significantly reduced the expression of a reporter gene. Ultrasound-targeted destruction of RNA-loaded microbubbles may be an effective image-guided strategy for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> interference in cardiac disease...|$|R
40|$|Since 40 years, {{angiogenesis}} {{has been}} recognized to be a prominent factor {{in the development of}} solid tumors and has been regarded as an attractive target for cancer therapy. A promising strategy to interfere with diseases where (over) expression of specific genes contributes to the pathological process, such as angiogenesis, is gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). So far, clinical success of RNAi-based strategies to inhibit tumor angiogenesis have been limited due to (1) scarcity of clinically promising pharmacological targets and/or (2) inefficiency or toxicity of the siRNA carrier system. In this thesis, we attempted to improve both siRNA target and carrier. Therefore, we studied a novel small Rho GTPase protein, Rac 1, as a potential target for anti-angiogenic therapy. Our results indicate that Rac 1 is an important regulator of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and that knockdown of Rac 1 using siRNA may represent an attractive approach to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth. At the same time, we tried to adapt and improve a novel class of biodegradable poly(amido amine) s, with built-in characteristics for intracellular release of its siRNA payload, for drug delivery purposes. By titrating the positive charges, these polymers were optimized for siRNA delivery. PEGylation of the polymers resulted in increased stability of siRNA polyplexes in salt and serum and further decreased their toxicity. Additionally, we modified a previously described lipid-based carrier for siRNA to target angiogenic endothelial cells. We show that these systems ensure cellular uptake and gene silencing in both murine and human endothelial cells. Further research should evaluate the use of these carriers for gene silencing in vivo. This thesis provides starting points for future research on the optimization of polymeric and lipidic carrier systems for silencing of genes involved in angiogenesis. This may ultimately lead to the development of safe delivery systems that enable <b>therapeutic</b> <b>RNA</b> interference in cancer therapy...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{potential}} of RNAi, ectopic expression of shRNA or siRNAs holds the inherent risk of competition for critical RNAi components, thus altering the regulatory functions of some cellular microRNAs. In addition, specific siRNA sequences can potentially hinder incorporation of other siRNAs when used in a combinatorial approach. We show that both synthetic siRNAs and expressed shRNAs compete against {{each other and with}} the endogenous microRNAs for transport and for incorporation into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). The same siRNA sequences do not display competition when expressed from a microRNA backbone. We also show that TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) is one of the sensors for selection and incorporation of the guide sequence of interfering RNAs. These findings reveal that combinatorial siRNA approaches can be problematic and have important implications for the methodology of expression and use of <b>therapeutic</b> interfering <b>RNAs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chitosan is a {{naturally}} occurring cationic mucopolysaccharide. It is generally biocompatible, biodegradable, mucoadhesive, non-immunogenic and non-toxic. Although chitosan {{is able to}} condense nucleic acids (NA) (both DNA and RNA) and protect them from nuclease degradation, its poor water solubility and low transfection efficacy have impeded its use as an NA carrier. In order to overcome such limitations, a multitude of strategies for chitosan modification and formulation have been proposed. In this article, we will first give {{a brief overview of}} the physical and biological properties of chitosan. Then, with a special focus on plasmid DNA delivery, we will have a detailed discussion of the latest advances in chitosan-mediated NA transfer. For future research, the following three important areas will be discussed: chitosan-mediated <b>therapeutic</b> small <b>RNA</b> transfer, structure-activity relationships (SAR) in chitosan vector design, and chitosan-mediated oral/nasal NA therapy. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Locked nucleic acids" (LNAs) {{belong to}} the backbone-modified nucleic acid family. The 2 '-O, 4 '-C-methylene-β-D-ribofuranose {{nucleotides}} are used for single or multiple substitutions in RNA molecules and thereby introduce enhanced bio- and thermostability. This renders LNAs powerful tools for diagnostic and <b>therapeutic</b> applications. <b>RNA</b> molecules maintain the overall canonical A-type conformation upon substitution of single or multiple residues/nucleotides by LNA monomers. The structures of "all" LNA homoduplexes, however, exhibit significant differences in their overall geometry, in particular a decreased twist, roll and propeller twist. This results in a widening of the major groove, a decrease in helical winding, and an enlarged helical pitch. Therefore, the LNA duplex structure {{can no longer be}} described as a canonical A-type RNA geometry but can rather be brought into proximity to other backbone-modified nucleic acids, like glycol nucleic acids or peptide nucleic acids. LNA-modified nucleic acids provide thus structural and functional features that may be successfully exploited for future application in biotechnology and drug discovery...|$|R
