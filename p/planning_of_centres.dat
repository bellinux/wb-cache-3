40|$|Countries, {{states and}} island nations often need forward {{planning}} of their radiotherapy services driven by different motives. Countries without radiotherapy services sponsor patients to receive radiotherapy abroad. They often engage professionals for a feasibility study {{in order to}} establish whether it would be more cost-beneficial to establish a radiotherapy facility. Countries where radiotherapy services have developed without any central planning, find themselves in situations where many of the available centres are private and thus inaccessible for a majority of patients with limited resources. Government may decide to plan ahead when a significant exodus of cancer patients travel to another country for treatment, thus exposing the failure of the country to provide this medical service for its citizens. In developed countries the trigger has been the existence of highly visible waiting lists for radiotherapy revealing a shortage of radiotherapy equipment. This paper suggests {{that there should be a}} systematic and comprehensive process of long-term planning of radiotherapy services at the national level, taking into account the regulatory infrastructure for radiation protection, <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>centres,</b> equipment, staff, education p...|$|E
40|$|Spatial <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> {{logistics}} <b>centres</b> follows specific {{spatial and}} infrastructural requirements, conditioned by desired traffic flux and scope. Spatial and environmental {{limitations of the}} usual freight handling sites are forcing logistical activities to search for areas that can ensure undisturbed expansion and practically unlimited traffic flows. The consequence of this trend is suburbanisation coupled with all the spatial and environmental effects. Within this framework, set against the awareness of the uniqueness of any particular site, the article points out the significance of a comprehensive and timely spatial and environmental <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> logistical <b>centres.</b> Therefore clear spatial objectives, transparent analytical starting blocks and adequate planning regulation {{prove to be the}} imperative in the spatial <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> logistical <b>centres</b> and formulation <b>of</b> the spatial concept. Simultaneously, and with respect to the complexity of spatial developments, the significance of territorial cohesion is emphasised, which is manifested as territorial identity, territorial quality and territorial efficiency...|$|R

It is not a prescription for the ideal building design.

This thesis discusses the period between infancy and school age as crucial in the physical and emotional development of children; a time when they first establish concepts of space, relationships, and feelings. Each environment and social interaction experienced plays a large role in a child's development, both socially and physically.

50|$|Foligno {{railway station}} forms {{part of the}} main line from Rome to Ancona, and is the {{junction}} for Perugia; it is thus an important rail centre, with repair and maintenance yards for the trains of central Italy, and was therefore subjected to severe Allied aerial bombing in World War II, responsible for its relatively modern aspect, although it retains some medieval monuments. Of its Roman past no significant trace remains, {{with the exception of}} the regular street <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> the <b>centre.</b> Other resources include sugar refineries and metallurgical, textile, building materials and paper and timber industries. After the war, the city's position in the plain and again its rail connections have led to a considerable suburban spread with the attendant problems of traffic and air pollution, as well as a severe encroachment on the Umbrian wetlands.

In fact, the main facade of Palazzo Marino was originally the one facing Piazza San Fedele, to the south-east (i.e., exactly opposite to Piazza della Scala). Likewise, when La Scala was built (in 1778), it was facing a street rather than a square. It was only in the late 19th Century that the authorities of Milan initiated a thorough renovation of the area, which involved the creation of the square. Luca Beltrami first contributed with Palazzo Beltrami (1886), then with the new facade of Palazzo Marino (1888-1892), and, much later, with the Banca Commerciale building (1923-1927).|$|R
