40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the causes and}} consequences of hedge fund activism. Hedge funds target profitable and healthy firms, with above-average cash holdings. The target firms earn significantly higher abnormal stock returns around the initial 13 D filing date than a sample of control firm. However, they do not show improvements in accounting performances in {{the year after the}} initial purchase. Instead, hedge funds extract cash from the firm through increases in the target’s debt capacity and higher dividends. Examination of proxy fights and threats accompanying the activist campaign suggests that hedge fund managers achieve their goals by posing a credible threat of engaging the target in a costly <b>proxy</b> <b>solicitation</b> contest. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract * The U. S. {{corporate}} governance {{system is a}} "representative " shareholder democracy (director primacy and manager discretion, fiduciary/professional duties and aspirational preferences, reputational- and self-enforcement mechanisms), conceptually similar to Karl Popper's open society. The system is a semi-personal exchange, repeated game that helps to offset the three fundamental conflicts of principal-agency in {{corporate governance}}. From an architectural perspective, the U. S. system is a model-reference adaptive control system with three feedback mechanisms (the stock market, the material disclosure system, and the <b>proxy</b> <b>solicitation</b> system) that admit shareholder criticism (exit, voice, and precatory judgment). Constructive shareholder criticism pushes firms to adapt, brings problems to their boards ' attention, and prods their managers {{to solve the problems}} early on before they fester and grow. The U. S. system relies on fiduciaries (outside directors) and professionals (public auditors). The current crisis of investor confidence can be attributed to their failure to carry out their public responsibilities, which has significantly increased the measurement and enforcement costs of public equity ownership. Representative democracy provides for the economizing of virtue. Restoring investor confidence will require the continual reinforcement of aspirational preferences for virtuous conduct by fiduciaries and professionals. The current crisis can also be attributed to the inability of corporations in economic distress to problem-solve. Representative democracy also facilitates problem-solving through time. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the U. S. corporate governance system (Allen, 1999) from the perspectives of North’s framework of institutional analysis (1990 a) and Popper’s political philosophy of open society (1944 a-b), (1988). Along the lines of a recently proposed problem-solving model of economic behavior (Mantzavinos, 2001), open society is based on the adaptive behavior paradigm (Popper, 1994) : “All life is problem-solving. ” The paradigm can be summarized by Popper’s four-stage methodology of science (1979) ...|$|E
40|$|The idea {{of whether}} or not the {{shareholders}} of public firms should obtain access to the firms’ proxy materials has been controversial in the United States. The continual disagreements surrounding proxy access reforms demand the necessity of looking at other countries that already allow shareholder access to a company’s proxy. This article aims to explore the concerns and issues of shareholder proposal rights for corporate elections and shareholder access in South Korea and to provide considerations for an improved regime. Towards this end, this author conducted a case study of the shareholder proposals of public firms listed on the Korea Exchange over the periods 2007 through 2009. The analysis of the data suggests that shareholder proposals for director nominations have seldom been exercised for large public firms, especially chaebols—the large, family-controlled Korean corporate groups. Consequently, the current standards for a gradated shareholder eligibility requirement should be reconsidered, thus enabling shareholder nomination rights to function as an effective means to control agency problems in large public firms. Having cumulative voting systems and voting restrictions in auditor elections entail greater risks that directors or auditors representing special interests may be elected through shareholder nominations. In particular, considering the relatively large number of unsupported auditor nominations, a stricter requirement for auditor candidate nominations might mitigate the disadvantages of frivolous auditor nominations. In terms of nominating purposes, more than half of shareholder proposals were found to be utilized for the purpose of pursuing takeovers of control rights in South Korea, where there is no limitation on the number or qualification of directors to be nominated by shareholder proposal rights. This invites a reexamination of the proper scopes of shareholder nomination rights in conjunction with shareholder proxy access, depending upon the size of nomination. On the other hand, the fact that nominating shareholders frequently conduct a separate <b>proxy</b> <b>solicitation</b> shows that the current regime does not provide a sufficiently effective method for nominating shareholders. Future studies should include the effects of the exercise of shareholder nominations on enhancing corporate governance of the firms...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{different approaches to}} the regulation of the capital markets {{with a focus on}} explaining why certain assumptions about markets, actors, and systems came to be embedded in the regulatory practice in the American capital markets. More specifically, I examine regulatory assumptions about the nature of public firm ownership, the distortions that these assumptions introduced into the regulatory framework governing the securities markets, and the epistemological and risk-based implications of these distortions to actors, markets, and the regulatory system. The analysis draws on a number of theoretical approaches and methodologies including legal history, law and economics, comparative law, complexity/systems analysis, socio-legal analysis, and political economy. This study analyzes the performance of the US Securities and Exchange Commission as the principal regulator of the American capital markets. The regulatory framework arguably reflects the Commission's perceptions (of market realities) and preferences (in response to these ""market realities""). The federal proxy rules found in s. 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, used as a case study in this volume, exemplify this claim. As one of the original responsibilities assigned to the Commission by Congress, s. 14 (a) of the 1934 Act gave the agency near-complete authority to regulate the federal proxy process. Thus, the functioning of the federal proxy regime hints at the Commission's performance as a regulator. Since s. 14 (a) deals with <b>proxy</b> <b>solicitation</b> of shareholder votes, one essential policy consideration is the nature of corporate ownership. To evaluate the Commission's knowledge in relation to ownership, we need to appreciate how the agency evaluated underlying assumptions vis-à-vis ownership; displayed awareness of changing socio-economic realities in the securities markets; and developed responsive regulatory measures accordingly. The analysis highlights how the Commission missed learning opportunities (to varying degrees) over the years vis-à-vis (i) distortions introduced into the regulatory framework in the 1930 s, (ii) implications of these distortions to the stability of the regulatory framework, (iii) demographic changes in the nature of public firm ownership leading to the formation of an ownership structure not previously discussed in the literature, which I call the ""market oriented blockholder model,"" (iv) new forms of endogenous risks relating to the regulatory framework, which I call ""regulatory systemic risk. "" The cumulative impact of these factors have negative implications to the agency's reputation and legitimacy. These findings suggest that the Commission needs to optimize its process to become what I call a ""learning regulator""-an organization displaying adaptability to the evolving environment subject to its oversight through the acquisition, generation, and translation of knowledge and the modification of its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights. To facilitate such optimization, I develop an organizational learning model tailored to administrative agencies-the ""learning regulator framework. "" Measures adopted pursuant to the model encourage organizational learning, risk reduction, and enhanced efficiency in the regulated environment. These measures, in turn, enhance the regulator's reputation and shield its legitimacy from criticism. ...|$|E
