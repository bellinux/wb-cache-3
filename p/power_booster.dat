50|$|The {{optional}} <b>Power</b> <b>Booster</b> PB-E1 or Battery Pack BP-E1 {{attach to}} the base of the camera. The booster (PB-E1) holds 8 AA batteries or an optional Ni-Cad pack, and boosts the standard drive from 3 frames per second to 6. The <b>Power</b> <b>Booster</b> E1 has its own shutter release and input dial for use when shooting in the vertical format. The battery pack (BP-E1) is a lighter and simpler accessory. This holds 4 AA cells and a lithium battery, and you can select between the two power sources with a switch. It provides a grip for vertical shots but no additional controls. The major appeal of the Battery Pack BP-E1 is that is lighter and less expensive than the <b>power</b> <b>booster.</b>|$|E

50|$|Following the {{departure}} of his partner, Matthews was introduced to inventor and electric engineer Robert Myer through IBM colleagues. Together they designed a circuit to create a distortion-free sustain. A simple line booster used by Myers in testing to preamplify the guitar's signal was also manufactured from 1969 as the Linear <b>Power</b> <b>Booster</b> (LPB-1), and has continued production in present day.|$|E

He later robbed a bank, but {{was defeated by}} Spider-Man. He then attempted a theft of a <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> from the Tinkerer after commissioning him to build it for him, but was again defeated both by Spider-Man and a failsafe function the Tinkerer installs in his products {{to deal with such}} situations.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 2014, the Power Station is an {{innovative}} product design which couples an adjustable reactive load with an internal 50W, 6L6 power amplifier. The Power Station {{serves as a}} power attenuator, <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> and reamping device with a passive line out and post load amp effects loop. The internal power amp response can be adjusted using dedicated Presence and Depth controls based on Fryette's original Depth Control design introduced in 1988 and subsequently adopted by every major tube amplifier builder on the market today.|$|E
50|$|KQRI {{is one of}} {{the newest}} {{additions}} to the Albuquerque radio market, having moved into the area in 2004 from Grants, New Mexico. The 105.5 frequency in Albuquerque was previously translator K288CX, which had re-broadcast the programming on various stations in the Albuquerque and Santa Fe market over the years. In 2015, more than decade after being displaced, the translator moved to 107.5 as K298BY rebroadcasting KIVA 1600. In 2012, KQRI-FM1, a 16,000 watt effective radiated <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> on 105.5 in Albuquerque came on the air.|$|E
40|$|A manned {{recoverable}} flying {{machine that}} operates both in {{air and space}} was discussed. This space shuttle precursor was proposed in the early 1900 's by Eugen Sanger.

Basic concepts of the space aircraft, a cross between a <b>powered</b> <b>booster</b> rocket and an aerodynamic glider, are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the raised}} edge along {{the outside of}} every piece of track, a car would almost never leave the track from going too fast. Whilst this did prevent TCR from having the stop/start, run-to-fetch-a-spun-vehicle nature of Scalextric (particularly in young hands), it did mean that a TCR race {{required}} no particular skill and the user of the faster car would always win. (Speed equalisers and <b>power</b> <b>boosters</b> were later made available to attempt {{to level the playing}} field).|$|R

Card numbers 1-6 and 8-12 were issued {{at a rate of}} one in every 36 first series retail packs, while numbers 13-26 were issued in hobby packs at a rate of one in 36. Inserted in place of two basic cards, they are printed 28 point stock and the fronts have prismatic foil painting. Card number 7, which is Mickey Mantle in the regular set, was not issued in the <b>Power</b> <b>Booster</b> form.|$|E
5000|$|The Axis fuzz pedal, {{also sold}} {{under the name}} 'Foxey Lady' for the Guild guitar company, and LPB-1 Linear <b>Power</b> <b>Booster</b> were the first {{products}} in 1969. The LPB-1 massively boosted a guitar signal to provide gain by clipping the signal, resulting in a raw distorted sound, full of sustain and harmonics. Several similar devices, which sold well, followed, such as the Treble Booster and Bass Booster.The Mike Matthews Freedom Amp, a portable guitar amp powered by 40 [...] "D" [...] batteries, was popular in many venues that lacked an A/C power source.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, Iron Man guest {{starred in}} Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends with William H. Marshall {{providing}} his voice. He made cameo appearances throughout the series, most prominently in [...] "The Origin of the Spider-Friends", in which Tony Stark {{is a central}} character. The Beetle stole a crime-detection computer and the <b>Power</b> <b>Booster</b> invented by Tony Stark to increase his power. He was the first villain that the Spider-Friends faced together in that origin episode. In gratitude for the Spider-Friends' aid against the Beetle, Stark provided them with the crime-detection technology used by the heroes throughout the series.|$|E

5000|$|This article mainly {{refers to}} the {{mechanical}} device {{in the context of}} a brake <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> or vehicular braking-system assist. The term [...] "vacuum servo" [...] is actually a generic term for any device which uses a vacuum to amplify/boost the mechanical effort of a device by use of a vacuum in an assisting chamber, either attached to the input or output, or placed between the input and output. In a Vacuum brake servo, the unit is placed between the brake pedal and the hydraulic master cylinder, using stored vacuum to amplify the drivers pedal efforts, giving a greater braking force.|$|E
50|$|A {{microwave}} power module consists of a solid state power amplifier, which drives a vacuum <b>power</b> <b>booster,</b> typically a traveling wave tube. The {{high voltage power supply}} required by the TWT is provided by an electronic power conditioner. In pulsed-mode MPMs, the power conditioner provides a pulsed high voltage that is triggered by a trigger input. MPMs also include a microcontroller, which is responsible for controlling the operation of the module, such as making sure the various power supply voltages come up in the appropriate sequence to prevent damage to the TWT. It also reports the module status, including the various voltages, currents and temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Metal Storm is an action-platform game {{featuring}} six stages {{with two}} acts each, {{and a final}} boss rush stage. The player takes {{on the role of}} the M-308 Gunner, an all-purpose combat robot with a specially equipped gravity control device. This device allows the player to flip from the floor to the ceiling and vice versa. The gunner is also equipped with a gun to destroy enemies. The player can pick up various power-ups including a <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> for the gun, a shield, and a fireball ability for when flipping gravity. When a stage is finished, a password is provided which saves the score, special weapons, and number of lives left.|$|E

He {{works in a}} team alongside Mira Nova, a Tangean princess with phasing <b>powers,</b> <b>Booster,</b> a janitor from the planet Jo-Ad, and XR, a robot created by the Little Green Men (the aliens from the movies, LGM for short). This version of Buzz is completely {{different from the one}} in Toy Story, in looks and personality. Buzz also has had many love interests on the show. He once had a friend and partner named Warp Darkmatter, however, he later joined Zurg and became his primary agent. Buzz also seems to never take off the purple headwear that he has with his Space Ranger uniform. Aside from his regular catch phrase, he has a habit of telling villains that [...] "Evil never wins!" ...|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} {{versions}} of the Canon EOS-1 available on launch. There was the Standard body only option, and a more premium High Speed option called the Canon EOS-1 HS. The HS kit came with the body and the additional <b>Power</b> Drive <b>Booster</b> E1, which allowed for up to 5.5 frames per second. The HS option was mainly used for sports and wildlife photography.|$|R
50|$|The F2H-2 was the {{foundation}} for three minor variants of the Banshee. The first, the F2H-2B, had strengthened wings and a strengthened inner pylon under the portside wing to allow the craft to carry a 1,650 lb (748 kg) Mark 7 nuclear bomb or a 3,230 lb (1,465 kg) Mark 8 nuclear bomb. In order {{to compensate for the}} vastly increased load, the F2H-2B was fitted with stiffer landing gear struts and a pilot-switchable <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> for the ailerons; the latter was necessary so pilots could control a roll to the left with a heavy Mark 8 nuclear bomb fitted on the left-hand pylon. One 20 mm cannon was omitted to make room for additional electronics to arm the nuclear weapon.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant CommanderZydos (1-48) is the strongman, {{brutal and}} prone to deep thinking. He was a key player amongst the Gorma because of his power and he could create {{extremely}} dangerous new Gorma like Jin. He believed utterly in Shadam as his leader, but was also prone to doing his own things. He has trouble controlling the 3 Gorma Idiots as they tend to botch the plans due to their competitive nature. He was nearly killed by the Heavy Armor Qi Palace, but he survived. During the match between Shadam and Jiaxu, Zydos was sent to destroy the <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> Jiaxu intended {{to use in the}} match. Though he barely survived the Heavy Armor Qi Palace for the second time, Zydos died when he turned into his true form: a clay figure created by Shadam as he remembered him.|$|E
5000|$|When the time-displaced Decepticon agent, Ravage, {{used the}} time machine called the Kronosphere to alter the time line (branching off the Binaltech/Alternators storyline from the {{continuity}} of the G1 animated series), the chaos that ensued resulted in the destruction of Shockwave's body. With Ravage's aid, his mind was installed into a stolen Autobot [...] "Binaltech" [...] body, equipped with a prototype [...] "Transmuter" [...] device, which, when interfaced with Shockwave's personality component, allowed the chassis to [...] "transmute" [...] itself into Shockwave's recognizable physical form, including his cyclopean visage and gun-arm. He wields a Turbo Rifle which can also serve as a <b>power</b> <b>booster</b> for his gun-arm, and can project up to five holographic duplicates of himself anywhere on the planet (an ability mentioned in the series bible for the original animated series, but never put to use until episode 4).|$|E
50|$|The EOS 1V was {{the fastest}} moving-mirror film camera ever put into {{production}} {{at the time it}} was introduced, at 10 frames/second with the PB-E2 <b>power</b> drive <b>booster</b> and the NP-E2 Ni-MH battery pack. (Although the 1nRS has a higher frame rate, it used a fixed pellicle mirror rather than a moving mirror). This feat has since been overtaken by the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II with 16fps.|$|R
5000|$|Ever since 27 March 1960, when Admiral Pecori Geraldi {{had argued}} that a seaborne nuclear force was the most {{resistant}} to attack, the navy had looked {{for an opportunity to}} take on a nuclear role and had gained experience through the successful test of Polaris missiles from Giuseppe Garibaldi in September 1962. Thus, in 1971, the navy started an indigenous ballistic missile program for use on submarines and surface warships or [...] "technology program intended to develop high <b>power</b> solid-propellant <b>boosters</b> for civil and military applications".|$|R
2500|$|Power suit: Instead of any superhuman <b>powers,</b> <b>Booster</b> Gold uses an {{advanced}} microcircuitry-powered all-purpose combat suit. The suit bestows enhanced strength, {{at least twenty}} tons without exertion, and protection to the wearer, and is durable, lightweight and easy to wear. The suit is able to withstand bullets without losing its integrity (although being shot hurts). It {{is equipped with a}} force field, courtesy of the Brainiac 5 belt, able to withstand powerful impact forces and supplying air for no-air atmospheres and defending Booster from germs and pollution: this particular feature was later downplayed, as Booster prefers now engaging the shield only when necessary to avoid weakening his immune system. Originally, it was the war-suit of an alien invader, put on display on the museum from which Booster stole much of his equipment. The suit was damaged by Doomsday, then replaced with bulky suits of armor and a variation of the [...] "Energy Superman" [...] energy-dampening costume. The current suit, of unknown origin, is a close replica of the original. In the alternate continuity of the Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century series, Brainiac 5 arranged the events leading Booster into stealing a huge array of power cells used by the Science Police to fuel his suit.|$|R
