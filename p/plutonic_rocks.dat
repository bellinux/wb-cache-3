5|$|A major {{geological}} {{structure in}} the region is the Northern Patagonian Batholith. This structure, formed by <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> including granodiorite and tonalite, is crossed north-south by the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone and surrounded by metamorphic rocks west and volcanic rocks east of the batholith.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} formed {{on top of}} <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks,</b> which were scoured by glaciation. At the south coast of Tierra del Fuego, {{volcanic}} activity provided the late Jurassic formation known as the Lemaire Formation. Later, during the Cretaceous, the Yaghan Formation consisting of marine sediments was deposed {{on top of the}} Lemaire Formation. The basement of Fueguino consists of an ophiolite of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. The ophiolitic sequence contains pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, titanomagnetite, cubanite and pyrite.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E

25|$|In {{the rock}} record, {{volcanic}} arcs {{can be seen}} as the volcanic rocks themselves, but because volcanic rock is easily weathered and eroded, it is more typical that they are seen as <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks,</b> the rocks that formed underneath the arc (e.g. the Sierra Nevada batholith), or in the sedimentary record as lithic sandstones.|$|E

25|$|The Murrumbidgee Batholith {{formed by}} melting {{different}} sediments to the Ordovician Pittman Formations, as the granites contain more feldspar elements Ca, Na and K. At Cooma there is migmatite where the sediments have been partially melted {{in order to}} produce the <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> in the batholith. Variations in their composition are explained by partial mixing with melted oceanic crust.|$|E
25|$|The QAPF diagram {{has four}} {{minerals}} or mineral groups chosen as important cornerstones of the classification. These are quartz (Q), Alkali feldspars (A), plagioclase feldspars (P), and feldspathoids (F). F and Q for chemical reasons {{can not exist}} together in one plutonic rock. Other minerals may and almost certainly occur in these rocks as well {{but they have no}} significance in this classification scheme. So, the whole diagram is actually composed of two ternary plots (QAP and FAP). To use the classification, the concentration (the mode) of these minerals must be known and recalculated to make their sum 100%. For example: a plutonic rock that contains no alkali feldspar and no feldspathoids but contains lots of pyroxenes (neglected in this diagram), plagioclase feldspar and few quartz grains is probably gabbro (located at the right edge of the diagram, near P). This diagram does not determine whether a rock is gabbro, diorite, or anorthosite. There are another criteria used to decide that. Note that this diagram is not used for all <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Ultramafic rocks are the most important <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> that have separate classification diagrams.|$|E
25|$|When magma cools {{it begins}} to form solid mineral phases. Some of these settle {{at the bottom of}} the magma chamber forming cumulates that might form mafic layered intrusions. Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> such as gabbro, diorite and granite, {{depending}} upon the composition of the magma. Alternatively, if the magma is erupted it forms volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite and rhyolite (the extrusive equivalents of gabbro, diorite and granite, respectively).|$|E
50|$|Ammineite is {{supposed}} to be a result of an interaction of an earlier copper mineral, likely from a <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock,</b> with ammonia in guano. Ammonia may be produced in decomposition of compounds like urea or uric adic.|$|R
50|$|Mount Karifuri {{is split}} between two {{different}} rock types. The western side consists of <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> formed 40-32 million years ago. The eastern side {{is made of}} metamorphic rock formed under low-to-mid pressure 50-20 million years ago.|$|R

25|$|QAPF {{diagrams}} {{are mostly}} used to classify <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> (phaneritic rocks), {{but are also}} used to classify volcanic rocks if modal mineralogical compositions have been determined. QAPF diagrams {{are not used to}} classify pyroclastic rocks or volcanic rocks if modal mineralogical composition is not determined, instead the TAS classification (Total-Alkali-Silica) is used. TAS is also used if volcanic rock contains volcanic glass (such as obsidian). QAPF diagrams are also not used if mafic minerals make up more than 90% of the rock composition (for example: peridotites and pyroxenites).|$|E
25|$|The Animikie Group {{formations}} are in east-central and northeastern Minnesota, and the Thunder Bay District of Northern Ontario; {{they are}} geographically divided into the Gunflint Range, the Mesabi and Vermilion ranges, and the Cuyuna Range. The Animikie Basin was an extensional basin which developed over a basement {{consisting of the}} 2,750- to 2,600-million-year-old Superior province {{to the north and}} the 3,600-million-year-old Minnesota River Valley subprovince to the south. The extension was caused by the east-northeasttrending Great Lakes tectonic zone; it separates the Superior province from the Minnesota River Valley subprovince. The sediments were deformed, metamorphosed and intruded by the <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> of the 1860 ± 50-million-year-old Penokean orogeny.|$|E
25|$|The interpretable {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Michelangelo quadrangle begins {{with the formation of}} the four ancient, multiring basins. From oldest to youngest, they are: Barma-Vincente, Bartok-Ives, Hawthorne-Riemenschneider, and Eitoku-Milton. These basins presumably formed during the period of heavy bombardment inferred from lunar history (Wilhelms, in press). Contemporaneous with their formation and shortly afterward, was the deposition of the intercrater plains material. This unit has a complex history of deposition; it was reworked in place and probably includes brecciated <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> and possibly ancient volcanic flows. Deposition of the intercrater plains material was waning as the next oldest basins (Dostoevskij, Tolstoj) were formed. Partly overlapping their formation was the deposition of the intermediate plains material, probably emplaced partly as distal basin ejecta and partly as volcanic flows. Regional deformation of these plains units by compressive tectonics, forming scarps, was contemporaneous with their deposition.|$|E
50|$|Hornblendite is a <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} the amphibole hornblende. Hornblende-rich ultramafic rocks are rare and when hornblende {{is the dominant}} mineral phase they are classified as hornblendites with qualifiers such as garnet hornblendite identifying a second abundant contained mineral.|$|R
50|$|Troctolite 76535 is a {{coarse-grained}} <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> that {{is believed}} to have had a slow cooling history. The rock originates from early in the Moon's history. Geologists have described it as a coarse-grained olivine-plagioclase cumulate with a granular polygonal texture.|$|R
50|$|Nepheline syenite is a holocrystalline <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> that {{consists}} largely of nepheline and alkali feldspar. The rocks are mostly pale colored, grey or pink, {{and in general}} appearance they are not unlike granites, but dark green varieties are also known. Phonolite is the fine-grained extrusive equivalent.|$|R
25|$|Quickly {{after the}} lunar crust formed, {{or even as}} it was forming, {{different}} types of magmas that would give rise to the Mg-suite norites and troctolites began to form, although the exact depths at which this occurred are not known precisely. Recent theories suggest that Mg-suite plutonism was largely confined to {{the region of the}} Procellarum KREEP Terrane, and that these magmas are genetically related to KREEP in some manner, though their origin is still highly debated in the scientific community. The oldest of the Mg-suite rocks have crystallization ages of about 3.85 Ga. However, the last large impact that could have excavated deep into the crust (the Imbrium basin) also occurred at 3.85 Ga before present. Thus, it seems probable that Mg-suite plutonic activity continued for a much longer time, and that younger <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> exist deep below the surface.|$|E
2500|$|Textural {{criteria}} are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks {{where the majority}} of minerals will be {{visible to the naked eye}} or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. <b>Plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. [...] "olivine-bearing picrite" [...] or [...] "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{geological}} feature crossing the OWL is the Cascade Range, raised {{up in the}} Pliocene (two to five million years ago) {{as a result of}} the Cascadia subduction zone. [...] These mountains are distinctly different on either side of the OWL, the material of the South Cascades being Cenozoic (<66 Ma) volcanic and sedimentary rock, and the North Cascades being much older Paleozoic (hundreds of millions of years) metamorphic and <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks.</b> It is unknown whether this difference is in any way linked with the OWL, or is simply a coincidental regional difference.|$|E
50|$|Then on the 10th of July it was {{announced}} on NRK1, Norway's number one TV channel, that a meteorite {{had been found in}} a man's driveway south of Stavanger. The story was soon denounced by the experts as being a <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> from a nearby source.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island is}} the {{geological}} type {{area of the}} mineral labradorite, which is a plagioclase feldspar. [...] Labradorite is the principal component of the igneous rock type anorthosite. The Nain anorthosite batholith is a large igneous <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> complex that covers a large area {{of this part of}} Labrador.|$|R
50|$|Half Dome Granodiorite traces {{to early}} Late Cretaceous. It age is between 85 to 83.4 (+/-1 to 2%) Ma, with {{average age of}} 84.1 Ma. It is younger than Sentinel {{granodiorite}} (88.4 Ma), and older than Cathedral Peak granite (83.7 Ma). Half Dome Granodiorite is the Valley's youngest <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Volcanic {{rocks are}} {{apparent}} in the Muscat area, and are composed of serpentine and diorite, extending along the Gulf of Oman coast for ten or twelve [...] from the district of Darsait to Yiti. <b>Plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> constitute the hills and mountains of Muscat and span approximately [...] from Darsait to Ras Jissah. These igneous rocks consists of serpentine, greenstone and basalt, typical of rocks in southeastern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. South of Muscat, the volcanic rock strata are broken up and distorted, rising to a maximum height of , in Al Dakhiliyah, a region which includes Jebel Akhdar, the country's highest range. The hills in Muscat are mostly devoid of vegetation but are rich in iron.|$|E
2500|$|Puerto Rico is {{composed}} of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks,</b> which are overlain by younger Oligocene to recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks. Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern Oligocene to recent carbonates. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. These rocks may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed {{to come from the}} Pacific Ocean realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates. This means that it is currently being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by the interaction of these plates. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11, 1918, with [...] seismic moment estimated at 7.5 on the [...] moment magnitude scale. It originated off the coast of Aguadilla and was accompanied by a tsunami.|$|E

50|$|A {{batholith}} (from Greek bathos, depth + lithos, rock) {{is a large}} mass of {{igneous rock}} intrusive (also called <b>plutonic)</b> <b>rock</b> that forms from cooled magma deep in the Earth's crust. Batholiths are almost always made mostly of felsic or intermediate rock-types, such as granite, quartz monzonite, or diorite (see also granite dome).|$|R
50|$|Igneous {{rocks are}} divided into two main categories: <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> and volcanic. <b>Plutonic</b> or {{intrusive}} <b>rocks</b> result when magma cools and crystallizes slowly within the Earth's crust. A common example of this type is granite. Volcanic or extrusive rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as lava or fragmental ejecta, forming minerals such as pumice or basalt. The chemical abundance {{and the rate of}} cooling of magma typically forms a sequence known as Bowen's reaction series. Most major igneous rocks are found along this scale.|$|R
25|$|The core of {{the plateau}} {{is made up of}} {{volcanic}} rock, which is ringed by <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock.</b> The base is crystalline and metamorphic rock. The base rock is primarily gneiss and granite that dates to the Precambrian period. A layer of basalt covers this. Vulcanism has created fertile black and brown soils. Erosion played a large role.|$|R
