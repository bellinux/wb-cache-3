5000|$|The term [...] "penicillin" [...] {{is often}} used generically to refer to {{benzylpenicillin}} (penicillin G, the original penicillin found in 1928), procaine benzylpenicillin (procaine penicillin), benzathine benzylpenicillin (benzathine penicillin), and <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> (penicillin V). Procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin have the same antibacterial activity as benzylpenicillin but act {{for a longer period}} of time. <b>Phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> is less active against gram-negative bacteria than benzylpenicillin. Benzylpenicillin, procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin can be given by intravenous or intramuscular injections, but <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> can be given by mouth because of its acidic stability.|$|E
50|$|Treatment: Broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} therapy is needed, <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> likely is sufficient.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and costs of a multifaceted flexible educational programme aimed at reducing antibiotic dispensing at the practice level in primary care. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with general practices as the unit of randomisation and analysis. Clinicians and researchers were blinded to group allocation until after randomisation. SETTING: 68 general practices with about 480, 000 patients in Wales, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 34 practices were randomised to receive the educational programme and 34 practices to be controls. 139 clinicians from the intervention practices and 124 from control practices had agreed to participate before randomisation. Practice level data covering all the clinicians in the 68 practices were analysed. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention practices followed the Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) educational programme, which included a practice based seminar reflecting on the practices' own dispensing and resistance data, online educational elements, and practising consulting skills in routine care. Control practices provided usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total numbers of oral antibiotic items dispensed for all causes per 1000 practice patients in {{the year after the}} intervention, adjusted for the previous year's dispensing. Secondary outcomes included reconsultations, admissions to hospital for selected causes, and costs. RESULTS: The rate of oral antibiotic dispensing (items per 1000 registered patients) decreased by 14. 1 in the intervention group but increased by 12. 1 in the control group, a net difference of 26. 1. After adjustment for baseline dispensing rate, this amounted to a 4. 2 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 6 % to 7. 7 %) reduction in total oral antibiotic dispensing for the year in the intervention group relative to the control group (P= 0. 02). Reductions were found for all classes of antibiotics other than penicillinase-resistant penicillins but were largest and significant individually for <b>phenoxymethylpenicillins</b> (penicillin V) (7. 3 %, 0. 4 % to 13. 7 %) and macrolides (7. 7 %, 1. 1 % to 13. 8 %). There {{were no significant differences between}} intervention and control practices in the number of admissions to hospital or in reconsultations for a respiratory tract infection within seven days of an index consultation. The mean cost of the programme was £ 2923 (€ 3491, $ 4572) per practice (SD £ 1187). There was a 5. 5 % reduction in the cost of dispensed antibiotics in the intervention group compared with the control group (- 0. 4 % to 11. 4 %), equivalent to a reduction of about £ 830 a year for an average intervention practice. CONCLUSION: The STAR educational programme led to reductions in all cause oral antibiotic dispensing over the subsequent year with no significant change in admissions to hospital, reconsultations, or costs.

50|$|<b>Phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> {{is usually}} {{used only for}} the {{treatment}} of mild to moderate infections, and not for severe or deep-seated infections since absorption can be unpredictable. Except for the treatment or prevention of infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (which is uniformly sensitive to penicillin), therapy should be guided by bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response. People treated initially with parenteral benzylpenicillin may continue treatment with <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> by mouth once a satisfactory response has been obtained.|$|E
50|$|Benzathine is a diamine {{used as a}} {{component}} in some medications including benzathine <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> and benzathine benzylpenicillin. It stabilises penicillin and prolongs its sojourn when injected into tissues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> {{is usually}} well tolerated but may {{occasionally}} cause transient nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, constipation, acidic smell to urine and black hairy tongue. A previous hypersensitivity reaction to any penicillin is a contraindication.|$|E
50|$|Benzathine <b>phenoxymethyl{{penicillin}}</b> (rINN), {{also called}} penicillin V benzathine (USAN) or benzathine penicillin V, is a penicillin. The benzathine component is a diamine that stabilizes the penicillin component and prolongs its sojourn when injected into tissues, thus improving its pharmacokinetics.|$|E
50|$|It is less {{active than}} {{benzylpenicillin}} (penicillin G) against Gram-negative bacteria. <b>Phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> has {{a range of}} antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{that is similar to}} that of benzylpenicillin and a similar mode of action, but it is substantially less active than benzylpenicillin against Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenoxymethyl{{penicillin}},</b> {{also known}} as penicillin V, is an antibiotic useful {{for the treatment of}} a number of bacterial infections. Specifically it is used for the treatment of strep throat, otitis media, and cellulitis. It is also used to prevent rheumatic fever and to prevent infections following removal of the spleen. It is given by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Eli Lilly {{developed}} {{a method for}} producing 7-ACA based on cleaving the α-aminoadipoyl side chain of cephalosporin C. Further work by Robert Morin led to semisynthesis of 3-deacetoxy-7-ACA (7-ADCA) from penicillins which is convenient because penicillins can be fermented with more ease than cephalosporins. For example, 7-ADCA can be semisynthesized in seven chemical reaction steps from <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> {{was first}} made in 1948. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.05 to 0.96 USD per day. In the United States a course of treatment costs less than 25 USD.|$|E
5000|$|The {{narrow range}} of treatable {{diseases}} or [...] "spectrum of activity" [...] of the penicillins, along with the poor activity of the orally active <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin,</b> led {{to the search for}} derivatives of penicillin that could treat a wider range of infections. The isolation of 6-APA, the nucleus of penicillin, allowed for the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins, with various improvements over benzylpenicillin (bioavailability, spectrum, stability, tolerance).|$|E
50|$|Cefroxadine can be {{prepared}} by several routes, including {{one in which the}} enol is methylated with diazomethane as a key step. A rather more involved route starts with compatively readily available <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> sulfoxide benzhydryl ester (1).This undergoes fragmentation when treated with benzothiazole-2-thiol to give 2. Ozonolysis (reductive work-up) cleaves the olefinic linkage and the unsymmetrical disulfide moiety is converted to a tosyl thioester (3). The enol moiety is methylated with diazomethane, the six-membered ring is closed by reaction with 1,5-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-5-ene (DBU), and the ester protection is removed with trifluoroacetic acid to give 4. The amide side chain is removed by the usual PCl5/dimethylaniline sequence followed by reamidation with the appropriate acid chloride to give cefroxadine (5).|$|E
40|$|AbstractA <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> amidohydrolase which hydrolyses <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> to 6 -aminopenicillanic acid (6 -APA) {{has been}} {{isolated}} from {{two species of}} Penicillium chrysogenum. The amidohydrolase had a molecular mass of approx. 42 kDa. Its activity with benzylpenicillin as substrate was only 1. 5 % of that with <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> and it was inhibited by its products. No penicillin formation from 6 -APA and phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl coenzyme A was observed.

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the resistance profiles of Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens and to detect possible changes in antibiotic resistance over the time period of 1991 - 2005. Methods A. actinomycetemcomitans (125 strains), P. gingivalis (152 strains) and P. intermedia/P. nigrescens (326 strains) isolated during the years 1991 - 2005 were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin, metronidazole, <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> and tetracycline using the Etest. Results No antibiotic resistance was detected in P. gingivalis, whereas a few isolates of P. intermedia were not susceptible to clindamycin (0. 9 %), <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> (13. 5 %) or tetracycline (12. 6 %). Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline and metronidazole were the most effective antibiotics against A. actinomycetemcomitans with 0 %, 0. 8 % and 20. 8 % non-susceptible isolates, respectively. However, 88 % of the A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates were non-susceptible to <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> and 88 % to clindamycin. When strains isolated in the years 1991 - 94 were compared with those isolated in the years 2001 - 04, there was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains non-susceptible to clindamycin, metronidazole or <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin,</b> or in the percentage of P. intermedia strains non-susceptible to <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> or tetracycline (P > 0. 4 each).

40|$|Several penicillin-producing fungi were {{examined}} for {{ability to produce}} 6 -aminopenicillanic acid (6 -APA) and penicillin acylase. 6 -APA was found in corn steep liquor fermentations of Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Aspergillus ochraceous, and three strains of Penicillium sp. 6 -APA was not detected in fermentations of Epidermophyton floccosum although penicillins were produced. 6 -APA formed {{a large part of}} the total antibiotic production of T. mentagrophytes. The types of penicillins produced by various fungi were identified by paper chromatography, and it was found that all cultures produced benzylpenicillin. T. mentagrophytes and A. ochraceous showed increased yields of benzylpenicillin and the formation of <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> in response to the addition to the fermentation medium of phenylacetic acid and phenoxyacetic acid, respectively. Washed mycelia of the three Penicillium spp. and two high penicillin-yielding strains of P. chrysogenum possessed penicillin acylase activity against <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin.</b> A. ochraceous, T. mentagrophytes, E. floccosum, and Cephalosporium sp. also had penicillin acylase activity against <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin.</b> Only two of the above fungi, T. mentagrophytes and E. floccosum, showed significant penicillin acylase activity against benzylpenicillin; in both cases it was very low. The acylase activity of A. ochraceous was considerably increased by culturing in the presence of phenoxyacetic acid.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{treatment of}} group A beta haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis with amoxycillin once daily compared with <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> {{three or four}} times a day. DESIGN [...] Randomised controlled study of consecutive patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of group A beta haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in whom culture of a throat swab yielded positive results. SETTING [...] Five family medicine practices. SUBJECTS [...] 157 patients aged over 3 years who required treatment with antibiotics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Clinical response, bacteriological response, days at work and school lost, and compliance. RESULTS [...] During the period of the study 393 patients presented with symptoms suggesting streptococcal pharyngitis; 157 of them had throat swabs that yielded positive results on culture. Eighty two were treated with <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> and 75 with amoxycillin. No difference was observed in the clinical response, days at work and school lost (139 days for 64 patients taking <b>phenoxymethylpenicillin</b> v 100 days for 57 patients taking amoxycillin; p > 0. 2), or residual positive cultures after two days (6 (7. 3 %) v 3 (4 %); p > 0. 5). A significant difference in the bacteriological response was found after 14 days (5 (6. 1 %) v 0; p < 0. 04) with no positive cultures observed in the amoxycillin group.

PATIENTS [...] 51 Girls aged under 15 with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria. INTERVENTIONS [...] Before 1982 intercurrent infections (mostly tonsillitis or otitis) were treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin; after 1982 erythromycin treatment was preferred.
