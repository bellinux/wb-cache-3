Thus, it had decided to introduce overseas voting on a small scale at the next general elections. At that time, the law generally required overseas voters to have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two years during the five-year period before the prescribed date. However, Singaporeans whom the Government had posted abroad were exempted from this requirement and so were their families.

The inverted operator, called a backward abstract unification operator, computes all maximal <b>pre-conditions</b> {{for a given}} equation and its post-condition. It is a key operator in a backward analysis. The maximal preconditions are obtained by first calculating a superset of all preconditions and then generating all maximal <b>pre-conditions</b> from the superset.
