50|$|The Government of Cameroon {{demonstrated}} weak anti-trafficking {{law enforcement}} efforts {{over the last}} year. The government enacted no relevant legislation during the reporting period, and the country {{does not have a}} law prohibiting all forms of trafficking in persons, as its 2006 draft law against adult trafficking has yet to be passed and enacted. The country’s existing 2005 law against child trafficking and slavery prescribes a penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment for these offenses − a punishment that is sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses. During the reporting period, authorities investigated 26 new cases of human trafficking, as well as 18 other cases of possible trafficking offenses, none of which has resulted in a prosecution. All of the 26 cases involved children, and 10 of the cases were arrests and detentions pending trials. Several factors delay these cases, including the limited number of gendarmes and police officers available in rural areas, poor understanding of trafficking issues among victims who may be illiterate, and the lack of any security units specifically assigned to anti-trafficking details. The remaining 16 cases were alleged trafficking offenders who were caught in the act and arrested, but finally released after the matter was resolved either at the level of security forces, social affairs agencies, or a human rights lawyer’s chambers. To address these cases, officials used the 2005 anti-child trafficking law and the <b>pertinent</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Penal Code. The government reported no trafficking convictions during the reporting period. The government did not investigate traditional leaders in the Northern Region suspected of keeping hereditary servants in conditions of involuntary servitude. Official sources give no indication that the government facilitates or condones trafficking, though there were signs of some officials’ involvement in trafficking. In November 2009, a Bamenda-based lawyer filed a complaint against a commissioner of one of the police districts for complicity in child trafficking. The lawyer claimed that the commissioner opposed the arrest and detention of a woman caught while committing transnational trafficking. The Bamenda High Court took no action on the complaint against the police commissioner during the reporting period.|$|E

5000|$|United Nations Administrative {{tribunal}} with Judge Sumar Sen as president, in {{a seminal}} Judgment on affirmative action, held : [...] "that the various resolutions for Improvement {{of the status}} of women in the Secretariat which have been referred to and statements of the Secretary-General have conceded the existence of an unsatisfactory history with respect to the recruitment and promotion of women that does not accord with Article 8 of the Charter. In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Article 8 of the Charter must be regarded as a source of authority for reasonable efforts to improve the status of women. It would be anomalous indeed if this unsatisfactory history had to remain unremedied for an unduly long period. Unless affirmative action measures are taken towards ameliorating the effects of this past history, they will, without doubt, be perpetuated for many years. This is incompatible with the objectives of Article 8, as recognized by the General Assembly. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that Article 8 permits the adoption of reasonable affirmative action measures for improvement {{of the status of}} women." [...] The Tribunal added that, [...] "as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates; obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior". The Tribunal, however, cautioned that affirmative action, however laudable, did not justify any weakening of the requirements of Article 101 (3) of the Charter that officials of the Organization be of [...] "the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity": [...] "In evaluating the reasonableness of affirmative action measures, <b>pertinent</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Charter may not be ignored. The Tribunal considers that, with respect to affirmative action measures, it would be impermissible to view Article 8 of the Charter as overriding Article 101 (3) ... This language unequivocally establishes a standard under which less qualified persons are not entitled to preferential treatment based on gender. The fundamental principle reflected in Article 101 (3) may not be diluted by a desire, however commendable, to overcome past problems.” The Tribunal concluded that, [...] "as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates(emphasis added); obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior".|$|E

On April 10, 2015, the CHED granted Pampanga Campus the permit to operate First Year and Second Year of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology. On July 7, 2015, the Our Lady of Fatima University Pampanga Campus pioneered the program of Bachelor of Science in Culinary Management in the Philippines that was granted by CHED in virtue of the University’s status as an Autonomous Higher Education Institution and {{in accordance with the}} <b>pertinent</b> <b>provisions</b> of RA 7722, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Act of 1994.” Due to this increasing number of students and programs, the second building named after Saint Jacinta, was built. [...] The University did not stop in offering the best for the Kapampangans but it kept committed on improving its services to its students. The Regional Office III of the Department of Education granted the campus permit to operate for its Junior High School (Grade Seven to Grade Ten) on March 26, 2015 replacing ECC under the name of Our Lady of Fatima University - Pampanga. Hereafter, the Basic Education Department has become an ESC-FAPE accredited educational institution last March 10, 2015. The students of the Junior High School of the campus grew in number hence it became imperative to build the campus’ third building called the Blessed Francisco Building. On the 28th of July 2015, the Our Lady of Fatima University - Pampanga already replaced the name ‘East Central Colleges’ by the registration granted by the Security and Exchange Commission in Manila. Even if the campus is only at its third year of operation, its youth did not deter it to offer quality services that would be at par with the international standard. The International Organization for Standardization, an international institution that develops and sets standards, audited the Campus last September 10, 2015 for quality management setting known as the ISO 9001. Through AJA Registrars, the Pampanga Campus of the University was certified with an ISO 9001:2008 for meeting the internationally standardized quality management system that the organization has set. In October 2015, the campus offered the Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM).

40|$|Cet article traite de l'utilisation de la {{convention}} collective en tant qu'outil d'intervention en matière de santé au travailThis study {{deals with the}} effectiveness of the collective agreement as a means of intervention in questions of occupational health. The first part of the study briefly situates the question of occupational health in historical and present perspectives. The possibility of inserting preventive measures in collective agreements is then treated, followed by the elaboration of research objectives. The potential impact of the collective agreement on occupational health is limited by several factors. Nevertheless, the successes registered through them seem significant to concrete action in the workplace, and have been repeatedly and will probably continue to be used. The task at hand, therefore, is to analyse the degree of success achieved. The study's sample included 491 collective agreements negotiated in the following sectors: manufacturing, mining and forest products. The contents of the collective agreements were analyzed by type of provision. Most frequent were references to participatory bodies (joint or otherwise) governing protective equipment and compensation. Second in importance were references to health services, information, the right of refusal, and inspection. Provisions on training and rehabilitation are less frequent, while. those on research are almost non-existent. Each classification is clearly defined, and statistical tables are provided on several points. The interpretation of results is subdivised into two parts:— The information available reveals a definite general interest of the bargaining partners regarding occupational health. Thus, approximately 80 % of the collective agreements contained at least one <b>pertinent</b> <b>provision.</b> — This overall interest, however, must be clearly distinguished from its effectiveness in practice. As regards the second part, several points are dealt with:— In order to provide meaningful protection in the areas of prevention and compensation, the relevant provisions must be as encompassing as possible. In fact, {{less than half of the}} collective agreements even approach this criteria. — The practical impact of the relevant provisions, based on their precision, varies a great deal from one agreement to the next. — Taken quantitatively, the relevant provisions are more oriented toward compensation than prevention, such as research, information and training. In view of such results, it should be recognized that Law 17 (Loi sur la santé et la sécurité au travail), if properly applied, will permit a greater number of workers to benefit from the rights and remedial structures contained presently in a limited number of collective agreements. — On the other hand, the results of this study should not be considered purely in quantitative terms. In several cases, provisions of less general impact were revealed to be very effective from the point of view of concrete applications of the collective agreement. The development of preoccupations with occupational health in collective agreements is considered in the folio wing two ways: the increase in the use of provisions concerning occupational health over the years, as well as the impact of recent provincial legislation on occupational health and safety. In conclusion, the limits of the collective agreement, as practised in our industrial relations System, are evaluated...|$|R
