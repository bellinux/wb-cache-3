60|$|During {{the past}} fiscal year the {{financial}} {{condition of the}} Post-Office Department {{has been one of}} increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in being able to state that the actual <b>postal</b> <b>revenue</b> has nearly equaled the entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and the former to $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In 1860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to $5,656,705.49, the postal receipts of that year being $2,645,722.19 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent, but the annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced 35 per cent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post-Office Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole service.|$|E

60|$|I {{have said}} that the {{correspondence}} circulating in the United States is less than that of the United Kingdom. In making any comparison between them, I am obliged to arrive at facts, or rather at the probabilities of facts, in a somewhat circuitous mode, as the Americans have kept no account of the number of letters which pass through their post-offices in a year; we can, however, make an estimate, which, if incorrect, shall not at any rate be incorrect against them. The gross <b>postal</b> <b>revenue</b> of the United States for the year ended June 30th, 1861, was in round figures 1,700,000l. This was the amount actually cashed, exclusive of a sum of 140,000l. paid to the post-office by the government for the carriage of what is called in that country free mail matter; otherwise, books, letters, and parcels franked by members of Congress. The gross <b>postal</b> <b>revenue</b> of the United Kingdom was in the last year, in round figures, 3,358,000l., exclusive of a sum of 179,000l. claimed as earned for carrying official postage, and also exclusive of 127,866l., that being the amount of money order commissions, which in this country is considered a part of the post-office revenue. In the United States there is at present no money order office. In the United Kingdom the sum of 3,358,000l. was earned by the conveyance and delivery of 593,000,000 of letters, 73,000,000 of newspapers, 12,000,000 of books. What number of each was conveyed through the post in the United States we have no means of knowing; but presuming the average rate of postage on each letter in the States to be the same as it is in England, and presuming also that letters, newspapers, and books circulated in the same proportion there as they do with us, the sum above named of 1,700,000l. will have been earned by carrying about 300,000,000 of letters. But the average rate of postage in the States is in fact higher than it is in England. The ordinary single rate of postage there is three cents, or three half-pence, whereas with us it is a penny; and if three half-pence might be taken as the average rate in the United States, the number of letters would be reduced from 300,000,000 to 200,000,000 a year. There is, however, a class of letters which in the States are passed through the post-office at the rate of one half-penny a letter, whereas there is no rate of postage with us less than a penny. Taking these half-penny letters into consideration, I am disposed to regard the average rate of American postage at about five farthings, which would give the number of letters at 250,000,000. We shall at any rate be safe in saying that the number is considerably less than 300,000,000, and that it does not amount to half the number circulated with us. But the difference between our population and their population is not great. The population of the States during the year in question was about 27,000,000, exclusive of slaves, and that of the British Isles was about 29,000,000. No doubt in the year named the correspondence of the States had been somewhat disturbed by the rebellion; but that disturbance, up to the end of June, 1861, had been very trifling. The division of the Southern from the Northern States, as far as the post-office was concerned, did not take place till the end of May, l861; and therefore but one month in the year was affected by the actual secession of the South. The gross <b>postal</b> <b>revenue</b> of the States which have seceded was, for the year prior to secession, 1,200,500 dollars, and for that one month of June it would therefore have been a little over 100,000 dollars, or 20,000l. That sum may therefore be presumed to have been abstracted by secession from the gross annual revenue of the post-office. Trade, also, was no doubt injured by the disturbance in the country, and the circulation of letters was, as a matter of course, to some degree affected by this injury; but it seems that the gross revenue of 1861 was less than that of 1860 by only one thirty-sixth. I think, therefore, that we may say, making all allowance that can be fairly made, that the number of letters circulating in the United Kingdom is more than double that which circulates, or ever has circulated, in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This case {{is set in}} August 2012, about 10 {{months after}} the ‘Ready for the Future’ (RTF) Transformation Programme had been {{implemented}} at Singapore Post Limited (SingPost). The programme had been planned {{in response to the}} new challenges and opportunities that had arisen in the postal industry. In the last decade or so, most postal services around the world had witnessed a decline in demand for their basic mail services with the boom in Internet-based alternatives, such as e-mail and online bill-payment. Bucking the international trend, SingPost had managed to grow its total <b>postal</b> <b>revenue</b> from approximately US$ 244 million in 2001 to nearly US$ 325 million in 2011. Its careful preparation in anticipation of global trends, its search for alternative revenue sources, and an increase in Singapore’s population were some reasons why SingPost seemed able to outperform the industry worldwide. However, a closer examination of the components of the mail revenue would show that SingPost was not wholly immune to the global shift. Stamped mail, mostly from private individual customers, reduced from 180 million units in 2002 to 130 million units in 2011. Furthermore, rising global trends in market liberalisation had brought in new entrants into the once exclusive postal markets. SingPost had recognised that adapting to these new economic conditions was critical to the survival of a modern postal service. The RTF Programme was a 30 -month strategy to increase service volume by expanding into a regional network through acquisition and investment in more efficient infrastructure, IT, and talent. The strategy was based on acquisition and investment along five different ‘pillars’ [...] mail, digital services, logistics, e-commerce and retail and financial services [...] to increase revenue and fill the void left by declining mail. Although the results over the past 10 months had been encouraging, would the roadmap laid out by the RTF programme enable SingPost to become a leader in e-commerce delivery solutions?
