The mechanisms by which thermal and catalytic treatments deconstruct lignite remain elusive, which is where quantum mechanical calculations can offer fundamental insights. In order to investigate the cleavage of <b>C-O</b> bridge <b>bond,</b> which is the critical step in the thermal decomposition of lignite, the alpha-O- 4 and beta-O- 4 types of structural units are selected as lignite model compounds to calculate the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> dissociation enthalpies using several kinds of density functional theory methods (B 3 PW 91, B 3 P 86, PBE 1 PBE, BMK, M 06 - 2 X and M 05 - 2 X) at 6 - 31 +G(d,p) level. By the comparison between the results and the theoretical benchmark values provided by CBS-QB 3 method, M 05 - 2 X functional was applied for the calculations on <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> dissociation enthalpies.

An electron donating group can stabilize the phenoxy radicals (radical effect), however, an electron withdrawing group has the opposite effect. In most cases, the radical effect is more important than the ground-state effect. Furthermore, there is a negligible correlation between the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> distances and strengths, and the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> dissociation enthalpies cannot be predicted so easily.

40|$|As {{fossil fuel}} {{resources}} {{become more and more}} scarce, attention has been turned to alternative sources of fuels and energy. One promising prospect is the conversion of methane (natural gas) to methanol, which requires an initial activation of a C-H bond and subsequent formation of a <b>C-O</b> <b>bond.</b> The most well studied methodologies for both C-H activation and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> formation involve oxidation of the metal center. Metal complexes with facile access to oxidation states separated by four charge units, required for two subsequent oxidations, are rare. Non-oxidative methods to perform C-H <b>bond</b> activation or <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> formation must be pursued in order for methane to methanol to become a viable strategy. In this dissertation studies on redox and non-redox methods for both C-H activation and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> formation are discussed. In the early chapters <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> formation in the form of reductive functionalization is modeled. Polypyridine ligated rhodium complexes were studied computationally to determine the properties that would promote reductive functionalization.

The thesis is divided in two chapters describing two different catalytic systems. Chapter 2 describes a heterogeneous palladium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenolysis of primary, secondary, and tertiary benzylic alcohols to generate the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbons using formic acid as the hydrogen donor. A detailed mechanistic investigation of this reaction has been conducted that establish the kinetic order of each reaction component and also the deuterium kinetic isotope effects.

40|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism of the}} L-proline-catalyzed alpha-aminoxylation reaction between aldehyde and nitrosobenzene has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Our calculation results reveal following conclusions [1]. The first step that corresponds {{to the formation of}} <b>C-O</b> <b>bond,</b> is the stereocontrolling and rate-determining step [2]. Among four reaction channels, the syn-attack reaction channel is more favorable than that of the anti one, and the TS-ss channel dominates among the four channels for this reaction in the step of <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> formation [3]. The intermolecular hydrogen bond between the acidic hydrogen of L-proline and the N atom of the nitrosobenzene in an early stage of the process catalyzes very effectively the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> formation by a large stabilization of the negative charge that is developing at the O atom along the electrophilic attack [4]. The effect of solvent decreases the activation energy, and also, the calculated energy barriers are decrease with the enhancement of dielectric constants for <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> formation step. These results are in good agreement with experiment, and allow us to explain the origin of the catalysis and stereoselectivity for L-proline-catalyzed alpha-aminoxylation of aldehyde reaction.

To better understand the chemistry of THFA, the reaction energies and the corresponding energy barriers of selective <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> hydrogenolysis and ring-opening of THFA on Rh(111) for the formation of 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran (2 -MeTHF), 1, 5 -pentanediol (1, 5 -PeD), and 1, 2 -pentanediol (1, 2 -PeD) were studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that starting from THFA to produce 2 -MeTHF, the direct <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage of the CH 2 OH group is not favored. Alternatively and more preferentially, the reaction occurs through the initial activation of C-H bond on the side chain, followed by dehydroxylation and hydrogenation. On the other hand, in the metal catalyzed ring-opening process of THFA to 1, 5 -PeD and 1, 2 -PeD, the first dehydrogenation of secondary CH-O or primary CH 2 -O moiety in the ring decreases the barriers of the subsequent <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> dissociation.
