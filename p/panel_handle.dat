40|$|AbstractTo {{increase}} the competition {{of the solar}} energy collection system, {{the size of the}} solar panel module during the manufacturing process is being increased continuously. As the size of the solar panel increases, the size of the robot to <b>handle</b> the <b>panel</b> increased also. The change in scale of the robot inevitably results in the amplification of the adverse effect of the flexure. The main source of the flexure in the large scale solar cell <b>panel</b> <b>handling</b> system is the long and thin fork fingers of the hand and the solar cell panel. In addition, the belt-driven actuator system used by most of the large scale <b>panel</b> <b>handling</b> robot is another significant source of the vibration. In this paper, the flexible multi body dynamic model of a large scale solar cell <b>panel</b> <b>handling</b> robot, which is being designed and constructed with the help of Kyung Hee University, is developed. The belt-driven system in the robot is also modeled as flexible system and included in the robot to represent the actual vibration characteristics of the actuator system...|$|R

40|$|It is not {{surprising}} that this biased pan-el upheld all of its own Lyme guidelines recommendations, which ignore clinical judgment and treatment options [3]. In dismissing 1600 pages of peer-reviewed studies as “anecdotes, ” the Lyme Disease Review Panel disregarded evidence that the number of patients in all controlled trials of persistent Lyme disease totals a mere 221 [5], that studies of these patients have yielded mixed results [6], that the risk of extended antibiotic therapy is extremely low [7], and that a key study by Klempner et al [8] was seriously underpowered and therefore inadequate to deny extended treatment to patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms [9]. When the science is uncertain, guidelines panels should not usurp risk/benefit decisions that properly belong to clinicians and patients. Perhaps the most glaring manipulation of the review process was the Review <b>Panel’s</b> <b>handling</b> of its 4 : 4 split vote on Lyme testing [10]. The guidelines clearly state that commercial Lyme testing is man-datory for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, despite the insensitivity of the tests. The Review Panel first claimed that the man-datory testing requirement was an “ad-monition ” rather than a true recommen-dation, rendering the split vote irrelevant. Then, taking refuge behind boilerplate dis-claimer language drafted for legal rather than clinical purposes, the Review Panel effectively upheld the mandatory testing recommendation [3]. The role of a medical society is not to “call the science ” according to the vote of a panel that represents one side of a de-bate. Every guidelines panel should ac-knowledge diversity of opinion, defer to clinical judgment, and respect patient au-tonomy. Failure to do so may produce a short-term benefit in terms of upholding the status quo and protecting the society from litigation, but the ultimate cost may be severe damage to patient care and the society’s reputation as an impartial au-thority on good medicine. A Pyrrhic vic-tory indeed. Acknowledgment...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{modeling}} energy resource allocation, including dispatch, storage, and the longterm investments in new technologies, capturing different sources of uncertainty such as energy from wind, demands, prices, and rainfall.

40|$|Fan-out Wafer Level Packaging (FOWLP) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{packaging}} trends in microelectronics. Mold embedding for this technology is currently done on wafer level up to 12 "/ 300 mm size. For higher productivity and therewith lower costs larger mold embedding form factors are forecasted for the near future. Following the wafer level approach then the next step will be a reconfigured wafer diameter of 450 mm. An alternative option would be leaving the wafer shape and moving to panel sizes leading to Fan-out Panel Level Packaging (FOPLP). Sizes for the panel could range up to 18 "× 24 " or even larger. For reconfigured mold embedding, compression mold processes are used in combination with liquid or granular compound. As an alternative process, lamination can be considered where also sheet compounds can be used. Using maskless laser direct imaging technologies (LDI) instead of photolithography has a high potential for further cost reduction with intrinsic process advantages. The LDI cost advantage is backed by LDI availability for large panel sizes, also including 450 mm wafer form factors. Already today PCB technologies offer the potential for large area panel packaging up to 24 "× 18 "/ 610 × 457 mm 2 and can be applied to form a redistribution layer [RDL] for large area reconfigured wafers or panels, replacing thin film redistribution. For PCB based RDLs a resin coated copper sheet (RCC) is laminated on the reconfigured wafer or panel, respectively. Micro vias are drilled through the RCC layer to the die pads and electrically connected by Cu plating. Final process step is the etching of Cu lines using LDI techniques for maskless patterning. State of the art equipment and materials allow the manufacturing of structures down to 20 μm lines and spaces with a clear development trend to 10 μm lines and spaces and hence getting close to photolithography thin film structure sizes. Based on the technology described above the Fan [...] ut Panel Level Packaging approach will be demonstrated on full 24 "× 18 "/ 610 × 457 mm 2 format including large area embedding and redistribution. Related technology challenges as die shift, warpage, <b>panel</b> <b>handling</b> or yield will be discussed in detail. Using maskless LDI technology real die positions can be automatically adapted to the redistribution and hence less accurate die placement can be compensated and higher die shift could be tolerated which is a big advantage when moving towards large area with acceptable yield. In summary this paper describes the technological path from wafer level embedding to 24 "× 18 " fan-out panel level packaging technology in combination with low cost PCB based RDL processes. The technology described offers a cost effective packaging solution for various scenarios e. g. as packages for handheld consumer applications or bio-medical applications as sensor integration into microfluidics...|$|R
2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution <b>panel</b> to <b>handle</b> harmonics. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.|$|R

40|$|Nonparametric {{efficiency}} {{analysis has}} become a widely applied technique to support industrial benchmarking {{as well as a}} variety of incentive-based regulation policies. In practice such exercises are often plagued by incomplete knowledge about the correct specifications of inputs and outputs. Simar and Wilson (2001) and Schubert and Simar (2011) propose restriction tests to support such specification decisions for cross-section data. However, the typical oligopolized market structure pertinent to regulation contexts often leads to low numbers of cross-section observations, rendering reliable estimation based on these tests practically unfeasible. This small-sample problem could often be avoided with the use of panel data, which would in any case require an extension of the cross-section restriction tests to <b>handle</b> <b>panel</b> data.

Third, it takes into account arbitrary correlations (for example, among firms). Fourth, it does not require making unrealistic assumptions (such as the assumption of independence among firms within the same market).
