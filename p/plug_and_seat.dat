50|$|During the Occupation of France and in {{the years}} shortly after World War II, Régnier {{designed}} and produced a set of three simplified four-cylinder inverted air-cooled inline engines of increasing capacity and power, the 4J, 4K and 4L. The specifications of the post-war 4L engine are similar, though not identical to, those of the pre-war R.4, whilst those of the pre-war R.4L specifications are closer {{to that of the}} post-war 4K. In 1946 or 1947, Régnier, now nationalised, was absorbed into SNECMA and the 4L engines, the most widely used member of the series, became the SNECMA-Régnier 4L. Notable constructional features, shared with the 4J and 4K engines, included machined steel cylinder barrels with external baked-on anti-corrosion varnish and separate cylinder heads with unusual metallo-plastic seals, held to the crankcase by long bolts. Screwed-in <b>plug</b> bushes <b>and</b> valve <b>seats</b> were made from aluminium-bronze. The 4L's five-bearing steel crankshaft was forged, as were the duralumin connecting rods which had split, steel backed, bronze bearings. The crankcase was cast from aluminium alloy.|$|R
