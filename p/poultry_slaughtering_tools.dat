Lamentably the rate of chicken slaughter premises which got halal accreditation from the Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (JAKIM) and the Jabatan Agama Islam Negeri (JAIN) is low. This {{study was conducted to}} identify the application of the halal slaughtering concept as indicated by Islamic Law, taking into account four fundamental variables which poultry slaughterhouse managements, works procedures in slaughterhouses, the <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> process and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> equipment. This study was conducted in the Pontian area, with the number of respondents that was 19 among poultry slaughterhouse managers. A questionnaire was utilized as the research instrument.

40|$|After the {{implementation}} of new health inspection regulations in 2000 there was a precipitous decline {{of the number of}} slaughter plants in the United States. Particularly affected were small and very small slaughter plants. This loss of capacity is affecting local food supply chains and may limit local supply options. The empirical analysis in this thesis uses the spatial distribution of people and livestock to analyze the location choice decisions of existing and new meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> facilities. Utilizing a spatial probit estimator the model analyzes how location factors from the existing stock of USDA inspected meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> plants in 2007 are different from new USDA inspected plants established during the time period 2008 - 2010. This comparison provides an understanding of factors that affect the location decision of new USDA inspected plants. Empirical results reveal that slaughter plant location behavior is strongly affected by the location of existing firms, infrastructure, and agglomeration factors. Inspection type as well as input supplies also significantly influences the location choice of USDA inspected meat and poultry plants. The analysis further reveals that new USDA inspected meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> plants increasingly tend to locate in the Northeast region, as compared to the North Central Region and other areas of the United States. ...|$|R

Four HACCP models of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> house including refrigerated chicken carcasses, frozen chicken cuts, refrigerated waterfowl carcasses, and frozen waterfowl cuts were offered by this system. Users could also append their monitoring items, adjust the control limits, and create new slaughter processes according to individual situation of slaughter house. After setting up of CCP, users selected the CCP items and input the values from monitoring data to accomplish the record. These input values compare with the values user set, to see if it is unusual or not, and saved into database. The output reports can either be selected by one period of a monitoring item, the records of batches, the records of dates, or the records of the abnormal monitoring item, and to help users to evaluate their HACCP system at slaughter houses. This system also provided the information of possible causes and executed the correction steps of common hazards so that could assist producers to promote the sanitation level of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> houses and achieve the safety target of meat products. 本研究之目的，在建立家禽屠宰場之線上HACCP（危害分析與重要管制點）記錄與監控系統。經由網際網路連結至伺服器，家禽屠宰業者即可紀錄場內重要管制點之監測值。本系統以網頁之方式呈現，運用ASP.

Investigations were {{performed}} in the project „Unfharmfull disposal of inedible animal by-products in the AP of Vojvodina by their technical processing and base parameters of profitability of their processing“that {{was supported by the}} Provincial Secretary for science and technological development, Nr. 114 - 451 - 01458 / 2008. Abstract. In this study, nutritional components that are obtained during <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> having significance with respect to processing into animal feeds were investigated. By-products obtained during <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> are considered very valuable raw materials for production of highly valuable animal feeds and energetic feeds. Recognition of chemical and physical characteristics of the raw materials represents essential prerequisite for conduction of any technological process, for proper raw materials handling {{as well as for the}} equipment and machines design that are necessary for acceptance and processing of the inedible slaughterhouse by-products. Authors have found that the nitrogen complex of the examined raw materials contains predominantly proteins. Digestible nitrogen for all investigated raw materials equals approximately with total nitrogen content, indicating that all proteins from these raw materials are accessible for utilization in animal organism, with exception of feathers that need special technological processing. Basic chemical composition, nitrogen fractions and amino acid composition of the inedible by-products from poultry slaughterhouses indicate that the processing of these raw materials could be directed into production of swine and pet feeds production, as well in production of bio fuels and biogas. Blood and feathers anyhow represent significant protein source, and soft wastes, heads and legs, as well as the mixed raw material, besides as protein source, can be regarded as raw fat source.

40|$|Background and Aim: Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{digestive}} diseases in the world. Salmonellosis is caused by varieties of salmonella serotypes and there are concerns about the contamination of poultry and its products by this microorganism. Given that the carcasses of poultry, as a major source of infection with this microorganism, determine the frequency and the rate of this type of bacterial contamination, they are considered a criterion in the assessment of the health status of respective poultry farms and their potential health hazards to consumers. The present study aimed at determining prevalence of salmonella contamination of poultry carcasses in Birjand industrial slaughterhouses in 2012. Materials and Methods: Immediately after <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering,</b> 550 samples were randomly taken from different slaughterhouses. Salmonella spp were isolated from suspected positive cultures. Then, they were identified and confirmed by means of biochemical and serological tests. Results: Based on the results of bacteriological tests, out of a total of 250 samples taken from the <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtered</b> before putting in boiling water, 8 cases (3. 2 %) were positive for Salmonella contamination. Serotyping results revealed that all isolates belonged to Salmonella infantis serotype. Among a total of 300 samples taken from the cases after being placed in boiling water, only one sample (0. 3 %) was positive for Salmonella infantis. Conclusion: The results indicate that there is a relatively low prevalence of salmonella contamination in the poultry farms in the South Khorasan. Furthermore, lack of diversity in salmonella isolates reveals good health control and low levels of microbial transmission into poultry farms of this area. The outbreak of Salmonella infantis is uniformly consistent with the global spread of this serotype. Differences in the frequency of positive samples before and after placing the carcasses in boiling water may reveal the role of boiling process in reducing salmonella contamination of <b>slaughtered</b> <b>poultry...</b>|$|R

This paper evaluates the performance of a lab-scale advanced wastewater treatment system that consists of sequencing batch reactor (SBR), chemical–dissolved-air flotation (DAF) system and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, used for the reclamation from anaerobically pre-treated poultry slaughterhouse wastewater. Twelve-hour cycles in a fill-aerobic-anoxic-settle-discharge sequence and ethanol addition as carbon source for denitrification at 1. 41 ± 0. 19 C/N ratio were the SBR operating conditions for nitrogen removal. Ferric chloride and cationic polymer as flocculant aid were the chemicals used for phosphorus removal. 4. 5 – 5. 5 coagulation pH, 1. 32 ± 0. 19 Fe/P molar ratio associated with 1. 0 mgL− 1 cationic polymer, 20 % recycle rate and 10 cmmin− 1 flotation velocity were the best chemical–DAF system operating conditions from which resulted > 99 % phosphorus and 65 ± 25 % suspended solids removals.
