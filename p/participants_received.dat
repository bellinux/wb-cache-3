5|$|The final {{decision}} was made at the 83rd FIDE Congress in September 2012 in Istanbul. Out of the three bidding cities, the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting. Thereafter, discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised. The first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan, who stated that the Armenian chess players would {{find it difficult to}} play in Baku, since the two nations were in armed conflict. The second concern was related to the difficulties that the participants may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country. In his speech during the congress, Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions, where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met, and no incident was ever recorded. He also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win. With regard to the visa issue, Rahimov mentioned the positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> their visas on arrival at the airport without any problem. He also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily. The next speaker was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who suggested that the 42nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{the company was}} not {{exceptionally}} productive, and while sales were up, income was not. Morale was low in some areas, and lowe {{came up with the}} idea of meeting with small groups of employees at his home. Before each meeting, <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> the usual packet of information about the company, but they also got a copy of “Robert K. Greenleaf’s booklet, “The Servant as Leader.” The result of the employee meetings was The People Objective which stated how employees thought Texas Distributors employees should operate.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} game’s promotions, {{there was}} a Voltron {{scavenger}} hunt that {{took place at the}} convention. The scavenger hunt entitled, The Hunt to Form Voltron had participants use their smartphones to find the five Voltron lion stands and their corresponding QR codes. At each stand, <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> an exclusive button and a chance to win a variety of collectible prizes from THQ, Mattel, WEP, Viz Media and Classic Media including: a 92-inch flat screen Mitsubishi television, an Xbox 360 console, classic Voltron action figures, Voltron retro T-shirts and DVDs.|$|E

25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased. Under that condition, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment.|$|E
25|$|The 1981–82 {{season was}} Wynter's last for Jamaica. He {{appeared}} in five first-class matches, taking a career-best taking 14 wickets {{for the season}} (at 32.85). The following season, in January and February 1983, Wynter left Jamaica and controversially toured South Africa with a West Indies XI. The tour drew heavy criticism, due to its breaking of the sporting boycott of the country (in place during apartheid). Wynter played only a single major fixture on tour, a match against the South African national team. Opening the bowling with Sylvester Clarke in South Africa's first innings, he took the wickets of Kevin McKenzie and Garth Le Roux, finishing with 2/26. For {{taking part in the}} rebel tour, Wynter and the other <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> a life ban from professional cricket in the West Indies. He subsequently settled in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The hype around The Grey Album {{caught the}} {{attention}} of Beatles' copyright holder EMI, who ordered Danger Mouse and retailers carrying the album to cease distribution. Music industry activist group Downhill Battle responded by coordinating Grey Tuesday, an electronic civil disobedience event held on 24 February 2004. Participating websites posted copies of The Grey Album for free download for a 24-hour period in protest of EMI's attempts to prevent distribution of the mashup on the grounds that sampling is fair use and that a statutory license should be provided {{in the same manner as}} if an artist were to perform or record a cover version of a song. Hundreds of web sites publicized the event with 170 hosting the album for download. Over 100,000 copies were downloaded on that day alone. The legal repercussions of the protest were minimal; a number of the <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> cease and desist letters from EMI, but no charges were filed in connection with the event.|$|E

25|$|Another study {{examined}} the incorporation of music with therapeutic upper extremity exercises on pain perception in stroke victims. Over the course of eight weeks, stroke victims participated in upper extremity exercises (of the hand, wrist, and shoulder joints) in conjunction {{with one of the}} three conditions: song, karaoke accompaniment, and no music. Patients participated in each condition once, according to a randomized order, and rated their perceived pain immediately after the session. Results showed that although {{there was no significant difference}} in pain rating across the conditions, video observations revealed more positive affect and verbal responses while performing upper extremity exercises with both music and karaoke accompaniment. Nayak et al. examined the combination of music therapy with traditional stroke rehabilitation and also found that the addition of music therapy improved mood and social interaction. Participants who had suffered traumatic brain injury or stroke were placed in one of two conditions: standard rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation along with music therapy. <b>Participants</b> <b>received</b> three treatments per week for up to ten treatments. Therapists found that participants who received music therapy in conjunction with traditional methods had improved social interaction and mood.|$|E
25|$|The <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> a life ban from Caribbean cricket in 1983. In many instances, {{they were}} ostracised {{socially}} and professionally, {{such was the}} hostility toward players that complied with the South African apartheid system. In contrast, the players commented on a warm reception from both blacks and whites in South Africa and the tour {{may have been a}} positive influence on relations between races. It {{was one of the few}} occasions when white and black people had played sport together in South Africa. The players' bans were lifted in 1989 (although Lynch appeared in ODI's for England a year earlier against the touring West Indians) but the only tour member who played for West Indies again was Moseley, at the age of 32 (two tests in the 1989-90 home series against England: though he did not take many wickets, his appearance was chiefly notable for breaking Graham Gooch's hand, forcing Gooch - now England's captain - to miss the remainder of the series). Stephenson and Clarke had very successful first-class careers in South African and English domestic cricket: and Stephenson in particular could perhaps be thought unlucky not to be given a chance in Test cricket, given the precedent set by Moseley's selection and the fact that his performances in the English county championship had been nothing short of spectacular.|$|E

For US$2,000, <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> five days of an [...] "immersive adventure camp", including one-on-one coaching from Hill and other famous climbers. As of 2012 Hill was living in Boulder, Colorado and still travelling widely. From Boulder she runs a small business offering climbing courses and also works as a technical adviser for various climbing gear companies. As of 2013, Hill was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company.

500|$|A Department of Veterans' Affairs study {{concluded}} that [...] "Overall, the doses received by Australian participants were small.... Only 2% of <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> more than the current Australian annual dose limit for occupationally exposed persons (20 mSv)." [...] However, such findings are contested. Australian servicemen were ordered to: repeatedly fly through the mushroom clouds from atomic explosions, without protection; and to march into ground zero immediately after bomb detonation. [...] Airborne drifts of radioactive material resulted in [...] "radioactive rain" [...] being dropped on Brisbane and Queensland country areas. A 1999 study for the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association found that 30 per cent of involved veterans had died, mostly in their fifties, from cancers.|$|E
500|$|In Hobart, Amundsen {{received}} congratulatory telegrams from, among others, former US President Theodore Roosevelt and King George V of the United Kingdom. The king expressed particular {{pleasure that}} Amundsen's first {{port of call}} on his return had been on soil of the British Empire. In Norway, which only six years earlier had become an independent country after 500 years of Danish and Swedish supremacy, the news was proclaimed in banner headlines, and the national flag was flown throughout the country. [...] All the expedition's <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> the Norwegian South Pole medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), established by King Haakon to commemorate the expedition. [...] However, Amundsen's biographer Roland Huntford refers to [...] "the chill underneath the cheers"; there remained a residue of unease over Amundsen's tactics. One Norwegian newspaper expressed relief that Amundsen had found a new route, and had not intruded on Scott's path from McMurdo Sound.|$|E

500|$|Markham faced further {{problems}} in securing {{funding for the}} expedition. In 1898, after three years' effort, {{only a fraction of}} what was required had been promised. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink had obtained a sum of £40,000 (over [...] in 2008) from publisher George Newnes, to finance a private Antarctic venture. Markham was furious, believing that funds were being diverted from his own project, and denounced Borchgrevink as [...] "evasive, a liar and a fraud". He was equally hostile to William Speirs Bruce, the Scottish explorer who had written to Markham asking to join the National Antarctic Expedition. On receiving no confirmation of an appointment, Bruce obtained finance from the Scottish Coats family and organised his own Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Markham accused Bruce of [...] "mischievous rivalry", and of attempting to [...] "cripple the National Expedition... in order to get up a scheme for yourself". The Scottish expedition duly sailed, but Markham remained unforgiving towards it, and used his influence to ensure that its <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> no Polar Medals on their return.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Rick Strassman and {{his colleagues}} {{conducted}} a five year long DMT study at the University of New Mexico. The results provided insight {{about the quality of}} subjective psychedelic experiences. In this study <b>participants</b> <b>received</b> the DMT dosage intravenously via injection and the findings suggested that different psychedelic experiences can occur, depending on the level of dosage. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05mg/kg, read [...] "mg DMT per kg body weight") produced somaesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05mg/kg had mild mood elevating and calming properties). In contrast, higher doses (0.2 and 0.4mg/kg) researchers labeled as [...] "hallucinogenic" [...] that elicited [...] "intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both". Comparing to other sensory modalities the most affected was visual domain. Participants reported visual hallucinations, less auditory hallucinations and specific physical sensation progressing to a sense of bodily dissociation, as well as experiences of euphoria, calm, fear, and anxiety.|$|E
