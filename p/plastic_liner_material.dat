40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} potential impact on groundwater quality {{as a result of the}} release of leachate from livestock mortality burial for three species of livestock: swine, bovine and poultry. Specific objectives were to: 1. Characterize the chemical composition of leachate in livestock mortality burial pits for three species: bovine, swine and poultry; and 2. Evaluate the potential environmental impact of livestock burial through groundwater transport modelling. A two part program was followed to achieve these objectives. The first portion involved construction of lined burial pits complete with leachate collection systems. Poultry (1300 kg), swine (5900 kg) and bovine (9750 kg) carcasses were each placed in separate pits and the pits covered with <b>plastic</b> <b>liner</b> <b>material</b> and then approximately one meter of earthen cover. The pits were sampled for leachate chemical analysis at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 8 months, 14 months and 25 months post burial. The second portion involved using the chemical analysis results from first portion and two groundwater modeling software packages (CTRAN and PHREEQC) to characterize the leachate and evaluate the potential this material could have on groundwater resources adjacent to burial pits. The results indicated that livestock mortality leachate contains, on average, after two years of decomposition, concentrations of 12, 600 mg/L of ammonium-N, 34, 600 mg/L alkalinity (as bicarbonate), 2, 600 mg/L chloride, 3, 600 mg/L sulphate, 2, 300 mg/L potassium, 1, 800 mg/L sodium, 1, 500 mg/L phosphorus along with relative lesser amounts of iron, calcium and magnesium. Maximum values for the major ions were up to 50 % higher than the average in some instances. The pH of the leachate was near neutral. In comparison to earthen manure storages and landfills, the strength of the leachate was 2 - 4 times higher. To properly characterize the leachate chemistry, speciation of the mortality leachate was performed using PHREEQC. This speciation provided evidence of phosphate compounds precipitating from solution, as well as significant amounts of phosphoric acids (0. 03 mol/L). Relatively high concentrations of ammonium sulphate also formed and due to the negative charge, allow for potentially 300 mg-N/L to transport conservatively. In comparison to naturally occurring groundwater, activities of bicarbonate, sulphates, phosphates and other minerals were many orders of magnitude higher than concentrations present in groundwater. Preliminary simulations were created with two software packages, Geo-Slope CTRAN and PHREEQC to simulate transport of the leachate for three different soil conditions. The Geo-Slope model models a conservative contaminant, while the PHREEQC model involves geochemical speciation and contaminant transport including ion exchange occurring along the pathway. Transport through a low permeable soil (K= 1 x 10 - 10 m/s) was dominated by diffusion allowing unattenuated leachate to transport a distance of approximately three meters in 50 years. The moderately permeable soil situation (K= 1 x 10 - 9 m/s) produced a transport depth of six meters with an approximate concentration of the tracer thirty to forty percent of initial concentration in 50 years. In a highly permeable soil (K= 1 x 10 - 8 m/s), transport reached a depth of 10 meters in 10 years with approximately forty percent of initial concentration. The PHREEQC transport model demonstrated a highly concentrated calcium and magnesium plume forming in front of the ammonium plume suggesting ion exchange and attenuation of ammonium. In the occurrence of a mass mortality event, regulators in Canada have decided to employ a trench burial system. Trenches could be created using on-the-farm equipment such as backhoes to obtain approximate trench dimensions of 2 m wide and 4 m deep. To assess the impact of multiple trenches and their appropriate spacing, models were created with Geo-Slope CTRAN to evaluate the effects on trench spacing. It was determined through these models that a minimum 10 m separation distance would provide a potential contaminant plume maximum soil contact and no trench-to-trench impact. To further evaluate the potential impact of livestock burial leachate, mass loading into an aquifer was evaluated for a moderately permeable soil (K= 1 x 10 - 9 m/s) for a mass mortality event in a 10, 000 head feedlot. Disposal consisted of ten 200 m trenches with a 10 m separation distance. Disposal covered 2. 2 hectares and provided a mass loading of ammonium to an aquifer 10 m below of 950 kg/year after 50 years and increasing from 50 years until the peak concentration of the plume reached the aquifer. At this loading rate, nitrogen concentrations exceed drinking water standards 10 - 15 times...|$|E

40|$|With the {{traditional}} use of CFC- 11 blown polyurethane foam for refrigerator insulation {{there has been}} limited need for interaction between the PU producers {{on the one hand}} and the producers of <b>plastics</b> used for <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> on the other hand. Taking into consideration their ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP) there is wide acceptance that HCFC- 123 and - 141 b are the nearest "drop in" substitutes known today for CFC- 11 replacement. However, this has major implications as these new blowing agents are significantly more aggressive requiring novel approaches in terms of material choice for monolithic and/or co-extruded sheet to retain the optimum sheet thickness, productivity and economics of current materials. This paper first of all summarises the current status of developments towards the reduction and eventual elimination of CFC- 11 from rigid polyurethane foam systems used for the insulation of domestic refrigerators and freezers. It then addresses the problems of liner/alternative blowing agent interactions using tests which attempt to bridge the classical laboratory tests whilst acknowledging the ultimate need to run full scale processing, assembly and functional performance trials at refrigerator manufacturers. Key parameters covered include thermal conductivity, its ageing, carbon dioxide permeability and adhesion between the polyurethane foam and the <b>plastic</b> <b>liner.</b> Physical attack of the liners is studied employing two qualitative testa One involves an unconstrained situation with profiled vacuum formed liner in contact with HCFC blown foams; the other uses a prototype tool which incorporates shelf support and mullion in a restrained mode with an aluminium tool.

40|$|Based on {{regulatory}} requirements for Type A and B radioactive material packaging, a Testing Program {{was developed to}} evaluate the effects of mixed wastes on plastic materials {{which could be used}} as liners and seals in transportation containers. The plastics evaluated in this program were butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer (Nitrile rubber), cross-linked polyethylene, epichlorohydrin, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPDM), fluorocarbons, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), butyl rubber, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). These plastics were first screened in four simulant mixed wastes. The <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> were screened using specific gravity measurements and seal materials by vapor transport rate (VTR) measurements. For the screening of <b>liner</b> <b>materials,</b> Kel-F, HDPE, and XLPE were found to offer the greatest resistance to the combination of radiation and chemicals. The tests also indicated that while all seal materials passed exposure to the aqueous simulant mixed waste, EPDM and SBR had the lowest VTRs. In the chlorinated hydrocarbon simulant mixed waste, only Viton passed the screening tests. In both the simulant scintillation fluid mixed waste and the ketone mixture waste, none of the seal materials met the screening criteria. Those materials which passed the screening tests were subjected to further comprehensive testing in each of the simulant wastes. The materials were exposed to four different radiation doses followed by exposure to a simulant mixed waste at three temperatures and four different exposure times (7, 14, 28, 180 days). Materials were tested by measuring specific gravity, dimensional, hardness, stress cracking, VTR, compression set, and tensile properties.

The aim of this project was to evaluate post-harvest methods of control to ensure that packed fruit cartons destined for export are free of live GCB adults and acceptable to international quarantine standards. Cold storage trials were carried out at a commercial cold store in Ceres during three years. GCB adults were subjected to controlled atmosphere conditions (treatment) and regular atmosphere conditions (control) {{for a period of}} 6 weeks during 2001 and 10 weeks during 2002. The trials during 2001 and 2002 were carried out by packing GCB and pears into cardboard boxes with <b>plastic</b> <b>liners.</b> During 2003 the trial was repeated, but GCB and pears were placed directly into open plastic lug boxes without <b>plastic</b> <b>liners.</b> The results showed that GCB appear to be very well cold-adapted and that at least nine weeks will be required to achieve 100 % mortality under controlled atmosphere conditions if pears are packed with <b>plastic</b> <b>liners.</b> A mortality of 100 % was never achieved under regular atmosphere conditions {{for the duration of the}} trial. If no <b>plastic</b> <b>liners</b> were used, 100 % mortality of GCB occurred one week earlier under controlled atmosphere conditions. Sufficient data was generated here to conclude that low temperature in itself was not sufficient to effectively sterilize pears from GCB infestations.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an experimental study on how acoustic properties of certain absorbing <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> are affected by nonstandard atmospheric conditions. This study was motivated by the need to assess risks associated with incorporating acoustic testing capability in wind tunnels with semicryogenic high Reynolds number aerodynamic and/or low pressure capabilities. The study consisted of three phases: 1) measurement of acoustic properties of selected <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> at subatmospheric pressure conditions, 2) periodic cold soak and high pressure exposure of <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> for 250 cycles, and 3) determination of the effect of periodic cold soak on the acoustic properties of the <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> at subatmospheric conditions and the effect on mechanical resiliency.

A vacuum facility was used to create the subatmospheric environment in which an impedance tube was placed to measure acoustic properties of the test materials. An automated cryogenic cooling system was used to simulate periodic cold soak and high pressure exposure. It was found that lower ambient pressure reduced the absorption effectiveness of the <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> to varying degrees.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project was to develop an innovative manufacturing method that allows reinforcing fibres to be on-line impregnated with thermoplastics during wrapping and laid on a liner. The new process {{is based on the}} principle of in-situ extrusion of molten polymer on to a conventional fibre strand, which was not impregnated with the polymer, just before the fibres are laid on the liner. The project is divided into three units consisting of eight work steps in total to produce a demonstration component {{in the form of a}} fully-wrapped plastic cylinder for service pressures up to 300 bar (burst pressure greater than 900 bar). The concept of on-line impregnation with thermoplastics has been successfully realised using a partially reinforced steel liner. Based on a number of full-scale tests carried out, the good bursting behaviour, fatigue strength and ageing resistance of the component have been demonstrated. A <b>plastic</b> <b>liner</b> has been developed, which is produced by the rotational moulding process and into which the metallic end pieces (openings) are introduced during the moulding process. The <b>plastic</b> <b>liner</b> has been shown to be compatible with and to have a low permeability for the gases such as air and natural gas to be contained in it at high pressure. The <b>plastic</b> <b>liner</b> reinforced with fibres by the wet winding method has attained a burst pressure of 1050 bar on average. Compared to a conventional steel cylinder, its weight is reduced by about 70 %. The new winding technique could not be satisfactorily adopted with the <b>plastic</b> <b>liner.</b> It is therefore necessary to try out other thermoplastics or to develop new process steps in order to achieve sufficient temperature stability during winding.
