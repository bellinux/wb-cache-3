60|$|The {{divergent}} ridges {{that bound}} any simple pattern admit of nine, and only nine, distinct {{variations in the}} first part of their course. The bounding ridge that has attained the summit of any such pattern must have arrived either from the Inner plot (I), the Outer plot (O), or from both. Similarly as regards the bounding ridge that lies at the lowest point of the pattern. Any one of the three former events may occur in connection with any of the three latter events, so they afford in all 3 × 3, or nine possible combinations. It is convenient to distinguish them by easily intelligible symbols. Thus, let i signify a bounding line which starts from the point I, whether it proceeds to the summit or to the base of the pattern; let o be a line that similarly <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> O, and <b>let</b> u be a line that unites the two plots I and O, either by summit or by base. Again, let two symbols be used, of which the first shall always refer to the summit, and the second to the base of the pattern. Then the nine possible cases are--uu, ui, uo; iu, ii, io; ou, oi, oo. The case of the arches is peculiar, but they may be fairly classed under the symbol uu.|$|R
