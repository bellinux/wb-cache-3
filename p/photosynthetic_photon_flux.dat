Data were acquired in the period 18 th April- 8 th June 2014 by one sensor outside and one inside the experimental greenhouse built in Southern Italy. Numeric simulations were performed by means of commercial software Autodesk ® Ecotect ®. For the investigated greenhouse model, the exposed percentage - the ratio of the calculated insolation at a particular point within an enclosure to the simultaneous unobstructed outdoor insolation under the same sky conditions - was calculated over a three dimensional grid formed by 50 x 10 x 15 cells each with 1. 00 x 1. 00 x 0. 20 m size. The long-term analysis demonstrated a good capability of the numerical model to predict the shading effect inside a photovoltaic greenhouse combining the daily calculated exposed percentage with measurements of solar radiation.

The CO 2 concentration was elevated to 1200 micromoles per mole, and water and nutrients were supplied by liquid hydroponic culture. An unusually high plant density (2000 plants per square meter) was used to obtain high yields. Crop growth rate and grain yield reached 138 and 60 grams per square meter per day, respectively; both continued to increase up to the highest integrated daily PPF level, which was three times greater than a typical daily flux in the field. The conversion efficiency of photosynthesis (energy in biomass/energy in <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>photons)</b> was over 10 % at low PPF but decreased to 7 % as PPF increased. Harvest index increased from 41 to 44 % as PPF increased. Yield components for primary, secondary, and tertiary culms were analyzed separately. Tillering produced up to 7000 heads per square meter at the highest PPF level. Primary and secondary culms were 10 % more efficient (higher harvest index) than tertiary culms; hence cultural, environmental, or genetic changes that increase the percentage of primary and secondary culms might increase harvest index and thus grain yield.

The flux station footprint area is mainly composed of herbs and crops with some sparse trees and shrubs. Fluxes data were completed by an inventory of dominating species around the tower and the meteorological measurements. Flux response to climatic and edaphic factors was studied. Water was found the main controlling factor of ecosystem dynamics: much larger uptake was found in wet than dry season. During wet season, a very clear answer of net CO 2 <b>fluxes</b> to <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>photon</b> <b>fluxes</b> density (PPFD) was observed. A low limitation in response to saturation deficit and soil water variability was however observed. The total ecosystem respiration (TER) was found highly dependent on soil moisture below 0. 1 m(3) m(- 3), but saturates above this threshold.

40|$|Leaf vapor {{diffusive}} conductance (gl) and transpiration (T) measurements in an irrigated orchard of {{the acid}} lime "Tahiti" {{were carried out}} in a subtropical climatic condition in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Measurements were made using steady-state null-balance porometers and were taken throughout the day, on several occasions from February to November, 1998. During September and October, measurements were performed on exposed and shaded young and fully expanded leaves, {{as well as on}} old leaves inside the tree canopy. The old leaves showed lower values of gl and T when compared to the other groups. In the other months, measurements were taken only with exposed and shaded fully expanded leaves. The highest values of gl and T were obtained from February to April. For exposed leaves gl was higher from early morning to midday, decreasing thereafter with some oscillation in the afternoon. Shaded leaves produced a pattern of increasing gl and T from 8 : 00 - 9 : 00 a. m. to midday, followed by a decrease when values matched those of the exposed leaves in the afternoon. In April, the first measurement in midmorning showed low gl and T values, increasing sharply in the exposed leaves until midday and then decreasing {{until the end of the}} afternoon. Between May and November, gl and T decreased sharply compared to the previous months. Boundary line and regression analysis were used to find the mathematical relationships between mean values of gl for the tree and <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>photons</b> <b>flux</b> density, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit of the air measured in the orchard.

However, photosynthesis is a quantum process and the chemical reactions of photosynthesis are more dependent {{on the number of}} photons than the amount of energy contained in the photons.

40|$|The role of {{blue light}} in plant growth and {{development}} was investigated in soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr. cv Williams) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L. ] Moench. cv Rio) grown under equal <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>photon</b> <b>fluxes</b> (approximately 500 micromoles per square meter per second) from broad spectrum daylight fluorescent or blue-deficient, narrow-band (589 nanometers) low pressure sodium (LPS) lamps. Between 14 and 18 days after sowing, {{it was possible to}} relate adaptations in photosynthesis and leaf growth to dry matter accumulation. Soybean development under LPS light was similar in several respects to that of shaded plants, consistent with an important role for blue light photoreceptors in regulation of growth response to irradiance. Thus, soybeans from LPS conditions partitioned relatively more growth to leaves and maintained higher average leaf area ratios (mean LAR) that compensated lower net assimilation rates (mean NAR). Relative growth rates were therefore comparable to plants from daylight fluorescent lamps. Reductions in mean NAR were matched by lower rates of net photosynthesis (A) on an area basis in the major photosynthetic source (first trifoliolate) leaf. Lower A in soybean resulted from reduced leaf dry matter per unit leaf area, but lower A under LPS conditions in sorghum correlated with leaf chlorosis and reduced total nitrogen (not observed in soybean). In spite of a lower A, mean NAR was larger in sorghum from LPS conditions, resulting in significantly greater relative growth rates (mean LAR was approximately equal for both light conditions). Leaf starch accumulation rate was higher for both species and starch content {{at the end of the}} dark period was elevated two- and three-fold for sorghum and soybean, respectively, under LPS conditions. Possible relations between starch accumulation, leaf export, and plant growth in response to spectral quality were considered...|$|R

The {{combination of}} treatments allowed us to separately assess the effects of blue and green light fraction among species and PPF. At a PPF of 500, increasing blue light from 11 to 28 % significantly decreased dry mass in tomato, cucumber, and pepper, {{but there was no}} significant effect on soybean, lettuce and wheat. At a PPF of 200, dry mass significantly decreased only in tomato across the blue light range. Effects on leaf area paralleled effects on dry mass in all species at both PPFs, indicating that the effects of blue light on dry mass were mediated by changes in leaf area. Contrary to predictions of net assimilation based on blue light response of single leaves, {{there was no evidence of}} decreasing net assimilation with increasing blue light. In contrast to the significant effect of blue light dry mass and leaf area, increasing green light fraction from zero to 30 % resulted in few significant differences. Contrary to several reports on significant green light effects on growth (both increases and decreases), we found no consistent effect of green light among species on growth, leaf area or net assimilation.

At the lower PPF (200), increasing blue light reduced growth only in tomato (41 %). The effects of blue light on growth were mediated by changes in leaf area and radiation capture, with minimal effects on whole-plant net-assimilation. In contrast to the significant effects of blue light, increasing green light in increments from zero to 30 % had a relatively small effect on growth, leaf area or net assimilation at either low or high PPF.

Leaf anatomy was also evaluated using conventional techniques. The degree of blockage of the <b>photosynthetic</b> active <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> density (PPFD) by sooty mold and its effect on photochemistry were evaluated.

This high-light saturation, both for tracking (much higher than the other species), and for photosynthesis, confirmed mallow as a high-light demanding species. Further, because there was no photoinhibition, the leaves could capture the potential of an increased carbon gain in higher irradiance by resorting to solar tracking.

The outdoor solar irradiance distribution measurements on the PV array installed at Energy Park, School of Renewable Energy Technology (SERT), Naresuan University, Thailand revealed that the solar irradiance is directly proportional with <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> density which the wavelength is influence of <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> density. The increasing of power output under real working of a-Si and p-Si depends on both <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> density and module temperature. But the increasing of power output of HIT mainly depends on both <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> density...|$|R

A comparative study between high <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> photocatalytic process and routine low <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> photocatalytic process for methylene blue degradation {{has been made in}} aqueous solution. The experimental results showed that under the best conditions of high UV photocatalytic reaction 99 % decolorization and 95 % TOC removal of 20 [*]mg[*]L− 1 methylene blue could be achieved in 30 [*]s and 120 [*]s of UV irradiation time, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, photocatalytic decolorization and photocatalytic degradation of dyes {{in such a short time}} has not been reported. Aiming at the low photonic efficiency in high <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> photocatalytic process, we found that reducing the density of excited electron-hole appropriately could improve initial apparent photonic efficiency effectively. The TOC experiments under high UV <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> showed a faster mineralization rate and a different mineralization process compared to that under low UV <b>photon</b> <b>flux...</b>|$|R
