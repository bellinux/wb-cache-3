National Security Advisor Nancy McNally and Leo {{consider}} the potential implications of possible retributions and are relieved when the Palestinians respond to American <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> arresting a leader of a militant group. As Leo points out, however, the solution is likely to be only temporary.|$|E
5|$|Albert A. Bühlmann {{published}} Decompression–Decompression sickness in 1984. Bühlmann {{recognized the}} problems associated with altitude diving, and proposed a method that calculated maximum nitrogen loading in the tissues at a particular ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> modifying Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios to increase linearly with depth.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and hydration. Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that increases intracranial <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> use of a primitive vacuum pump.

5|$|Andrei Rublev won several awards. In 1969, {{the film}} was {{screened}} at the Cannes Film Festival. Due to <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> Soviet officials, the film could only be shown out of competition, and was thus not eligible for the Palme d'Or or the Grand Prix. Nevertheless, it won the prize of the international film critics, FIPRESCI. In 1971 Andrei Rublev won the Critics Award of the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics, and in 1973 the Jussi Award for best foreign film.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population <b>pressure,</b> <b>by</b> the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E

5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Danny K. Davis {{running for}} Chicago mayor in the Democratic primary {{scheduled}} for February 26, 1991, made police brutality and excessive force {{an issue in}} the campaign. He sought an independent citizens' review of the police department. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International called for an investigation into police torture in Chicago. After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned whether there was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E
5|$|Karmal was {{appointed}} Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting {{voted in favor}} of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.|$|E

5|$|On 9 October 1918, under <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> Germany, the Senate and Parliament {{elected a}} German prince, Friedrich Karl, {{brother-in-law}} of German Emperor William II, {{to become the}} King of Finland. Eventually, General Rüdiger von der Goltz was able to utilize the weakness of Finland for the power political benefit of the German Empire. All this diminished Finnish sovereignty. The Finns, both right and left, had achieved independence on 6 December 1917 without a gunshot, but then compromised it by allowing the Germans to enter the country without difficulty during the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Quantities {{of atoms}} {{are found in}} {{different}} states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and <b>pressure.</b> <b>By</b> varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An {{example of this is}} solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bluespotted ribbontail ray as Near Threatened. Although still relatively common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development and destructive fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite. In addition, its populations are under heavy <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> artisanal and commercial fisheries, and by local collecting for the aquarium trade.|$|E

The Muslim Brotherhood continued to demand for Mubarak's resignation.

The government warned of a military crackdown amid ongoing protests. Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected US calls to repeal the emergency law and also accused the US of trying to impose its will on the Egyptian government. The newly appointed Mubarak's Culture Minister Gaber Asfour resigned after one week in office, citing health problems.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>by</b> a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E

This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.|$|E
