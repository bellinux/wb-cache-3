The airframe was transported by road from its storage location at J Supor & Son Trucking & Rigging Co. Inc. in Kearny, New Jersey to the display facility at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte. The transportation started on June 4 and arrived on June 10, 2011. The road trip took 7 days, and covered 788 miles in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia & North Carolina. J Supor & Son transported the aircraft to the museum. Because the fuselage was transported in one piece, {{as it was}} when it was recovered from the river, the truck was 190 feet long. Virtually everything except the passengers' personal effects are still in the airplane. The landing <b>gear</b> <b>pins,</b> fire axe, and the manuals were still in the cockpit, and the Coke cans were still in the food carts.|$|R

40|$|A drive {{mechanism}} enables a socket-type wrench to rotate a shaft and prevents accidental {{rotation of the}} shaft when the wrench is not coupled to the shaft. In the original intended application, the shaft {{would be part of}} an attachment mechanism on a spacecraft, and the purpose to be served by the drive is to prevent back-driving of the shaft by launch vibrations while enabling an astronaut equipped with the appropriate wrench to actuate the shaft while in orbit. The design could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which it is necessary to prevent rotational back-driving. The mechanism includes a gear near the tip of the shaft, and a drive nut that constitutes the tip of the shaft. The gear and drive nut are positioned in a recess in a housing. The recess is sized to receive the wrench socket that mates with the drive nut. Also contained in the housing are four linkages that include pins that are spring-loaded into engagement with the gear to prevent rotation of the shaft. When the wrench socket is inserted in the recess, it pushes on the linkages in such a manner as to disengage the <b>pins</b> from the <b>gear...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{friction}} coefficient and wear rate of gear {{fiber reinforced plastic}} (gear fiber) and glass fiber reinforced plastic (glass fiber) sliding against mild steel are investigated experimentally. In order to do so, a pin on disc apparatus is designed and fabricated. Experiments are carried out when smooth or rough mild steel <b>pin</b> slides on <b>gear</b> fiber and glass fiber disc. Experiments are conducted at normal load 10, 15 and 20 N, sliding velocity 1, 1. 5 and 2 m/s and relative humidity 70 %. Variations of friction coefficient with the duration of rubbing at different normal loads and sliding velocities are investigated. Results show that friction coefficient is influenced by duration of rubbing, normal load and sliding velocity. In general, friction coefficient increases for a certain duration of rubbing and after that it remains constant {{for the rest of}} the experimental time. The obtained results reveal that friction coefficient decreases with the increase in normal load for gear fiber and glass fiber mating with smooth or rough mild steel counterface. On the other hand, it is also found that friction coefficient increases with the increase in sliding velocity for both of the tested materials. Moreover, wear rate increases with the increase in normal load and sliding velocity. The magnitudes of friction coefficient and wear rate are different depending on sliding velocity and normal load for both smooth and rough counterface pin materials...|$|R

40|$|A {{review on}} 15 years {{research}} on remote laser propulsion with a parabolic thruster at DLR is presented. Mission scenarios were analyzed for nanosatellite launch to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using a ground-based high energy laser as energy supply significantly optimizing the mass-to-payload-ratio. Experimental work {{was carried out}} using a home-made, electron-beam sustained CO 2 high energy laser in the 10 kW class with around 10 μs pulse length. The parabolic thruster was compared with the Lightcraft Technology Demonstrator in air-breathing mode {{as well as with}} Polyoxymethylene (POM) as an ablative propellant with respect to laser pulse energy and beam profile taking into account for standardization issues of ballistic pendula. Experiments showed good performance of pure air-breathing mode without propellant down to 200 mbar ambient pressure allowing for a drastic propellant reduction for the initial flight phase during dense atmosphere. The commonly used hydrodynamic point explosion model with a strong shock wave was analyzed with respect to the optimization of the impulse coupling coefficient in geometric scaling by the adaptation of nozzle diameter and length to the range of the applied laser pulse energy. The usage of ablative propellants like POM, inevitable in the vacuum of space, yields enhancement of impulse coupling under atmospheric conditions which can partly be attributed to combustion. Various polymer-metal composites were developed and analyzed in order to achieve a higher specific impulse, but failed due to material inhomogeneity. Started up with wire-guided flights, using only air as propellant in a laser-induced breakdown, the detonation reproducibility by means of an ignition pin on the axis of symmetry of the thruster was proven in the free flight experiments yielding an altitude up to 8 m, limited by the laboratory ceiling. Nevertheless, flight dynamic analysis of a tilted <b>pin</b> as steering <b>gear</b> and hovering experiments near ground level revealed crucial coupling of lateral and angular motion and the demand of spin-stabilization for a beam-riding flight.

40|$|Hydraulic servo {{controls}} {{are designed to}} facilitate rotation in place without providing increased ppower to steering wheels. In the initial design phase, the dimensions required for control systems are usually obtained through the calculation of their load when wheels rotate in place, where the torque is calculated empirically. The starting point in the project calculation is thus to determine the hydraulic power steering torque torsional resistance which is then {{used to determine the}} maximum value of force i. e. the torque on the stering wheel. The calculation of the control system servo control consists of determining the basic parameters, the required pump capacity, the main dimensions of the hub and the  pipeline and the conditions for the stability of the system control mechanism. Introduction The aim of the calculation of the steering control system is to determine the basic parameters of its components which ensure the fulfilment of requirements of the control system. Calculations are performed in several stages with a simultaneous  detailed constructive analysis of the control system leading to the best variant. At each stage, design and control calculations of the hydraulic servo of the steering mechanism are performed. The design allows the computation to complete the selection of basic dimensions of the amplifer elements, starting from the approved scheme and the basic building loads of approximate values. Calculations control is carried out to clarify the structural solution and to obtain the output characteristics of the control amplifier which are applied in the  estimation of  potential properties of the structure. Project calculation Baseline data must be sufficiently reliable, ie. must correspond to the construction characteristics of the vehicle design and the control system as well as to service conditions [...] A proper deterimination of the torque calculation of torsional resistance in wheels is of utmost importance. Moment of resistance to wheel rotation in place The magnitude of the torque required to rotate drive wheels in place, is affected by: 1) load on wheels; 2) coefficient of friction of the tire surface; 3) dimensions and shape of the tire footprint on the surface, as deterimined by the pressure in the tire and its construction; 4) lateral stiffness of the tire; 5) turning radius of drive wheels; 6) angles of inclination of the pin; 7) moment of friction in <b>pins</b> and steering <b>gear</b> mechanism. To achieve the proper torque values of torsional resistance in drive wheels, it is necessary to take into account all these influential factors, as this provides a lower load on the elements in the control system while enabling easier control and reducing the moment of force on the steering wheel. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Mitin Mitin obtained the coefficient  only for one tire so the use of this formula is practically impossible. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Taborek Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Lisov This formula takes into account the radius of the tire, but {{does not take into account}} the pressure and elastic characteristics of tires. Moment of resistance ito rotating drive wheels in place by Litvinov For the calculation by this formula, it is necessary to know the dependence of the tire footprint surface and the load on it. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place by Gough Experimental studies have shown that this term is very acceptable. Dimensions of the executive hydraulic cylinder The control amplifier must provide that the wheels rotate in place when the force of the driver on the steering wheel is not above 160 – 200 N in a complete range of the rotation angles from   for the inner wheel to for the outer wheel. Reactive and centering elements of the hydraulic servo control The control system without a hydraulic servo control must have one very important characteristic which is to develop the ability of the driver to feel the road configuration, especially when going around a curve. In order to achieve this, a reactive element is built into the hydraulic servo control, with a task to absorb rapidly drive wheel oscillations during the reverse inclusion of the hydraulic servo control (from the drive wheels to the steering wheel). Determination of the dimensions of reactive elements and the stiffness of centering springs Taking the results of the static analysis into account, the dependence of force and the torsional resistance in drive wheels can be obtained. From this dependence, P can be found  as a function of. Control calculation The control calculation is performed after selecting general elements of the control system and the amplifier. The control  calculation allows the reduction of amplifier dimensions through the transmission gear mechanism, by selecting the   part onto which amplifier force. is applied. Conclusion The calculation of the control system helps in determining the basic parameters of its elements and assemblies, thus providing the control over the vehicle motion. The main input data in calculating hydraulic servo control is the determination of torsional resistance in drive wheels. In order to achieve proper torque values in torsional resistance, it is necessary to take into account  the given influencing factors since this ensures, on the one hand, lower load on the control system elements and, on the other hand, easier control by reducing the force applied to the steering wheel. ECE Regulation № 79 defines the maximum force that can be applied to the steering wheel, so this paremeter of control systems must be taken into account in vehicle design. The piston stroke and the cylinder length are determined for maximum torque angles of drive wheels, followed vy the determination of the cylinder piston diameter. The tendency to reverse the action of the  hydraulic servo control would violate the basic requirement to the control system which is to get drive wheels back into straight line motion under the influence of the stabilizing moment. In order to prevent reverse action, a reactive and centering element is installed into the hydraulic servo control. Prestressing of central springs provides the return of the steering and drive wheels under the influence of the stabilizing moment without involving the hydraulic servo control. Friction force in the control mechanism must be lower than the force of prestressed central springs. The control computation is performed after the determination of all parameters in order to test the operating ability of the hydraulic servo control and to obtain its characteristics. A properly designed hydraulic servo control has to provide that the summary execution of torque hydraulic servo control and the driver exceeds the moment of resistance throughout the range of angles of rotation of wheels. </p...|$|R
