He bases his claim on a source found in the Mercurio Peruano which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's Plaza de toros de Acho, the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named <b>Punche</b> (Punch), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian Pisco punch, invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of San Francisco, California. A recipe for a pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook Manual de Cocina a la Criolla; consequently, culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that [...] "t is entirely possible that the 'Cocktail' that came to be the pisco sour [...] had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the antibacterial activity of five different root-canal sealers (RoekoSeal, Ketac-Endo, AH Plus, Sealapex, Sultan). With the use of Enterococcus faecalis as a test organ-ism, both the agar-diffusion test (ADT) and direct-con-tact test (DCT) were performed. For DCT, sealers were mixed and placed on the sidewall of microtiter plate wells. A 10 -l bacterial suspension {{was placed on the}} tested material samples. Bacteria were allowed to di-rectly contact to the sealers for 1 h at 37 Â°C. Bacterial growth was then spectrophotometrically measured through every 30 min for 19 h by using an Anthos Labtec HT 2. For ADT, a 200 -l bacterial suspension was spread on brain-heart infusion agar plates. Freshly mixed sealers were poured into uniform wells <b>punche...</b>|$|E
