A {{spring-loaded}} lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. [...] The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a <b>prepared</b> <b>surface.</b> [...] The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the WAIS Divide coring project, a vacuuming system {{was set up to}} facilitate this. [...] The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break.

40|$|Background: Erbium, chromium: Yttrium, scandium, gallium, garnet (Er, Cr: YSGG) laser {{has been}} {{successfully}} used in the ablation of dental hard and soft tissues. It {{has been reported that}} this system is also useful for <b>preparing</b> tooth <b>surfaces</b> and etching, but no consensus exist in the literature regarding the advantage of lasers over conventional tooth preparation technique. Materials and Methods: Labial surfaces of 25 extracted human maxillary central incisors were divided into two halves. Right half was prepared with diamond bur and left half with Er, Cr; YSGG laser and a reduction of 0. 3 - 0. 5 mm was carried out. Topography of <b>prepared</b> <b>surfaces</b> of five teeth were examined under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The remaining samples were divided into 4 groups of 10 specimens each based on the surface treatment received: One group was acid etched and other was nonetched. Composite resin cylinders were bonded on <b>prepared</b> <b>surfaces</b> and shear bond strength was assessed using a universal testing machine. Results: The SEM observation revealed that the laser <b>prepared</b> <b>surfaces</b> were clean, highly irregular and devoid of a smear layer. Bur <b>prepared</b> <b>surfaces</b> were relatively smooth but covered with smear layer. Highest bond strength was shown by laser prepared acid etched group, followed by bur prepared the acid etched group. The bur prepared nonacid etched group showed least bond strength. Conclusions: Er, Cr: YSGG laser can be used for preparing tooth and bond strength value achieved by laser preparation alone without surface treatment procedure lies in the range of clinical acceptability...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the current trend towards "minimal invasive" dentistry, diverse cavity {{preparation}} techniques have been introduced as an alternative or addition to common bur instrumentation. This study investigated whether diamond sonoabrasion (SonicSys Micro, Kavo), air abrasion (Prep Start, Danville) and Er:YAG laser irradiation (Fidelis) produce surfaces at enamel/dentin that are equally receptive to bonding as traditional mid-grit diamond-bur (Komet) and 600 -grit SiC-paper <b>prepared</b> <b>surfaces,</b> of which the latter two served as controls. An etch&rinse adhesive (OptiBond FL, Kerr) applied with and without prior acid-etching and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE, Kuraray) were employed to bond the restorative composite (Z 100, 3 M ESPE) to the diversely prepared enamel and dentin surfaces. The microtensile bond strength (microTBS) was determined after 24 hours of storage in water at 37 degrees C. The {{results indicated that the}} manner of preparation of enamel and dentin prior to bonding procedures significantly influenced the bonding effectiveness of both the etch&rinse and the self-etch adhesive. Using an etch&rinse adhesive, separate acid-etching of air-abraded and Er:YAG-irradiated enamel and dentin surfaces remains mandatory. Bonding to diamond-sonoabraded and air-abraded enamel and dentin was, in general, not different from bonding to conventional diamond-bur <b>prepared</b> <b>surfaces,</b> whereas, bonding to Er:YAG-irradiated enamel and dentin surfaces in general resulted in a significantly lower bonding effectiveness compared to bonding to diamond-bur <b>prepared</b> <b>surfaces.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
