40|$|End of life care often {{involves}} the use of combinations of more than one drug in a syringe for administration by a continuous subcutaneous infusion using a syringe driver or pump. This is considered to be an effective method of symptom management and can provide a good control of symptoms. The combining of more than one drug however raises the question of compatibility. Even though many combinations of drugs have been successfully used in clinical practice in specialist areas without supporting laboratory data, the dangers of this practice are unknown and it is important to study the chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>compatibilities</b> of combining more than one drug for administration. The publication of National Patient Safety Alert 20 : ‘Promoting safer use of injectable medicines’ by the NPSA in March 2007 addressed this issue. Assessment of the Marie Curie Hospice database (Liverpool) has identified ten supportive drug combinations that have been used for continuous subcutaneous infusion and their associated dose. In this study the compatibility of these supportive drug combinations was assessed with each of the following opioids: morphine, diamorphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone and alfentanil. The preparation of the combinations replicated clinical practice as close as possible. The combinations were prepared in BD syringes and a CME T 34 syringe pump together with its administration set was used for the infusion of the prepared combinations at ambient temperature. Assessment of the combinations, including appearance, pH and compatibility assays, was performed at time zero, then 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after the start of the infusion. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was the principal technique for compatibility assessment. This study proposed 50 combinations for compatibility assessment. Of the 45 combinations tested, the results identified 40 combinations as compatible. At the stated concentrations these 40 combinations were considered compatible with the diluents, the syringes and administration sets used. No incompatibility was evident in any of the combinations tested however the data obtained could not be used to confirm compatibility in five of the combinations tested.

Objective: To describe the <b>physical</b> <b>compatibility</b> and stability of morphine sulphate and naloxone hydrochloride (at various concentra-tions) in IV admixtures. Methods:The <b>physical</b> <b>compatibility</b> and stability of admixtures of mor-phine 1000 µg/mL and naloxone 4 µg/mL, 12. 5 µg/mL, and 25 µg/mL in 0. 9 % sodium chloride were studied. For each concentration of naloxone, one bag was stored at room temperature (22 °C) for 72 h and one bag was stored under refrigeration (4 °C) for 30 days. For all preparations, physical characteristics, including pH, colour, and formation of precipitate, were evaluated. The samples were also analyzed by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90 % of the initial concentration.

40|$|International audienceSince the {{pioneering}} work of Wulff and Mosbach more than 30 years ago, molecular imprinting of synthetic polymers {{has emerged as}} a robust and convenient way for synthesizing polymeric receptor materials bearing specific recognition sites for target molecules. The resulting materials, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), are therefore commonly referred to as ‘plastic antibodies’. They are obtained by polymerizing a scaffold around a target, or a derivate thereof, which acts as a molecular template. MIPs have been successfully applied in many areas including affinity separation, immunoassays, chemical sensing, solid-phase extraction, drug delivery, cell and tissue imaging, direct synthesis and catalysis. In terms of affinity and selectivity, MIPs are on a par with biological receptors like antibodies, and this is accompanied by a superior chemical and <b>physical</b> stability, <b>compatibility</b> with organic media, reusability, easy engineering and low cost. These advantages represent the main reasons for the wide interest raised around molecularly imprinted materials. Mainly produced by free radical polymerization (FRP) of vinyl monomers, MIPs have also taken advantage of the introduction of controlled/living radical polymerization (CRP) techniques, which have literally transformed polymer chemistry over the last decade. This review describes the advantages arising from the use of CRP in synthesizing MIPs, both in terms of sheer binding properties as well as for their remarkabl...|$|R

Both open and proprietary standards exist worldwide; {{we focus on}} enhancements to the digital video broadcasting – handheld (DVB-H) standard for transmission over cooperative cellular networks, which {{enables the use of}} relaying to supplement existing fixed infrastructure. Cooperation creates a distributed form of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, resulting in breakthroughs in network energy efficiency and reliability. Thus, cooperative networks have an inherently green ad hoc topology that is able to substantially reduce infrastructure cost, system complexity and energy expenditure. In this paper, novel strategies are proposed and evaluated that combine: (1) fountain coding, e. g., Raptor codes at the application layer, and (2) network coding. Originally proposed for broadcasting over the Internet, the application of fountain codes to wireless cooperative communications networks has been limited to date. These codes enable lower (<b>physical)</b> layer <b>compatibility.</b> Network coding is used to reduce energy consumption by opportunistically recombining and rebroadcasting required combinations of packets.
