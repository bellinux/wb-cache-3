It is also possible for the object distance S1 to be negative, in which case the lens sees a so-called virtual object. This happens when the lens is inserted into a converging beam (being focused by a previous lens) before the location of its real image. In that case even a negative lens can project a real image, as is done by a Barlow lens.|$|E
40|$|AbstractYoung animals {{compensate}} for defocus imposed by {{positive or negative}} spectacle lenses by adjusting the elongation rate of their vitreous chambers, thus matching {{the length of the}} eye with the focal length of the eye’s optics combined with the spectacle lenses. The ability to {{compensate for}} either negative or <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> could rely on the ability to distinguish between myopic and hyperopic blur, or it could rely on the fact that <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> would bring nearby objects into focus, thereby reducing the amount of blur, whereas negative lenses would not. This study asks whether eyes emmetropize using the magnitude of blur or the sign of blur as a directional cue. We fitted chick eyes with <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> while imposing a substantial amount of blur, either (a) by having them wear lenses only when restrained {{in the center of a}} cylinder, the walls of which were beyond their far-point or (b) by having them wear mild diffusers over <b>positive</b> <b>lenses.</b> We found good refractive compensation in both situations in a large number of birds. Furthermore, we found that mild diffusers worn on top of <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> differentially affected the two ocular components of refractive compensation: there was less choroidal thickening, but more inhibition of ocular elongation, compared to wearing <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> alone. These findings argue both that the eye can discern the sign of the blur and that choroidal and ocular-elongation components of the refractive compensation do not respond identically to visual inputs...|$|R

2500|$|The {{signs of}} the lens' radii of {{curvature}} indicate whether the corresponding surfaces are convex or concave. The sign convention used to represent this varies, but in this article a positive R indicates a surface's center of curvature is further along {{in the direction of}} the ray travel (right, in the accompanying diagrams), while negative R means that rays reaching the surface have already passed the center of curvature. Consequently, for external lens surfaces as diagrammed above, [...] and [...] indicate convex surfaces (used to converge light in a <b>positive</b> <b>lens),</b> while [...] and [...] indicate concave surfaces. The reciprocal of the radius of curvature is called the curvature. A flat surface has zero curvature, and its radius of curvature [...] is infinity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{plane wave}} {{incident}} on a <b>positive</b> <b>lens</b> is focused {{at a point}} by the lens; all the 'rays' have the same phase {{at the point of}} focus, so that this is equivalent to viewing the plane wave at infinity. Thus, if the diffracted light is focused with a lens, the observed diffraction pattern can be modelled using Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffracted light can be considered to be made up of a set of plane waves of varying orientation. [...] When a lens is located in front of the diffracting aperture, each plane wave is brought to a focus at a different point in the focal plane with the point of focus being proportional to the x- and y-direction cosines, so that the variation in intensity as a function of direction is mapped into a positional variation in intensity.|$|E

40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 6 months post date of publicationPURPOSE. We {{demonstrated}} that eyes of young animals of various species (chick, tree shrew, marmoset, and rhesus macaque) can shorten in the axial dimension {{in response to}} myopic defocus. METHODS. Chicks wore <b>positive</b> or negative <b>lenses</b> over one eye for 3 days. Tree shrews were measured during recovery from induced myopia after 5 days of monocular deprivation for 1 to 9 days. Marmosets were measured during recovery from induced myopia after monocular deprivation, or wearing negative lenses over one or both eyes, or from wearing <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> over one or both eyes. Rhesus macaques were measured after recovery from induced myopia after monocular deprivation, or wearing negative lenses over one or both eyes. Axial length was measured with ultrasound biometry in all species. RESULTS. Tree shrew eyes showed a strong trend to shorten axially to compensate for myopic defocus. Of 34 eyes that recovered from deprivation-induced myopia for various durations, 30 eyes (88 %) shortened, whereas only 7 fellow eyes shortened. In chicks, eyes wearing <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> reduced their rate of ocular elongation by two-thirds, including 38. 5 % of eyes in which the axial length became shorter than before. Evidence of axial shortening in rhesus macaque (40 %) and marmoset (6 %) eyes also occurred when exposed to myopic defocus, although much less frequently than that in eyes of tree shrews. The axial shortening was caused mostly by the reduction in vitreous chamber depth. CONCLUSIONS. Eyes of chick, tree shrew, marmoset, and rhesus macaque can shorten axially when presented with myopic defocus, whether the myopic defocus is created by wearing <b>positive</b> <b>lenses,</b> or {{is the result of}} axial elongation of the eye produced by prior negative lens wear or deprivation. This eye shortening facilitates compensation for the imposed myopia. Implications for human myopia control are significant. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. It {{has been}} found in the chicken that the amount of retinal {{glucagon}} mRNA increases during treatment with <b>positive</b> <b>lenses.</b> Pharmacological studies support the idea that glucagon may act as a stop signal for visually induced eye growth. To gain more insight into the functional role of glucagon, the changes of glucagon and glucagon receptor mRNA concentrations in retina and choroid over time were studied. Furthermore, the abundance of glucagon and the glucagon receptor was studied in different fundal layers (retina, retinal pigment epithelium[RPE], choroid) and the blood. METHODS. Semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to measure glucagon and glucagon receptor mRNA levels in retina and choroid after <b>positive</b> and negative <b>lens</b> treatment for 2, 6, or 24 hours, by unilateral � 7 - or � 7 -D lenses.

40|$|PURPOSE. Myopia can {{be induced}} in {{chickens}} {{by having them}} wear either negative lenses (lens-compensation myopia [LCM]) or diffusers (form-deprivation myopia [FDM]), whereas posi-tive lenses cause lens-compensation hyperopia (LCH). These three conditions were compared with respect to (i) their early time course and (ii) the effect of two manipulations of the lighting. METHODS. Longitudinal changes in ocular dimensions and re-fractive error were measured in chicks maintained under three different conditions: (i) wearing either 215 D lenses or dif-fusers in a normal light/dark cycle; (ii) wearing either 115 D lenses, 215 D lenses, or diffusers with brief periods of strobo-scopic lights {{at the beginning and}} end of the dark period; (iii) wearing either 16 D lenses, 26 D lenses, or diffusers with the nights interrupted by brief periods of white light. In addition, scleral and choroidal proteoglycan synthesis was measured in eyes that wore <b>positive</b> <b>lenses,</b> negative lenses, or diffusers for 3 hours followed by different periods of darkness. RESULTS. (i) The time course of the changes in axial length over the first 72 hours was significantly faster in LCM than in FDM. Indeed, the diffusers did not begin to significantly affect the total length of the globe for 3 days, although the vitreous chamber had deepened after 9 hours, because the choroid thinned extremely rapidly (within 1 hour) with either diffusers or negative lenses. (ii) Scleral proteoglycan synthesis was higher in eyes with negative lenses than in those with diffusers at 11 hours, but the reverse was true at 27 hours. (iii) Brief periods of stroboscopic light attenuated FDM more than LCM. (iv) In contrast, interruption of the nights by brief periods of light attenuated LCM more than FDM. (v) Neither lighting manipulation affected LCH. (vi) Choroidal proteoglycan syn-thesis decreased similarly with 3 hours of wearing either dif-fusers or negative lenses. CONCLUSIONS. Although both negative lenses and diffusers cause similar increases in the rate of ocular elongation, the responses differ in time course and in the effect of manipulations of the daily lighting.

40|$|Purpose To {{provide a}} summary of the classic paper "Differences in the {{accommodation}} stimulus response curves of adult myopes and emmetropes" published in Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics in 1998 and to provide an update on the topic of accommodation errors in myopia. Summary The accommodation responses of 33 participants (10 emmetropes, 11 early onset myopes and 12 late onset myopes) aged 18 - 31 years were measured using the Canon Autoref R- 1 free space autorefractor using three methods to vary the accommodation demand: decreasing distance (4 m to 0. 25 cm), negative lenses (0 to - 4 D at 4 m) and <b>positive</b> <b>lenses</b> (+ 4 to 0 D at 0. 25 m). We observed that the greatest accommodation errors occurred for the negative lens method whereas minimal errors were observed using <b>positive</b> <b>lenses.</b> Adult progressing myopes had greater lags of accommodation than stable myopes at higher demands induced by negative lenses. Progressing myopes had shallower response gradients than the emmetropes and stable myopes; however the reduced gradient was much less than that observed in children using similar methods. Recent Findings This paper has been often cited as evidence that accommodation responses at near may be primarily reduced in adults with progressing myopia and not in stable myopes and/or that challenging accommodation stimuli (negative lenses with monocular viewing) are required to generate larger accommodation errors. As an analogy, animals reared with hyperopic errors develop axial elongation and myopia. Retinal defocus signals are presumably passed to the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid and then ultimately the sclera to modify eye length. A number of lens treatments that act to slow myopia progression may partially work through reducing accommodation errors...|$|R
