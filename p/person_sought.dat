In addition, as in Gascoigne v Gascoigne, where {{the purpose of the}} transfer involves illegality, the courts will not uphold it as a resulting trust. This rule was subtly modified by the House of Lords decision in Tinsley v Milligan. Tinsley and Milligan had jointly purchased a house to run as a business, and both accepted that it had been bought to own jointly. Only Tinsley was registered as the owner, however, so that Milligan (with Tinsley's knowledge) could claim state benefits. The House of Lords decided that Milligan could claim an equitable interest, since it was the contribution to the purchase price (a lawful act) which she was relying on, not the associated fraud (an illegal act). Although the purpose of the initial registration had been illegal, the purpose of the purchase itself had not.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand Miss X. can trace many of her visions to memories, as Maury could in his illusions hypnagogiques. Thus, Miss X. saw in the crystal, the printed {{announcement}} of a friend's death. She had not consciously read the Times, but remembered that she had held it up before her face as a firescreen. This kind of revival, as she says, corresponds to the writing, with planchette, of scraps from the Chanson de Roland, by {{a person who had}} never consciously read a line of it, and who did not even know what stratum of Old French was represented by the fragments. Miss X. seems not to know either; for she calls it 'Provencal'. Similar instances of memory revived are not very uncommon in dreams. Miss X. can consciously put a group of fanciful characters into the crystal, while this is beyond the power of the seer known to the writer, who has attempted to perceive what a friend is doing at a distance, but with no success. Thus she tried to discover what the writer might be about, and secured a view of two large sunny rooms, with a shadowy figure therein. Now it is very probable that the writer was in just such a room, at --- Castle, but the seer saw, on the library table, a singular mirror, which did not exist there, and a model of a castle, also non-existent. The knowledge that the <b>person</b> <b>sought</b> for was staying at a 'castle,' may have unconsciously suggested this model in the picture.|$|E
60|$|When Glastonbury {{was about}} twenty-one years of age, he {{unexpectedly}} inherited from an uncle a sum which, though {{by no means}} considerable, was for him a sufficient independence; and as no opening {{in the service of}} the Church at this moment offered itself, which he considered it a duty to pursue, he determined to gratify that restless feeling which seems inseparable from the youth of men gifted with fine sensibilities, and which probably arises in an unconscious desire to quit the commonplace and to discover the ideal. He wandered on foot throughout the whole of Switzerland and Italy; and, after more than three years' absence, returned to England with several thousand sketches, and a complete Alpine Hortus Siccus. He was even more proud of the latter than of having kissed the Pope's toe. In the next seven years the life of Glastonbury was nearly equally divided between the duties of his sacred profession and the gratification of his simple and elegant tastes. He resided principally in Lancashire, where he became librarian to a Catholic nobleman of the highest rank, whose notice he had first attracted by publishing a description of his Grace's residence, illustrated by his drawings. The duke, who was a man of fine taste and antiquarian pursuits, and an exceedingly benevolent <b>person,</b> <b>sought</b> Glastonbury's acquaintance in consequence of the publication, and from that moment a close and cherished intimacy subsisted between them. In the absence of the family, however, Glastonbury found time for many excursions; by means of which he at last completed drawings of all our cathedrals. There remained for him still the abbeys and the minsters of the West of England, a subject on which he was ever eloquent. Glastonbury performed all these excursions on foot, armed only with an ashen staff which he had cut in his early travels, and respecting which he was superstitious; so that he would have no more thought of journeying without this stick than most other people without their hat. Indeed, to speak truth, Glastonbury had been known to quit a house occasionally without that necessary appendage, for, from living much alone, he was not a little absent; but instead of piquing himself on such eccentricities, they ever occasioned him mortification. Yet Glastonbury was an universal favourite, and ever a welcome guest. In his journeys he had no want of hosts; for there was not a Catholic family which would not have been hurt had he passed them without a visit. He was indeed a rarely accomplished personage. An admirable scholar and profound antiquary, he possessed also a considerable practical knowledge of the less severe sciences, was a fine artist, and no contemptible musician. His pen, too, was that of a ready writer; if his sonnets be ever published, they will rank among the finest in our literature.|$|E

Objective To test {{the effectiveness of a}} multicomponent behavioral intervention delivered by lay health workers to adults with psychological distress in primary care settings. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, through January 28, 2016, in 3 primary care centers in Peshawar, Pakistan, that included 346 adult primary care attendees with high levels of both psychological distress and functional impairment according to the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2. 0 (WHODAS 2. 0).

40|$|Introduction The {{prevalence}} of work-related musculoskeletal disorders is very common. The main {{objective of the}} study was to identify any association between the severity of musculoskeletal symptoms and treatment choice by workers in automobile manufacturing plants. Methods A cross-sectional study of 1017 production workers in six automobile manufacturing plants was performed. The study included the structured interviews to determine symptoms, preexisting personal risk factors, treatment choices (health care provider or no treatment sought), job strain, and job satisfaction. Nordic style questionnaire for symptoms, Karasek’s Demand Control Model and three job satisfaction questions were used to assign symptom severity, job strain, and job satisfaction, respectively. The case definition was that the <b>person</b> <b>sought</b> treatment from plant clinic or personal health care provider. The independent variables were symptom severity (2 levels), job strain (2 levels), job satisfaction (3 levels). The logistic analysis was used for data analysis. Results The Whole Body symptoms severity score was taken as the highest symptoms severity for any body region. Those with High symptoms were more likely to seek treatment than those with Low symptoms, OR= 2. 3 (1. 23 - 4. 27, 95 %CI). There was no effect associated with job strain and job satisfaction. Those with osteoarthritis, neurological disorders and hypertension sought more treatment, OR= 3. 32 (1. 55 - 7. 11, 95 %CI), OR= 30. 5 (5. 37 - 173, 95 %CI) and OR= 2. 97 (1. 19 - 7. 44, 95 %CI). Sex was significant, where women were more likely to seek treatment than men, OR= 2. 3 (1. 33 - 3. 07, 95 %CI). There were no significant findings for BMI, diabetes, rheumatologic disorder, thyroid problems, and smoking. Conclusion The study found an association between the severity of the symptoms for a musculoskeletal disorder and the decision to seek treatment from a health care provider (either plant clinic or private provider). Participants with osteoarthritis, neurological disease and hypertension were also more likely to seek treatment more than those without the conditions.
