Material and Methods: In a series of 246 idiopathic central hypogonadism patients,wefound three novel (<b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 158 I, <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 334 M, and p. N 15 TfsX 30) and six already known (p. L 173 R, p. T 260 M, p. R 268 C, <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 274 D, <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 331 M, and p. H 20 MfsX 23) germline variants in the PROKR 2 gene. We evaluated the effects of seven missense alterationsontwodifferent prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR 2) -dependent pathways: inositol phosphate-Ca 2 + (Gq coupling) and cAMP (Gs coupling). Results: PROKR 2 variants were found in 16 patients (6. 5 %). Expression levels of variants <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 158 I and <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 331 M were moderately reduced, whereas they were markedly impaired in the remaining cases, except <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 334 M, which was significantly overexpressed. The variants p. T 260 M, p. R 268 C, and <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 331 M showed no remarkable changes in cAMP response (EC 50) whereas the IP signaling appeared more profoundly affected. In contrast, cAMP accumulation cannot be stimulated through the p. L 173 R and <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 274 D, but IP EC 50 was similar to wt inp. L 173 R and increased by 10 -fold in <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 274 D. The variant <b>p.</b> <b>V</b> 334 M led to a 3 -fold increase of EC 50 for both cAMP and IP. Conclusion: Our study shows that single PROKR 2 missense allelic variants can either affect both signaling pathways differently or selectively. Thus, the integrity of both PROKR 2 -dependent cAMP and IP signals should be evaluated for a complete functional testing of novel identified allelic variants...|$|R

Specifically, fractional factorial designs consisting of n runs which permit {{the identification and}} discrimination of the models of interest are evaluated and classified. The classifications are dependent on a new property introduced in this dissertation, denoted <b>P</b> <b>V,</b> g ≥ 1, which relies {{on the structure of}} the variance-covariance matrix for the estimates of the model parameters. Designs with the property, <b>P</b> <b>V,</b> g ≥ 1, permit to divide the models in the class considered into g groups so that all models in a group have equal variances for the least squares estimates of the k two-factor interaction effects. Ghosh-Tian optimum designs [Ghosh and Tian (2006) ] for m = 4, n = 6, [...] ., 11, k = 1, and m = 5, n = 7, [...] ., 16, k = 1 are classified with respect to g values, g ≥ 1, in the property <b>P</b> <b>V</b> and presented through illustrative examples. Several characterizations of designs with <b>P</b> <b>V,</b> g ≥ 1, are provided for the case when k = 1. Designs such as balanced designs, isomorphic designs and complementary designs with the property <b>P</b> <b>V</b> are proven to have <b>P</b> <b>V</b> for k = 1. Tables identifying all such balanced designs are provided. It is noted that although D 9. 2 and D 14 are not balanced, these designs in fact take a special form resulting in <b>P</b> <b>V</b> for k = 1. These special forms are investigated in depth.
