5000|$|The Shangqing huangshu guodu yi 上清黄書過度儀 [...] "Liturgy of Passage of the Yellow Writ of Highest Clarity" [...] (DZ 1294) is the {{earliest}} preserved Zhengyi text to record bugang-type dancing following the magic-square <b>pattern.</b> <b>Mark</b> Csikszentmihalyi (2008:868) says, [...] "This text may {{date from the}} second to fifth centuries CE, and reflects the integration of ritualized visualization, invocation, and sexual techniques." [...] According to Andersen (1989:18), [...] "It presents a wedding ritual, or perhaps one should rather say a rite of sexual union. In any case, sexual union takes place {{as a part of}} the ritual, which also includes certain dances performed by the couple." [...] This text uses the word nie 躡 [...] "walk on tiptoe; walk quietly; tread" [...] in nieji 躡紀 [...] "treading the sequence" [...] or nieshi 躡時 [...] "treading the of time" [...] - instead of bugang, which later became the standard term - describing a ritual dance in which the couple each puts one foot in opposing earthly branches and joins their other two feet in the center, then shifting to the next earthly branch, and so on until they have gone through the whole circle. Nieji refers specifically to the practice, performed repeatedly during the ritual and in turns by both participants, of [...] "toeing" [...] with one foot the body of the other while lying side by side. The movement starts from the heart and describes a circle in eleven steps, the man moving his left foot clockwise to an end point on the right side of the woman and the woman moving her right foot counter-clockwise to an end point on the left side of the man. In both cases it is clear from the accompanying incantation that the notion of the movement of the four seasons is involved. The practice, which is described also as a form of massage, clearly intends to establish an inner circulation in accordance with the patterns of the universe. (Andersen 1989:27). This text gives a series of sexually implicit incantations for neidan [...] "inner circulations" [...] uniting the couple's yin and yang, in order to reach the Shengmen 生門 [...] "Gate of Life" [...] (tr. Andersen 1989:27). The man says, [...] "I wish to mount the Guideline of Heaven and enter the Sequence of Earth. The four seasons and the five elements are each of themselves apposite." [...] The woman says, [...] "I wish to lie on earth and receive heaven, uniting yin and yang. The four seasons and the five elements are each of themselves apposite." [...] They both say, [...] "The five breaths — both the dark and the yellow — adhere of their own my body. They return to my five organs, which glow with light." ...|$|E
40|$|Subsidence {{analysis}} was performed on 43 boreholes penetrating the Upper Vendian-Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary succession of the Baltic Basin. The results were related to lithofacial and structural data to elucidate subsidence mechanisms and the regional tectonic setting of basin development. Tectonic subsidence patterns are consistent throughout the basin for the time period studied. An extensional tectonic subsidence event, possibly of two phases, is indicated from the Late Vendian {{to the beginning of}} the Middle Cambrian. This event is seen in the southwestern part of the Baltic Basin (Peri-Tornquist zone) until the earliest Cambrian after which it is also observed in the SW-NE-trending Baltic Depression part of the basin. Basin development during this time is interpreted as recording the latest stages of break-up of the Precambrian super-continent Rodinia and ultimately the formation of the Tornquist Sea. The late Middle Cambrian to Middle Ordovician tectonic subsidence pattern of the Baltic Basin is characteristic of post-rift thermal subsidence of the newly formed passive continental margin of Baltica, developed along its southwestern edge. A gradual increase in subsidence rate is observed from the (Middle?) Late Ordovician and throughout the Silurian (particularly for Ludlow and Pridoli times) creating subsidence curves with convex shapes typical of foreland basin development. The rate of Late Silurian tectonic subsidence increases significantly towards the southwest margin of the Baltic basin, adjacent to the present location of the North German-Polish Caledonides. The Baltic Basin therefore appears to have developed primarily as a flexural foreland basin during Silurian oblique collision of Baltica and Eastern Avalonia. A foreland setting is supported by the influx of distal turbidites into the basin from southwest sources in the Late Silurian. Compressional deformation structures of Early Devonian (Lochkovian) age are seen in seismic sections in the central part of the Baltic Basin (Lithuania). These, together with a change in subsidence <b>pattern,</b> <b>mark</b> the end of the Caledonian stage of basin development of the Baltic Basin. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.
