5|$|<b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} late Roman/Byzantine author {{to write on}} {{imperial}} ceremonies, beginning a tradition that lasted unto the 14th century. His histories are also an important historical source; for instance, his work alone preserves the negotiations and provisions of the Roman–Persian treaty of 298 between Galerius and Narseh.|$|E

The family moved to Australia in 1950, where <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> educated at Christ Church Grammar School, Perth.

5|$|Gerard was {{the nephew}} of Walkelin, Bishop of Winchester, and Simon, Abbot of Ely. His parents were Osbert and Anna, and his brother <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> also a royal clerk. Where {{he was born and}} raised is unknown; he is {{documented}} as cantor of Rouen Cathedral, and precentor of the same cathedral, although the date of his appointment to either office is unrecorded. By 1091 he had become archdeacon of Rouen. He served in the royal chancery under successive kings of England, William I and William II.|$|E
5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg {{has been}} used in discussions {{on a wide variety of}} topics e.g., economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. James Kemp, a retired United Methodist pastor, {{compared}} Horton to the early Christians to whom the First Epistle of <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, as evidenced by the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book.|$|E

5|$|It {{is presumed}} that <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> {{a native of}} Italy, like {{the other members of}} the Gregorian mission. This mission was {{dispatched}} by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. It landed in Kent in 597, and soon converted King Æthelberht of Kent, who gave Augustine the land on which he founded the abbey that later became St Augustine's, Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Keable's {{most famous}} {{publication}} {{was his first}} novel, Simon Called Peter, but he produced a prodigious literary output, spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides. Simon Called Peters sequel, Recompense, {{was made into a}} film, and his later novels all attracted substantial attention. His writings generally met with much greater popular than critical approbation, and Simon Called <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> sufficiently incendiary to be banned. The book nonetheless became a contemporary best-seller.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Vogt, {{who played}} Peter, told the {{production}} {{team at the}} outset of filming that he only had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the project. Not all of his scenes were filmed by the time his schedule ran out, and he left the production despite the fact that <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> to play a pivotal role in the then-unrecorded climax. His lines in {{the last half of the}} film were given to Ellery, whose character is never introduced, explained, or addressed by name.|$|E

5|$|Peter drowned while {{crossing}} the English Channel {{on the way}} to Gaul, at a place called Ambleteuse, near Boulogne. At first he was buried hastily nearby, but Bede reports that after a light illuminated the grave every night, the locals realised <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> a saint and exhumed him and re-interred him in Boulogne. The actual date of death is unknown, and since his feast day was celebrated on two different days, 30 December or 6 January, that information does not clear up the mystery. The date of his death is reported to have been 1 year, 7 months and 3 weeks after Augustine's, by Thomas of Elmham, a 15th-century chronicler. If this is true, this would give a year of death between 605 and 611. This information, however, is contradicted by the fact that <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> present at the Council of Paris in 614, convened by Chlothar II. It is possible that he died during his return from the Council of Paris.|$|E
5|$|Peter is a {{considered}} a saint, with a feast day on 6 January. His cult was confirmed in 1915. A Vita Petri, or Life of Peter, written by Eadmer in the 12th century, exists in manuscript form, {{but it is}} unreliable. There is evidence that <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> the object of veneration in Boulogne in the 15th century, and a church in that town was associated with Peter, although probably not {{from the start of}} his cult.|$|E

5|$|<b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> born in Venice, {{the only}} son of Doge Otto Orseolo.

Peter did not follow his father, who fled to the Byzantine court in Constantinople; he instead went to Hungary, where his uncle appointed him commander of the royal army.|$|E
5|$|Stackpole {{returned}} to San Francisco in 1912 and married Adele Barnes, two months younger than he, an art student of Xavier Martinez {{and one of}} the first graduates of the California Academy of Arts and Crafts. Adele Stackpole was a perfectionist in many ways, including the precision of her bookplate engravings and the demands she placed on her relationships. On June 15, 1913, the Stackpoles' son <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> born in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid 13th century and had a three-stage tower added in the 15th, however it was extensively restored when the main house {{was built in the}} late 17th century. The church consists of a north and south aisle, chancel and south west porch with the tower to the west. In the south aisle are encaustic tiles dating from the 13th century. The font is Norman while the pulpit is Jacobean. There is also a 16th-century Flemish altar triptych.|$|E

5|$|The Brancacci Chapel, in the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria del Carmine, was founded around 1366/7 by Piero di Piuvichese Brancacci. The chapel passed to Piero's nephew, Felice Brancacci, who some time between 1423 and 1425 commissioned the painter Masolino {{to decorate the}} walls {{with a series of}} frescoes from the life of Saint Peter. <b>Peter</b> <b>was</b> the name-saint of the founder, and the patron saint of the Brancacci family, but the choice also reflected support for the Roman papacy during the Great Schism.|$|E

Later their continued contact became an issue in his security clearance hearings because of Tatlock's Communist associations.
