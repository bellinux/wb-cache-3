5|$|Some {{payloads}} consist simply of {{an application}} designed to lock or restrict the system until <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, or even modifying the {{master boot record}} and/or partition table to prevent the operating system from booting until it is repaired. The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption to encrypt the victim's files {{in such a way}} that only the malware author has the needed decryption key.|$|E
5|$|<b>Payment</b> <b>is</b> {{virtually}} {{always the}} goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|Prompt <b>Payment</b> <b>is</b> {{a comedy}} {{that focuses on}} a lawyer named Jack who is deeply in debt {{to a bunch of}} {{creditors}}. The creditors gather together and go to Jack's office to demand repayment and refuse to leave until they are paid. Jack refuses to leave his office and the creditors decide to play poker while they wait. Jack escapes through a fire escape and dons a disguise and approaches them as another unhappy creditor. Jack's skill in the game leads him win a large sum of money from the creditors. Jack excuses himself from the game and returns undisguised to pay the creditors back, much to the creditors rejoicing.|$|E

50|$|Progress <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> partial <b>payments</b> {{for work}} {{completed}} during a portion, usually a month, during a construction period. Progress <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> made to general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers as construction projects progress. <b>Payments</b> <b>are</b> typically {{made on a}} monthly basis but could be modified to meet certain milestones. Progress <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> an important part of contract administration for the contractor. Proper preparation of the information necessary for payment processing can help the contractor financially complete the project.|$|R

5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% denominated in foreign currencies, debt <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> going to be more costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According {{to the president of the}} Icelandic Federation of Labour (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.|$|E

50|$|County <b>{{payments}}</b> <b>are</b> the United States Forest Service {{payments of}} 25% of gross revenues from each national forest {{to the states}} for use on road and school programs in the counties where the national forests <b>are</b> located. The <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> technically known as Payments to States, because the states determine which road and school programs can be funded. However, the <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> allocated to the counties based on the national forest acreage in each county. County <b>payments</b> <b>were</b> modified temporarily by the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-393).|$|R
50|$|If the <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> {{made at the}} end of {{the time}} periods, so that {{interest}} is accumulated before the <b>payment,</b> the annuity <b>is</b> called an annuity-immediate, or ordinary annuity. Mortgage <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> annuity-immediate, interest is earned before being paid.|$|R

25|$|The {{adjustment}} period. This is {{the length}} of time that the interest rate or loan period on an ARM is scheduled to remain unchanged. The rate is reset {{at the end of this}} period, and the monthly loan <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> recalculated.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposite}} of credit sales (i.e. higher charge for deferred <b>payment)</b> <b>is</b> reduced charges for early payment, and also implies {{an acknowledgment of}} the time value of money and validity of interest on loans according to some (M.A. Khan).|$|E
5000|$|Notation {{directly}} above the basic symbol indicates when <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> made. Two dots indicates an annuity whose <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> {{made at the}} beginning of each year (an [...] "annuity-due"); a horizontal line above the symbol indicates an annuity payable continuously (a [...] "continuous annuity"); no mark above the basic symbol indicates an annuity whose <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> made at the end of each year (an [...] "annuity-immediate").|$|R

25|$|For each purchase, {{the bank}} charges the {{merchant}} a commission (discount fee) for this service {{and there may}} be a certain delay before the agreed <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> received by the merchant. The commission is often a percentage of the transaction amount, plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).|$|E
25|$|There are ten bridges {{over the}} Aura river in Turku. The {{oldest of the}} current bridges is Auransilta, which was {{constructed}} in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The Föri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without <b>payment,</b> <b>is</b> a well known feature of the city.|$|E
50|$|Weregild <b>payment</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} legal mechanism in early Germanic society; the other {{common form of}} legal reparation at this time was blood revenge. The <b>payment</b> <b>was</b> typically made to the family or to the clan.|$|R
50|$|The 1990 “Mental Health Initiative” {{stated that}} the provincial {{government}} would invest $26 million in additional funding over the following 10 years. But only the first <b>payment</b> <b>was</b> initiated and in 1992, the second <b>payment</b> <b>was</b> 18 months overdue.|$|R
5000|$|The above can be reversed: {{given the}} terms (principal, tenor, rate) and amortized payment A, one can compute the WAL {{without knowing the}} {{amortization}} schedule. The total <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> [...] and the total interest <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> , so the WAL is: ...|$|R
25|$|Negative amortization. This {{means the}} {{mortgage}} balance is increasing. This occurs whenever the monthly mortgage payments are not {{large enough to}} pay all the interest due on the mortgage. This may be caused when the payment cap contained in the ARM is low enough such that the principal plus interest <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> greater than the payment cap.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland and Northern Ireland, no banknotes, {{not even}} those issued in those countries, are legal tender. They {{have a similar}} legal {{standing}} to cheques or debit cards, in that their acceptability {{as a means of}} <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved, although Scots law requires any reasonable offer for settlement of a debt to be accepted.|$|E
25|$|In some online lotteries, {{the annual}} {{payments}} are only $25,000, with a balloon payment {{in the final}} year. This type of installment <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> often made through investment in government-backed securities. Online lotteries pay the winners through their insurance backup. However, many winners choose lump sum, since they believe {{they can get a}} better rate of return on their investment elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|... 12% {{compounded}} monthly. Because {{interest is}} compounded, {{there is no}} significant accrued interest account. The current month's obligation becomes part of principal immediately when due. Therefore, there is no issue as to the order in which <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> applied. All <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> applied to principal, which includes accrued interest because interest has been compounded. No grace period.|$|R
50|$|All <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> by credit card.|$|R
50|$|Non-cumulative: missed {{dividend}} <b>payments</b> <b>are</b> forgone.|$|R
25|$|Resulting trust: A {{resulting}} trust {{is a form}} of implied trust which occurs where (1) a trust fails, wholly or in part, as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets; or (2) a voluntary <b>payment</b> <b>is</b> made by A to B in circumstances which do not suggest gifting. B becomes the {{resulting trust}}ee of A's payment.|$|E
25|$|Whenever the pay {{as you go}} balance falls below £10, £20 or £40 {{is added}} to the balance {{automatically}} when the Oyster card is touched on an entry validator. A light on the Oyster reader flashes to indicate the Auto top-up has taken place and an email is sent to confirm the transaction. <b>Payment</b> <b>is</b> then taken from the registered debit or credit card.|$|E
