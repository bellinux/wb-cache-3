Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General.

The hearing was adjourned to due a <b>procedural</b> <b>irregularity</b> in the application, and when this was resolved on 2 May the Court issued notices to the Delhi police and government that required them to provide information regarding the current status of the investigation.

50|$|According to Peckham-Beachcroft, the Richmond {{captain and}} several of its players had become {{concerned}} about Allen's lack {{of control over the}} game, so they did not wish to take the field against North Melbourne under those circumstances. As a result, the committee informed the Association on Wednesday 27 September that it would not play the match unless Allen's appointment as umpire were overturned and he be replaced by another candidate. Richmond lobbied the Association to make a new appointment to as late as the evening of Friday 30 September, but the Association refused to do so. This was in large part because there had been no <b>procedural</b> <b>irregularity</b> with Allen's appointment; Richmond had objected to Allen's performances by letter, but the Richmond delegate present at Allen's appointment had raised no objections. Some delegates, most vocally Mr Harris from West Melbourne, were also motivated by ensuring that one club {{should not be allowed to}} dictate to the entire Association.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether arbitrators’ {{application of}} the wrong substantive law is a ground for challenge of arbitral awards. The topic is divided into the theoretical question of whether to refer the arbitrators’ {{application of the}} wrong substantive law to excess of mandate or <b>procedural</b> <b>irregularity,</b> and the practical question of how national courts handle the demarcation problems that occur in review of awards. The scope of the thesis is limited to challenges on the grounds excess of mandate and <b>procedural</b> <b>irregularity</b> under section 34 of the Swedish Arbitration Act (SAA). [1] The SAA has thereby served {{as a basis for}} the study, but the legislative history, case law and doctrine have also been important. The thesis finds that arbitrators’ application of the wrong substantive law could in theory constitute both excess of mandate and <b>procedural</b> <b>irregularity.</b> However, there are several demarcation problems that occur in practice because it is difficult to distinguish between substantive and procedural errors. Therefore, it seems like only a deliberate disregard of the parties’ choice of law could lead to awards being set aside. Throughout the thesis, the interests of party autonomy and finality of awards are weighed against one another with the conclusion that theory seems to emphasize party autonomy whereas practice seems to emphasize finality of awards. The thesis provides an alternative school of thought of how national courts’ could handle demarcation problems to allow for a wider scope of review on the provision <b>procedural</b> <b>irregularity.</b> This would permit review of also substantive matters to ensure that no significant procedural error has occurred and thus, it would lead to a better balance between party autonomy and finality of awards.

40|$|Close {{companies}} are the majority constituency {{in the corporate}} population across the globe. Yet little attempt has been made by corporate law systems explicitly to legislate for them. This is particularly so in the United Kingdom, where the courts have {{assumed the role of}} providing a customized corporate law regime for such entities. The Duomatic principle of unanimous assent, which is used to whitewash <b>procedural</b> <b>irregularity,</b> is the paradigm in this respect. This article reviews judicial attitudes in the common law world in this regard and evaluates {{the pros and cons of}} converting a globally recognized common law principle into a statutory statement of the law. It also considers the wider merits/demerits of a discrete regulatory framework for close companies and private companies in general...|$|E

5000|$|The {{case set}} a {{precedent}} against unlawful and preventive detention.
