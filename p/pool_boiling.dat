5000|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>pool</b> <b>boiling</b> are different for zeotropic mixtures {{than that of}} pure mixtures. For example, the minimum superheating needed to achieve this boiling is greater for zeotropic mixtures than for pure liquids because of the different proportions of individual substances in the liquid versus gas phases of the zeotropic mixture. [...] Zeotropic mixtures and pure liquids also have different critical heat fluxes. In addition, the heat transfer coefficients of zeotropic mixtures are less than the ideal values predicted using the coefficients of pure liquids. This decrease in heat transfer {{is due to the}} fact that the heat transfer coefficients of zeotropic mixtures do not increase proportionately with the mass fractions of the mixture's components.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Pool</b> <b>Boiling</b> Experiment (PBE) is {{designed}} to improve understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that constitute nucleate <b>pool</b> <b>boiling.</b> Nucleate <b>pool</b> <b>boiling</b> is a process wherein a stagnant pool of liquid is in contact with a surface that can supply heat to the liquid. If the liquid absorbs enough heat, a vapor bubble can be formed. This process occurs when a pot of water boils. On Earth, gravity tends to remove the vapor bubble from the heating surface because it is dominated by buoyant convection. In the orbiting space shuttle, however, buoyant convection has much less of an effect because the forces of gravity are very small. The <b>Pool</b> <b>Boiling</b> Experiment was initiated to provide insight into this nucleate boiling process, which has many earthbound applications in steamgeneration power plants, petroleum plants, and other chemical plants.
