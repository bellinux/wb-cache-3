5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the <b>photocathode</b> initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
25|$|While {{the third}} {{generation}} of tubes were fundamentally {{the same as the}} second generation, they possessed two significant differences. Firstly, they used a GaAs—CsO—AlGaAs <b>photocathode,</b> which is more sensitive in the 800nm-900nm range than second-generation photocathodes. Secondly, the <b>photocathode</b> exhibits negative electron affinity (NEA), which provides photoelectrons that are excited to the conduction band a free ride to the vacuum band as the Cesium Oxide layer {{at the edge of the}} <b>photocathode</b> causes sufficient band-bending. This makes the <b>photocathode</b> very efficient at creating photoelectrons from photons. The Achilles heel of third generation photocathodes, however, is that they are seriously degraded by positive ion poisoning. Due to the high electrostatic field stresses in the tube, and the operation of the MicroChannel Plate, this led to the failure of the <b>photocathode</b> within a short period - as little as 100 hours before <b>photocathode</b> sensitivity dropped below Gen2 levels. To protect the <b>photocathode</b> from positive ions and gases produced by the MCP, they introduced a thin film of sintered aluminium oxide attached to the MCP. The high sensitivity of this <b>photocathode,</b> greater than 900 µA/lm, allows more effective low light response, though this was offset by the thin film, which typically blocked up to 50% of electrons.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1936, a much {{improved}} <b>photocathode,</b> Cs3Sb (caesium-antimony), {{was reported by}} P. Görlich. The caesium-antimony <b>photocathode</b> had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12% at 400nm, and {{was used in the}} first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by RCA (i.e., the 931-type) both as a <b>photocathode</b> and as a secondary-emitting material for the dynodes. Different photocathodes provided differing spectral responses.|$|E
40|$|The {{lifetime}} of GaAs <b>photocathodes</b> can be greatly improved by introducing Li in the Cs+NF 3 activation process. The surface activation layer of such <b>photocathodes</b> is studied by synchrotron radiation photoemission and is compared with GaAs <b>photocathodes</b> activated without Li. The charge distributions of N, F and Cs experience significant changes when Li is {{added in the}} activation. In addition, the presence of Li causes NFx molecules to take an orientation with F atoms on top. All these changes induced by Li hold the key for the lifetime improvement of GaAs <b>photocathodes...</b>|$|R

25|$|It was {{not until}} the {{development}} of the bialkali antimonide photocathodes (potassium-cesium-antimony and sodium-potassium-antimony) discovered by A.H. Sommer and his later multialkali <b>photocathode</b> (sodium-potassium-antimony-cesium) S20 <b>photocathode</b> discovered in 1956 by accident, that the tubes had both suitable infra-red sensitivity and visible spectrum amplification to be useful militarily. The S20 <b>photocathode</b> has a sensitivity of around 150 to 200 µA/lm. The additional sensitivity made these tubes usable with limited light, such as moonlight, while still being suitable for use with low-level infrared illumination.|$|E
25|$|These are {{extremely}} light-sensitive vacuum tubes with a <b>photocathode</b> coated onto part (an end or side) {{of the inside}} of the envelope. The <b>photocathode</b> contains combinations of materials such as caesium, rubidium and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function, so when illuminated even by very low levels of light, the <b>photocathode</b> readily releases electrons. By means of a series of electrodes (dynodes) at ever-higher potentials, these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through secondary emission to provide a readily detectable output current. Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{an image}} tube was first {{proposed}} by G. Holst and H. De Boer (Netherlands) in 1928 , but early attempts to create one were not successful. It was not until 1934 that Holst, working for Philips, created the first successful infrared converter tube. This tube consisted of a <b>photocathode</b> in proximity to a fluorescent screen. Using a simple lens, an image {{was focused on the}} <b>photocathode</b> and a potential difference of several thousand volts was maintained across the tube, causing electrons dislodged from the <b>photocathode</b> by photons to strike the fluorescent screen. This caused the screen to light up with the image of the object focused onto the screen, however the image was non-inverting. With this image converter type tube, it was possible to view infrared light in real time, for the first time.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} the polarization and charge limit behavior of electron beams produced by strained GaAs <b>photocathodes.</b> These <b>photocathodes</b> {{are the source of}} high– intensity, high–polarization electron beams used for a variety of high–energy physics experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Recent developments on p–type, biaxially–strained GaAs <b>photocathodes</b> have produced longitudinal polarization in excess of 80 % while yielding beam intensities of ~ 2. 5 A/cm 2 at an operating voltage of 120 kV. The SLAC Gun Test Laboratory, which has a replica of the SLAC injector, was upgraded with a Mott polarimeter to study the polarization properties of <b>photocathodes</b> operating in a highvoltage DC gun. Both the maximum beam polarization and the maximum charge obtainable from these <b>photocathodes</b> have shown a strong dependence on the wavelength of illumination, on the doping concentration, and on the negative electron affinity levels. The experiments performed for this thesis included studying the effects of temperature, cesiation, quantum efficiency, and laser intensity on the polarization of high–intensity beams. It was found that, although low temperatures have been shown to reduce the spin relaxation rate in bulk semiconductors, they don’t have a large impact on the polarization o...|$|R

25|$|Second {{generation}} {{image intensifiers}} {{use the same}} multialkali <b>photocathode</b> that the first generation tubes used, however by using thicker layers of the same materials, the S25 <b>photocathode</b> was developed, which provides extended red response and reduced blue response, making it more suitable for military applications. It has a typical sensitivity of around 230 µA/lm and a higher quantum efficiency than S20 <b>photocathode</b> material. Oxidation of the cesium to cesium oxide in later versions improved the sensitivity {{in a similar way}} to third generation photocathodes. The same technology that produced the fiber optic bundles that allowed the creation of cascade tubes, allowed, with a slight change in manufacturing, the production of micro-channel plates, or MCPs. The micro-channel plate is a thin glass wafer with a Nichrome electrode on either side across which a large potential difference of up to 1,000 volts is applied.|$|E

25|$|Photomultipliers are {{typically}} constructed with an evacuated glass housing (using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum tubes), containing a <b>photocathode,</b> several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the <b>photocathode</b> material, {{which is usually}} a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer {{on the inside of}} the entry window of the device. Electrons are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier, where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Theoretical {{calculation}} {{indicates that}} the large exponential-doping GaAs <b>photocathodes</b> have a much narrower electron energy distribution than traditional GaAs NEA cathodes, and the excellent performance attributes to the special structure characters of the band-bending region and lower negative electron affinity of the new-type GaAs <b>photocathodes.</b> The effects of surface doping concentration and work function on the energy distribution are discussed in details, and the FWHM of the energy distribution is less than 100 meV.

25|$|Image intensifiers convert {{low levels}} of light photons into {{electrons}}, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter an objective lens which focuses an image into a <b>photocathode.</b> The <b>photocathode</b> releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a microchannel plate (MCP). Each high-energy electron that strikes the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is tilted to encourage more electron collisions, thus {{increasing the amount of}} emission of secondary electrons.|$|E
25|$|First {{generation}} passive devices, introduced {{during the}} Vietnam War, were {{an adaptation of}} earlier active GEN 0 technology, and rely on ambient light instead of an infrared light source. Using an S-20 <b>photocathode,</b> their image intensifiers produce a light amplification of around 1,000×, but are quite bulky and require moonlight to function properly.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} devices feature {{an improved}} image-intensifier tube utilizing micro-channel plate (MCP) with an S-25 <b>photocathode,</b> {{resulting in a}} much brighter image, especially {{around the edges of}} the lens.

40|$|The ALICE HMPID RICH {{detector}} {{is equipped}} with CsI <b>photocathodes</b> in a MWPC {{for the detection of}} Cherenkov photons. The long term operational experience with large area CsI <b>photocathodes</b> will be described.

25|$|With the {{discovery}} of more effective <b>photocathode</b> materials, which increased in both sensitivity and quantum efficiency, it became possible to achieve significant levels of gain over Generation 0 devices. In 1936, the S-11 cathode (cesium-antimony) was discovered by Gorlich, which provided sensitivity of approximately 80 µA/lm with a quantum efficiency of around 20%; this only included sensitivity in the visible region with a threshold wavelength of approximately 650nm.|$|E
