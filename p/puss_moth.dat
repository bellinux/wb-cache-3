5|$|In March 1930, a {{discussion}} initiated by pilot G. Vlasto {{led to the}} founding of Madras Flying Club which became a pioneer in pilot training South India. On 15 October 1932, Indian aviator J. R. D. Tata flew a <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> aircraft carrying mail from Karachi to Bombay (currently Mumbai) and the aircraft continued to Madras (currently Chennai) piloted by Neville Vincent, a former Royal Air Force pilot and friend of Tata.|$|E
50|$|The fleet {{originally}} {{consisted of}} five DH60 Gipsy Moths. A Fokker Super Universal and two DH <b>Puss</b> <b>Moths</b> were added in 1930, but all three crashed during 1931, {{two of the}} crashes being fatal.|$|R
50|$|Union Airways carried {{its first}} {{passenger}} from Cape Town to East London on 3 September 1929. The airline also undertook the carriage of sick persons on mercy flights (unscheduled; route and schedule as required). As both mail and passenger traffic increased Miller bought a Fokker Super Universal {{single engine aircraft}} that could carry six passengers; this aircraft entered service on 29 May 1930. The next aircraft type to enter service with Union Airways were two de Havilland DH 80A <b>Puss</b> <b>Moths.</b> These aircraft could carry two passengers in an enclosed cabin and replaced some of the Gypsy Moths that had been sold or written off.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{famous of}} the record {{breaking}} <b>Puss</b> <b>Moths</b> was Jim Mollison's G-ABXY, [...] "The Heart's Content" [...] which completed the first solo east-west Atlantic crossing in August 1932 from Portmarnock Strand near Dublin to New Brunswick, Canada and the first east-west crossing of the South Atlantic from Lympne Aerodrome to Natal, Brazil in February 1933. His wife Amy Johnson made record flights between England and Cape Town using G-ACAB, [...] "Desert Cloud" [...] in 1932.C.J. Melrose flew VH-UQO, named [...] "My Hildegarde" [...] in the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race. They finished overall seventh and second on handicap {{in a time of}} 10 days 16 hours.|$|R
5|$|On 18 September 1932, Holden was {{travelling}} as {{a passenger}} aboard a New England Airways DH.80 <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> from Sydney to Brisbane when it crashed at Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, killing him instantly. The other occupants, pilot Ralph Virtue {{and the joint}} owner of the Canberra, Holden's schoolfriend Dr George Hamilton, also perished. Investigations determined that the <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth,</b> VH-UPM, had gone down {{as a result of}} wing failure caused by aileron flutter. A crowded memorial service for Holden and Hamilton took place at Sydney Church of England Grammar School on 20 September; they were cremated that afternoon at Rookwood Cemetery, where eighteen aircraft piloted by friends and associates of the pair overflew the chapel. Holden was survived by his wife and children. His father Hubert carried on operating Holden's Air Transport Services, floating it as a public corporation and serving as chairman. Les Holden, George Hamilton, and one of their schoolmates who had also recently died, Henry Braddon, were commemorated with a memorial stained-glass window at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School chapel in 1934. Holden was also honoured by Holden Street, built in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra in 1943.|$|E
25|$|LAPE {{was one of}} the few {{airlines}} that used the Douglas DC-1; some of the other planes used by LAPE are the following: Fokker F.VII, Spartan Executive, Caudron C.448, Breguet 470, Savoia-Marchetti S.74, Northrop Delta, Douglas DC-2, Ford Trimotor, General Aviation GA-43, Airspeed AS.6J Envoy, de Havilland Dragon Rapide and de Havilland <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth.</b>|$|E
25|$|The aerodrome {{started off}} as an unpaved {{airfield}} in 1928. It {{was used by}} the then newly established Bombay Flying Club for teaching, joy-rides, and air travel. The activities of the club were limited {{by the fact that the}} aerodrome at Juhu was not suitable during the monsoon. Much progress had been made in the layout of the ground of the aerodrome by 1932, although the ground was still not fit for use during that year's monsoon. J. R. D. Tata, the father of civil aviation in India, made his maiden voyage to Juhu airport from Drigh Road Airstrip in Karachi, via Ahmedabad, on 15 October 1932 carrying mail in a <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|South African Airways {{was formed}} on 1 February 1934 {{following}} {{the acquisition of}} Union Airways (UA) by the South African government. Forty staff members, along with one de Havilland DH.60 Gypsy Moth, one de Havilland 80A <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth,</b> three Junkers F.13s and a leased Junkers F13 and Junkers A50 were among the acquired. Upon acquisition, the government changed the airline's name to South African Airways. came under control of the South African Railways and Harbours Administration (now Transnet). Charter operations started that year. On 1 February the following year, the carrier acquired Suidwes Lugdiens / South West Airways (now Air Namibia), which had since 1932 been providing a weekly air-mail service between Windhoek and Kimberley. During this time, South African ordered three Junkers Ju 52/3m aircraft, which were delivered in October 1934 and entered service 10 days later. These aircraft were configured to carry 14 passengers, along with four crew. They enabled thrice-weekly Durban–Johannesburg services, with weekly services on the Durban–East London–Port Elizabeth–George/Mossel Bay–Cape Town route. On 1 July 1935, SAA moved its operations to Rand Airport as it became increasingly obvious that Johannesburg would become the country's aviation hub, which coincided with the launching of Rand–Durban–East London–Port Elizabeth–Cape Town services. From July the following year a weekly Rand–Kimberley–Beaufort West–Cape Town service commenced; in April 1936, all Rand–Cape Town services were taken over from Imperial Airways. A fourth Ju 52/3m soon joined the fleet.|$|E
500|$|The British Medical Journal {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} July 1890. The review begins by noting that the pre-Darwinian view of colour [...] "to-day appears almost ridiculous", adding that [...] "we now know" [...] that colour is of benefit to the animal, and is subject to natural selection. The reviewer writes that it is among Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) that [...] "protective resemblance or 'cryptic coloration' is most beautifully illustrated, and the book teems with instances" [...] of these, noting that Poulton had [...] "made {{this part of the}} subject his own". The review quotes examples including the twig larvae of the Brimstone moth and the [...] "terrifying attitude" [...] of the <b>Puss</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillar.|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} a brief account of the {{physical}} causes of animal coloration. The second chapter gives {{an overview of the}} book, describing the various uses of colour in terms of the advantages it can bring through natural selection. The next seven chapters describe camouflage, both in predators and in prey. Methods of camouflage covered include background matching, resemblance to specific objects such as bird droppings, self-decoration with materials from the environment, and the seasonal colour change of arctic animals. Two chapters cover warning colours, including both Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is edible, and Mullerian mimicry, where distasteful species mimic each other. A chapter then looks at how animals combine multiple methods of defence, for instance in the <b>puss</b> <b>moth.</b> Two chapters examine coloration related to sexual selection. Finally Poulton summarizes the subject with a fold-out table including a set of Greek derived words that he invented, of which [...] "aposematic" [...] and [...] "cryptic" [...] survive in biological usage.|$|E
500|$|In October 1932, a Spartan A.24 Mailplane (G-ABLI) left Lympne {{en route}} for Karachi from Blackpool. Karachi was reached {{in less than}} six days. On 14 November 1932, Amy Johnson left Lympne for Cape Town in DH.80a <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> (G-ACAB). She beat her husband Jim Mollison's time by 10 hours and 28 minutes, setting a new UK-South Africa record. On the return she also set a new South Africa-UK record. On 11 April 1933, William Newton Lancaster {{departed}} Lympne in an Avro Avian V (G-ABLK) Southern Cross Minor to beat Amy Johnson's UK-South Africa record. The aircraft crashed in the Sahara next day and although Lancaster survived he died eight days later when his water ran out. On 2 November 1934, Owen Cathcart Jones and Ken Waller landed at Lympne in a de Havilland Comet (G-ACSR) after a record breaking flight from Australia to the United Kingdom. Harry Frank Broadbent landed at Lympne in a DH.85 Leopard Moth (VH-AHB) on arrival from Australia on 27 April 1937, filmed by Gaumont News, and an Australia-UK record was set. [...] On 24 October 1937 Jean Batten flew to Lympne in a Percival Gull Six (G-ADPR), having set a solo Australia-UK record and female Australia-UK record.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Johnson married Scottish pilot Jim Mollison, who had {{proposed}} to her during a flight together some eight hours {{after they had}} first met. In July 1932, Johnson set a solo record for the flight from London to Cape Town, South Africa in <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> G-ACAB, named Desert Cloud, [...] breaking her new husband's record.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson next {{obtained}} de Havilland DH.80 <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> G-AAZV {{which she}} named Jason II. In July 1931, she and co-pilot Jack Humphreys {{became the first}} to fly from London to Moscow in one day, completing the [...] journey in approximately 21 hours. From there, they continued across Siberia and on to Tokyo, setting a record time for Britain to Japan.|$|E
2500|$|During [...] anting, birds rub insects {{on their}} feathers, usually ants, which secrete liquids {{containing}} chemicals such as formic acid. [...] These {{can act as}} an insecticide, miticide, fungicide, bactericide, or to make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid. It possibly also supplements the bird's own preen oil. [...] Although {{it has been suggested}} that anting acts as a way of reducing feather parasites such as mites or in controlling fungi or bacteria, there has been little convincing support for any of the theories. [...] Some cases of anting involved the use of millipedes or <b>puss</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillars, and these too are known to release powerful defensive chemicals.|$|E
2500|$|Wartime {{aviation}} {{has changed}} the course of history and Sir Lindsay Everard is an important contributor to its development. [...] In 1930, Sir Lindsay opened Ratcliffe Aerodrome on [...] near his estate and Ratcliffe College. [...] He had become President of the Leicester Aeroclub in 1928, purchasing the club a de Havilland Gipsy Moth in 1929. [...] Named [...] "The Quorn", the club used Carts Field at Desford. [...] A large air show brought 30,000 spectators to the site. [...] Sir Lindsay purchased a de Havilland <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> that he named [...] "The Leicestershire", and sold in July 1932. [...] He also favoured the Percival Gull Four P.1.B Mk. IIa.|$|E
2500|$|The Tata Airmail Service, {{as it was}} called, {{continued}} on to Pune, Bellary, and Madras. This was the birth of Air India, which, in 1932, was based here out of a hut with a palm thatched roof and had 1 pilot and 2 apprentice mechanics with 2 piston engined aircraft, a <b>Puss</b> <b>Moth</b> and a Leopard Moth. Two bitumen runways - one aligned East-West and the other [...] North-NorthWest - South-SouthEast were laid in 1936. During the monsoons, operations had to be shifted to Poona due to water logging. A third runway was planned for construction in 1939 but this never occurred. It served as the city's airport up to and during World War II.|$|E
