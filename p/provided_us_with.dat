The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments.|$|E
25|$|Excavations of {{the ship}} sheds (neōsoikoi) at the harbour of Zea in Piraeus, which was the main war harbour of ancient Athens, were first carried out by Dragatsis and Wilhelm Dörpfeld in the 1880s. These have <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a general outline of the Athenian trireme. The sheds were ca. 40 m long and just 6 m wide. These {{dimensions}} are corroborated by the evidence of Vitruvius, whereby the individual space allotted to each rower was 2 cubits. With the Doric cubit of 0.49 m, this results in an overall ship length of just under 37 m. The height of the sheds' interior was established as 4.026 metres, leading to estimates that {{the height of the}} hull above the water surface was ca. 2.15metres. Its draught was relatively shallow, about 1metre, which, in addition to the relatively flat keel and low weight, allowed it to be beached easily.|$|E
25|$|Research has <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> {{mixed results}} {{as to whether}} or not a person's {{involvement}} in social networking can affect their feelings of loneliness. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social networking can change their feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way. Some companies with mobile workers have encouraged their workers to use social networking to feel connected, educators are using it to keep connected with their students and individuals are benefiting from social networking to keep connect with already close relationships that they've developed under circumstances that would otherwise make it difficult to do so. Each social networking user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online. In his book Digital Identities: Creating and Communicating the Online Self, Rob Cover argues that social networking's foundation in Web 2.0, high-speed networking shifts online representation to one which is both visual and relational to other people, complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety. In 2016, news reports stated that excessive usage of SNS sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression, to almost triple the rate for non-SNS users. Experts worldwide have said that 2030 people who use SNS more have higher levels of depression than those who use SNS less.|$|E

500|$|In season three, Abby {{sets her}} {{sights on the}} wealthy Gary Ewing, the husband of her good friend Valene Ewing. While Gary {{initially}} thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress Joan Van Ark, who played Val, said: [...] "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center I can’t believe I did that but it really <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> some great stories. And it was the longest running story on the show." [...] Dan Lewis of the Sarasota Journal said, [...] "In a recent episode, Abby lures Gary Ewing into an affair, and sets it up so that his wife will discover it. After she completed the scene, Miss Mills recalls, the crew hissing at her – jokingly, of course." [...] The character was known for her numerous rivalries with other female characters, such as Paige and Karen. Carole Glinez said, [...] "Mills' character faced her rival Paige, played by future Desperate Housewives sexpot Nicollette Sheridan." ...|$|E
500|$|Limbo was {{released}} on 21 July 2010 on the Xbox Live Arcade service, as the first title in the yearly [...] "Summer of Arcade" [...] promotion. Although the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) had listed entries for Limbo for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows platforms, Playdead confirmed {{that this was a}} mistake on ESRB's part, and that they had no plans for the game on these systems. Patti later clarified that they had planned on Windows and PlayStation 3 versions alongside the Xbox 360 version initially, but after reviewing their options, decided to go with Xbox 360 exclusivity, in part that [...] "Microsoft <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> an excellent opportunity, which included a lot of support for the title which in the end would mean a better visibility for Limbo". According to producer Mads Wibroe, part of their decision not to release for the Windows platform was to avoid issues with software piracy, something they could control on the Xbox 360. Patti stated that staying exclusive with the Xbox platform was an assurance that {{they would be able to}} recoup their investment in the game's development. Sony Computer Entertainment executive Pete Smith stated later that while they had tried to vie with Microsoft for exclusivity for Limbo, Playdead refused to relinquish its intellectual property to Sony as part of the deal. Patti affirmed that Limbo would not be released for another console, but that their next game, already in development as of October 2010, may see wider release.|$|E

2500|$|If Shakespeare {{had been}} a {{slightly}} more important person during his lifetime, {{at least as important}} as Ben Jonson, history would have <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> more details about his life. But Shakespeare was not {{at the top of the}} social ladder, he was little more than a parasite of contemporary magnates. Nor did he belong to the great minds of his time. He was too uneducated to achieve such a position, as it is known. The romantic ideas according to which Shakespeare was a great wit, a great historian or a great thinker, are nowadays completely rejected [...] Today, it is evident that Shakespeare was first of all a true dodger of his era. He used the various materials from history or from the contemporary circumstances in England in order to create attractive theatrical masterpieces. First of all, we have to understand that Shakespeare never thought of theatre as literature. The theatre was a dangerous and slightly indecent institution, which every respectful and truly honored member of the society would rather avoid.|$|E

2500|$|Physician I. Spielmann {{describes}} Rainer admiringly as a [...] "polyhistor" [...] with [...] "a passionate {{image of}} what truth is". According to a student, the historian of medicine G. Brătescu, Rainer was an outstanding pedagogue and public speaker, whose anatomy lessons were highly inspirational, but whose neglect for his public appearance could alienate young people. As he writes: [...] "After showing us that medical science is one of observation, but that in practice it involves continuous experimentation, and why it {{is more of a}} craft that demands medical instinct, Rainer <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> the one effective measure to sustain it: uninterrupted self-examination". Vitner also noted Rainer's preference for orality, attributing it to an [...] "extraordinary fear of the written word". Meanwhile, other specialists rejected Rainer's ideas and approach. According to anatomist Victor Papilian (whom Rainer had denounced as a plagiarist), Rainer's was [...] "a sterile and envious school" [...] of self-proclaimed [...] "geniuses". According to Papilian, Rainer moved freely between subjects outside of his competence, including the paleontology of Leonardo da Vinci and the latest discoveries in astronomy.|$|E
2500|$|Criminal defense {{attorney}} Angelyn Gates of Chase Criminal Defense Attorneys raises concern that citizen groups {{are not subject}} to the same standards as trained law enforcement officials. She notes that laws are designed to keep police officers from violating citizens' rights, and that the same rules don't apply to citizens who may be violating other citizens' rights. [...] "Police officers are trained in theory," [...] Gates said. [...] " [...] are not watching out for themselves by trying to pretend they're a child on the Internet," [...] she said. [...] "They're doing it for the thrill, fun, and notoriety they seem to be getting out of it." [...] Detective Mike Burns of Darke County asserts that Perverted-Justice sets stricter criteria than many law enforcement agencies do for arrest. He contends that Perverted-Justice subscribes to protocols well within those followed by law enforcement. He does however concede, [...] "Sometimes it was a fine line, but they <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> 140 people they were chatting with after 10 days with possibilities of showing up for a meeting. There's no way a department five times our size could have done that." ...|$|E

He also went on to say, [...] "As I said to the BCCI in a letter, had it been one of the players who was attacked there would have been an outcry, but because it was me no-one seemed to care. The reply came back talking about my racist comments." [...] and added [...] "There was a cover-up. Everyone went into cover-up mode. It was quite obvious it was a serious assault. It wasn't just a push in the back as the media was led to believe. The whole thing was played down. The only phone call I got from the BCCI asked me whether it really happened." [...] In response, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told Cricinfo, [...] "No way can it be called racist. We treated the issue just like we would have treated [...] any other Indian player. I remember calling him and finding out the issue. We also enhanced security and provided adequate protection. The local police also <b>provided</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> support." [...] Chappell later downplayed the incident saying his comments came at [...] "an emotional time".|$|E

30|$|While being a Muslim is a {{significant}} screening cue, it cannot differentiate between Muslims who are Jihadists and Muslims who are not Jihadists.
