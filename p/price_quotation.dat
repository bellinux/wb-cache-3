5000|$|Once the HTML or XHTML markup is {{delivered}} to a page-visitor's client browser, {{there is a}} chance that client-side code will need to navigate the internal structure (or Document Object Model) of the web page. The most common {{reason for this is that}} the page {{is delivered}} with client-side JavaScript that will produce on-going dynamic behavior after the page is rendered. For example, if rolling the mouse over a 'Buy now' link is meant to make the price, elsewhere on the page, become emphasized, JavaScript code can do this, but JavaScript needs to identify the price element, wherever it is in the markup. The following markup would suffice: [...] Another example is the Ajax programming technique, where, for example, clicking a hypertext link may cause JavaScript code to retrieve the text for a new <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> to display in place of the current one within the page, without re-loading the whole page. When the new text arrives back from the server, the JavaScript must identify the exact region on the page to replace with the new information.|$|E

To {{satisfy the}} {{increasing}} requirements in the collaborative development and <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> for injection mould from the customers and companies, {{this paper presents}} a web-based cost estimation system of injection mould which can aid mould designers to evaluate the different design alternatives, implement the collaborative development of injection mould, and provide a reference for mould quotation. The overall architecture of the system based on a logical structure of four layers is established. Approach to cost estimation for injection mould is described in detail. Furthermore, a java-enabled solution together with the JESS 4. 4 expert system shell and Microsoft Access 2000 is employed to develop such a networked cost estimation system. Finally, an actual example is given to demonstrate {{the use of the}} online cost estimation system of injection mould. The practical results from engineering application indicate the system can provide an effective and feasible tool to aid the evaluation of design alternatives and <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> at the early development stages of injection mould...|$|E
40|$|This article {{studies the}} joint <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> and {{production}} scheduling {{problem for a}} manufacturer. The {{novelty of the work}} includes modeling the uncertainty in the customers order placement, as well as considering the detailed sequencing decision for multiple distinct orders, in a unified framework. We derive closed-form expressions for the expected production cost, measured by the total weighted completion time, under a given set of price quotations and then design dynamic programming algorithms to find the optimal price quotations. The proposed model and algorithms are validated by computational experiments. Important managerial insights are provided. First, the manufacturer only needs to evaluate a few discrete prices to quote, rather than consider a full, continuous spectrum of prices. Second, knowing accurate information on order placement probabilities is important for the manufacturer to make profitable pricing and scheduling decisions. Third, the integrated decision on <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> and production scheduling has a significant advantage in profit maximization compared with various alternative decision approaches. The quotation model also demonstrates efficiency in quoting dynamically arriving inquiries. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a profit-maximizing make-to-order manufacturer that offers multiple products {{to a market}} of price and delay sensitive users, using a model that captures three aspects of particular interest: first, the joint use of dynamic <b>pricing</b> and lead-time <b>quotation</b> controls to manage demand; second, {{the presence of a}} dual sourcing mode that can expedite orders at a cost; and third, the interaction of the aforementioned demand controls with the operational decisions of sequencing and expediting that the firm must employ to optimize revenues and satisfy the quoted lead times. Using an approximating diffusion control problem we derive near-optimal dynamic <b>pricing,</b> lead-time <b>quotation,</b> sequencing, and expediting policies that provide structural insights and lead to practically implementable recommendations.
