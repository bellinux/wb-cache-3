40|$|Western {{flower thrips}} (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis, {{is one of}} the most serious pests in several {{vegetable}} and flower crops worldwide. It is a highly polyphagous insect and a vector of several plant viruses of which the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus and the Impatiens Necrotic Spot Virus are the most important. Feeding by WFT causes light coloured patches on leaves, petals and fruits, stunted plant growth, and flower and fruit deformation. Synthetic pesticides has been widely used to control  WFT. However, the frequent use of these pesticides leads to rapid resistance in WFT, and they are a threat to the environment. Therefore, it is desirable to identify natural sources of resistance effective against WFT to allow breeders to improve resistance in crop species. Monoterpenes, as constituents of floral scents and plant resins, play an important role in pollinator attraction and in direct and indirect plant defence against pest insects and pathogens. For example, linalool is a common floral scent constituent and found to be emitted from the leaves by many plant species after herbivore attack. In earlier work, linalool-overexpressing Arabidopsis has been tested for resistance to the pest aphid, Myzus persicae, in dual-choice assays, and transgenic plants significantly repelled or deterred the aphids. A linalool synthase (LIS) was overexpressed in chrysanthemum plants and studied the effect of transgenic plants on WFT (Chapter 2).   The volatiles from leaves of transgenic plants were significantly attractive to WFT, however, WFT were significantly deterred by the content of leaf discs from transgenic plants. The headspace analysis showed that the volatiles of LIS chrysanthemum leaves were strongly dominated by linalool,but, they also emitted small amounts of the C 11 -homoterpene, (3 E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, a derivative of nerolidol. In addition, LC-MS analysis showed that several non-volatile linalool glycosides were significantly increased in the leaves of LIS chrysanthemum compared with leaves of wild-type plants. A geraniol synthase (GES) was overexpressed in maize to see whether WFT could be affected by geraniol or its derivatives (Chapter 3). However, geraniol produced in transgenic maize was all efficiently converted to non-volatile glycoside, geranoyl- 6 -O-malonyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, and GES maize had no effect on WFT behaviour. These studies demonstrate complex effects of terpene engineering on the metabolic changes in transgenic plants. These results suggest that the release/glycosylation of terpenes should be controlled to improve plant resistance against WFT upon metabolic engineering with terpene synthases.   The research subsequently focused on a well-known natural pesticide—pyrethrins. Pyrethrins comprise a group of six closely related esters, derived from the monoterpene alcohol chrysanthemol. Pyrethrins are the economically most important natural insecticide with broad uses in homes, agriculture and stored products for more than 150 years. The effect of pyrethrins against WFT was evaluated on its survival, feeding behaviour, and reproduction both in vitro and in planta (infiltrated chrysanthemum leaves) (Chapter 4). Pyrethrins at 0. 1 % (w/v) and 1 % (w/v) exhibited a significantly negative effect on feeding, and the effects of natural concentrations of pyrethrins in pyrethrum leaves can explain the observed high mortality of WFT feeding on pyrethrum leaves. After the finding of this strong effect of pyrethrins on WFT, the study on the biosynthetic pathway of pyrethrins was continued in order to introduce pyrethrin biosynthesis in transgenic plants. A second function of the published enzyme, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS) was identified (Chapter 5). CDS has been reported to catalyse the formation of chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP). However, CDS was demonstrated to also catalyse the next step of CPP into chrysanthemol both in vitro and in vivo. CDS was proposed to be renamed as a chrysanthemol synthase (CHS) using DMAPP as substrate. The gene involved in the next step converting chrysanthemol to chrysanthemic acid has also been characterized (Ramirez, 2013). A chrysanthemic acid:CoA   ligase, which is involved in the final stage of pyrethrin biosynthesis was also studied (Chapter 6). The function of this enzyme was confirmed in vitro and the encoding gene showed a similar expression pattern as CHS in several different tissues and flower developmental stages. The gene responsible for making the final esters is a GDSL-lipase-like acyltransferase (Kikuta et al., 2012). We assume still three to four enzymes are required for the biosynthesis of the basic one of the six <b>pyrethrin</b> esters, jasmolin <b>I,</b> from the precursors DMAPP and jasmonic acid which are universal in plants. And four to five extra genes are required for the complete biosynthesis of all six pyrethrin esters. In this study, new insights were gained for the biosynthesis of monoterpenes and their derivatives and conjugates, as well as for plant resistance to WFT mediated by these compounds. The characterization of genes involved in pyrethrin biosynthesis paves the way for metabolic engineering of this natural pesticide in other crops...|$|R
40|$|The use of botanical {{insecticides}} is in today’s world {{an attractive}} {{alternative to the}} less safe and environmentally malign synthetic chemicals, whose overall longer persistence in the environment does not only make them more contaminant, but also increases their chances of causing a rapid development of resistance in the target pest and having negative-side effects on beneficial organisms. Yet, at present {{only a handful of}} botanical products are in commercial use for insect control on crops. Among the most important botanical insecticides (pyrethrins, rotenone, neem and essential oils), pyrethrins have the longest history of effective use against a wide range of insects and best record of low toxicity to mammals. Although pyrethrins were relegated from their once prominent position in the mid- 1930 ’s, the recent market trends towards “reduced risk” pesticides and host plant resistance have brought pyrethrins back to the attention and initiated the generation of knowledge around them. Pyrethrins refer to an oleoresin extracted from the dried daisy-like flowers of pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium). The active constituents are six esters formed by a combination of two acids (chrysanthemic acid and pyrethric acid) and three alcohols (pyrethrolone, cinerolone and jasmolone, collectively called rethrolones). The esters of chrysanthemic acid with the rethrolones constitute type <b>I</b> <b>pyrethrins,</b> whereas the esters of pyrethric acid are collectively known as type II pyrethrins. Apart from being the source of pyrethrins, pyrethrum also produces a range of other defense compounds collectively known as sesquiterpene lactones, which have also been implicated in plant defense against herbivores, pathogens, and competing plant species. Although pyrethrins and sesquiterpene lactones are found throughout the whole plant, the highest concentrations of both types of compounds are found in the achenes of the flowers, which are densely covered with glandular trichomes. GC-MS analysis revealed that trichomes of mature achenes contain sesquiterpene lactones and other secondary metabolites, but no pyrethrins. Although glandular trichomes were known to participate in the production of mono- and sesquiterpene compounds that were stored in or emitted from the subcuticular cavity just outside the apical cells, here we demonstrate that basipetal secretion can also occur. In pyrethrum, the monoterpene-derived portion of pyrethrins, chrysanthemic acid (CA), is translocated from the trichomes to the pericarp, where it is esterified into pyrethrins that accumulate in the intercellular space. We also show that during seed maturation, pyrethrins stored in the pericarp are absorbed by the developing embryo, and that during seed germination these embryo-stored pyrethrins are recruited by the germinating seedling, which, {{due to the lack of}} trichomes, cannot produce defense compounds themselves. At early stages, not only sesquiterpene lactones that diffuse to the soil from the seed coat, but also the pyrethrins found in the seedlings, seem to play a more important role as antimicrobials than as insecticides. Although there has been considerable progress on the chemistry of pyrethrins, the molecular/biochemical basis of their biosynthesis was largely unknown. The acid and alcohol moieties of pyrethrins derive from distinct pathways. Whereas the alcohol portion is believed to be derived from linolenic acid and share a large part of its biosynthetic pathway with jasmonic acid, the acid moieties are monoterpenes with a cyclopropane ring that are supposed to be derived from an irregular monoterpene pathway. Before the start  of this project, only one enzyme, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (TcCDS), had been isolated and demonstrated to catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of the acid portion of pyrethrins, which consist of the condensation of two molecules of DMAPP to produce chrysanthemol (COH) via chrysanthemyl diphosphate. During this project an additional acyltransferase enzyme (TcGLIP) was isolated by another group and demonstrated to be responsible for the esterification of (1 R, 3 R) -chrysanthemoyl-CoA and (S) -pyrethrolone, one of the last steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins, which was demonstrated in this thesis to likely take place in the pericarp. To identify additional genes of the pyrethrin biosynthetic pathway, we generated three EST libraries derived from ovaries, trichomes and leaves. Gene candidates were obtained either by keyword interrogation of the annotated contigs or by blasting the libraries with known genes catalyzing similar reactions in other plants. Given the likelihood of cytochrome P 450 s as potential candidates to catalyze the missing steps in the biosynthesis of the acid moiety of pyrethrins, the pyrethrum EST libraries, were first interrogated for genes encoding cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes with a developmental expression pattern similar to TcCDS, and a specific expression in CA-producing glandular trichomes. Experiments with yeast microsomes allowed the selection of two enzymes capable of converting COH into chrysanthemal. Although after agro-infiltration none of these enzymes affected the background level of CA, one of them (Ct 21854) resulted in a strong reduction of COH emission, which correlates with a significantly higher amounts of a CA conjugate, confirming that Ct 21854 qualifies as a chrysanthemic acid synthase efficiently converting COH into CA. Rethrolones have been proposed to originate from linolenic acid and share part of the oxylipin pathway with jasmonic acid, which in turns implies that one of the first committed steps should involve a lipoxygenase enzyme, catalyzing the hydroperoxidation of linolenic acid at position 13 of the hydrocarbon chain. Based on this assumption the pyrethrum EST libraries were interrogated for genes encoding LOX enzymes. The expression patterns of twenty-five lipoxygenase EST contigs were characterized, and the ones with a developmental regulation similar to TcCDS and TcGLIP were selected. Subsequently, the molecular cloning of a lipoxygenase, TcLOX 1, was carried out.  Recombinant TcLOX 1 was demonstrated to catalyze the peroxidation of the linolenic acid substrate at the C 13    position. The gene shares the developmental and trichome-specific  expression pattern with TcCDS, suggesting that a trichome production and translocation could be operating for the alcohol moiety of pyrethrins as well. Finally, besides pyrethrins, pyrethrum plants are also a source of sesquiterpene lactones. Even though considerable information on bioactivity and industrial significance of pyrethrum sesquiterpene lactones is available, the localization and biosynthetic origins were largely unknown. Like in other species of the Asteraceae family, pyrethrum sesquiterpene lactones are exclusively stored in trichomes and it is shown that germacratrien- 12 -oic acid (GAA) is most likely the central precursor of all known sesquiterpene lactones found in pyrethrum. Candidate genes implicated in the first two committed steps leading from farnesyl diphosphate to GAA were retrieved from the pyrethrum trichome EST library, cloned, and characterized in yeast and in planta. Furthermore, a gene encoding an enzyme capable of catalyzing the C 6 hydroxylation of GAA was characterized. This hydroxylation results in spontaneous lactonization likely resulting in the putatively identified C 6 -C 7 -costunolide-derived STLs in pyrethrum. However, the enzyme may also catalyze the hydroxylation at the C 6 position of the lactonized precursor of all reported C 7 -C 8 -type STLs. In conclusion, the work compiled in this thesis presents new insights into the participation of pyrethrum trichomes in the biosynthesis and selective trafficking of pyrethrins precursors and STLs in opposite directions, and contributes to understanding the role of these flower-stored secondary metabolites in the immunization of the next generation against insect and fungal pathogens. Moreover, this study makes an important contribution towards understanding the biochemical and molecular bases of pyrethrins and STLs, the two most relevant bioactive compounds found in pyrethrum...|$|R

5000|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>I</b> involves the esterification of (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid with (S)-(Z)-pyrethrolone. One synthetic method {{for each of}} these is shown in the images below. Sobti and Dev of the Malti-Chem Research Centre in Nadesari, vadodara, India published this method for chrysanthemic acid in 1974. The starting material for the synthesis uses commercially available (+)-3α, 4α-epoxycarane (1).

Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), copper(I) iodide, triethylamine, and vinyl bromide are added to (7) to add two more carbons and form (8). The final step is the addition of an activated zinc compound to reduce the triple carbon bond to form the cis product, (S)-pyrethrolone (9).

50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>I</b> and II by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called resmethrin is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include tetramethrin, allethrin, phenothrin, barthrin, dimethrin, and bioresmethrin. Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, fenpropathrin, and bioethanomethrin.|$|E
50|$|Most of the world's {{supply of}} {{pyrethrin}} and C. cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya, which produces {{the most potent}} flowers. Other countries include Croatia (in Dalmatia) and Japan. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. Since the 2000s, Kenya has produced about 70% of the world's supply of pyrethrum. A substantial amount of the flowers is cultivated by small-scale farmers who depend on it {{as a source of}} income. It is a major source of export income for Kenya and source of over 3,500 additional jobs. About 23,000 tons were harvested in 1975.

The pyrethroids represented a major advancement in the chemistry that would synthesize the analog of the natural version found in pyrethrum. Its insecticidal activity has relatively low mammalian toxicity and an unusually fast biodegradation. Their development coincided with the identification of problems with DDT use. Their work consisted firstly of identifying the most active components of pyrethrum, extracted from East African chrysanthemum flowers and long known to have insecticidal properties. Pyrethrum rapidly knocks down flying insects but has negligible persistence — which is good for the environment but gives poor efficacy when applied in the field. Pyrethroids are essentially chemically stabilized forms of natural pyrethrum and belong to IRAC MoA group 3 (they interfere with sodium transport in insect nerve cells).|$|E

40|$|Dalmatian {{pyrethrum}} (Tanacetum cinerariifolium /Trevir. / Sch. Bip.) is {{a perennial}} herbaceous plant {{belonging to the}} Asteraceae family. It is endemic to the East coast of the Adriatic Sea and its natural habitat extends from Italy to northern Albania and up in the mountainous regions of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Pyrethrum flowers yield an important insecticide, the pyrethrin. Pyrethrin is mainly concentrated in oil glands {{on the surface of}} the seed inside the tightly packed flower head, but they can also be found in the other plant parts, however in much lower concentrations. The pyrethrin exist as a combination of six insecticide active ingredients: <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>I,</b> cinerin I, jasmolin I, pyrethrin II, cinerin II and jasmolin II, with <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>I</b> and pyrethrin II present in higher concentrations. Pyrethrin is non-toxic to mammals and other worm-blooded animals, it is unstable in light, oxygen, water and at elevated temperatures and therefore highly biodegradable. Due to the fact it is environmentally safe it is leading insecticide in organic farming systems. The most scientific work concerning Dalmatian pyrethrum was focused on its morphological and biochemical traits that are relevant in breeding. Breeding programmes are primarily focused on increasing the yield of pyrethrin per unit area. Relative to dry flower weight, flower heads contain the majority of the pyrethrin.

In this work, a rapid and sensitive LC–(ESI) -MS/MS method has been developed for the individual quantification and confirmation of pyrethrin residues in fruit and vegetable samples by monitoring two specific transitions for each pyrethrin component under Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. Samples were extracted with acetone/water or acetone, depending on the sample type, and raw extracts were directly injected in the LC–MS/MS system.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) extraction (SFE) of targeted secondary metabolites from selected natural products. Phytochemical characterization and determination of biological efficacy was completed using advanced analytical methods and in-vivo bio-assays. More than 500 SFE extracts were generated and characterized. Sample preparation (particle size, moisture content) and extraction parameters (pressure, temperature and flow rate) were investigated {{and the ability of}} SFE to extract specific biosynthetic classes of compounds was evaluated. Where warranted, pilot scale studies were conducted for larger scale biological trials. SFE of the neotropical vine, Souroubea sympetala, a traditional medicine used for a culture bound syndrome related to anxiety, resulted in an extract rich in betulinic acid (5. 54 +/- 0. 24 mg/g) determined by HPLC-APCI/MS. When subjected to validated rodent anxiety behavioral assays (e. g. elevated plus maze (EPM)) the SFE extract demonstrated significant anxiolysis (anti-anxiety) compared to the vehicle control, with a 50 % increase in time spent in open arms and a 73 % increase in unprotected head dips observed. The significant in-vivo anxiolysis observed provides scientific support for the ethnobotanical use of this traditional medicine and a promising lead for a natural health product (NHP) to treat anxiety. Systematic variation of SFE parameters (pressure and temperature) on pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) oleoresin, a natural insecticide, resulted in a residue free pyrethrin concentrate, suitable for organic agricultural applications. The highest pyrethrin concentration (0. 531 g/g) and highest ratio of pyrethrins I (<b>pyrethrin</b> <b>I,</b> cinerin I, jasmolin I) to pyrethrins II (pyrethrin II, cinerin II, jasmolin I) (PI:PII = 1. 95) was obtained at 40 °C; 10 MPa while 40 °C; 30 MPa produced the lowest pyrethrin concentration (0. 436 g/g) and lowest ratio of PI:PII (1. 87). Total pyrethrin recovery was highest at 40 °C; 30 MPa (8. 39 g pyrethrins) vs. 40 °C; 10 MPa (6. 96 g pyrethrins). The insecticidal activity of the SFE extracts of the pyrethrum oleoresin was confirmed (> 70 % mortality at 48 h) using the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) a major pest of agriculture. SFE of piperamides from black pepper (Piper nigrum), a promising botanical insecticide and synergist, was successful at pressures above 30 MPa and temperatures greater than 50 ˙C with total yields greater than 7. 87 % (CV < 0. 10) and piperamide concentrations greater than 150 mg/g (CV < 6. 0). Flow rate, sample size, and particle size were optimized at 5 L/min, 10 g, and 1 mm mesh respectively. Insecticidal activity corroborated dose dependent piperamide bioactivity. Extract from 10 MPa; 60 °C (42. 38 mg/g) produced 10. 0 +/- 6. 8 (24 h) and 13. 3 +/- 6. 7 % (48 h) mortality. Extract from 35 MPa; 40 °C (148. 56 mg/g) produced 70. 0 +/- 10. 0 (24 h) and 73. 3 +/- 8. 4 % (48 h) mortality. Northern shrimp (Pandelus borealis) by-products extracted by SFE (35 MPa; 40 °C) generated a deep red oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (7. 8 +/- 0. 06 %) and docosahexaenoic acid DHA (8. 0 +/- 0. 07 %). Optimization of pressure (60 MPa), temperature (80 °C), moisture (13 %), particle size (0. 85 mm), and flow rate (9 L/min) resulted in a more efficient extraction without significantly changing concentrations of EPA and DHA.
