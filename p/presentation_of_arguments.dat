His logic and method of <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> were really very marvellous and worthy of remark.The Fiji Government, however, was so worried about his activities that it repeatedly inquired into his fitness to teach school children, removed him from control of one school (see below), temporarily suspended his teaching licence and censored his mail, especially his imports of Arya Samj literature.|$|E

Lloyd {{notes that}} there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to [...] "legitimate their own positions," [...] laying [...] "claim to a new kind of wisdom ... that purported to yield {{superior}} enlightenment, even superior practical effectiveness." [...] Medical writers in the Hippocratic tradition maintained that their discussions were based on necessary demonstrations, a theme developed by Aristotle in his Posterior Analytics. [...] One element of this polemic for science was an insistence on a clear and unequivocal <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments,</b> rejecting the imagery, analogy, and myth of the old wisdom. Some of their claimed naturalistic explanations of phenomena {{have been found to be}} quite fanciful, with little reliance on actual observations.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} by Lana (1963) demonstrates that the controversiality of the topic can have a moderating effect on order effects. College students {{and high school students}} read arguments for and against a controversial topic and a noncontroversial topic, and were then asked to fill out an opinion questionnaire about the topics. For college students, the controversial topic exhibited a primacy effect. College students did not exhibit any order effects for a noncontroversial topic. The college students were persuaded more by the argument they encountered first for a controversial issue, but were not influenced by the order of the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> for noncontroversial topics. However, for high school students, no order effects were exhibited for either the controversial or noncontroversial topics. Therefore, the controversy of a topic appears to affect the role order effects play for some age groups in persuasion.|$|E

The event {{was held at the}} Palace of the Parliament.The debate started with a <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> that Basescu and Geoana tried in turn to explain why Romanians should vote for his supreme position in the state. Candidate of PSD + PC Alliance said he came up with a project to develop the country and has demonstrated that he can unite the Romanian and keep “a constructive tone and a positive approach." [...] He discussed the three pillars that he sustains: redefining the way that Romania is working, agriculture and developing the working field. Geoana specified that his alliance with the liberals, initialed in Timisoara, is sincere and not based on political interests. He expressed hope that Traian Basescu will not use in the debate means and personal attacks, “like the way in which designed the campaign, which was based on lies and personal attacks on the family."In turn, Traian Basescu said that the presidency is a privilege and a [...] "huge obligation" [...] which marked him every day in the five-year term when he was president of Romania. His speech was focused on supporting the accelerated reform of the state in which the “voice of Romanians must be heard". The head of state proposed “a government of politicians for politicians”. Basescu spoke in his debut of the speech about the social democrats, whom he accused that they do not understand the country's priorities, and acquire political privileges. The candidate supported by the Liberal Democrats recalled the possibility of returning to power former communist government and Ion Iliescu. Traian Basescu promised that it would immediately pass Romanians outcome of the referendum of 22 November {{to reduce the number of}} MPs and creating a unicameral parliament, which he never did.The two candidates approaches were strewn often during the three hours of debate with attacks and mutual accusations that they have launched systematically. The President appreciated that the support structure of Mircea Geoana campaign was linked to television of Sorin Ovidiu Vantu, Dan Voiculescu and Dinu Patriciu's public interventions.The two presidential candidates swore with the hand on a Bible provided by Robert Turcescu, the moderator of the debate. While Geoana vowed not promised benefits Patriciu Vantu and Voiculescu, Basescu vowed that he “never punched a child in the plex or in the face".|$|E

The {{goal of the}} work {{described}} in this paper concerns the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> that bring a new perspective to some existing results of queuing networks. Comparison between numerical data obtained with models that use only buffer length as state variable with models that use also server state show that the models which only use buffer length do not correctly represent the systems under study. Also a new scheduling policy is presented. It is motivated by {{the belief that the}} marginal cost of waiting should not be a constant and by the belief that strict priorities are only interesting to customers having higher priority. With this new policy we propose to replace strict priorities, as is the case of the µc−rule. The variance of the cycle time for all classes achieved with the new policy will be presented, as is numerically computed. The tools used to get the results presented in this work, such as Dynamic Programming and Discrete Event Simulation, are also described...|$|E
40|$|I There is {{something}} completely archaic yet very modern about {{the tone and}} issues of the 1920 s debates in the Economic Journal on the representative firm and increasing returns, also {{often referred to as}} ‘the cost controversy’. Then, as now, applied economists, “realitics”, as Sir John Clapham called them, and theoretical economists (‘analytics’) were often a race apart who neither properly understood nor appreciated each other’s roles and approaches. Then, as now, views differed on whether or not theory had to be directly applicable in explanations of ‘real world ’ observations and much misunderstanding occurred because the separation between logically coherent ‘high theory ’ in its own domain and, a separate issue, its direct applicability, was not made by protagonists in an argument. Or, if it were, one side would be concerned with the former, the other with the latter, without either making this understanding explicit. For these confusions and misunderstandings, Marshall must take his full share of the blame. Though this distinction was clear in his own mind, in the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> in his Principles it is purposefully blurred because of his desire to be read b...|$|E
