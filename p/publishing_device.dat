In some series the renaming was more complicated. This change affected many series (e.g. 101, 116, 118, 122, 133, 140, 153, 155, 174, 237, 501).|$|R

40|$|Recently {{an elastic}} {{inverted}} pendulum structure was proposed {{as a means}} to make nonlinear energy harvesters. An effective dynamical model of this bi-stable system has an effective lumped mass that is dependent on the displacement, hence preventing direct application of previous analyses for nonlinear harvesters driven by random vibrations. We have set up a stationary Fokker-Planck equation for the inverted pendulum and solved it to obtain explicit expressions for the stationary probability densities of the system. We found that the marginal distribution of velocity is non-Gaussian, but numerically it differs little from a Gaussian when parameters for a recently <b>published</b> <b>device</b> are used. The conditional probability of position given velocity, has two peaks for low velocities. These merge into one upon increase of velocity...|$|R

40|$|As {{the amount}} and variety of {{personal}} wireless devices increases, people may be carrying with them a myriad of different mobile devices forming a Personal Mobile Software Environment (PMSE). Services offered to these devices need to adapt to device capabilities as well as changes in the PMSE {{to provide the best}} possible end user experience. A way of communicating device capabilities is creating and distributing textual device profile documents that contain capability information as attribute-value pairs. This thesis answers the question: how to manage device capability profiles in a multi-device end user environment? The research is conducted using the constructive method, producing a design for profile management and negotiation components in client and server tiers for a middleware service providing and adapting software platform, describing a prototype implementation and evaluating the design against previously <b>published</b> <b>device</b> profiling designs.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{characterization}} of a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) fabricated with a standard 0. 13 µm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process. We have developed a figure of merit for SPADs when these detectors are employed in high frame-rate fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy, which allows us to specify an optimal bias point for the diode and compare our diode with other <b>published</b> <b>devices.</b> At its optimum bias point at room temperature, our SPAD achieves a photon detection probability of 29 % while exhibiting a dark count rate of only 230 Hz and an impulse response of 198 ps. 1 Fluorescent dyes have become essential markers for observing and quantifying biological processes. Traditionally, fluorescence microscopy has been performed using spectrallydiscriminated intensity measurements. Recently, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), which measures the rate of decay of fluorophore emission after a pulsed excitation, has become a new imaging modality 1, exploiting the sensitivity of a dye’s lifetime to chemical and physical environment, including the proximity of secondary dyes through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 2. The most common sensors in FLIM are the photomultiplier tube (PMT) or discrete single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). These devices are used in a time-correlate...|$|R
