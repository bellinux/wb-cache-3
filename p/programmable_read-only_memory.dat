40|$|A novel {{concept of}} soft {{secondary}} electron programming (SSEP) is introduced and {{shown to be}} a promising programming scheme for scaled NOR flash electrically erasable <b>programmable</b> <b>read-only</b> <b>memories.</b> Although the mechanism {{is similar to that of}} the channel-initiated secondary electron (CHISEL) programming, SSEP uses an "optimum" substrate bias that results in a lower drain disturb compared with both channel hot electron (CHE) and conventional CHISEL programming schemes. The concept behind minimizing drain disturb is discussed. SSEP is shown to give faster programming and lower disturb than CHE at all operating conditions, as well as better program/disturb margin compared with conventional CHISEL programming at similar program speed or disturb time. The effect of repeated program/erase cycling using SSEP is compared against CHE and CHISEL cycling. IEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{mechanism}} of drain disturb is studied in silicon– oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon Flash electrically erasable program-mable <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> cells. It is shown that disturb {{is a serious}} problem in programmed cells and is caused by injection of hot holes from substrate into the oxide/nitride/oxide stack. The origin of these holes is identified by analyzing the influence of halo doping, channel doping, and channel length scaling on drain disturb. Band-to-band tunneling at the drain junction is nor-mally the dominant source of these holes. It is also shown that holes generated out of impact ionization of channel electrons become dominant in cells with high channel leakage (especially at lower channel lengths). Finally, the effect of repeated program/ erase cycling on drain disturb is studied. Drain disturb be-comes less severe with cycling, the reasons for which are deter-mined using gate-induced drain leakage measurements and device simulations.

40|$|We {{optimized}} thin reoxidized nitrided SiO 2 (ROXNOX) films {{produced by}} RTP {{on the basis}} of a careful analysis of the requirements of EEPROMs. The influence of oxidation, nitridation, and reoxidation parameters on charge-trapping and breakdown during a constant current stress was studied in detail. We show that avery light nitridation gives a maximum nitrogen concentration at the Si/SiO 2 interface and the largest increase in the endurance of the films under a high-field stress. The physical basis of these results is discussed. The improvement was confirmed on complete I kbit memory arrays produced with a 3 ~tm CMOS process with self-aligned contacts. Their lifetime was increased by at]east an order of magnitude, up to more than 10 ~ Highly reliable thin dielectric films are needed for ad-vanced integrated circuits, in particular, for electrically erasable and <b>programmable</b> <b>read-only</b> <b>memories</b> (EEPROMs).
