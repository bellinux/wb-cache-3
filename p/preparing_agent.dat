40|$|Four {{theories}} of the human conceptual system—semantic memory, exemplar models, feed‐forward connectionist nets, and situated simulation theory—are characterised and contrasted on five dimensions: (1) architecture (modular vs. non‐modular), (2) representation (amodal vs. modal), (3) abstraction (decontextualised vs. situated), (4) stability (stable vs. dynamical), and (5) organisation (taxonomic vs. action–environment interface). Empirical evidence is then reviewed for the situated simulation theory, and the following conclusions are reached. Because the conceptual system shares mechanisms with perception and action, it is non-modular. As a result, conceptual representations are multi-modal simulations distributed across modality‐specific systems. A given simulation for a concept is situated, <b>preparing</b> an <b>agent</b> for situated action with a particular instance, in a particular setting. Because a concept delivers diverse simulations that <b>prepare</b> <b>agents</b> for action in many different situations, it is dynamical. Because the conceptual system’s primary purpose is to support situated action, it becomes organised around the action–environment interface...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Background/Aims: Scintigraphy with 99 mTechnetium HMPAO {{labelled}} {{white blood}} cells (99 mTc HMPAO-WBC) is routinely used {{for the assessment of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The main disadvantages of this diagnostic test are the time consuming in vitro cell labelling and the handling of blood itself. To overcome these problems, new, equally effective agents are under development. To assess the value of a new, easily <b>prepared</b> <b>agent,</b> the 99 mTc- Leucoscan, in IBD, we performed a pilot scintigraphic study in patients with active Crohn&# 146;s disease (CD). In the event of negative results, it was envisaged, that another agent 99 mTc (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) would be tested. Patients - Method: We performed 99 mTc-Leucoscan scintigraphy in 7 patients with clinically active CD and in 3 of them an additional scintigraphy with 99 mTc (V) DMSA. Two of the 7 patients were males and 5 females; aged 26 - 70 years (mean age 42 years). Two of them had extra-intestinal manifestations with joint involvement. Results: In one of these patients 99 mTc-Leucoscan scintigraphy was considered as indeterminate because of relatively increased uptake in the bowel and in the other 6 it was false negative. In the 2 patients with joint involvement 99 mTc-Leucoscan images did show increased uptake in the involved bone areas. Three of all patients subsequently underwent 99 mTc (V) DMSA scintigraphy and all 3 were considered true positive. Conclusion: Our study concludes that 99 mTc-Leucoscan scintigraphy has no place in the assessment of gastrointestinal inflammation in CD. 99 mTc (V) DMSA could be suggested as a reliable tracer that could substitute for 99 mTc-HMPAO WBC scintigraphy in IBD patients.

40|$|Artículos en revistasDADICC is the {{abbreviated}} name for an intelligent system {{able to detect}} on-line and diagnose anomalies {{as soon as possible}} in the dynamic evolution of the behaviour of a power plant based on a combined cycle gas turbine. In order to reach this objective, a modelling process is required for the characterization of the normal performance when any symptom of a possible fault is present. This will be the reference for early detection of possible anomalies. If a deviation in respect to the normal behaviour predicted is observed, an analysis of its causes is performed in order to diagnose the potential problem, and, if possible, its prevention. A multi-agent system supports the different roles required in DADICC. The detection of anomalies is based on agents that use models elaborated using mainly neural networks techniques. The diagnosis of the anomalies is <b>prepared</b> by <b>agents</b> based on an expert-system structure.

40|$|Acyl {{carrier protein}} (ACP) {{contains}} an essential sulfhydryl group in its phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. We {{have investigated the}} state of this sulfhydryl in developing and mature spinach seed (Spinacia oleracea). Seed extracts were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate or native polyacrylamide gels, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies raised against spinach ACP-I. In extracts of mature seeds <b>prepared</b> with reducing <b>agents,</b> ACP-II migrated as a single major band, whereas extracts <b>prepared</b> without reducing <b>agents</b> gave two major bands. The additional band {{was identified as a}} conjugate of ACP-II to glutathione (ACP-S-S-G) {{on the basis of its}} sensitivity to reducing agents and its comigration with standards in both native and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. In developing spinach seeds ACP-II exists primarily in its free sulfhydryl form or as acyl derivatives, with essentially no ACP-S-S-G present. During later stages of seed development, as seed water content declines, ACP-S-S-G accumulates to approximately 50 % of the total ACP. Seed imbibition results in a rapid decline in ACP-S-S-G levels. The ACP-S-S-G:ACP-SH ratio of seeds during storage was found to be a function of seed water content and this could be manipulated by controlling the relative humidity under which the seeds were stored. We speculate that conjugation of ACP to glutathione protects the ACP from sulfhydryl oxidative damage in dry seeds...|$|R
