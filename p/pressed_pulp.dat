40|$|Mechanical {{dewatering}} of cut alfalfa {{could replace}} the traditional method of field drying and {{would also be}} cheaper than total thermal dehydration in dryers. Juice from alfalfa also contains several compounds that would meet the growing demands of a low-calorie-fed population and also, provide compounds that could find a cure {{to some of the}} fatal communicable diseases. The major objective of this research is to find the pressure levels required to remove some of the initial moisture from shredded alfalfa {{and the quality of the}} <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> and juice if alfalfa is mechanically dewatered in a pressure cell. The results from dewatering using the pressure cell are used to simulate the working of a continuous screw press for process optimization purposes. Experiments on dewatering of alfalfa were done on a screw press which is originally designed for extracting oil from oilseeds. The screw press was modified to simulate the field conditions of a continuous dewatering process for cut alfalfa. Measurements were done for dewatering power consumption and the <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> was pelleted on a pilot scale pelleting mill. The quality of <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> and expressed juice was analyzed at different screw speeds and choke openings. Using the available data from the above experiments, a quasimechanistic model was developed for the continuous dewatering process in a single-screw press. The model is based on a semi-empirical relationship given by Koegel et al. (1972) for dewatering of alfalfa in a batch-type hydraulic press. The model was tested against the experimental data and a sensitivity analysis was done by changing the variables. The agreement for predicted power and pressure is very poor. The results show that once the initial moisture is removed from fresh alfalfa at a low pressure of 2 - 4 MPa, further moisture removal from the dewatered <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> becomes difficult even at considerably higher pressures. The efficiency of juice extraction can be enhanced by delaying the onset of the 'steady equilibrium moisture content state'. Comparison of energies using three different methods of pelleting shows that field drying can save energy by 13 % over combination of mechanical dewatering and thermal drying. Combination of mechanical dewatering and thermal drying can save energy by 45 % over total thermal dehydration. However considering the numerous value-added products obtained from the alfalfa juice and the fact that mechanical dewatering is a weather independent system, it seems to be a promising technology for the future...|$|E
40|$|Relatively cheap, poor quality, {{unprepared}} biomass {{materials can}} be difficult to burn efficiently on a large commercial scale because of their variable composition, relatively low calorific values and high moisture contents. Consequently it is often necessary to co-fire these materials with a hydrocarbon support fuel to ensure stable and efficient combustion. Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) is a promising method for burning mixtures of fuels with widely differing individual characteristics although {{there is a need for}} further information on the “optimum” conditions for efficient operation as well as on the proportions of support fuel which should be used in particular applications. This paper is therefore concerned with co-firing of coal with pressed sugar beet pulp, (a solid biomass with an average moisture content of 71 %), in a lab scale (< 25 kW net thermal input) fluidised bed combustor. The project was undertaken in collaboration with British Sugar plc. who operate a large coal-fired fluidised bed, with a nominal thermal rating of 40 MW, to generate hot combustion gases for use in subsequent drying applications. The combustion characteristics of different coal and <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> mixtures were investigated over a wide range of operating conditions. For stable combustion the maximum proportion of pulp by mass in the blended fuel was limited to 50 %. However under these co-firing conditions a fixed bed temperature can be achieved with 20 % lower fluidising air (when compared with coal alone) since evaporation of the moisture in the <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> provides additional cooling of the bed. This reduction in excess air will be beneficial for the output of the full scale plant at British Sugar since at present the flow rate of the fluidising air and hence the amount of coal which can be burnt is limited by high pressure drops in the bed air distributor system. The <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> has relatively low nitrogen levels and hence a further benefit of co-firing is that NOx emissions are reduced by about 25 %. Agglomeration of the bed can be a problem when co-firing biomass because of the formation of “sticky” low melting point alkali metal silicate eutectics which result in subsequent adhesion of the ash and sand particles. Consequently, longer term co-firing tests were undertaken with a 50 / 50 blended fuel by mass. Problems of bed agglomeration were not observed over the duration of these tests and moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies indicated that the levels of alkali metals in the ash were relatively low.

40|$|For {{dairy farmers}} {{involved}} in winter milk production a high intake of forage {{is required by}} autumn calved dairy cows to produce a high milk yield with a moderate level of concentrate supplementation. Since intake of grass silage is often limiting, alternative forages or feeds {{may be needed to}} maximise forage intake. In areas not suitable for growing maize alternative forages need to be considered. These could include limited amounts of very high quality grass silage (DMD 750 - 800 g /kg), grazed autumn pasture or bulky by-product feeds, e. g. superpressed sugar beet pulp. An experiment was conducted involving 5 treatments in which a standard good quality grass silage (S) was partially replaced with either very high quality grass silage, which was either unwilted (U) or wilted (W), ensiled pressed sugar beet pulp (P) or with autumn pasture (G). These additional feeds were fed at a level of 5 kg DM/day to autumn calved cows in early lactation over a period of 8 weeks from late October to late December. The <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> diet (P) included 0. 5 kg DM soyabean meal to increase its protein level. The autumn grass was cut daily and fed indoors. The additional feeds were fed on top of the standard silage in individual feeding boxes and the standard silage was fed ad libitum to cows on all treatments. The cows were fed concentrates at 6 kg/day in two feeds on all treatments. The digestibility of the standard grass silage (754 g DMD/kg) was higher than planned and was only slightly less than that of the high quality supplementary silages (783 g DMD/kg). Feeding the U and W silages did not increase total forage intake but did increase milk yield by 1. 7 - 1. 9 kg/day compared with silage S alone. Milk fat and protein concentration tended to be reduced on the diets containing U and W silages, consequently yield of fat and protein were not significantly increased compared with silage S. Forage intake was increased by 8 % (0. 8 kg DM/day) when silage S was supplemented with autumn grass and milk yield was increased by 1. 5 kg/day without affecting milk composition. Intake of silage was reduced by 37 % by feeding grass. Feeding the <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> supplement (P) increased intake of forage (+ 1. 1 kg DM/day), increased milk yield by 2. 7 kg/day and also improved milk protein concentration and yield (+ 121 g/day). Cows gained in liveweight to a similar extent on all diets. It was concluded that feeding <b>pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> with a good quality grass silage had the greatest effect on forage intake and milk production whereas feeding high quality grass silages or autumn grass had a smaller effect. Larger increases in intake and milk production would be expected from these feeds if the standard grass silage was of lower digestibility (~ 700 g DMD/kg), similar to average quality first cut silage.

40|$|Enzymatic {{saccharification}} of spent sugarbeet pulp was {{studied as}} a process for producing. Fermentable sugars were obtained by sequential hydrothermolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis of spent sugar beet pulp. In the hydrothermolysis stage 44 % saccharification was obtained in just 1 h. Hemicellulose and pectins were solubilized to during hydrothermolysis. In the enzyme hydrolysis stage, the hydrolysate achieved almost complete saccharification (88 %) in just 6 h by {{using a combination of}} pectinase (9. 5 IU) and hemicellulase (0. 3 IU). That is the total time to achieve complete saccharification was 7 h. It was found that there exists a strong synergism between pectinase and hemicellulase enzymes to achieve complete saccharification and pectinase was an important enzyme. The use of anaerobic digestion (or mixed culture anaerobic fermentation) process was investigated as a means of producing enzymes for saccharification of hydrolysate. The performance of sugar beet pulp digestion at mesophilic (37 oC) and thermophilic (55 oC) temperature regimes was compared in single stage, unmixed, batch, laboratory scale anaerobic digesters. <b>Pressed</b> <b>pulp</b> as received from the factory was fed to the digesters without any pretreatment or size reduction. Three experiments were carried out at each temperature using inoculum obtained from thermophilic and mesophilic anaerobic digesters fed sugarbeet tailings. At both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures SBP degraded very well to yield more than 0. 3 m 3 of methane at STP per kg volatile solids. However, the performance of the thermophilic anaerobic digester was better than the mesophilic in most aspects that were considered like ultimate methane potential, rate of degradation, duration of digestion and maximum specific volumetric methane productivity. Hence, thermophilic anaerobic digestion was used as a source of enzymes for saccharification of sugar beet pulp. Extracellular enzymes are indeed secreted during thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sugar beet pulp in leach bed digester, particularly, pectin and hemicellulose hydrolyzing enzymes. The maximum activity of both hemicelluloytic and pectinolytic enzymes were found in cell-free (leachate) portion of the digester, followed by biofilm- associated and cell-bound activities. The hemicelluloytic activity of the extract was 0. 128 IU whereas the pectinolytic activity in extract was 0. 07 IU. The activities in thermophilic digester were approximately 10 times higher than mesophilic digesters. 58 % saccharification was obtained in just 24 hrs by using enzyme extracts from anaerobic digester after hydrothermolysis pretreatment. The use of mixed culture microbial extracellular enzymes from the anaerobic digester for saccharification of sugar beet pulp is a novel concept and offers a few advantages over fungal and commercial enzymes such as 1) On-site production of highly active microbial enzymes is possible and this approach can possibly improve the economics of pretreatment, as the costs of enzymes are independent of market fluctuations 2) The anaerobic extracts possess both hemicelluloytic and pectinolytic activities besides other activities important for degradation of pentoses in sugar beet pulp, possibly reducing the costs of using commercial enzymes 3) The method for enzyme extraction developed here can be scaled up to a continuous or a semi-continuous operation...|$|E
