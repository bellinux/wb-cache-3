After some delays, the first Links went online in January 2016. The <b>public</b> <b>network</b> was announced in February 2016. Locations like St. George, Jamaica, South Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue were prioritized for LinkNYC kiosk installations, with these places receiving Links by the end of 2016. By mid-July 2016, the planned roll-out of 500 hubs throughout New York City was to occur, though the actual installation proceeded at a slower rate. , there were 400 hubs in three boroughs (most of which were in Manhattan along lower Second Avenue, Third Avenue, Eighth Avenue, upper Amsterdam Avenue, Lafayette Street, parts of Broadway, and the Bowery; at least 25 along Grand Concourse and in Fordham in the Bronx; and some along Queens Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in Queens). In November 2016, the first two Links were installed in Brooklyn, along Fulton Street in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, with plans to install nine more Links in various places around Brooklyn before year's end, especially around Prospect Park and LIU Brooklyn. Around this time, Staten Island also received its first Links, which were installed in New Dorp. The Links were being installed at an average pace of ten per day throughout the boroughs with a projected goal of 500 hubs by the end of 2016. , there were 920 Links installed across the city.|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the {{objectivity}} of urban <b>public</b> transport <b>network</b> evaluation and achieve the sub-file of quality level of preliminary scheme, a comprehensive evaluation method for urban <b>public</b> transport <b>network</b> was proposed based on TOPSIS, and then constructed the evaluation model of urban <b>public</b> transport <b>network.</b> This method was applied to Xi’an urban <b>public</b> transport <b>network</b> planning, which obeyed the basic theory of scheme evaluation and some related requirements. The result showed that planning- 5 was the best one among the five urban <b>public</b> transport <b>network</b> planning in Xi’an and consistent with the passenger flow prediction. The evaluation model for urban <b>public</b> transport <b>network</b> based on TOPSIS was objective, which involved few parameters, simple operation, scientific evaluation and provided a basis for urban <b>public</b> transport <b>network</b> planning decision...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is a {{well-known}} fact that the Internet traffic travels through <b>public</b> <b>networks.</b> These networks lack security and are vulnerable. Encryption and public key cryptography are important technologies {{that are used to}} preserve data security and integrity, and to reduce information theft on the <b>public</b> <b>networks.</b> However, the existing routing protocols are incapable of providing secure data transmission on <b>public</b> <b>networks.</b> To this end, our laboratory introduced the Service-oriented Router (SoR) to maintain rich information for the next-generation networks by shifting the current Internet infrastructure to an information-based and an open-innovation platform. An SoR can analyze all packet stream transactions on its interfaces and store them in high throughput databases. Using the features of the SoR, in this paper, we propose a hop-by-hop routing protocol that provides per-hop data encryption. This infrastructure is proposing to preserve both the security and the privacy of data that traverses through <b>public</b> <b>networks.</b> We implemented a prototype of per-hop data encryption protocol on the ns- 3 simulator and the results obtained are discussed in this paper...|$|R

City Saskatchewan and CTV Two Alberta were formerly provincial public broadcasters (SCN and Access), but both have since been privatized and amalgamated into commercial networks operated by their current owners (Rogers and Bell). While both outlets devote a portion of their schedules to their networks' respective, advertising-supported entertainment programming, both networks are still required to adhere to an educational remit in the majority of their programming. Unlike in the United States, where a statewide <b>public</b> <b>network</b> is usually the state's primary PBS member station, the provincially owned public systems in Canada are independent of each other and have their own programming..|$|E

This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local switching system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E

25|$|The {{public water}} supply system in Greater Beirut {{receives}} its water from the Jeita springs (50 million m3/year) as well as well fields in the Damour region (30 million m3/year). The Jeita spring {{is the source of}} drinking water for about 1.5 million Lebanese. Water is treated in the Dbaiye water treatment plant north of the city with a capacity of 430,000m3/day (157 million m3/year). Besides the <b>public</b> <b>network,</b> around 1,000 mostly private wells are scattered in the area of Beirut. Their depth varies between 50 and 300m and their average individual discharge is 35 liters/second. Total water supply from these wells could be higher than through the {{public water supply}}, depending on how many hours the pumps run. Overpumping from wells in the Beirut area has led to seawater intrusion into aquifers.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{a public}} {{hydraulic}} power network was suggested by Joseph Bramah in a patent obtained in 1812. William Armstrong began installing systems in England from the 1840s, using low-pressure water, but a breakthrough occurred in 1850 {{with the introduction of}} the hydraulic accumulator, which allowed much higher pressures to be used. The first <b>public</b> <b>network,</b> supplying many companies, was constructed in Kingston upon Hull, England. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company began operation in 1877, with Edward B. Ellington as its engineer. Ellington was involved in most of the British networks, and some further afield. Public networks were constructed in Britain at London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. There were similar networks in Antwerp, Melbourne, Sydney, Buenos Aires and Geneva. All of the public networks had ceased to operate by the mid-1970s, but Bristol Harbour still has an operational system, with an accumulator situated outside the main pumphouse, enabling its operation to be easily visualised.|$|E
25|$|The poor {{indicated}} they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was {{much lower than the}} prices they had to pay to private vendors. They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. Boiling of water is frequent. Water from the <b>public</b> <b>network,</b> including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality.|$|E
