At national level, an epidemiological alert system is operational in Italy since 2005, issuing forecasts for the major urban areas. At local level, during summer 2006 the Regional Weather Service (Servizio Meteorologico Regionale-SMR) of Lombardia issued a daily short range forecast of heat discomfort to local health districts. In this work we present the strategies adopted to assess the value and utility {{to the health care}} system of the issued forecasts, and some results obtained so far.

40|$|This thesis uses {{computational}} art {{practice to}} explore the question of indeterminacy and uncertainty in contemporary societies. It explores the issues navigating through different disciplines, starting from a preamble where the discoveries of quantum mechanics are confronted with the vision of modern and contemporary empiricists and re-articulated in post-structuralism and postmodernism. The approach from physics and determinism moves towards one of the classic questions of philosophy, that of free will. The state of indecision is described as the act of making a decision, an act extended in time – eventually to infinity. The reflection leads {{to the field of}} generative semiotics. Since the use of oracles to make decisions is also a peculiarity of humans, the distance that articulated language creates between reality and signs is proposed as a disruption that fosters the dichotomy of instinct and rationality. In this fracture nature assumes the form of the divine, whereas rationality is a procedural form. Technology, as an ultimate expression of this rational form, surpasses humans in <b>procedural</b> <b>decision</b> making capabilities, becoming a novel instrument to reach a divine union. Yet, early computing showed that, to halt a process resolving an undecidable problem, a machine has to receive an input of a different kind, an analog tape or an oracle as it were. The interaction with a different substance – the analogue sensor or a supernatural daemon – becomes the trigger to surpass a situation of impasse. The question of uncertainty is then transduced into an art work that responds as an intervention in that interdisciplinary space, materialising an aesthetic form that draws on elements of the absurd and the aliatory in art, all re-interpreted in a do-it-yourself hacker fashion, creating a peculiar noise drama that has the effect of a symbolic ritual, or, ultimately, its destructive illusions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this microethnography case study was to {{research}} how the Head Coach of a winning collegiate baseball program could instill a team culture of winning. ^ This study begins {{the understanding of the}} processes a Head Coach and his Assistants utilize in their day to day activities and during games as they developed and maintained their winning team culture. This was a six month in-depth investigation of one successful collegiate athletic program involving four months of active field work and another two months of interviews and follow-up. A unique feature of this study was the situated context of the Baseball program as a Tier 2 sport in respect to athletic program resources. Further, the State College where this program is located does not have an institution wide culture of winning and success in the athletic department. ^ The Head Coach and four Assistant Coaches, of which three were senior or graduate assistants, were the major research subjects. The 38 team members and the athletic trainer were also relevant to the impact of this study. Field observations during practice and games were the primary source of data. Exit interviews with the coaches were conducted in May and June following the wrap-up of the baseball season and were very important to the triangulation of the field observations. The interviews themselves were very insightful to the cognitive coaching processes and levels utilized by the coaches. ^ The results of this study generated seven major organizational cultural themes each with supporting subset behaviors, rituals, customs, symbols or language. The seven themes are: (1) relentless performance culture, (2) <b>procedural</b> <b>decision</b> strategies, (3) culture of discipline, (4) confidence, (5) singularity of purpose, (6) family, and (7) fun.

40|$|A {{traditional}} symbolic {{representation of}} the idea of ‘object’ (a chair) was offered up to an instrument of musical measure (a musical keyboard) in order to produce metric readings, which were then organised/interpreted so as to provide material for a musical realisation of the object. Thus a musical instrument (the keyboard) is used as a measuring instrument and, by process of inversion, the physical subject/object (the chair) becomes a representation of musical measures. An archetypal chair was chosen from the Ikea catalogue, and the accompanying instructions for its assembly used as a way of deciding upon a measuring procedure and sequence. In this way the instructions also function as a graphic score for the piece. There are five main structural components in a BERTIL chair. These were colour-coded in the score and then ‘played’ in sequence by pressing them into the keyboard, with the direction of motion required in order to achieve an adequate measure of their dimensions suggested by the score. It was decided that only the white notes (which permitted a more consistent and continuous form of contact) would be used. This harmonic restriction not only provides a pleasant tonal centre for the piece (C major/A minor), but middle C also acts as the literal tonal centre for the measurement procedure, with each component offered up to the keyboard symmetrically in relation to that central point. Pitch values are thus dependent upon how the components are constructed (e. g. the width of a chair leg was found to depress two adjoining keys), as well as how they are shown in relation to each other within the assembly instructions. This practical <b>procedural</b> <b>decision</b> exerts a basic contrapuntal compositional device (a sort of ‘contrary motion’) which in turn produces balanced motival form. A moderate tempo of 60 bpm was used so as to provide a suitable rate of movement for accurate readings. This tempo/rate was also chosen in order to provide a comfortable pace in which to ply the components into the keyboard (60 bpm@ 64 mm per second), whilst also allowing the components’ physical dimensions to be directly mirrored in standard rhythmic divisions, i. e. /e. g. at 60 bpm, a beat (a crotchet) lasts one second = 64 mm. A sixteenth note (a semiquaver) thus lasts ¼ of a second = 16 mm. A whole note (a semi-breve/ 4 crotchet beats) last 4 seconds = 256 mm, while at the other extreme of our conversion table a 256 th note lasts 1 / 64 th of a second = 1 mm. The ‘readings’ (pitch values and durations) were then entered into a MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) sequencing computer programme, where a separate musical part was created for each component part, with each assigned a different keyboard sound in order to facilitate identification, clarity and timbral variety. The more drawn out drones tend to be the chair’s legs or the side braces. The larger clusters, relatively short in duration, are when lateral pieces such as back braces depress an extended bank of keys (the seat produces a somewhat longer cluster about three quarters in). The sequence of four short stabs, which reappear at regular intervals, are produced by/representational of the tips of the four upturned chair legs. The piece lasts 2 ’ 25 ”...|$|E
40|$|Classical risk {{assessment}} paradigms no longer suffice {{to deal with}} complex, uncertain and ambiguous risks. Therefore, new approaches to prevent, control, communicate, {{and deal with the}} causes of these risks and with public anxieties about risks are necessary. In phase 1 we analyzed the available concepts to integrate risk and economical assessment with social aspects in one framework, and discussed the relevant criteria that need to be considered in order to develop a final {{risk assessment}} framework. Furthermore, still in phase 1, empirical work was performed in the form of case studies to analyze and define a framework, or to select criteria. We {{are in the process of}} reviewing, selecting, and testing tools and instruments that can be used in this appraisal framework, to go from concepts to practice. To grasp the full complexity of controversial, uncertain and immature risks, to cope with different values and views, and to develop a good communication we consider the appraisal framework as a <b>procedural</b> <b>decision</b> making process. It requires a more participative approach as the legal rational approach does not deliver adequate public management tools for handling these issues. We propose a sequential model, going through a series of steps, that can be used both in cases of strategic planning and management, and in the management of local projects usually related to siting conflicts. In each phase of the model integrated assessment tools and methods can be applied up to the point where consensus or a clear representation of different values and views (ideal in very uncertain and ambiguous problems), or an optimal balance between different criteria (in more simple cases) is achieved. All together our Appraisal Framework [is shaped] as a process, structuring and supporting the decision-making process. • To promote and organize a mutual learning of all actors entering into the policy cycle spiralling up through the different phases. • In the context of local siting conflicts, local contamination issues and urban planning topics (all with very close relationships with individuals), including regional, global E&H issues (food, climate, air, transport…) It’s a policy cycle, focused around a certain problem, organised to formulate and evaluate policy options, with stakeholders involved at different phases and steps of the process. Here the AF is structured as a learning network composed of all the players entering into the decision-making process at different stages. The quality of the decision making process can be appreciated either on the basis of its outcomes or on the process itself. Our framing falls under the latter. It also rests on the procedural equity feeling and its impact on the acceptability of the effects of the decision (Joss S. and Brownlea A., 1999). Such an approach opens the way to a greater legitimacy of decisions whose substantive effects or outcomes are essentially dubious – a fortiori in the context of the precaution. It encourages a reflection on the manner of combining the opening of the decision-making process through participative methods with others meta-tools such as strategic management, integrated and comparative approach of the risk, or the evaluative method. These meta-tools structure the participative step, giving it objectives, precise questions and ad hoc means. It contributes to the technical quality of the decision and to its social acceptability, particularly when it is the product of a decision-making process which the actors consider precautionary and adapted to the context of great scientific uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of buildings and their operation contribute to {{a large proportion of}} total energy end-use worldwide; indeed, buildings account for 40 % of the total energy consumption and for 36 % of CO 2 emissions in the European Union. The sector is expanding, which is bound to increase its energy consumption. In order to reduce the growing energy expenditure, the European Directive imposes the adoption of measures to improve the energy efficiency in buildings. The recast of the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings defined all new buildings will be nearly zero-energy buildings by the end of 2020. However, the transformation of the EU's building stock will not be completed until well after 2020 and this target can only constitute an intermediate step. Indeed, the recent Commission Roadmap for moving towards a competitive, low-carbon economy showed that emissions in the building sector could be reduced by around 90 % by 2050. While new buildings should be designed as intelligent low or zero-energy buildings, refurbishment of existing building stock has many challenges and opportunities because, in the building sector, most energy is consumed by existing buildings. Since the replacement rate of existing buildings by the new-build is only around 1 - 3 % per annum, a rapid enhancement of taking up retrofit measures on a large scale is essential for a timely reduction in global energy use and promotion of environmental sustainability. Consequently, defining minimum energy performance requirements for new and, in particular, for existing buildings represent a key element in European building codes. For this reason, EPBD recast has set out Member States must ensure that minimum energy performance requirements are set with a view to achieve cost-optimal levels for buildings, building units and buildings elements. A cost-optimal level is defined as the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle. It must be calculated in accordance with a comparative methodology framework that is based on the global cost method. To apply this methodology Member States are expected to define a series of Reference Buildings as baseline and representative models of the national building stock. Additionally, they must define energy efficiency measures to be applied to Reference Building; these ones can be a single measure or constitute a package of measures. Reference Buildings can be exploited as a basis for analysing national building stock and the potential impacts of energy efficiency measures in order to select effective strategies for upgrading existing buildings. Finally, once estimated the Reference Building energy consumptions and the impact of the different energy efficiency measures, the costs of the different packages are estimated in order to establish which of them has the lowest global cost and, consequently, represents the cost-optimal level. Global cost method considers the initial investment, the sum of the annual costs for every year and the final value, all with reference to the starting year of the calculation period. A measure or package of measures is cost-effective when the cost of implementation is lower than the value of the benefits that result, taken over the expected life of the measure. The cost-optimal result represents that retrofit action or combination of actions that minimized the global cost. From the variety of specific results, a cost curve can be derived; the lowest part of this curve represents the economic optimum for the specific set of the analyzed energy efficiency measures. This PhD study deals with complex scenario above described. Its main objective is to examine cost-optimal analysis in order to establish if this methodology can be an appropriate tool to guide and support decisions related with buildings energy performances. In detail, a critical review of the methodology has been developed and some sensitivity analyses have been exploited in order to testing the robustness of the cost-optimal analysis results. Considering the influence that similar outcomes could have on the European energy policies and on the roadmap towards 2050, it is fundamental to evaluate, even before the same outcomes, how these are reliable. Cost-optimality as a theoretical concept is well and clearly established. However, its application is far from easy and straightforward. Indeed, cost-optimal analysis is a complex methodology characterized by an inherent degree of uncertainty in the final outputs; choices of methodology, <b>procedural</b> <b>decision</b> and complexity of much of the input data significantly affect outcomes. In addition, the research highlights that often although a cost-optimal calculation is being developed and some energy efficiency retrofit measures are individualized, there are no effective instruments, in term of energy policies and financial tools, to drive the market to increase the rate of deep renovation...|$|E

40|$|Many {{aeronautical}} decision-making (ADM) mnemonic-based methods exist. However, {{there is}} no empirical research that suggests that they are actually effective in improving decision-making. Klein (1993), {{in his study of}} naturalistic decision making suggested that the decision-making process centers around two processes; situation assessment to generate a plausible course of action and mental simulation to evaluate that course of action for risk management. In this study a short, ADM training course was constructed around two mnemonic methods, SHOR (Stimuli, Hypotheses, Options, and Response) and DESIDE (Detect, Estimate, Set safety objectives, Identify, Do, Evaluate). Forty-one pilots from the Republic of China Tactical Training Wing participated: half received a short ADM training course and half did not. After training, the procedural knowledge underpinning their Situation Assessment and Risk Management ability, two skills essential for successful decision-making, were evaluated using pencil and paper-based knowledge tests based upon several demanding tactical flight situations. These scenarios were designed to encompass the six basic types of decision making described by Orasanu (1993); go/no go decisions; recognition-primed decisions; response selection decisions; resource management decisions; non-diagnostic <b>procedural</b> <b>decisions,</b> and decisions requiring creative problem-solving. The results show gains attributable to the decision making training course in both situation assessment and risk management skills.

40|$|This Article {{documents}} how, {{over the}} past six years and coinciding with the “Great Recession of 2008,” both public and private antidiscrimination enforcement mechanisms have become increasingly constrained, such that the ability to enforce the mandate of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - the main federal law prohibiting employment discrimination - may be facing a crisis point. While enforcement mechanisms for federal antidiscrimination law have long left room for improvement, recent developments in the economy, due to the 2008 recession, and in federal case law, due to a series of <b>procedural</b> <b>decisions</b> by the Roberts Court, compels a reconsideration of the existing enforcement scheme. The Article then theorizes a new model for combining public and private enforcement efforts and using administrative procedures under existing law more robustly to leverage the relative strengths of each part of the statutorily designed compromise. This proposed model offers both a strategic response to recent economic and legal developments that threaten effective antidiscrimination enforcement and an opportunity to more perfectly realize Congress 2 ̆ 7 s original enforcement vision...|$|R
40|$|Although {{much of the}} {{prevailing}} scholarship surrounding the 9 / 11 decisions tends to downgrade <b>procedural</b> <b>decisions</b> of law as weak and inadequate, procedural rulings have affected the law of national security in remarkable ways. The Supreme Court and lower courts have used procedural devices to require, {{as a condition of}} deference, that the coordinate branches respect transsubstantive procedural values like transparency and deliberation. This is “muscular procedure,” the judicial invocation of a procedural rule to ensure the integrity of coordinate branch decision-making processes. Through muscular procedure, courts have accelerated the resolution of large numbers of highly charged cases. Moreover, they have refined their institutional role by requiring the executive to reasonably interpret authorizing legislation, properly implement a congressional delegation, and sufficiently coordinate intra-branch deliberations, and by requiring Congress to oversee executive decision-making through clear legislation. These decisions are significant not only for their outcomes, but also for the way they have integrated procedural standards into sensitive areas of law defined by large amounts of deference to coordinate branch expertise. Muscular procedure thus has relevance not only within national security, but the plenary power context more generally, where the judiciary maintains a comparative institutional advantage in resolving procedural questions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The term {{procedure}} {{is often used}} synonymously with method. In this article I ask two questions: 1. Why is it justified to use both terms in the same way? 2. What are the consequences of understanding methods as procedures? I begin the paper by considering influential theories {{in the fields of}} law and politics (LUHMANN, HABERMAS) because concepts of procedures have been most thoroughly reflected upon in these fields. The focus is on legitimacy of legal and political norms and <b>procedural</b> <b>decisions.</b> Contrasting other kinds of procedures, e. g. economic and scientific ones, {{it should be possible to}} identify further dimensions beyond legitimacy, namely constitution and knowledge. This makes it possible to develop a general model that joins basic functions and structural characteristics of procedures. The "political " experimental procedure, developed by Bruno LATOUR, will be discussed as it exemplifies the general model. Specifying and expanding upon LATOUR's conception allows us to derive consequences for the procedurality of scientific work; for a procedural methodology, which is associated with terms such as relationality, positivity, reconstruction, and transdisciplinarity. Moreover, this may clear an interesting path toward negotiating the divide between quantitative versus qualitative research. Eventually a procedural based method offers critical potential because it enables consideration of th...|$|R
