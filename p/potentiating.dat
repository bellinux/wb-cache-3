5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus <b>potentiating</b> the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E

Due to the anticholinergic and antihistamine effects of dosulepin anticholinergic and antihistamine medications may have their effects <b>potentiated</b> by dosulepin and hence these combinations are advised against. Dosulepin may have its postural hypotensive effects <b>potentiated</b> by diuretics. Anticonvulsants may have their efficacy reduced by dosulepin due to its ability to reduce the seizure threshold.|$|R

25|$|Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatories, {{regardless}} of the inflammation's cause; their primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis. Lipocortin-1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis {{at the level of}} phospholipase A2 {{as well as at the}} level of cyclooxygenase/PGE isomerase (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, <b>potentiating</b> the anti-inflammatory effect.|$|E
25|$|Tissue factor also binds {{to factor}} VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production. Thrombin {{is a potent}} platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, <b>potentiating</b> the coagulation cascade. So in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially, with each inducing the other to form the final clot.|$|E
25|$|BPFs {{are members}} of a family of {{peptides}} whose <b>potentiating</b> action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF teprotide (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect in vivo. Teprotide had limited clinical value {{as a result of its}} peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. David Cushman, Miguel Ondetti and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.|$|E

The acute intravenous injection of reserpine in pithed rats <b>potentiated</b> pressor responses to tyramine, but depressed those to adrenaline and noradrenaline. During the intravenous infusion of noradrenaline in spinal cats and pithed rats the pressor responses to tyramine were increased, whilst those to adrenaline and noradrenaline were decreased. Infusion of isoprenaline in a spinal cat depressed responses to tyramine and noradrenaline, but <b>potentiated</b> those to adrenaline. A lower rate of infusion of isoprenaline in the same animal subsequently <b>potentiated</b> adrenaline and noradrenaline, but continued to depress tyramine. These results are held to be inconsistent with {{the view that the}} sympathomimetic effects of tyramine are produced entirely by the release of catechol amines...|$|R
40|$|The study {{objective}} was to compare qualitatively the clinical features of patients with electrical status epilepticus in sleep with focal versus generalized sleep <b>potentiated</b> epileptiform activity. We enrolled patients 2 to 20 years of age, studied between 2001 and 2009, and with sleep <b>potentiated</b> epileptiform activity defined as an increase of epileptiform activity of 50 % or more during non–rapid eye movement sleep compared with wakefulness. Eighty-five patients met the inclusion criteria, median age was 7. 3 years, and 54 (63. 5 %) were boys.

25|$|While {{there are}} a variety of {{hypotheses}} that have been proposed for the cause of Alzheimer's disease, the knowledge of this disease is far from complete to explain, making it difficult to develop methods for treatment. In the brain of Alzheimer's patients, both neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors and NMDA receptors are known to be down-regulated. Thus, four anticholinesterases have been developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment in the U.S.A. However, these are not ideal drugs, considering their side-effects and limited effectiveness. One promising drug, nefiracetam, is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's and other patients with dementia, and has unique actions in <b>potentiating</b> the activity of both nACh receptors and NMDA receptors.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide <b>potentiating</b> the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{secreted}} {{from the}} enterochromaffin cells eventually {{finds its way}} out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it can serve as a vasoconstrictor and/or a vasodilator while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by <b>potentiating</b> the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Additionally, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.|$|E

25|$|Barbiturates act as {{positive}} allosteric modulators, and at higher doses, as agonists of GABAA receptors. GABA {{is the principal}} inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Barbiturates bind to the GABAA receptor at multiple homologous transmembrane pockets located at subunit interfaces, which are binding sites distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. In addition to this GABAergic effect, barbiturates also block AMPA and kainate receptors, subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. Taken together, the findings that barbiturates potentiate inhibitory GABAA receptors and inhibit excitatory AMPA receptors can explain the superior CNS-depressant effects of these agents to alternative GABA <b>potentiating</b> agents such as benzodiazepines and quinazolinones. At higher concentration, they inhibit the Ca2+-dependent release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate via an effect on P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels.|$|E
25|$|Quandt {{and colleagues}} later {{published}} findings definitively identifying a mutation that did potentiate Cit+ evolution. This mutation {{was in the}} gltA gene, which encodes citrate synthase, an enzyme involved {{in the flow of}} carbon into the citric acid cycle. It had the effect of increasing citrate synthase activity, and they showed that it permitted improved growth on acetate. Moreover, with the gltA mutation, the rnk-citT module that causes the Cit+ trait has a neutral-to-slightly beneficial fitness effect, while, without it, the module was strongly detrimental. The gltA mutation therefore seems to have permitted early, weak Cit+ variants to persist in the population until later refining mutations could occur, consistent with their earlier conclusions. After a strong Cit++ phenotype evolved, the increased citrate synthase activity became detrimental. The researchers found that later mutations in gltA countered the first mutation, reducing citrate synthase activity, and further improving growth on citrate. They concluded that the series of mutation in gltA first potentiated, and then refined growth on citrate. They also suggested that the lineage in which Cit+ arose might have occupied a niche in Ara-3 based on growth on acetate, and that the <b>potentiating</b> mutations that led to evolution of Cit+ in Ara-3 were originally adaptive for acetate use.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, a {{research}} {{team led by}} Eric Quandt in the lab of Jeffrey Barrick at the University of Texas at Austin described {{the application of a}} new technique called Recursive Genomewide Recombination and Sequencing (REGRES) to identify <b>potentiating</b> mutations among the 70 present in the Ara-3 lineage that evolved Cit+. This method used multiple rounds of a process in which F plasmid based conjugation between a 33,000 generation Cit+ clone, CZB154, and the Cit− founding clone of the LTEE to purge mutations not required for either manifestation of a weak or strong form of the Cit+ trait, which they refer to as Cit++. They found that the rnk-citT module responsible for the phenotypic switch to Cit+ was sufficient to produce a weak Cit+ phenotype in the ancestor. They also identified a mutation that had occurred in the lineage leading to CZB154 after the initial evolution of Cit+ that conferred a strong, Cit++ phenotype in the ancestor absent any mutation but the rnk-citT module. This mutation, found in the regulatory region of a gene called dctA, caused a massive increase in the expression of the DctA transporter, which functions to import C4-dicarboxylates into the cell. This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Cit+ cells to re-uptake succinate, malate, and fumarate released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate. They identified a similar mutation in Cit++ clones in the Ara-3 population that increased DctA expression by restoring function to a gene that regulates it, dcuS, that had been deactivated in the ancestral clone. Quandt et al. concluded that the dctA mutation was not involved in potentiation, but refinement. This led them to suggest that evolution of Cit+ in the Ara-3 population might have been contingent upon a genetic background and population-specific ecology that permitted the early, weak Cit+ variants to persist in the population long enough for refining mutations to arise and render growth on citrate strong enough to provide a significant fitness benefit.|$|E

2500|$|Long-term potentiation, {{commonly}} referred to as LTP, is an increase in synaptic response following <b>potentiating</b> pulses of electrical stimuli that sustains at a level above the baseline response for hours or longer.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the standard acoustic startle habituation paradigm contains the elements of Pavlovian fear conditioning was tested.

Freezing behavior was measured toindex conditioned fear. The startle response was <b>potentiated</b> on CS trials, and rats froze more in CS than in non-CS periods.
