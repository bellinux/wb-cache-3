Just thought I'd throw that out," [...] he said to a Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reporter while on his campaign bus on Monday, the afternoon after his interview with the paper's editorial board. [...] "I want to talk to commanders on the ground. Because you run for president (<b>people</b> <b>say)</b> <b>you</b> need to have the answer. No, you don't! No, you don't! That's not good decision-making." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, {{just before}} Worcestershire's 2007 {{campaign}} got underway, Hick said that despite being contracted {{only for the}} season, {{he did not want}} to retire at the end of the summer. He said, [...] "I am not looking at it as my last season ... a lot of <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are a long time retired ... I am still one of the fitter members of the side and I love and enjoy what I do ... Why should I pack it in if I am contributing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Banville {{has said}} that he imitated James Joyce as a boy: [...] "After I'd read the Dubliners, and was struck at the way Joyce wrote about real life, I {{immediately}} started writing bad imitations of the Dubliners." [...] However, The Guardian reports: [...] "Banville himself has acknowledged that all Irish writers are followers of either Joyce or Beckett – and he places himself in the Beckett camp." [...] He has also acknowledged other influences. During a 2011 interview on The Charlie Rose Show, Rose asked, [...] "The guiding light has always been Henry James?" [...] and Banville replied, [...] "I think so, I mean <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> know, I've been influenced by Beckett or Nabokov but it's always been Henry James [...] so I would follow him, I would be a Jamesian." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's title, , {{a phrase}} {{typically}} {{used to describe}} a strong bond and chemistry between a group of people, was made as {{a reference to the}} band's own bond between each other, strengthened over the four years of recording the album. The album's liner notes include a thanks from Dougy Mandagi to [...] "the all encompassing spirit, the alpha and omega through which I live and create." [...] – a nod to both Mandagi and Jonathon Aherne's christian beliefs. Although Mandagi describes himself as [...] "not a super religious person", he felt a desire to express his beliefs in the liner notes, in response to what Mandagi claims is a [...] "cynical" [...] attitude towards [...] "anyone who has any belief." [...] He further explained that, [...] "for better or worse I learned a lot of things from religion. <b>People</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> don't need to attribute it to God, you don't need to learn what's right and wrong from the Church. Of course that's true, but it doesn't change the fact that's where I learnt right and wrong." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very much; it vexes me even. <b>People</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are miserly; {{and yet you}} are not, for {{you give}} liberally {{to the poor and}} to {{religious}} societies--though your gifts are conveyed so secretly and quietly that they are known to few except the receivers.

[...] But Jeanie shrunk back from him {{with a feeling of}} {{internal}} abhorrence. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it does not much signify; if you keep up the feeling of ill-will, at least you do not act upon it, and I thank you for your respect to my secret, when a word (which in your place I would have spoken at once) would have cost me my life. <b>People</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> should keep from the wife of your bosom the secret that concerns your neck--my wife and her sister both know mine, and I shall not sleep a wink the less sound." ...|$|E

60|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to}} hate the crime and love the criminal. No, that is the {{language}} of false morality; you ought {{to hate the}} crime and the criminal, if the crime is of magnitude. If the crime is a small one, then you ought to be angry with the crime and reluctant to punish the criminal; but when there are great crimes, then you may hate them together. What! am I to love Nero? {{to fall in love with}} Heliogabalus? is Domitian to be the subject of my affection? No, we hate the crime, and we hate the criminal ten times more; and if I use indignant language, if I use the language of scorn and horror with respect to the criminal, I use the language that becomes me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did {{you start}} up, {{as if you were}} afraid of me, when I came in?" [...] she said wildly. [...] "Why did you ask if you were in the way? Oh, Minna! Minna! can't you forget the day when I locked you out of my room? My child! I was beside myself--I was mad with my troubles. Do you think I would behave harshly to you? Oh, my own love! when I came to tell you of your marriage, why did you ask me if you were in the way? My God! am I never to know a moment's {{pleasure}} again without something to embitter it? <b>People</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> take after your father, Minna. Are you as cold-blooded as he was?

I bet Miss Dalstan has a box full of them. She probably chose yours because she knew that you were feeling pretty miserable, because she'd got sorry for you coming over on the steamer, because she has a great big heart, and is always {{trying to do something}} for others. She's made a man of you. Oh! I know a bit about plays. I know that with the royalties you're drawing you can well afford rooms like these and anything else you want. But that isn't all she's done. She's introduced you to her friends, she's taken more notice of you than any man around. She takes you out automobile driving, she lets you spend all your spare time in her rooms. She don't mind what <b>people</b> <b>say.</b> <b>You</b> dine with her and take her home after the play. You have more of her than any other person alive.

60|$|When we {{consider}} what, {{to use the}} words of the catechism, is the chief end of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day {{may turn out to be}} falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What old <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> cannot do, you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough once, perchance, to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new people put a little dry wood under a pot, and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost. One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned anything of absolute value by living. Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything to the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any experience which I think valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my Mentors said nothing about.|$|E
6000|$|He {{found he}} could talk to her of his work and aims upon the Fuel Commission and of the {{conflict}} and failure of motives he found in himself, as freely as he had done to Dr. Martineau and with a surer confidence of understanding. Perhaps his talks with the doctor had got his ideas into order and made them more readily expressible than they would have been otherwise. He argued against the belief that any class could be good as a class or bad as a class, and he instanced the conflict of motives he found in all the members of his Committee and most so in himself. He repeated the persuasion he had already confessed to Dr. Martineau that {{there was not a single}} member of the Fuel Commission but had a considerable drive towards doing the right thing about fuel, and not one who had a single-minded, unencumbered drive towards the right thing. [...] "That," [...] said Sir Richmond, [...] "is what makes life so interesting and, in spite of a thousand tragic disappointments, so hopeful. Every man is a bad man, every man is a feeble man and every man is a good man. My motives come and go. Yours do the same. We vary in response to the circumstances about us. Given a proper atmosphere, most men will be public-spirited, right-living, generous. Given perplexities and darkness, most of us can be cowardly and vile. <b>People</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> cannot change human nature and perhaps that is true, but you can change its responses endlessly. The other day I was in Bohemia, discussing Silesian coal with Benes, and I went to see the Festival of the Bohemian Sokols. Opposite to where I sat, far away across the arena, was a great bank of men of the Sokol organizations, an unbroken brown mass wrapped in their brown uniform cloaks. Suddenly the sun came out and at a word the whole body flung back their cloaks, showed their Garibaldi shirts and became one solid blaze of red. It was an amazing transformation until one understood what had happened. Yet nothing material had changed but the sunshine. And given a change in laws and prevailing ideas, and the very same people who are greedy traders, grasping owners and revolting workers to-day will all throw their cloaks aside and you will find them working together cheerfully, even generously, for a common end. They aren't traders and owners and workers and so forth by any inner necessity. Those are just the ugly parts they play in the present drama. Which is nearly at the end of its run." ...|$|E
