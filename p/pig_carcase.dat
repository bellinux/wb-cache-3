50|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, the claymore was put {{up against}} the iklwa. The claymore decapitated three meat heads in one swing, cutting straight through the joints of the meat necks and lopping the lower jaws off {{two of the three}} skulls. In a second test, it cleanly cut into a Zulu ishlangu shield and only stopped when it hit the load cell to which the shield was affixed. The claymore's strike was measured at 310 psi, with Geoff Desmoulin speculating that a Zulu warrior carrying the ishlangu would suffer at least one broken bone in his arm. For the iklwa test, a <b>pig</b> <b>carcase</b> was mounted on a zipline to simulate motion. The iklwa pierced a lung and severed the carcase's spinal cord. The weapon also penetrated a sample of unriveted chainmail and the ballistic-gel torso beneath, where it pierced the aorta and stopped an inch before the spinal cord. The claymore's range and performance proved to be the deciding factors, giving it the edge.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} {{mid-range}} weapon match-up, the twin hooks were put {{up against the}} stingray spear. The twin hooks cut cleanly through the ribs of a <b>pig</b> <b>carcase.</b> Putting both swords together doubled the weapon's range, a feature that was demonstrated while cutting through a gel torso's abdomen to the liver, leaving a deep, geometrically-aligned wound which effectively destroyed the abdomen's vital organs. The stingray spear was stabbed into a gel torso's abdomen. As this was judged to not be a kill shot, Sala Baker repeated the test with a new stingray spear, this time aiming for the region just below the ribcage. He succeeded in inflicting a kill shot, striking vital organs and possibly reaching the spinal cord. The stingray spear caused severe damage, {{but not as much}} as the twin hooks, and the twin hooks were given the edge for this and re-usability, as the stingray spear was deemed a [...] "one-shot" [...] weapon.|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a RNA virus of {{the genus}} Hepevirus. HEV {{genotype}} 3 is zoonotic and pigs are the main reservoir. This genotype has been identified in the United Kingdom, in sporadic locally-acquired cases without recent history of foreign travel to endemic countries. The number of HEV-confirmed human cases in the UK has increased significantly, from 124 cases in 2003 to 661 in 2013. Non-travel cases now account for the majority (69 %) of cases observed annually in the UK. Our aim {{was to assess the}} risk of HEV occurrence in pork carcases at slaughter in the UK. We performed a quantitative exposure assessment using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the number of carcasses contaminated with HEV produced in a high throughput porcine abattoir during one year. The input data used were: a) true prevalence in British pigs, b) probability of viral shedding in bile and faeces c) number of <b>pig</b> <b>carcases</b> with bile and/or faecal contamination detected during post-mortem inspection. The following assumptions were made when data were unavailable: a) sensitivity and specificity of the RP-PCR diagnostic test; b) meat from viraemic pigs was considered HEV-positive; c) visual faecal and bile contamination only considered since microscopic contamination would not be detected through visual inspection. We estimated through our model that 175, 152 (2. 4 %) of carcases produced in high throughput abattoirs would be infected with HEV in one year period. The number of viraemic pigs slaughtered at the abattoir was the largest driver of the uncertainty in carcass contamination. Variations in this parameter would change the output from 62, 982 carcasses up to 306, 320. Mitigation strategies at farm level should be explored, as it appears that control at this level would likely result in a higher reduction in HEV contamination in pork meat...|$|R
40|$|In New Zealand, Trichinella spiralis appears {{absent from}} {{commercial}} pigs, {{and is not}} a significant cause of zoonotic disease. Surveillance testing at slaughter has not ever detected T. spiralis in a commercially raised pig in New Zealand, yet many importing countries still require individual testing of all <b>pig</b> <b>carcases</b> for export. This thesis comprises four studies designed to evaluate the risk of T. spiralis infection in commercial pigs in New Zealand. In the first study, the prevalence of T. spiralis was surveyed in selected populations of rats, cats, stoats and weasels from landfills, piggeries and Department of Conservation lands as they are considered potential reservoirs of T. spiralis for domestic pigs. No positive samples were detected in this survey. The second study investigated rodent activity and baiting efficacy on three commercial piggeries in the Manawatu region of New Zealand over 72 weeks. This study found that while baiting and on-farm sanitation can effectively control rodents, the efficacy of the control depends largely on staff commitment. The third study used a mail questionnaire sent to 123 piggeries, to survey current management practices on commercial piggeries that could pose a risk for Trichinella transmission. The survey had a 69 % response rate and found that risky management practices occur infrequently in commercial piggeries. Lastly, a quantitative risk model was developed comparing individual carcass testing with alternative risk management strategies to assess the annual probability that a consumer in an importing country will eat a pork product of New Zealand origin containing at least one larva per gram of T. spiralis. Offals were found to always be safe. However, the unrestricted risk for fresh pork was over one in a million (1. 87 x 10 - 5), which was above the safety threshold and therefore various risk management options were considered. The strategy of only exporting pigs reared in certified, confined commercial herds has now been accepted and is in place by the importing country. This means that individual carcass testing is no longer compulsory for every exported pig carcass. The overall conclusion from this research established a very low risk of T. spiralis infection and transmission in New Zealand commercial piggeries. These findings have directly led to successfully changing export legislation by removing compulsory carcass testing pre-export, which has advanced New Zealand’s ability to competitively export high quality pork and pork products...|$|R

50|$|Ireland {{has a low}} {{density of}} pig {{production}} {{when compared to the}} larger pig producing regions across Europe.Irish pig producers finish their <b>pigs</b> at lower <b>carcase</b> weights compared to most countries across Europe. As a result, Irish producers do not castrate their male pigs. Castration is carried out across most of Europe as male pigs are generally brought to heavier carcase weights and, without castration, 'boar taint' may become an issue. Boar taint refers to the unpleasant odour and flavour characteristics noted in pork derived from males boars as they reach sexual maturity. Taint is only found in a small minority of boars and can be found in sows as it is actually caused by two different chemicals, one produced in the male testes and the other produced in the intestines. As the castration of pigs has also become an animal welfare issue across Europe, non-castration is considered a double advantage, as it benefits the welfare of the animal and entire boars produce leaner and better quality meat. Taint can be controlled through breeding away from the few lines that have it (genetics), feed management (higher fibre) and housing management (out on pasture instead of confinement).|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to provide empirical evidence to supplement advice available to the forensic community for the collection of muscle tissue for forensic analysis. This type of collection is normally carried out to determine the identity of individuals following mass disasters, such as plane crashes or natural disasters. DNA degradation was assessed in two model organisms, pig and rabbit (with human DNA as a control), over various time points. Rabbit recombination activating gene (RAG 1) was aligned to identify conserved regions in pig, rabbit and human. Primers were designed and optimised to create a 4 -plex PCR multiplex that can amplify 70 bp, 194 bp, 305 bp and 384 bp in three species. The 4 -plex multiplex was found to work efficiently in all three species down to 0. 3 ng of DNA template. The multiplex {{was used to assess}} whether DNA degradation can be predicted by accumulated degree-days (ADD), which provides a measure of both time and temperature. A series of field studies were performed to assess DNA persistence in pig and rabbit soft muscle tissues using a combination of whole animals, suspended muscle tissues (insect activity free) and muscle fragments. Field studies were carried out in: August-September 2009; February-May 2010; May-June 2010; June-July 2010 and September-November 2010. Soft muscle tissue samples were collected at different ADD. 4 -plex multiplex results showed that DNA was more persistent in pig tissues compared to rabbit tissues. In the September 2010 experiments, full multiplex amplification was obtained from rabbit until 137 ADD (whole carcases) and 210 ADD (body fragments and suspended tissues), while in the August 2009 experiments, full multiplex amplification was obtained until 112 ADD (whole carcases and body fragments) and until 141 ADD (suspended tissues). In the June 2010 experiments, full multiplex amplification was possible until 64 ADD. <b>Pig</b> whole <b>carcases</b> which were placed in the field in February 2010, showed multiplex amplification until day 90 (603 ADD), followed by September 2010 (until day 44 (490 ADD)) and May 2010 (until day 27 (338 ADD)). During the September 2010 project, body fragments produced full amplification until muscles were collected (342 ADD), while in case of whole carcases and suspended tissues; the amplification was possible until 490 ADD. There was complete failure of amplification of 305 bp and 384 bp in <b>pig</b> whole <b>carcases</b> after 342 ADD, while in suspended tissues, the amplification of 305 bp and 384 bp was possible until 420 ADD. The statistical analysis showed that amplification success of larger amplicons (194 bp, 305 bp and 384 bp) reduces with increase in ADD in pig and rabbit whole carcases, body fragments and suspended tissues while 70 bp was more persistence. The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in DNA persistence between whole carcases verses suspended tissues (Z= 0. 57, p> 0. 05) and whole carcases verses body fragments (Z= 1. 71, p> 0. 05), There was however a significant difference (Z= 2. 31, p< 0. 05) in DNA persistence in suspended tissues and body fragments with increase in ADD. The results from field experiments suggested that muscle tissues, if available, should be collected for DNA profiling, since even if degraded, a profile can be obtained. The results also suggested that the isolation of tissues from insect activity as quickly as possible (even if immediate storage is not possible) may be beneficial for DNA persistence. Seasonal variation in DNA persistence was observed due to maggot mass growth which increases carcase decomposition and ultimately effect on DNA persistence. Controlled incubation experiments were also performed at 27 °C, 37 °C and 47 °C until 21 days to assess DNA persistence, as these temperatures were not available under field conditions. The results showed that the amplification of 70 bp was more persistent compared to larger amplicons (194 bp, 305 bp and 384 bp). The drop-out in amplification of larger amplicons occurred more rapidly in samples incubated under laboratory conditions compared to the field samples. The statistical analysis showed species, ADD and temperature have strong effect (p< 0. 05) on DNA persistence under controlled conditions. The appearance of 70 bp amplicons in all samples collected from field and in most samples from controlled incubation experiments suggested that soft muscle tissues exposed to different environments can be used to perform SNP analysis. The full 4 -plex multiplex amplification obtained from rabbit and pig preserved and dehydrated samples suggested that 96...|$|R
