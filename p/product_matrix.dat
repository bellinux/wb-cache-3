40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the problem of}} allocating {{processors}} for <b>matrix</b> <b>products.</b> First, we consider how many processors should be allocated for computing one <b>matrix</b> <b>product</b> on a parallel system. Then, we discuss how to allocate processors {{for a number of}} independent <b>matrix</b> <b>products</b> on the parallel system. In many cases, it is shown that the performance of parallel algorithms does not improve beyond a certain point even though more processors are allocated for more parallelism. The results from experiments on the Fujitsu AP 1000 parallel system for a <b>matrix</b> <b>product</b> show that allocating more processors is not always beneficial for overall system performance. Also, when evaluating a number of independent <b>matrix</b> <b>products,</b> the concurrent execution of multiple <b>matrix</b> <b>products</b> by partitioning the system is better than the independent evaluation of <b>matrix</b> <b>products</b> sequentially by parallelizing each <b>matrix</b> <b>product.</b> Finally, we conclude that such kind of result can be applicable to many proces [...] ...|$|R

This problem is addressed by establishing a uniform strong law with rate for the eigenvalues of this matrix so as to relate them to the eigenvalues of the expected sum of squares and cross <b>products</b> <b>matrix.</b> Because the minimum eigenvalue of the latter matrix considered as a function of the number of parameters decreases faster than any polynomial, the rate at which parameters may increase is slower than any fractional power of the sample size...|$|R
