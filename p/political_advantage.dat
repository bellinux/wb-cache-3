On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas. On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.|$|E
5|$|From October 1988 to September 1994 {{the voices}} of representatives from Sinn Féin and several Irish republican and loyalist groups were banned by the British {{government}} from being broadcast on television and radio in the United Kingdom. The restrictions, announced by the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, on 19 October 1988, covered eleven organisations based in Northern Ireland and followed a heightened period {{of violence in the}} history of the Troubles, as well as the government's belief in a need to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media for <b>political</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1806. He became allied with fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay {{as a member of the}} War Hawks faction that favored war with Britain in 1812. At the outset of the War of 1812, Johnson was {{commissioned}} a colonel in the Kentucky Militia and commanded a regiment of mounted volunteers from 1812 to 1813. He and his brother James served under William Henry Harrison in Upper Canada. Johnson participated in the Battle of the Thames. Some reported that he personally killed the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, which he later used to his <b>political</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E

5|$|When Henry died in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, {{inherited}} the throne. Edward was a precocious {{child who had}} been brought up as a Protestant, but was initially of little account politically. Edward Seymour was made Lord Protector. He was commissioned as virtual regent with near sovereign powers. Now made Duke of Somerset, he proceeded at first hesitantly, partly because his powers were not unchallenged. When he acted {{it was because he}} saw the <b>political</b> <b>advantage</b> in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s {{with the}} {{emergence}} of the United States's first political parties. Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration. But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought <b>political</b> <b>advantage</b> over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author. Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it. But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.|$|E
5|$|Tyler was {{not only}} the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency, but at age 51, was the youngest president to that point. One of the main political principles he was guided by was states' rights, and he opposed a national bank, that the Whigs wanted to help develop the country, but which Tyler saw as an imposition on the sovereignty of the states. Tyler vetoed two bills to establish a national bank. Whig leaders, who wanted such a bank, saw <b>political</b> <b>advantage</b> in a breach with him. In September 1841, most of Tyler's cabinet resigned and Whig congressional leaders expelled him from the party.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Nisibis, Diocletian and Galerius returned to Syrian Antioch. At some time in 299, the emperors took part in a ceremony of sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices were unable to read the entrails of the sacrificed animals and blamed Christians in the Imperial household. The emperors ordered all members of the court to perform a sacrifice to purify the palace. The emperors sent letters to the military command, demanding the entire army perform the required sacrifices or face discharge. Diocletian was conservative in matters of religion, a man faithful to the traditional Roman pantheon and understanding of demands for religious purification, but Eusebius, Lactantius and Constantine state that it was Galerius, not Diocletian, who was the prime supporter of the purge, and its greatest beneficiary. Galerius, even more devoted and passionate than Diocletian, saw <b>political</b> <b>advantage</b> in the politics of persecution. He was willing to break with a government policy of inaction on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius, Lactantius, and Constantine each {{allege that}} Galerius was the prime {{impetus for the}} {{military}} purge, and its prime beneficiary. Diocletian, for all his religious conservatism, still had tendencies towards religious tolerance. Galerius, by contrast, was a devoted and passionate pagan. According to Christian sources, he was consistently the main advocate of such persecution. He was also eager to exploit this position to his own <b>political</b> <b>advantage.</b> As the lowest-ranking emperor, Galerius was always listed last in imperial documents. Until {{the end of the}} Persian war in 299, he had not even had a major palace. Lactantius states that Galerius hungered for a higher position in the imperial hierarchy. Galerius's mother, Romula, was bitterly anti-Christian, for she had been a pagan priestess in Dacia, and loathed the Christians for avoiding her festivals. Newly prestigious and influential after his victories in the Persian war, Galerius might have wished to compensate for a previous humiliation at Antioch, when Diocletian had forced him to walk {{at the front of the}} imperial caravan, rather than inside it. His resentment fed his discontent with official policies of tolerance; from 302 on, he probably urged Diocletian to enact a general law against the Christians. Since Diocletian was already surrounded by an anti-Christian clique of counsellors, these suggestions must have carried great force.|$|E
25|$|For {{nearly forty}} years the Church had two papal curias and {{two sets of}} cardinals, each electing a new pope for Rome or Avignon when death created a vacancy.

5000|$|To be {{established}} as the Primate of Germany would bring important <b>political</b> <b>advantages,</b> {{and increasing the}} prestige of his see through cultural means was probably {{an important element in}} Egbert's presumed role in establishing or encouraging artists and craftsmen to settle there.

25|$|Several groups {{fought over}} control of the {{sanctuary}} at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and <b>political</b> <b>advantage.</b> Pausanias later writes that in 668BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.|$|E
25|$|A {{suitable}} {{cover story}} {{was the need}} to deny use of the area to the enemy. The Kriegsmarine was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points and as shelters for commerce raiders, U-boats and supply ships. Also, in 1941, there existed a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the Falkland Islands, either as a base or to hand them over to Argentina, thus gaining <b>political</b> <b>advantage</b> for the Axis and denying their use to Britain.|$|E

50|$|A new {{economic}} interpretation {{arose in the}} 1950s and 1960s. This interpretation, informed by economic data on harvests, wages and general financial conditions. It suggested that in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, peasants saw newly achieved economic advantages slipping away, {{to the benefit of}} the landed nobility and military groups. The war was thus an effort to wrest these social, economic and <b>political</b> <b>advantages</b> back.|$|R
50|$|Achaea was conquered by the Romans in {{the year}} 146 BC. Emperor Augustus {{established}} Achaea as a senatorial province; generally speaking, the region benefited from the enlightened attitude of Roman emperors such as Augustus. This was because Achaea was geographically closer to Rome than other provinces, {{and so it was}} given <b>political</b> <b>advantages</b> and greater status in order for the Roman court to maintain a political equilibrium within the empire.|$|R
25|$|Despite a {{decreased}} {{budget to}} work with, Land {{was successful in}} consolidating offices {{to make them more}} efficient, yet all through attrition so that no workers were laid off, Land also carried out the successful consolidation of branch offices in a nonpartisan manner.

25|$|In March 1960, first-term U.S. Senator Richard L. Neuberger died in office. Despite {{calls to}} appoint his widow, Maurine Brown Neuberger, to the position, Governor Mark Hatfield instead {{appointed}} Oregon Supreme Court justice Hall S.

Hatfield stated {{that he intended to}} have appointed Neuberger, but that he wanted to appoint someone who would be focused on completing the remaining eight months of the term and not running in the regular-term Senate election as Neuberger had announced she would. Some observers noted that Hatfield, a Republican, though required by state law to appoint someone of the same political party as the late Senator Neuberger, did not want to give the other party the <b>political</b> <b>advantage</b> of incumbency.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Augustus {{was able to}} use the Tumult of Thorn (Toruń) to his <b>political</b> <b>advantage.</b> The tumult was a {{religious}} disturbance and confrontation involving Catholics and Protestants (Lutherans), followed by a verdict of the state court, which sentenced ten Protestants to death. The affair reflected general deterioration of religious tolerance in the Commonwealth, was widely condemned abroad and only the death of Peter I prevented a foreign military intervention prepared in response, with the participation of Frederick William I of Prussia. Augustus refused to intercede on behalf of the condemned and his standing among the unrepentant and unyielding szlachta improved. Subsequent efforts to normalize Poland's foreign relations came to an end when the Commonwealth became engulfed in factional fighting, of which the two recently formed great rival magnate camps, led respectively by the Czartoryski family and the Potocki family, were the main participants.|$|E

25|$|Isabella {{was brought}} up in and around the Château du Louvre and the Palais de la Cité in Paris. Isabella was cared for by Théophania de Saint-Pierre, her nurse, given a good {{education}} and taught to read, developing a love of books. As was customary for the period, all of Philip's children were married young for political benefit. Isabella was promised in marriage by her father to Edward, the infant son of King Edward I of England, with the intention to resolve the conflicts between France and England over the latter's continental possession of Gascony and claims to Anjou, Normandy and Aquitaine. Pope Boniface VIII had urged the marriage as early as 1298 but was delayed by wrangling over the terms of the marriage contract. Edward I attempted to break the engagement several times for <b>political</b> <b>advantage,</b> and only after he died in 1307 did the wedding proceed.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{economy is}} heavily {{dependent}} on the export of natural resources such as oil and natural gas, and Russia has used these resources to its <b>political</b> <b>advantage.</b> Meanwhile, the US and other Western countries have worked to lessen the dependency of Europe on Russia and its resources. Starting in the mid-2000s, Russia and Ukraine had several disputes in which Russia threatened {{to cut off the}} supply of gas. As a great deal of Russia's gas is exported to Europe through the pipelines crossing Ukraine, those disputes affected several other European countries. Under Putin, special efforts were made to gain control over the European energy sector. Russian influence {{played a major role in}} canceling the construction of the Nabucco pipeline, which would have supplied natural gas from Azerbaijan, in favor of South Stream (though South Stream itself was also later canceled). Russia has also sought to create a Eurasian Economic Union consisting of itself and other post-Soviet countries.|$|E
25|$|At {{an unknown}} date {{around the time}} of his accession, the young King Eadwig married Ælfgifu. The union was or was {{to become one of the}} most {{controversial}} royal marriages in 10th-century England. Eadwig's brother Edgar was the heir presumptive, but a legitimate son born out of this marriage would have seriously diminished Edgar’s chances of succeeding to the kingship, especially if both parents were of royal rank. Fostered by Ælfwynn wife of Æthelstan Half-King together with her son Æthelwine, Edgar enjoyed the support of Æthelstan Half-King (d. after 957) and his sons, whose power base was concentrated in Mercia and East Anglia and who would not have liked to lose power and influence to Ælfgifu's kinsmen and associates. If Hart's suggestion that Ælfgifu was of royal Mercian descent and related to the latter family is correct, it might have been hoped that the marriage would give Eadwig some <b>political</b> <b>advantage</b> in exercising West-Saxon control over Mercia.|$|E
