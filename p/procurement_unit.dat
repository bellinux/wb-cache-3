40|$|Procurement’s {{role has}} become more {{strategic}} due to increasing significance of suppliers and intensified competition. Procurement has also been recognized {{to have a positive}} effect on the profitability of a company. Category management is one outcome of this change. Category management divides the supply expenditure of a company into categories and manages them through category strategies formed in collaboration with business units which requires integration. In the former research literature, data utilization in procurement focuses mainly on suppliers, supply expenditure and purchasing performance. There is a lack of research on category management and data-driven integration between <b>procurement</b> and business <b>units.</b> This exploratory thesis focuses on three research questions. First, category management in the context of the case company is defined. The second research question focuses on the data-driven business integration in procurement. In addition, the effect of category management on this integration is studied. Finally, possibilities for improving data-driven business integration in procurement are studied. These three themes can be considered vital for the success of category management in the case company. This thesis is a mixed-method single case study using an abductive approach for analyzing the results. The thesis consists of two empirical parts: interviews and a statistical analysis. The literature review provides background for category management and data-driven business integration. It also supports formulation of the hypotheses for the statistical analysis. Interviews provide an overview on the category management of the case company. The statistical analysis attempts to integrate data from business <b>units</b> and <b>procurement</b> into an analysis to test whether data-driven integration can provide insightful information for managerial decision-making. The aim is also to increase synergy between <b>procurement</b> and business <b>units.</b> As a practical contribution, this thesis provides a framework of category management in the case company context. The findings give support for current research on the procurement’s changing role. The results also provide insight into the data-driven integration in the case company at the moment of the study and possibilities for improving it. In addition, the statistical analysis provides interesting results on the integration of data between <b>procurement</b> and business <b>units.</b> The study shows that data-driven integration between <b>procurement</b> and business <b>units</b> can provide relevant information for the strategic decision-making in both <b>procurement</b> and business <b>unit...</b>|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses tools available to minimize Department of Defense (DOD) cost overruns and our recent work on the Nunn-McCurdy process. For nearly 30 years, the statutory provision known as Nunn-McCurdy has been a tool for Congress to use to hold DOD accountable for cost growth on major defense programs. The purpose of the statute was to provide Congress greater visibility into major defense programs' cost growth and to encourage DOD to manage and control cost growth. A Nunn-McCurdy breach occurs when a program's unit cost exceeds certain thresholds. When that happens, DOD must notify Congress of the breach. There {{are two types of}} Nunn-McCurdy breaches: significant breaches and critical breaches. A breach of the significant cost growth threshold occurs when the program acquisition unit cost or the <b>procurement</b> <b>unit</b> cost increases by at least 15 percent over the current baseline estimate or at least 30 percent over the original baseline estimate. A breach of the critical cost growth threshold occurs when the program acquisition unit cost or the <b>procurement</b> <b>unit</b> cost increases by at least 25 percent over the current baseline estimate or at least 50 percent over the original baseline estimate. The Nunn-McCurdy process has been amended a number of times over the years. For example, in the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, Congress enacted a new provision requiring the Secretary of Defense to terminate a program that experiences a breach of the critical cost growth threshold, unless the Secretary of Defense submits a written certification to Congress. This statement focuses on (1) trends in Nunn-McCurdy breaches, (2) factors that may be responsible for these trends, (3) changes DOD is making or proposing to make to the Nunn-McCurdy process, and (4) other tools DOD can use to minimize cost overruns. This testimony includes information from our March 2011 report on Nunn-McCurdy breaches, which is being released today. The report contains information on the scope of our analysis and the methodology used. In addition, we drew on our published body of work on weapon system acquisitions and best practices to identify tools {{that can be used to}} minimize cost overruns. ...|$|E

On the contrary, if all the cost parameters are stationary, and assuming no unit holding cost, we show that the problem is polynomially solvable in time O(T^ 3), where T denotes the number of periods of the horizon.
