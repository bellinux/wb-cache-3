50|$|Kavečanský {{was born}} in Hrašovík, near Košice, modern day Slovakia. After {{completing}} his higher education in mechanics in Košice in 1943, he studied {{mechanical engineering at the}} Slovak Technical School in Bratislava, and at the Czech Higher Technical Faculty in Prague. He graduated in 1950. He then worked as a mechanical engineer, and in 1952 took a position as an assistant professor at the Faculty of Physics in Košice. From September 1, 1963 he worked as a <b>physical</b> <b>engineer</b> at the Natural Science Faculty UPJS. He finished his thesis work on magnetic processes on surfaces of Fe-Si samples in 1967. Kavečanský had {{a major role in the}} building of the experimental foundation of the Faculty of Physics in Košice. His personal research accomplishments include his study of magnetic media, namely Fe-Si materials, and mono and polycrystallized materials. He developed techniques to visualize the structure of electron domains using colloids and the Kerr effect. In conjunction with the Institutes of Metal Density in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, he also worked on applying the results of basic research of metal densities to technical uses. During his whole career in higher education, he was also involved with teaching. He gave lectures to future physicists, served as an advisor to doctoral candidates, and contributed to textbooks. Between 1970 and 1979, he was a regional representative in the Slovak National Physics Organization, and actively helped organize conferences on magnetism. He died on 9 January 1983, in Košice.|$|E

Using the case of Hurricane Katrina to illustrate {{the collapse of the}} standard model of emergency manage-ment without a clear focus on the role of cognition, the author reframes the concept of intergovernmental crisis management as a complex, adaptive system.

40|$|<b>Physical</b> {{ecosystem}} <b>engineers</b> are {{organisms that}} physically modify the abiotic environment. They can affect biogeochemical processing {{by changing the}} availability of resources for microbes (e. g., carbon, nutrients) or by changing abiotic conditions affecting microbial process rates (e. g., soil moisture or temperature). <b>Physical</b> ecosystem <b>engineers</b> can therefore create biogeochemical heterogeneity in soils and sediments. They do so via general mechanisms influencing the flows of materials (i. e., modification of fluid dynamic properties, fluid pumping, and material transport) or the transfer of heat (i. e., modification of heat transfer properties, direct heat transfer, and convective forcing). The consequences of physical ecosystem engineering for biogeochemical processes can be predicted by considering the resources or abiotic conditions that limit or promote a reaction, {{and the effect of}} physical ecosystem engineering on these resources or abiotic conditions via the control they exert on material flows and heat transfer...|$|R

30|$|Policies {{directed}} at human {{development at the}} urban and national levels have often attempted to change socioeconomic dynamics via improvements of infrastructure and services (Brook and Smith [2001]; Nunan and Satterthwaite [2001], Calderón and Servén [2004]). However, {{the nature of the}} link between the physical, infrastructural and social facets of human societies has remained unclear and difficult to establish in useful ways (Lynch [1981], Calderón and Servén [2004]). In practice, the attempt to use engineering solutions, e.g. for the provision of housing or transportation, as the principal driver of socio-economic development has been largely unsuccessful, especially in helping the poorest urban populations in developed nations. Vivid examples of such failures include the top-down policies of urban renewal in the United States and elsewhere after World War II (Mintzberg [1994]). These observations raise questions: what kind of social structures and dynamics underlie human socioeconomic development and what properties should infrastructural and <b>physical</b> <b>engineered</b> systems possess in order to support them.|$|R

40|$|Coping with {{rapid changes}} in {{technologies}} in professional lives requires tools that can persistently train the users. An important task for humans is {{to control the}} physical system behaviors with prediction. Though humans learn to perform this task with relative ease over several natural <b>physical</b> systems, <b>engineered</b> <b>physical</b> systems pose a problem as they are often inaccessible for natural interaction. Our research proposes a new architecture of autonomous agents, which allows them to be persistent assistants. These agents learn to perform a given Control based Prediction task over the physical systems by applying a modified Q_Learning algorithm. During this learning the state and actions spaces of physical system are acquired, which are projected as perceptual spaces in which the user can explore to learn to perform the given task. While facilitating such an exploration, the agent learns to support learning by the user by applying a modification of the TD(λ) algorithm. In this paper, we present {{the architecture of the}} agent, the learning algorithms, and a solution to some complex implementation issues.
