40|$|Environmental {{change is}} {{anticipated}} to negatively affect both {{plant and animal}} populations. As abiotic factors rapidly change habitat suitability, projections range from altered genetic diversity to wide-spread species loss. Here, we assess {{the degree to which}} changes in atmospheric composition associated with environmental change will influence not only the abundance, but also the genotypic/phenotypic diversity, of herbivore populations. Using free-air CO 2 and O 3 enrichment (FACE) technology, we assess numerical responses of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibiting a pink–green genetic polymorphism and an environmentally determined wing polyphenism on broad bean plants (Vicia faba) under enriched CO 2 and/or O 3 atmospheres, over multiple generations. We show that these two greenhouse gases alter not only aphid population sizes, but also genotypic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As the green genotype was positively influenced by elevated CO 2 levels, but the pink genotype was not, genotypic frequencies (pink morph: green morph) ranged from 1 : 1 to 9 : 1. These two genotypes also displayed marked differences in <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The pink genotype exhibited higher levels of wing induction under all atmospheric treatments, however, this polyphenism was negatively influenced by elevated O 3 levels. Resultantly, frequencies of winged phenotypes (pink morph: green morph) varied from 10 : 1 to 332 : 1.

However, a resistant duplicated allele of the gene encoding AChE 1 (ace- 1), potentially associated to a lower fitness cost, recently appeared in An. gambiae.

An {{association}} between the dysregulation of innate immunity, primarily the deregulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and BC development was described a long time ago. Several studies have reported that BC risk factors appear to be related to the interaction between certain genes and exposure to various environmental factors. Here, we investigated the potential correlation of three TLR 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs 3804100, rs 4696480, and rs 3804099) with the development of BC in female patients from Saudi Arabia. We collected 126 blood samples from women with BC and 146 blood samples from healthy women without any clinical signs of BC. The genotypic frequencies of TLR 2 polymorphisms were assayed. Our results showed that the genotypic and allelic frequencies of TLR 2 did not differ significantly between BC patients and healthy controls. However, the distributions of rs 3804100 (1350 T/C) genotypes in BC groups were 1 %, 19 %, and 80 % for CC, CT, and TT, respectively. In the control group, the rs 3804100 (1350 T/C) genotype distributions were 3 %, 18 %, and 79 % for CC, CT, and TT, respectively. The SNP rs 3804100 homozygous “TT” genotype was not associated with the risk of developing BC in the BC patients compared with controls (odds ratio [OR], 4. 5; confidence interval [CI], 0. 49 – 41. 02; P= 0. 145). The TLR 2 rs 4696480 AA genotype was observed in 23 % of BC patients compared to 18 % of control individuals, the AT genotype was seen in 40 % of BC patients and 46 % of control individuals, and the TT genotype was observed in 37 % of BC patients and 36 % of normal controls. Our results did not show any difference in genotypic frequency between BC patients and normal controls for the TLR 2 rs 3804099 SNP; however, the (C) <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> was 49 % in BC patients and 53 % in controls. The (T) <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> was 51 % and 47 % in BC patients and normal patients, respectively. These findings indicate that there is no association between the TLR 2 polymorphisms tested and BC susceptibility in the female population from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We suggest using other TLR 2 SNPs to investigate the possible relationship between innate immunity deregulation by disruption of TLR 2 and potential BC development.

40|$|Abstract. Negative frequency-dependent {{selection}} {{is a well}} known microevolutionary process that has been documented in a population of Perissodus microlepis, a species of cichlid fish endemic to Lake Tanganyika (Africa). Adult P. microlepis are lepidophages, feeding on the scales of other living fish. As an adaptation for this feeding behavior P. microlepis exhibit lateral asymmetry with respect to jaw morphology: the mouth either opens to the right or {{left side of the}} body. Field data illustrate a temporal phenotypic oscillation in the mouth-handedness, and this oscillation is maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Since both genetic and population dynamics occur on the same time scale in this case, we develop a (discrete time) model for P. microlepis populations that accounts for both dynamic processes. We establish conditions on model parameters under which the model predicts extinction and conditions under which there exists a unique positive (survival) equilibrium. We show that at the positive equilibrium there is a 1 : 1 phenotypic ratio. Using a local stability and bifurcation analysis, we give further conditions under which the positive equilibrium is stable and conditions under which it is unstable. Destabilization results in a bifurcation to a periodic oscillation and occurs when frequency-dependent {{selection is}} sufficiently strong. This bifurcation is offered as an explanation of the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillations observed in P. microlepis.

The <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> distributions observed in this study indicated quantitative inheritance of seedling mortality due to Bakanae disease (Fig.  2) indicating that the resistance/ susceptibility is under polygenic control. However, there was predominance of resistant progenies over susceptible ones, indicating the presence of major genetic loci in the population governing resistance. The QTL mapping technique aids to identify genetic regions affecting quantitative traits (Collard et al. 2005) that may contain or may reside proximally to the genes responsible for the trait. In this study, we have used two robust QTL mapping methods, such as IM and ICIM, of which former is a commonly used method for mapping QTLs from biparental crosses (Li et al. 2007). ICIM is an improvement over the commonly implemented composite interval mapping (CIM) algorithm, in which selection of marker is done through a stepwise regression taking into consideration of all markers simultaneously, leaving the flanking markers at the current interval. The phenotype values are adjusted for all the remaining markers retained in the regression model, and IM is then performed using the adjusted phenotype values. ICIM is therefore simple, faster and achieve model convergence efficiently, while keeping all the advantages of IM and simultaneously avoiding the complicated selection of background control markers used in CIM. ICIM {{is reported to have}} increased QTL detection power, while controlling false discovery with less biased QTL estimates than IM (Li et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT HLA class I antigen {{distribution}} of Sikh population from Punjab is presented. A total of 404 individual of Sikh community who were either donors for renal transplant recipients or staff in PGIMER Chandigarh were selected. HLA class I antigens (A and B) were identified using the standard National Institute of Health two stage micro lymphocytotoxicity assay. The <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> of HLA-A 10,B 5,B 8 {{were found to}} be increased while the frequencies of HLA-A 19, A 28, B 35 and B 40 {{were found to be}} decreased when compared to another north Indian population. The two-locus haplotype analysis revealed highly significant positive linkage disequilibrium for A 2 -B 21, A 10 -B 8. Significant negative linkage disequilibrium was also seen A 9 -B 8, A 10 -B 5, A 10 -B 7 and A 9 -B 24 and positive linkage for A 11 -B 5. Haplotype A 2 -B 21 appears to be unique to Sikhs...|$|R

We investigated the genetic structure of the urban cockroach Blattella germanica and its oxyuroid parasite Blatticola blattae. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to quantify genetic diversity between and within four populations (from two cities in France) of the host and its parasite. Diversity based on <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> was calculated for each RAPD marker using Shannon-Wiener's index. We used multivariate analyses to test the significance of genetic differentiation between host and parasite populations. Analysis of molecular variance was also used. Both methods gave similar results. Diversity between pairs of individuals was estimated by Nei & Li's index. Genetic diversity was higher within host or parasite populations (80 % and 82 %, respectively, of explained diversity) than between host or parasite populations (20 % and 18 %, respectively, explained diversity). The genetic distances between pairs of parasite populations (or individuals) were not correlated with the genetic distances between the corresponding pairs of host populations (or individuals) ...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{segregation}} {{experiments with}} plant species {{are commonly used}} for understanding the inheritance of traits. A basic assumption in these experiments is that each gamete developed from megasporogenesis has an equal chance of fusing with a gamete developed from microsporogenesis, and every zygote formed has an equal chance of survival. If gametic and/or zygotic selection occurs whereby certain gametes or zygotic combinations have a reduced chance of survival, progeny distributions are skewed and are said to exhibit segregation distortion. In this study, inheritance data are presented for the trait seed testa color segregating in large populations (more than 200 individuals) derived from closely related mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilcek) taxa. Segregation ratios suggested complex inheritance, including dominant and recessive epistasis. However, this genetic model was rejected {{in favor of a}} single-gene model based on evidence of segregation distortion provided by molecular marker data. The segregation distortion occurred after each generation of self-pollination from F 1 thru F 7 resulting in F 7 <b>phenotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 151 : 56 instead of the expected 103. 5 : 103. 5. This study highlights the value of molecular markers for understanding the inheritance of a simply inherited trait influenced by segregation distortion...|$|R
