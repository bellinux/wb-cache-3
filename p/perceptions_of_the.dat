40|$|Researchers in {{consumer}} {{and social psychology}} have developed various theories to account for shifts in <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> targets caused by contextual stimuli. In this previous work, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> a target stimulus is observed as it reacts to <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> contextual stimuli. Attention in the past research has focused entirely on the target. As a result, no one has investigated possible shifts in <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> contextual stimuli. <b>The</b> present research proposes and tests a reciprocity hypothesis to explain {{what happens to the}} contextual stimulus and suggests that not only is <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target shifted by the contextual stimulus, but also <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus is shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. That is, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted away from the target in a contrast condition, but toward the target in an assimilation condition. ^ Two studies with 390 undergraduates examined the hypothesis that, after priming, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. In Study 1, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce a contrast effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target was shifted away from the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted away from the target as well. In Study 2, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce an assimilation effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target was shifted toward the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted toward the target. That was, results in both studies supported the predictions. Thus, after the priming procedure, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target (symmetrical <b>perception</b> shift). ...|$|R

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E

5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals. The police were depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history {{to help make the}} modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian {{beliefs about the}} gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests.

Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine may have differed from those of the priests.

But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E
