40|$|Treatment of unfair trade laws {{has become}} an {{important}} topic in negotiations on <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>areas.</b> Recent <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>areas</b> involving the United States, {{one of the most}} significant users of these laws, have established special binational dispute settlement panels to arbitrate disagreements. Using a panel database of U. S. antidumping and countervailing duty activity from 1980 through 2000, the article examines whether the use of dispute settlement panels has reduced such activity between the United States and its North American Free Trade Agreement partners. The analysis finds little evidence for any effect, calling into question the effectiveness of dispute settlement panels in reducing unfair trade law activity. With the success of multilateral trade negotiation rounds under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in reducing traditional forms of trade protection, such as tariffs and quotas, attention has turned to the use of antidumping and countervailing duty laws by WTO member countries. In some countries, these laws have been on the books since well before the GATT/WTO existed. However, as GATT/WTO membership has grown over the past two decades, such activity has exploded. 1 This trend is worrisome for its implications for the ultimate effectiveness of recent and future GATT/WTO rounds. It may be that countries with antidumping and countervailing duty laws are willing to negotiate greater reductions in other forms of trade protection, since such laws allow the most import-sensitive sectors a channel of relief when negotiated reductions in trade barriers take place. But it is also the case that increased antidumping and countervailing duty activity may seriously undermine free trade agreements that do not fully addres...|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{demonstrates}} {{the importance of}} developing high quality output in order to compete in export markets and other recent studies verify the prevalence of fixed and ongoing trade costs while participating in those markets. I consider the joint choice of quality and export promotion costs when trade relationships are subject to temporary disputes. When transparency is low and macroeconomic instability is high, disputes arrive more frequently and, therefore, firms may inefficiently choose lower levels of quality and export promotion. These, in turn, build shallower trading relationships with less trade volumes and higher tariffs, and generate greater trade reductions during the more common trade disputes. Several institutional features of the WTO that are generally lacking in <b>preferential</b> <b>trade</b> agreements such as improved transparency, dispute investigation, and the provision to recommend asymmetric continuation payoffs can ameliorate these inefficient quality choice outcomes. Hence, lower quality output and lower quality trading relationships may be more endemic to countries that depend on <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>areas</b> {{as opposed to the}} WTO.

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} welfare effects of {{regional}} integration {{in a model}} of endogenous protection. They show that introducing <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> leads {{to an increase in}} protection against countries outside the <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>area.</b> Moreover, the important Meade result of <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> breaks down in the presence of endogenous protection. According to the Meade result, if excess demands exhibit net substitutability, the introduction of <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> is welfare-improving. In the presence of endogenous protection, because <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> is accompanied by increased protection against nonpartners, its effect on welfare is ambiguous. The authors also compare free <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> and customs unions. They provide the first formal treatment of the argument that a customs union is a more effective instrument for diluting the power of interest groups than is a free <b>trade</b> <b>area.</b> Under a customs union, the tariff available to one country becomes available to all countries in the union. This introduces a free-rider problem in lobbying and all lobbying takes place in one country. The lobby chooses a lower (common) external tariff under a customs unions than under a free <b>trade</b> <b>area.</b> This means that welfare in the country where lobbying takes place is higher under a customs union than under a free <b>trade</b> <b>area,</b> although the same may not hold true for the other country. The level of the common external tariff declines as the number of members in the union increases. Therefore, the larger the number of partners in a customs union, the more likely it will improve the welfare of member countries. But, because of the free-rider problem, lobbies are likely to resist the enlargement of the customs union.
