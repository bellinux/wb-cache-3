Finished articles are intended {{to be used for}} single and repeated contact with all kinds of foodstuffs at all temperatures. Residual content of the substance was not detected in sintered or processed (non-sintered) articles at temperatures at or above 360 Â°C and was detected in fluoropolymers processed (non-sintered) at 300 Â°C from which total mass transfer was calculated to be 13 Âµg/kg food. Based on migration modelling under highly conservative assumptions, estimated migration of the substance present at the measured residual level in articles processed (non-sintered) at temperatures of 300 Â°C, is in the range of 1 Âµg/kg. For repeated use applications, migration at each following use will be considerably lower. Based on negative results from three adequately performed in vitro genotoxicity tests, the Panel considered that the substance is non-genotoxic. The CEF Panel concluded that there is no safety concern for the consumer if the substance 2 H-perfluoro-[(5, 8, 11, 14 -tetramethyl) -tetraethyleneglycol ethyl propyl ether] is only used as a polymer <b>production</b> <b>aid</b> in the polymerisation of fluoropolymers intended for a) repeated and single use materials and articles when sintered or processed (non-sintered) at temperatures at or above 360 Â°C for at least 10 minutes or at higher temperatures for equivalent shorter times, b) repeated use materials and articles only when processed (non-sintered) at temperatures from 300 Â°C and up to 360 Â°C for at least 10 minutes...|$|E

40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a <b>production</b> <b>aid</b> per tonne of unginned cotton within {{national}} guaranteed quantities. Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a guaranteed minimum price of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to final agricultural output in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, Sterea Ellada and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of ginned cotton and is a major net exporter of ginned cotton. The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of ginned cotton per annum. Comment: The guaranteed minimum price system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of ginned cotton).

This new approach would further reduce the trade-distorting impact of EU cotton-sector support, which was already negligible. Addressing EU Agricultural Ministers in October 2003, Commissioner Fischler assured member states that with 40 % of the payments still coupled, 60 % decoupled and revenue coming from cotton cultivation, the gross margin to EU cotton farmers would still compare well to those from alternative crops.

40|$|During 1996 - 2000, U. S. {{imports of}} milk protein {{concentrate}} (MPC) increased rapidly. At the same time, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) went from nothing {{to more than}} 500 million pounds. Consequently, U. S. milk producers attributed low milk prices and dairy farmer income during this period to the increased imports of MPC. U. S. milk producers were especially concerned with MPC imports for two reasons. First, MPC between 40 and 90 percent protein had been classified in subheading 0404. 90. 10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Thus, MPC was {{not subject to the}} tariff-rate quotas applied to many other dairy products. Second, MPC produced in the European Union (EU) and exported to the United States was eligible for production and export subsidies. Along with the high U. S. internal milk protein prices maintained by the Dairy Price Support Program, and volatile world prices of NFDM, these policies created economic rents for trade in MPC between the European Union and the United States. To test the relationship between these policies and U. S. imports of MPC, these economic rents, which were not directly observable, were estimated by combing a set of identifiable variables: (1) the CCC purchase price, (2) the EU export refund, (3) EU casein <b>production</b> <b>aid,</b> and (4) the world price of NFDM as expressed by the Western Europe export price. A vector autoregression model was then estimated using monthly U. S. imports of MPC and the estimate of economic rents. This estimation showed that nearly 40 percent of the variability in U. S. MPC imports was attributable to the estimate of economic rents. These results demonstrate that U. S. and EU policies can not be analyzed in isolation when evaluating the impact of dairy policies on U. S. MPC imports. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

In this paper different combinations of traditional agricultural policies and revenue and yield insurance are analysed for the Spanish olive oil sector. Taking a database containing about half million Spanish olive growers during 8 campaigns, five possible policies are studied {{and the results are}} examined according to different criteria including average revenue and its variability, growers utility gains, taxpayers cost and the transfer efficiency of support. The policies analysed are: (1) non-intervention; (2) the policy currently in force in Spain that combines a <b>production</b> <b>aid</b> with a yield insurance; (3) a revenue insurance, only; (4) revenue insurance combined with a production aid; and (5) an aid per tree in combination with revenue insurance. The methodology is based on Monte-Carlo simulations performed on about 100 groups of growers that have been grouped according to their expected yields and variability. Assuming and estimating olive oil price and yields correlations for each group of growers, the analysis allows for consistent policy comparisons at a very disaggregate level. Using the results for all analysed groups, policies are ranked based on the above criteria at the provincial and national levels. Results show that the current regime of EU production aids of olive oil eliminates the advantage of extending the current yield insurance to a revenue insurance. It is also shown that the level of support delivered by production aids cannot be reached with revenue insurance even with completely subsidised premiums. Finally, it is shown that the policy that combines tree aids with revenue insurance exhibits good results for all examining criteria.

40|$|Review of EU {{subsidies}} in {{the fruit}} and vegetable sector Although {{the fruit and}} vegetable sector is not formally part of the CAP mid-term review, it is proposed to replace {{the current system of}} support through producer organisations and export refunds with an annual flat-rate payment of € 100 per hectare for a maximum guaranteed area of 800, 000 hectares, divided into national guaranteed areas. This could be topped up by an annual maximum amount of € 109 per hectare by member states. This USDA briefing points out that since the start of marketing year 2000 / 01 aid for fruit and vegetables intended for processing have been paid directly to the producer organisations and no longer to the processors and that as a consequence the new arrangements have made the fixing of a minimum price obsolete. In 2003 <b>production</b> <b>aid</b> to processed tomatoes is set at € 279 million a 25 % increase over 2001, while aid for processing fruit-based products is set at € 86 million, a 21 % increase over 2001, and aid for citrus fruit is set at € 249 million, a 46. 5 % increase over 2001. It should be noted that fruit processors may also be eligible for support under EU rural-development programmes. However these programmes are non-product specific and it is therefore impossible to determine the level of support being extended to specific types of processors under these programmes. The briefing also notes that fruit and vegetable grower may also benefit from member states' aid measures (e. g. the greenhouse sector in the Netherlands). The EU also grants financial support for the promotion of EU agricultural products, including fruit and vegetables on the internal market and third-country markets, with such promotional measures being part-financed by the EU (50 %), part by the member states (20 %) and part by the producer organisation (30 %).

40|$|Speaking to the European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003 the Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler {{outlined}} the proposals {{contained in the}} second round of the CAP mid-term review proposals. He pointed out that the trend towards decoupling was now firmly established, and argued that the more products which would be included in the single farm payment scheme the better. Against this background the Commission has put forward a communication on reform of the common market organisation for olive oil, tobacco and cotton. Reform proposals in the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sectors are aimed at reorienting support to 'reward healthy, high quality products and practices' and to supporting the development of 'alternative sources of income and economic activity'. In order to achieve this the majority of support is to be decoupled from production and integrated into the single farm payment scheme. Since the production of these crops is concentrated in less favoured regions of the EU it is also proposed to strengthen the rural development measures for these regions. For tobacco the existing tobacco premium is to be decoupled over a three-year period alongside a phasing out of the tobacco fund. During this transition period a special fund will be set up under the rural development pillar to support restructuring in tobacco-growing areas. By the end of the reform period more than 70 % of the current tobacco premium will have been converted into the single farm payments and at least 20 % will be deployed as restructuring assistance. In the olive-oil sector the approach is to be modified, for there are concerns that a complete conversion into a single decoupled payment scheme could lead to land abandonment in traditional production areas. For this reason 40 % of payments are to remain linked to production with 60 % being decoupled and incorporated into the single farm payment scheme. In the cotton sector the Commission has proposed to incorporate part of the current support into the single farm payment scheme and to transform the rest into <b>production</b> <b>aid</b> granted as an area payment. Here again only partial decoupling is to occur. Commissioner Fischler noted that a slightly different approach was being adopted in the sugar sector with three options being put forward for further discussion. This follows the approach adopted in the dairy sector and is designed to find an approach which will minimise land abandonment throughout the EU. Further discussion was felt to be necessary since 'the sugar sector is a sensitive and also complicated sector, which has never, until now, been fundamentally reformed'. It is felt that there is therefore a need for a political debate on sugar-sector reform. Commissioner Fischler noted that in the sugar sector it was clear that any reform of the sugar market will have to: bridge the gap between domestic and world market prices; involve a decoupling of support; weigh the pros and cons of the quota system; take into account the international impact of reform. A concise summary of the situation in the raw tobacco, olive oil and cotton sectors, an explanation of how the common organisation of the market works and a summary of the situation on world markets can be found in the Commission memorandum of September 23 rd 2003. Comment: Reform of the EU tobacco regime is likely to exert a downward price on EU tobacco prices, which could affect ACP earnings from tobacco exports. More fundamentally, the facilitation of disengagement of EU farming from tobacco production will intensify pressures to reduce tobacco consumption in the EU, which could result in a shrinking of the EU tobacco market. In the olive oil and cotton sectors only partial decoupling is proposed. This highlights the extent to which the EU is willing to retain coupled farm payments where this is necessary to keep land under production, setting limits on the extent to which the EU can move over to decoupled farm payments. The Commission's cautious approach to sugar-sector reform highlights the sensitivity of this sector within the EU.
