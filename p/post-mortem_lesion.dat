40|$|The {{accuracy}} of radiofrequency ablation catheter tip localization {{with reference to}} surrounding anatomy was examined with both fluoroscopic and intracardiac long axis ultrasound imaging modalities in the canine left ventricle. 72 lesions (5 – 6 per dog) were created in 14 dogs with the delivery of 20 – 65 watts of radiofrequency power via 4 – 12 mm tip catheters. Using a 9 RAO and 9 LAO mapping zone grid system, the relationship between fluoroscopic catheter tip position and underlying anatomy was established. The catheter tip location predicted by the fluoroscopic approach correlated precisely with the specific <b>post-mortem</b> <b>lesion</b> location in 52 (72 %) of lesions. In 18 (25 %), the lesions {{were found to be}} one zone (1 – 2 cm) removed from the predicted site and were ≥ 2 zones removed in 2 (3 %) lesions. locations predicted by longitudinally imaging intracardiac ultrasound as referenced to papillary muscles, the interventricular septum, and aortic and mitral annulae were significantly more accurate (chi 2 = 7. 1, p = 0. 029) than with fluoroscopy. In each of 20 sites examined, the lesion was within 5 mm of that predicted by intracardiac ultrasound localization. This information demonstrates that ultrasound guidance during catheter mapping may be superior to that possible with fluoroscopy. This is of importance for the localization of tachycardia circuits, the investigational localization of radiofrequency lesions created with catheter techniques, and for return site energy delivery in cases of unstable or only marginally reproducible tachycardias...|$|E

Two samples representing rectal swabs, liver and intestine were collected from each examined rabbits. A total of 718 samples expressing 329 surveyed rabbits (95 apparently healthy, 204 clinically affected and 30 freshly dead ones). Equal number (19) of feed and water samples were collected from each surveyed farm. All the samples were subjected for Clostridial isolation and spp. identification after cultural and biochemical characterization. Tissue samples from liver and intestine of freshly dead rabbits were subjected for histopathological examination. Results revealed that, the most prevalent observed signs were severe diarrhea, bloat accompanied with variable mortalities. <b>Post-mortem</b> <b>lesions</b> were severe enteritis and typhlitis with different degrees of necrosis and hemorrhages associated with gaseous contents.

Data recorded included animal identification, rectal temperature, lung score, and antibiotic therapy at first treatment. Treatment outcome data were recorded by feed yard personnel utilizing an animal health computer. The outcome data tracked for this study included subsequent BRDC treatment or death of the animal. Our findings indicated that as lung auscultation score (P <. 0001) or rectal temperature (P <. 0001) increased there was an increased risk for cattle to require a second BRDC treatment. Also, we observed an increased risk for death loss in cattle with higher lung auscultation scores (P <. 0001) or higher rectal temperature (P <. 0001) at the time of treatment for BRDC.

After angiography, the three vessels were studied (when possible) with IVUS-VH and OCT. Plaque characteristics were correlated with clinical and analytical data. Forty-six lesions were analyzed. IVUS-VH detected significant necrotic core in 15 (3 were definite TCFA). OCT detected TCFA in 10 lesions, erosion in 6, thrombus in 5 and calcified nodule in 8.

Previous investigations have used traditional epidemiological methods that are unable to identify the causative agent and from which dynamics of disease dispersion is difficult to discern. The objective {{of this study was to}} isolate, characterize and determine the genetic diversity and relatedness of M. bovis from major cattle rearing districts in Zambia by spoligotyping. A total of 695 carcasses were examined and 98 tissues had gross <b>post-mortem</b> <b>lesions</b> compatible with BTB. Results Forty-two out of the ninety-eight suspected tissues examined had culture properties characteristic of mycobacteria from which 31 isolates yielded interpretable spoligotypes. This technique showed good discriminatory power (HGDI = 0. 98), revealing 10 different spoligotype patterns. Twenty-seven isolates belonged to one cluster with more than 95 % similarity and inside the cluster, one predominant spoligotype was found in 20 (64. 5 %) of the isolates tested. The highest number of spoligotypes was observed among samples from Namwala district. Spoligotypes from 26 (83. 9 %) of the isolates belonged to five spoligotypes that have been reported before while the remaining 5 (16. 1 %) isolates had unique spoligotypes that are being reported for the first time; these have been assigned numbers SB 1763 to SB 1767. Five of the 6 districts had the predominant spoligotype (SB 0120). Conclusion The study has described the dispersion patterns of M. bovis in Zambian cattle for the first time and has identified 5 spoligotype patterns specific to Zambia. The observation of an overlap in the spoligotype pattern SB 0120 in 5 of the 6 districts suggests the probability of sharing a common source of infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} develop a novel, safe and {{immunogenic}} fowl typhoid (FT) vaccine candidate, a Salmonella Gallinarum ghost with controlled expression of the bacteriophage PhiX 174 lysis gene E was constructed using pMMP 99 plasmid in this study. The formation of the Salmonella Gallinarum ghost with tunnel formation and loss of cytoplasmic contents was observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. No viable cells were detectable 24 [*]h after the induction of gene E expression {{by an increase in}} temperature from 37 [*]°C to 42 [*]°C. The safety and protective efficacy of the Salmonella Gallinarum ghost vaccine was tested in chickens that were divided into four groups: group A (non-immunized control), group B (orally immunized), group C (subcutaneously immunized) and group D (intramuscularly immunized). The birds were immunized at day 7 of age. None of the immunized animals showed any adverse reactions such as abnormal behavior, mortality, or signs of FT such as anorexia, depression, or diarrhea. These birds were subsequently challenged with a virulent Salmonella Gallinarum strain at 3 [*]weeks post-immunization (wpi). Significant protection against the virulent challenge was observed in all immunized groups based on mortality and <b>post-mortem</b> <b>lesions</b> compared to the non-immunized control group. In addition, immunization with the Salmonella Gallinarum ghosts induced significantly high systemic IgG response in all immunized groups. Among the groups, orally-vaccinated group B showed significantly higher levels of secreted IgA. A potent antigen-specific lymphocyte activation response along with significantly increased percentages of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes found in all immunized groups clearly indicate the induction of cellular immune responses. Overall, these findings suggest that the newly constructed Salmonella Gallinarum ghost appears to be a safe, highly immunogenic, and efficient non-living bacterial vaccine candidate that protects against FT. </p...|$|R
40|$|Using massive {{parallel}} sequencing, {{which has}} become known as second-generation sequencing, some of the classic roadblocks to using herbarium DNA have been overcome. For instance, no longer is the degraded nature of most herbarium DNA preventing sequencing (because of blocking effective amplification). Instead, several kilobases of genomic sequence can be obtained on a routine basis, especially from high-copy number compartments such as plastomes (chloroplast genomes). With approaches such as genomic skimming a fair coverage of repetitive genome compartments (such as plastomes) can be obtained, enabling fast assembly of associated sequences. Although assembly of complete 150 + kilobase herbarium plastomes based on skimming still needs more investment, the generation of large contigs spanning several kilo bases is straightforward. It presents an important and cost-effective boost to using herbarium DNA-sequences in phylogenetic studies at species-level and beyond. At the same time, although herbarium DNA appears to bear the signature of ancient DNA, the accuracy of the herbarium DNA sequences obtained appears to be surprisingly high, as <b>post-mortem</b> miscoding <b>lesion</b> damage in most herbarium DNA is found to be negligible...|$|R

Supplementat 1 oi,. of the peanut oil meal with the three amino acids resulted in growth rate almost as good as that of chicks on the soybean oil meal diet. Addition of amino acids to the toxic peanut 011 meal did not improve its quality nor decrease the high mortality. In the soybean oil meal diet, methionine was found to be the first limiting amino acid. Growth rate due to lysine, glycine or combinations of the three amino acids was lower than that due to methionine supplementation alone. In the last experiment, the peanut oil meal was supplemented with fish meal. Supplementation above 50 percent may probably not be economical under the conditions of this experiment. Regression of weight gain per unit of feed consumed on the three amino acids gave significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) coefficients of 0. 301, 0. 562 and 0. 350 for lysine, sulfur amino acids and glycine respectively. The correlation coefficients respectively were r 1 = + 0. 96, r 2 = + 0. 98 and r 3 = + 0. 96.

Then the birds of groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 received inocula that contained feces and a pool of organs with fragments of liver, heart, spleen, and cecal tonsils obtained from the immediately previous group. The second trial had three groups with 10 birds each. Birds in group 7 received inocula containing a pool of organs from birds of group 5 from trial 1, whilst the birds in group 8 were vaccinated subcutaneously with one dose of vaccine. Both trials included negative control groups (6 and 9). Throughout the experimental period, birds were monitored for reactions to the vaccination on the site of administration, clinical signs, and <b>post-mortem</b> <b>lesions.</b> In each passage, in addition to the birds euthanized to provide the inocula material, two birds from each group were euthanized for assessment of possible lesions, and their organs (liver, heart, spleen and cecal tonsils) were cultured in an attempt to isolate the vaccine strain. Except for one bird from group 1, that had a local reaction on the site of vaccination - a small vesicle with less that 0. 5 mm that persisted until the third day post vaccination -, no other bird had any local reaction to the vaccine or any visible clinical alteration. Birds in group 8 did not present any reaction or clinical alteration because of the vaccine. We only managed to re-isolate the vaccine strain in the inocula made from organs of birds in group 1. We confirmed the isolation by means of biochemical tests, serology, and acriflavine agglutination test. All other cultures made from organs or feces, from all the other experimental groups did not show any growth of the vaccine strain or any other Salmonella serovar, suggesting that the vaccinated birds did not shed the SG 9 R vaccine strain.

40|$|Oligodendrocyte {{precursor}} cells (OPCs) {{are a major}} source of remyelinating oligodendrocytes in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). While OPCs are innervated by unmyelinated axons in the normal brain, the fate of such synaptic contacts after demyelination is still unclear. By combining electrophysiology and immunostainings in different transgenic mice expressing fluorescent reporters, we studied the synaptic innervation of OPCs in the model of lysolecithin (LPC) -induced demyelination of corpus callosum. Synaptic innervation of reactivated OPCs in the lesion was revealed by the presence of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, VGluT 1 + axon-OPC contacts in 3 D confocal reconstructions and synaptic junctions observed by electron microscopy. Moreover, 3 D confocal reconstructions of VGluT 1 and NG 2 immunolabeling showed the existence of glutamatergic axon-OPC contacts in <b>post-mortem</b> MS <b>lesions.</b> Interestingly, patch-clamp recordings in LPC-induced lesions demonstrated a drastic decrease in spontaneous synaptic activity of OPCs early after demyelination that was not caused by an impaired conduction of compound action potentials. A reduction in synaptic connectivity was confirmed by the lack of VGluT 1 + axon-OPC contacts in virtually all rapidly proliferating OPCs stained with EdU (50 -ethynyl- 20 -deoxyuridine). At the end of the massive proliferation phase in lesions, the proportion of innervated OPCs rapidly recovers, although the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents did not reach control levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that newly-generated OPCs do not receive synaptic inputs during their active proliferation after demyelination, but gain synapses during the remyelination process. Hence, glutamatergic synaptic inputs may contribute to inhibit OPC proliferation and might have a physiopathological relevance in demyelinating disorders...|$|R
40|$|African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is an Asfivirus and is {{the only}} member of the family Asfarviridae. It manifests as a disease that varies from acute to sub-acute or chronic forms. A true carrier state in {{domestic}} pigs is unknown but chronically affected individuals may carry and spread the virus for extended periods. African Swine Fever (ASF) is a socio-economically important disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality affecting the livelihood of many small to big scale farmers and seriously compromising international trade. Strategic measures to control this disease are by physical containment and culling in outbreak situations. There is no vaccine available. Nevertheless, every pork producer should ideally be actively involved in having biosecurity measures in place to avoid contamination and contacting their veterinary services in case of suspicion of ASF to have appropriate samples analysed. Official veterinary services must be equipped with proper diagnostic tools in order to provide a quick response. The sensitivity of currently available diagnostic tests at the Transboundary Animal Diseases Programme, Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute was analysed in order to report the best technique available. Sensitivity to ASF virus infection and therefore diagnostic potential of cell primary cultures as bone marrow macrophages, blood macrophages and alveolar macrophages was done via comparison of titre results from inoculations of ASFV SPEC 257 as control, and ASFV MOZ 1 / 98. In addition, molecular detection of specific DNA fragments within the viral genome were compared using five different PCRs. Bone marrow macrophage cultures and blood macrophage cultures were the most reliable cells whereas alveolar macrophages more often showed contamination. Results show that PPA PCR and real time PCR detected the highest diluted samples, thus the lowest concentration of virus, in both trials done with ASFV MOZ 1 / 98 and ASFV SPEC 257. In addition, animal trials were performed by inoculating domestic pigs with four different ASFV isolates of varying pathogenicity. These viruses were all from distinct geographic origins. Non-virulent ASFV OURT 3 / 88 and high virulent ASFV BENIN 1 / 97 were previously described and used as reference viruses. ASFV MOZ 1 / 98, suspected of having high virulence and ASFV MKUZE, which was thought to be of low virulence were included in this study to provide further information on the pathological and clinical outcome of the disease as well as measuring viral replication in various organs and blood. The study showed that ASFV MKUZE was of intermediate virulence, whilst ASFV MOZ 1 / 98 was highly virulent with a high mortality rate. Results confirmed the inadequacy of ASFV MKUZE to act as vaccine opposed to ASFV OURT 3 / 88. Following this, a potential vaccine by use of attenuated Portuguese ASFV OURT 3 / 88 tested against virulent heterologous challenge with a strain now known with certainty to cause acute ASF, the isolate ASFV MOZ 1 / 98 collected from a diseased pig in Mozambique. Domestic commercial pigs where submitted to either one or two vaccinations before challenge. Viral load in blood and tissue samples was higher in unvaccinated animals and higher in single vaccinated than in pigs vaccinated twice. However, acute ASF afflicted all groups with severe clinical signs and <b>post-mortem</b> <b>lesions.</b> Although it did not confer total immunity it was determined that pigs vaccinated with European attenuated ASFV OURT 3 / 88 acquired partial protection against challenge with virulent southern Africa ASFV MOZ 1 / 98.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{causes and}} the genetic and environmental modifying factors of the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain elusive. Extrapolating from the known mutations {{that cause the}} rare familial forms and from the typical <b>post-mortem</b> pathological <b>lesions</b> in all AD patients [...] e. g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) -the evident molecular candidates are amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin, and tau protein. To include ApoE 4 as the only certain genetic modifier known leaves us to {{face the challenge of}} implementing these very different molecules into an evident pathological partnership. In more than one respect, the proposition of disturbed axonal transport appears attractive with more details becoming available on APP processing and microtubular transport and also of the pathology in the model systems [...] e. g., transgenic mice expressing APP or protein tau. Conversely, the resistance of APP-transgenic mice with full-blown amyloid pathology to also develop tau-related neurofibrillar pathology is a major challenge for this hypothesis. From the most relevant data discussed here, we conclude that the postulate of disturbed axonal transport as the primary event in AD is difficult to defend. On the other hand, failing axonal transport appears to be of major importance in the later stages in AD, by further compromising tau protein, APP metabolism, and synaptic functioning. Protein tau may thus be the central "executer" in the chain of events leading from amyloid neurotoxicity to tau hyperphosphorylation, microtubular destabilization, disturbed axonal transport, and synaptic failure to neurodegeneration. In order to identify normal physiological processes and novel pathological targets, definition is needed [...] in molecular detail [...] of the complex mechanisms involved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|An 8 {{year old}} female spayed mixed breed rabbit was {{presented}} to the Cornell Exotics Service with for evaluation of abdominal distention, severe weakness and unwillingness/inability to use both hind limbs. Past pertinent history included breeding, living in an outdoor hutch, and testing positive for Encephalitozoon cuniculi antibodies. On initial assessment, the patient was minimally responsive, extremely weak, and exhibited clinical signs of systemic shock. The abdomen was severely distended and a taut stomach was palpable in the cranial abdomen. Hind limb withdrawal reflex was completely absent. Two view abdominal radiographs revealed a stomach that was severely distended with fluid and gas [...] displacing the abdominal viscera caudally. A presumptive diagnosis of shock secondary to gastric obstruction was made. A sterile orogastric tube was passed into the stomach in an attempt to alleviate the gaseous distension of the stomach. Shortly after passing the tube, a 6 / 6 cardiac murmur was detected and the patient subsequently went into cardiac arrest.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to isolate and identify Pasteurella spp. associated with pneumonic lungs showing respiratory signs of goats in Ethiopia. Materials and methods: A total of 2400 goats that were slaughtered at the Hashim&# 146;s Ethiopian Livestock and Meat Export abattoir, Ethiopia were randomly selected for this cross-sectional study during the period of October 2013 to July 2014. Detail ante-mortem, and <b>post-mortem</b> (PM) <b>lesions</b> were inspected, and the suspected samples were collected aseptically from the lungs. Among 2400 goats, 31 (1. 29 %) goats were not slaughtered because these goats showed severe clinical signs. Thus, 2369 goats were slaughtered finally. The collected samples were subjected for isolation and identification of bacterial species following conventional methods such as culture and biochemical examinations. Results: Out of 2400 goats examined, 960 (40 %) animals showed different abnormal respiratory signs. Based on PM findings, 16. 21 % (n= 384 / 2369) lungs were found as pneumonic, of which 78. 38 % (n= 301 / 384) were found to be associated with Pasteurella organism. The overall prevalence of Pasteurella organism (Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida) was 12. 71 % (n= 301 / 2369). In this study, youngers and goats with medium body condition score (BCS) had greater probability (P< 0. 05) to be infected by the bacteria though there was no difference in exposure to the organism among goats from Arsi, Bale and Hararghe. On the other hand, out of 301 positive cases, 274 (91. 03 %) were caused by M. haemolytica, and 27 (8. 97 %) were caused by P. multocida isolates. Conclusion: Pasteurella organism especially M. hemolytica is one of the most common causes of pneumonic pasteurellosis in caprine at the study area. So, chemoprophylaxis needs to be given to small ruminants prior to transportation or other stress conditions. [J Adv Vet Anim Res 2017; 4 (2. 000) : 147 - 154...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cortical gray matter (GM) {{demyelination}} is {{frequent and}} clinically relevant in multiple sclerosis (MS). Quantitative {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (qMRI) sequences such as magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and quantitative R 2 ∗ (qR 2 ∗) can capture pathological subtleties missed by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Although differences in MTR and qR 2 ∗ have been reported between lesional and non-lesional tissue, differences between lesion types or lesion types and myelin density matched normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) have not been found or investigated. Objective: Identify quantitative differences in histopathologically verified GM lesion types and matched NAGM at ultra-high field strength. Methods: Using 7 T <b>post-mortem</b> MRI, MRI <b>lesions</b> were marked on T 2 images and co-registered to the calculated MTR and qR 2 ∗ maps for further evaluation. In all, 15 brain slices were collected, containing a total of 74 cortical GM lesions and 45 areas of NAGM. Results: Intracortical lesions had lower MTR and qR 2 ∗ values compared to NAGM. Type I lesions showed lower MTR than type III lesions. Type III lesions showed lower MTR than matched NAGM, and type I and IV lesions showed lower qR 2 ∗ than matched NAGM. Conclusion: qMRI at 7 T can provide additional information on extent of cortical pathology, especially concerning subpial lesions.

Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the temporally varying and fixed events linked with the clinical incidence of PMWS by comparing affected and unaffected pigs in a cohort of 178 male piglets. Piglets were enrolled at birth and examined each week. Samples of blood were collected at regular intervals. The exposures measured were porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) antibody titres in all 178 and PCV 2 antigen in a subset of 75 piglets. We also observed piglet health and measured their weight, and a post-mortem examination was performed by an external laboratory on all pigs between 6 and 14 weeks of age that died. From the cohort, 14 (8 %) pigs died from PMWS and 4 % from other causes. A further 37 pigs between 6 and 14 weeks of age died from PMWS (30) and ileitis and other causes (7). PMWS was only apparent in pigs from 1 to 2 weeks before death when they wasted rapidly. There were no other characteristic clinical signs and no obvious gross clinical <b>lesions</b> <b>post-mortem.</b> There was no strong link with PCV 2 antibody throughout life but PCV 2 antigen level was higher from 4 to 6 weeks of age in pigs that died from PMWS compared with pigs that died from other causes...|$|R
