In addition, {{it is important to}} determine the contribution of the forming tissue to the mechanical properties of the scaffold during culture to optimize the pore network architecture. Depending on the biomaterial and scaffold fabrication technology, matching the scaffolds mechanical properties to articular cartilage can compromise the porosity, which hampers tissue formation.

An array of anti-GST Abs spots was transferred thought direct Micro-Contact printing on an anti-adhesive coating composed of printed PLL-g-dextran molecules. This original strategy was inspired from thin PEO films deposited by PECVD, {{which for the}} first time were shown to be <b>protein</b> <b>adhesive</b> under the dry conditions of μCP and protein resistant in solution. In our methodology, the first PLL-g-dextran coating is obtained by contact printing using a flat stamp, which is a very low-cost, reproducible and fast method for generating this efficient anti-fouling coating as compared to more advanced methods such as PECVD deposition. Our process involving two contact printing steps, offers localized areas where proteins attachment is robust while the non-specific adsorption is inhibited {{on the rest of the}} surface. More than 90 % of the non-specific protein adsorption can be eliminated with this process in comparison with an untreated glass slide. Compared to other blocking strategies known in the literature these advanced biochips appear more effective for reducing unspecific interactions around the affinity spots. This easy-to-use functionalization technique opens an interesting surface chemistry for improving the limit of detection of immunoassays and the biosensing performances of micro and nano biodetection devices.|$|E

Here we demonstrate that inactivation of Rho or its downstream target Rho-associated kinase (ROK) stimulated neurite growth in primary cells of cortical neurons plated on myelin or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan substrates. Furthermore, treatment either with C 3 transferase (C 3) to inactivate Rho or with Y 27632 to inhibit ROK was sufficient to stimulate axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult mice. Injured mice were treated with a single injection of Rho or Rho-associated kinase inhibitors delivered in a <b>protein</b> <b>adhesive</b> at the lesion site. Treated animals showed long-distance regeneration of anterogradely labeled corticospinal axons and increased levels of GAP- 43 mRNA in the motor cortex.

40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a 25 nm {{replication}} deficient DNA virus {{most commonly}} studied for {{human gene therapy}} applications. The work detailed in this thesis investigates the controlled delivery of AAV from surfaces for both transduction and biosensing applications. First, AAV was tested for compatibility with substrate-mediated gene delivery approaches. Two reverse transduction applications were investigated: (1) spatial localization of cells and virus vectors for tissue engineering applications and (2) live cell genetic microarrays. To drive the proper differentiation and assembly of cells within tissue engineering constructs, gene expression patterns {{may need to be}} tightly regulated. To localize adhesive proteins and AAV, polydimethylsiloxane stamps and <b>protein</b> <b>adhesive</b> alkanethiols were used. By adsorbing AAV onto adhesive proteins, including human fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, elastin and poly-l-lysine, both cell adhesion and gene delivery were localized to a defined pattern. Gene delivery was efficient on all protein surfaces, with higher expression observed on laminin surfaces. AAV was also patterned using a robotic spotter to create live cell genetic microarrays, creating localized cell islands expressing GFP. This potentially high-throughput technique could be extended to study complex genetic interactions within cells, such as stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. Additionally, AAV was explored as a biosensor by modifying virus output functionalities. Wild-type AAV 2 externalizes an N-terminus region containing a phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) domain during intracellular processing, allowing the virus to escape the endosomal pathway and deliver genetic cargo. This externalization can be replicated outside of cells through heat treatment. AAV 2 -ΔPLA 2 -His was created by replacing the PLA 2 domain with a nickel binding hexahistidine tag. This replacement allows heat-treated mutant virus to bind a nickel affinity column. Finally, directed evolution was used to (1) improve the ability of AAV to deliver genes into target cells or (2) alter AAV biosensor inputs. Virus libraries were created using error-prone polymerase chain reaction (EP-PCR) to introduce random amino acid modifications into the protein capsid. The error rate for these libraries was estimated to be between 5 - 7 errors per cap gene. Combining surface immobilization with directed evolution could allow for precise control of AAV for gene delivery and biosensing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{interactions}} occurring between {{biological systems}} and the surface of biomaterials has been an area of strong research focus {{for a number of}} decades. There has been a realisation of the importance of macromolecular interactions and a consequent need to understand biointerfacial events at the nanometer length-scale. A set of tools for working at the nanometer scale are critical for the study, design and evaluation of new biomaterials for application to improve medical devices and therapies {{and there has been a}} significant research drive to develop engineering approaches able to perform in the nanometer regime. One such engineering approach to nanopattern model biomaterial interfaces over large areas is colloidal lithography. In this thesis work colloidal lithography is extended from metals and ceramics for use with organic materials including bulk homopolymers, thin films of both homopolymers and block copolymers and monolayers of proteins. Large area arrays of topographic nanostructures with a range of aspect ratios and shapes are demonstrated by systematic control of processing parameters. Templating of block copolymers via topographic or chemical nanopatterns was shown and a templated PLL-g-PEG layer was subsequently used to create large area nanopatterns of the protein Laminin. A novel approach to quantifying protein binding from AFM height histograms was developed and utilised to characterise the functional properties of the surface bound Laminin. Artificial nanostructured biointerfaces produced by these approaches giving nanoscale topographic or chemical cues were used to study the influence of nanoscale surface structures on the behaviour of adherent cells in culture. Significant changes in cellular morphology and cytoskeletal arrangement were observed which correlated to reduced focal adhesion formation. Cells adherent to nanopatterns of <b>protein</b> <b>adhesive</b> domains and high aspect ratio (< 1) cylindrical nanostructures showed similar behaviour suggesting that effects of nanoscale topography in biointerfaces research may relate to their presentation of non-specifically bound protein adsorbing from the extra cellular matrix in a particular 3 D architecture with resultant influences on availability of those proteins to interact with cells.

40|$|Formaldehyde-based {{adhesives}} {{have been}} reported to be detrimental to health. Petrochemical-based adhesives are non-renewable, limited and costly. Therefore, the improvement of environmental-friendly adhesive from natural agricultural products has awakened noteworthy attention. A novel adhesive for wood application was successfully prepared with enhanced shear strength and water resistance. The Fourier transmform infrared spectra showed the surface functionalities of the functionalized carbon nanotubes (FCNTs) and soy protein isolate nanocomposite adhesive. The attachment of carboxylic functional group {{on the surface of the}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) after purification contributed to the effective dispersion of the CNTs in the nanocomposite adhesive. Hence, enhanced properties of FCNTs were successfully transferred into the SPI/CNTs nanocomposite adhesive. These unique functionalities on FCNTs however, improved the mechanical properties of the adhesive. The shear strength and water resistance of SPI/FCNTs was higher than that of the SPI/CNTs. SEM images showed the homogenous dispersion of CNTs in the SPI/CNTs nanocomposite adhesive. The carbon nanotubes were distributed uniformly in the soy <b>protein</b> <b>adhesive</b> with no noticeable clusters at relatively reduced fractions of CNTs as shown in the SEM images, which resulted into better adhesion on wood surface. Mechanical (shear) mixing and ultrasonication with 30 minutes of shear mixing both showed an improved dispersion of CNTs in the soy protein matrix. However, ultrasonication method of dispersion showed higher tensile shear strength and water resistance than in mechanical (shear) mixing method. Thermogravimetric analysis of the samples also showed that the CNTs incorporated increases the thermal stability of the nanocomposite adhesive at higher loading fraction. Incorporation of CNTs into soy protein isolate adhesive improved both the shear strength and water resistance of the adhesive prepared at a relatively reduced concentration of 0. 3 %. The result showed that tensile shear strength of SPI/FCNTs adhesive was 0. 8 MPa and 7. 25 MPa at dry and wet state respectively, while SPI/CNTs adhesive had 6. 91 MPa and 5. 48 MPa at dry and wet state respectively. There was over 100 % increase in shear strength both at dry and wet state compared to the pure SPI adhesive. The 19 % decrease in value of the new adhesive developed compared to the minimum value of ≥ 10 MPa of European standard for interior wood application may be attributed to the presence of metallic particles remaining after purification of CNTs. The presence of metallic particles will prevent the proper penetration of the adhesive into the wood substrate. The type of wood used in this study as well as the processing parameters could also result into lower value compared to the value of European standard. Therefore, optimization of the processing parameter as well as the conversion of carboxylic acid group on the surface of the CNTs into acyl chloride group may be employed in future investigation. However, the preparation of new nanocomposite adhesive from soy protein isolate will replace the formaldehyde and petrochemical adhesive in the market and be of useful application in the wood industry.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Presently, the {{production}} of wood composites relies on the formaldehyde-based wood adhesives such as phenol-formaldehyde (PF) and urea-formaldehyde (UF). However, their dependence on exhaustible fossil fuels and the emission of carcinogenic formaldehyde prompt to develop an environmentally friendly adhesive from renewable natural resources. This work focuses on development and characterization of forma 1 dehydefree wood adhesives from renewable soybean protein and lignin. Soybean protein is an abundant, inexpensive, and readily available natural product. Soybean protein-based adhesives were widely used as wood adhesives in 1930 s- 1960 s and are completely replaced by synthetic formaldehyde-based adhesives today because wood composites bonded with soybean protein-based adhesives have relatively lower strength and lower water resistance than those bonded with formaldehyde-based <b>adhesives.</b> Marine <b>adhesive</b> <b>protein</b> from mussels is a strong and water-resistant adhesive. However, {{the production}} of marine <b>adhesive</b> <b>protein</b> is difficult and costly.

These materials were dispersed in synthetic polymers such as poly (vinyl acetate) (PVAc), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly (ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA). Five different cross-linking agents were also tested. In {{the second part of the}} study, protein 2 was used as a renewable material. It was dispersed in dispersing media 2 and filler 1 was used. In an effort to increase the amount of renewable material in the adhesive composition, six different renewable fillers were examined. Lower pressing temperatures as well as lower amounts of cross-linking agent 1 were evaluated in order to observe their influence on the adhesive properties of the <b>protein</b> based <b>adhesive.</b> All formulations were characterized by measurement of viscosity, solid content and pH. The adhesive properties of some of the formulations in both parts of the study were characterized according to SS-EN 204 : 2001 and EN 14257 (WATT 91). The best results, of the starch based formulations, were obtained when starch 1 and protein 2 were dispersed in dispersing media 2 or dispersing media 7. These formulations in combination with cross-linking agents were classified as D 2 and passed the criteria for heat resistance (WATT 91).

In normal subjects, adhesion and thrombus formation were inhibited by the Fab' fragments of a monoclonal anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody (LJ-CP 8), which interferes with the interaction of platelets with all four <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> in both the fluid and solid phase. However, another anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody (LJ-P 5) that had minimal effects on the interaction of platelets with fibrinogen, but inhibited to varying degrees platelet interaction with other <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins,</b> was equally effective. The findings demonstrate that, at a shear rate of 2, 600 s- 1, <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> other than fibrinogen are involved in GPIIb-IIIa-mediated platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on subendothelium. In addition, since LJ-P 5 inhibited the binding of soluble von Willebrand factor and vitronectin, these <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> {{may be involved in}} platelet thrombus formation. In contrast to the results obtained at a shear rate of 2, 600 s- 1, fibrinogen could play a role in mediating platelet-platelet interactions with weak agonists or lower shear rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{previously}} demonstrated that chemically modified thrombin preparations induce endothelial cell (EC) adhesion, spreading and cytoskeletal reorganization via an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence and the olv 33 integrin. Native thrombin, however, did not exhibit adhesive properties, consistent with crystal structure analysis, showing that Gly-Asp residues of the RGD epitope are buried within the molecule. We have now identified a possible physiological mean of converting thrombin to an <b>adhesive</b> <b>protein.</b> Plasmin, the major end {{product of the}} fibrinolytic system, converted thrombin to an <b>adhesive</b> <b>protein</b> for EC in a time and dose-dependent manner. EC adhesion and spreading was also induced by a low molecular weight (~ 3, 000 D) cleavage fragment generated upon incubatio...|$|R
40|$|Invasion of the malarial {{parasite}} into a vector mosquito {{begins when}} the motile ookinete transverses the gut epithelium. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> that may mediate this invasive process {{have not been}} identified to date. We found that a molecule with an adhesive protein–like structure was expressed in the ookinete of Plasmodium berghei. This protein is structurally homologous to circumsporozoite <b>protein</b> and thrombospondin-related <b>adhesive</b> <b>protein</b> (TRAP) -related protein, CTRP, of Plasmodium falciparum. We named it P. berghei CTRP (PbCTRP) and report here its structure and manner of expression. PbCTRP has six integrin I region–like domains and seven thrombospondin-like domains in its putative extracellular region. This structure {{is similar to that}} of CTRP and TRAPs of malaria sporozoite. The putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of PbCTRP, CTRP, and TRAP also have conserved amino acid sequences. PbCTRP is produced at least 10 h after fertilization when zygotes begin transformation to ookinetes. In the mature ookinete, PbCTRP is located mainly in the anterior cytoplasm. The staining pattern was also similar to TRAP in the sporozoite. We suggest that PbCTRP may play a role in ookinete invasive motility and belongs to a protein family together with TRAP and other structurally related proteins of apicomplexan parasites...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{procedure}} that detects <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> in complex mixtures {{was used to}} characterize such proteins in plasma. The proteins are separated by SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Cells incubated on these filters attach to those <b>proteins</b> that have <b>adhesive</b> properties. When applied to human plasma proteins this procedure reveals, in addition to fibronectin, a cell-attachment protein with a polypeptide molecular weight of 70, 000. Using a monoclonal antibody that inhibits attachment of cells to fibronectin, we show that this polypeptide is not a fragment of fibronectin and we present evidence {{that it is a}} component of the serum spreading factor. Therefore, as defined by our assay, this protein and fibronectin are the major attachment proteins for fibroblastic cells in plasma or serum...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSea stars rely on {{epidermal}} secretions to {{cope with}} their benthic life. Their integument produces a mucus, which represents the first barrier against invaders; and their tube feet produce adhesive secretions to pry open mussels and attach strongly but temporarily to rocks. In this study, we combined high-throughput sequencing of expressed mRNA and mass-spectrometry-based identification of proteins to establish the first proteome of mucous and adhesive secretions from the sea star Asterias rubens. We show that the two secretions differ significantly, the major <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> being only present in trace amounts in the mucus secretion. Except for 41 proteins which were present in both secretions, a total of 34 and 244 proteins were identified as specific of adhesive secretions and mucus, respectively. We discuss the role {{of some of these}} proteins in the adhesion of sea stars as well as in their protection against oxygen reactive species and microorganisms. In addition, 58 % of the <b>proteins</b> identified in <b>adhesive</b> secretions did not present significant similarity to other known proteins, revealing a list of potential novel sea star <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> uncharacterized so far. The panel of proteins identified in this study offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of sea star-inspired biomimetic materials...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological and Agricultural EngineeringDonghai WangCurrently, the {{majority}} of adhesives used for wood veneer, plywood, and composite applications are formaldehyde-based. Formaldehyde is derived from petroleum and natural gas, making it non-renewable and toxic. Therefore, extensive {{research has been conducted}} to develop bio-based adhesives to replace formaldehyde-based <b>adhesives.</b> Soy <b>protein</b> has shown great potential to partially replace formaldehyde <b>adhesives,</b> and canola <b>protein</b> has similar properties to soy protein. However, little research has been conducted on the feasibility of using canola <b>protein</b> for wood <b>adhesive</b> applications. The objective of this research was to study the adhesion performance of canola protein. Canola protein was modified with different chemical modifiers including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), calcium carbonate (CaCO[subscript] 3), zinc sulfate (ZnSO[subscript] 4), calcium chloride (CaCl[subscript] 2), and 2 -octen- 1 -ylsuccinic anhydride (OSA) as well as combined chemical modifications. The wet, dry, and soak shear strengths of the adhesive formulations were determined. Viscosity testing, differential scanning calorimetry, and TEM and SEM imaging were used to characterize protein properties. Chemical modification with SDS (1 %, 3 %, and 5 %), CaCO[subscript] 3 (1 %, 3 %, and 5 %), ZnSO[subscript] 4 (1 %), and OSA (2 %, 3. 5 %, and 5 %) improved the dry and soak shear strengths compared to unmodified canola protein. Canola protein modified with 3. 5 % OSA had improved wet, dry, and soak shear strengths. Combined chemical modification of canola protein did not show significant improvement on shear strength. Thermal modification of canola <b>protein</b> <b>adhesives</b> showed a trend of increasing shear strength with increasing press temperature. The data suggests that with further research, canola protein has potential {{to be used as a}} commercial adhesive or as an additive to formaldehyde-based adhesives to make them more environmentally-friendly...|$|R
40|$|Epiretinal and subretinal {{membranes}} are fibrocellular proliferations {{which form}} on the surfaces of the neuroretina as a sequel {{to a variety of}} ocular diseases. When these proliferations complicate rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (a condition known as proliferative vitreoretinopathy or PVR), the membranes often contain numerous retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and a variety of extracellular proteins. The extracellular <b>proteins</b> include <b>adhesive</b> <b>proteins</b> like collagen, laminin and fibronectin. In addition, several matricellular proteins with potential counter-adhesive functions are present in the membranes. Two such matricellular proteins, thrombospondin 1 and osteonectin (or SPARC: Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine), tend to be codistributed with the RPE cells in PVR membranes. By virtue of their counter-adhesive properties, thrombospondin 1 and SPARC may reduce RPE cell-matrix adhesion and so permit key RPE cellular activities (for example, migration or shape change) in periretinal membrane development. Furthermore, within a 'cocktail' containing other proteins such as the metalloproteinases and growth factors like the scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor family, matricellular proteins {{may play a role in}} the RPE cell dissociation from Bruch's membrane, which characterises early PVR. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
