A batch {{process for the}} <b>production</b> <b>of</b> a low-volume, high value active pharmaceutical ingredient, developed at Sanofi (France), {{has been used as}} a case study. With the scale of 100 kg/y and a product price of a few thousands Euros per kilogram, also following a general trend in pharmaceutical industry, this process is supposed to be an ideal candidate for continuous, modular plant <b>production</b> <b>of</b> a highly <b>potent</b> <b>drug.</b> It was aimed to keep the learning gathered generic, i. e. to stand for the whole class of similarly produced drugs. The impact of various chemical process parameters on the overall production costs has been investigated and process performance represented in terms of operation time, waste and resource usage as the main process metrics. Five optimized and intensified scenarios were compared to the reference case operated at a Sanofi site: intensified reaction, continuous processing, alternative catalysts, change of solvent, change in the purification sequence, recovery of the key product, and intensified drying option. The analysis has shown that, under the assumptions used, an intensified millireactor based process with a subsequent continuous post-processing brings the most benefits in terms of cost, while its process performance, although equal or slightly better than batch, still can be optimized. The total product cost is then reduced for 35 %, while the operating time is 27 % lower than the base case, with 47 % less labor needed compared to the reference case. First studies on ecological impact by University of Jena confirm these promising findings and are presented in outlines herein; with an own paper on respective details to follow.

40|$|Abstract: Neurodegeneration {{is a huge}} {{socioeconomic}} and humanistic problem which {{occurs as a result}} of neuronal cell death i. e. Apoptosis, which involves the activation of caspase enzyme by Apaf- 1 in the presence of Cytochrome c and dATP. Recruitment of procaspase 9 to Apaf- 1 is mediated by the presence of Caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs). In order to block or inhibit the apoptotic pathway that occurs during the neurodegenerative diseases, the interaction between Apaf- 1 CARD and procaspase 9 was exploited. These findings that blocking the caspase activation and recruitment domain will result in Neuro-protection, helped in the designing <b>of</b> <b>potent</b> <b>drugs</b> that competitively interact with Apaf- 1 CARD and do not allow the cleavage of procaspase 9 to yield its biologically active form i. e. caspase 9. Thereby no neuronal degradation will occur. The spontaneous interaction between the receptor- Apaf- 1 and its natural ligand- procaspase 9 and also its interaction with its synthetic ligand, which can be exploited as the <b>potent</b> <b>drug</b> for neurodegeneration, were analyzed using several bioinformatics systems. Therefore, in the coming years, the compound can be exploited as a <b>potent</b> <b>drug</b> in order to obtain a reliable therapy for neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R

In this contribution, a collection of naturally-occurring abietane-type diterpenes and their derivatives was tested against S. aureus biofilms using a platform consisting of two phenotypic assays that have been previously published by our group. Three active compounds were identified: nordehydroabietylamine (1), (+) -dehydroabietic acid (2) and (+) -dehydroabietylamine (3) that prevented biofilm formation in the low micromolar range, and unlike typical antibiotics, only 2 to 4 -fold higher concentrations were needed to significantly reduce viability and biomass of existing biofilms.
