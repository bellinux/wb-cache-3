During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross maternity home, before becoming the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for a number of years. It became the location of the Police Staff College in 1960, and was later home to the European <b>Police</b> <b>College.</b> As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate.
