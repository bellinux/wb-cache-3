30|$|Lichens were {{inventoried}} {{on each of}} {{the selected}} trees within established sampling heights based on three height categories: (1) base (forest floor to 0.3 m up the stem), (2) bole (0.3 m to 2.4 m, or up to the lowest live branch within the tree canopy), and (3) canopy (defined as the lowest live branch, excluding epicormic sprouts). Measurement of lichens on the base and bole sections of the stem were accomplished from the ground, whereas canopy samples were either collected from the ground with a <b>pole</b> <b>saw</b> or required climbing equipment to excise the selected branch. Lichen thalli were identified and recorded in the field within each sampling interval. Voucher specimens for each species identified on a plot were collected. Vouchers were later examined in the lab using compound and dissecting microscopes, chemical spot test, and thin layer chromatography when appropriate. All vouchers were deposited in the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, New York, USA. In addition to abundance (counts for a given species within a sampling height), cover was also visually estimated in the field for each lichen taxon recorded. Cover was placed into five groups as follows: 1 (1 % to 5 %), 2 (6 % to 25 %), 3 (26 % to 50 %), 4 (51 % to 75 %), and 5 (76 % to 100 %). An estimate of total lichen cover for each sampling interval was also made independent of those for the individual taxa. For the purposes of assessing growth form and reproductive mode, a table of all species found during the study was produced and these characters were scored for all taxa using existing references and standard literature. This resulted in the assignment of a growth form (i.e., crustose, foliose, fruticose) and reproductive mode (asexual vs. sexual) to each taxon.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{relative}} pre-commercial thinning costs have increased, {{as a proportion of}} total silvicultural costs, and the annual area treated with pre-commercial thinning has decreased, partly because stands are denser and the development of tools has been slow compared to advances in tools for other forestry measures, calling for new methods and techniques to be developed. Reducing competition by topping secondary stems might be an attractive alternative to traditional pre-commercial thinning for biological, technical and financial reasons. However, the topped secondary stems must not overtop the main stems and should not present obstacles {{at the time of the}} first commercial thinning. Topping, i. e. top-cutting or top-breaking of secondary stems, was tested in birch (Betula sp.) stands with the background that increased competition from topped secondary stems may promote higher quality in the main stems and that topped secondary stems might die and disappear by the time of the first commercial thinning as a result of treatment. Furthermore, growth of the topped birch stems was studied after treatment in different seasons. Motor-manual equipment for topping and a mechanised prototype were tested in an experimental rig and the mechanised prototype was also tested in a field experiment. All tools were compared with a conventional brush saw, regarding both time requirements and quality of work. Results indicated that topping, especially at a higher level above ground leading to a smaller height lead for the main stems, gave a significant increase in main stem quality of birch, compared to traditional pre-commercial thinning. Secondary stems showed higher survival after topping compared to traditional pre-commercial thinning, but topping at a lower level above ground gave lower survival than topping at a higher level. No differences in growth or survival were detected between top-cut and top-broken stems over three years and survival and height growth was lower for stems treated in a growing condition compared to stems treated earlier in the year. Despite having a significantly less powerful engine, a motor-manual <b>pole</b> <b>saw</b> prototype designed to be used for topping was a competitive alternative to the brush saw in terms of both time consumption and damage to the residual stand. The mechanised prototype seemed to be a competitive alternative in high diameter and dense stands. Although the quality of work obtained with the mechanised prototype was equally high to the quality obtained with the brush saw, the results regarding time requirements for the mechanised prototype from the experimental study could not be verified in field experiments, resulting in a faster operation under field conditions with the brush saw irrespective of type of stand. It was also concluded that current standards for time requirements for brush saws might need to be revised, and that the height/diameter ratio might have an important influence on the time requirements for both motor-manual and mechanised pre-commercial thinning tools. Topping seemed to be an attractive alternative to traditional pre-commercial thinning. However, further studies with varying initial and remaining stand density, stand height, species composition and tests of other possible advantages, e. g. reduced browsing pressure on main stems and reduced time requirements for mechanised tools when the cutting height can be raised above obstacles, should be performed. Tools for topping could be developed that would give equal or better results with respect to both quality and costs compared to the traditional brush saw. Mechanised equipment for pre-commercial thinning that can give acceptable results in terms of quality of work are available, but further development is needed in order to lower time requirements...|$|E

40|$|Taper {{functions}} are required in modern forest management in {{estimation of the}} end forest products, to be classified for their life time in the environment. Based on a sample of 1640 trees of 10 species measured in volume, biomass and taper project on Mexicos northern temperate, mixed, uneven-aged coniferous forests, 12 stem profile taper functions were fitted in order to select the equation that provides better diameter estimates at commercial tree height. Although several equations fitted better specific tree species, the Newnham (1990) equation consistently yielded better diameter estimates at any length of the stem for all studied species. The confidence intervals on the Newnham (1990) equation parameters showed that each species has an unique stem profile and, therefore, single parameter equations are reported. Because of lack of analytical integration, the recommended taper equation (when numerically integrated) provided compatible, unbiased total bole volume when contrasted to conventional timber volume assessments.
