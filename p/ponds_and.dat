5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. <b>Ponds</b> <b>and</b> lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{have been}} {{recognized}} {{as a source of}} beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in cave art, being raised as ornamental fish in <b>ponds,</b> <b>and</b> displayed in aquariums in homes, offices, or public settings.|$|E

5|$|Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found {{throughout}} almost all countries of South America except Chile. They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, <b>ponds,</b> <b>and</b> marshes, {{as well as}} flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} dragonfly populations across the world, {{for example in}} Japan. Over 60% of Japan's wetlands {{were lost in the}} 20th century, so its dragonflies now depend largely on rice fields, <b>ponds,</b> <b>and</b> creeks. Dragonflies feed on pest insects in rice, acting as a natural pest control. Dragonflies are steadily declining in Africa, and represent a conservation priority.|$|E
5|$|Habitat types include polar, temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical. The terrestrial {{vegetation type}} may be forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. Fresh water habitats include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> estuaries, and marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, reefs, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents.|$|E

5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.|$|E

The center of the island is mountainous, and the western end is barren and vegetation is sparse.|$|E

5|$|The ice trade {{began in}} 1806 {{as the result}} of the efforts of Frederic Tudor, a New England entrepreneur, to export ice on a {{commercial}} basis. In New England, ice was an expensive product, consumed only by the wealthy who could afford their own ice houses. Nonetheless, icehouses were relatively common amongst the wealthier members of society by 1800, filled with ice cut, or harvested, from the frozen surface of <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> streams on their local estates during the winter months. Around the neighbouring New York City area, the hot summers and rapidly growing economy had begun to increase local demand for ice towards the end of the 18th century, creating a small-scale market amongst farmers who sold ice from their <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> streams to local city institutions and families. Some ships occasionally transported ice from New York and Philadelphia for sale to the southern U.S. states, in particular Charleston in South Carolina, laying it down as ballast on the trip.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{started with}} the {{harvesting}} of ice from <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> rivers during the winter, to be stored for the summer months ahead. Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C). Ice needed {{to be at least}} 18inches (0.46 m) thick to be harvested, as it needed to support the weight of the workers and horses and be suitable for cutting into large blocks. In New England, <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear crystal ice, typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could be harvested from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|E

5|$|The oldest beds of this {{formation}} {{belong to}} the Dinosaur Canyon Member, a reddish, slope-forming rock layer with thin beds of siltstone that are interbedded with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.|$|E
5|$|The temple itself {{consists}} of several large prayer halls and pavilions for assembly and prayer, statues of Buddha; various Bodhisattvas {{as well as}} Chinese gods are being venerated.

Fish <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> flower gardens {{are also part of}} the temple complex.|$|E
5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation salamanders breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation salamanders breed in spring and early summer. In the higher climates especially, salamanders will enter <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause {{abrasion}} damage to pumps and block pipes, settling <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> open filters. High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with disinfection treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate. It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E
5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills.
