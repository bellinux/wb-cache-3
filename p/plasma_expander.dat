5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in cross-country skiing {{have chosen to}} enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood <b>plasma</b> <b>expander</b> usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E

A case of a 64 -year-old male undergoing elective prostatectomy, who develops severe anaphylaxis and urticaria, 30 minutes following gelofusine infusion, is presented in this report.

50|$|After severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically {{known as}} plasma expanders, {{can be given}} intravenously, either {{solutions}} of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal solutions, such as dextrans, human serum albumin, or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a <b>plasma</b> <b>expander</b> is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with severe}} {{bleeding}} are often treated with colloids as plasma replacement fluids, including dextrans, gelatin-based solutions, or starches. Many of these agents {{will affect the}} hemostatic system beyond their effect on hemodilution. Obviously, the ensuing impairment of coagulation is not desirable in patients with major blood loss. However, there is considerable controversy whether the anticoagulant effects of the various compounds will truly translate into clinically relevant effects, such as increased blood loss or, even more importantly, transfusion requirements, the need for surgical (re) exploration, organ dysfunction, or mortality. In this overview, we discuss the effects of various plasma replacement solutions on the coagulation system and review the controlled clinical studies with different <b>plasma</b> <b>expanders</b> on clinically significant end points. We conclude that most <b>plasma</b> <b>expanders</b> have indeed marked effects at various points in the hemostatic system {{and that there are}} significant differences between various plasma replacement fluids but that clinically relevant effects on bleeding are mostly present if large volumes (i. e., > 1. 5 L) are infused or if the patient has a concomitant or preexistent hemostatic impairmen...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the risks}} and costs of blood and blood product infusion, {{developing}} blood and plasma substitutes is of significance. Two currently utilized substances, dextran and hydroxyethyl starch, are effective colloid <b>plasma</b> <b>expanders.</b> The dextrans have properties that improve microcirculatory blood flow but are associated with several possible adverse effects. Hydroxyethyl starch is a well-tolerated agent that has efficacy similar to albumin but at a lower cost.

The scandal also affected five other Finnish skiers, including Jari Isometsä and Harri Kirvesniemi. Myllylä received a two-year suspension from the FIS as a result.

40|$|The {{development}} of volume replacement fluids for resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock comprises oxygen carrying and non carrying fluids. Non oxygen carrying fluids or <b>plasma</b> <b>expanders</b> are used {{up to the}} transfusion trigger, and upon reaching this landmark either blood, and possibly {{in the near future}} oxygen carrying blood substitutes, are used. An experimental program in hemorrhagic shock using the hamster chamber window model allowed to compare the relative performance of most fluids proposed for shock resuscitation. This model allows investigating simultaneously the microcirculation and systemic reactions, in the awake condition, in a tissue isolated from the environment. Results from this program show that in general <b>plasma</b> <b>expanders</b> such as Ringer's lactate and dextran 70 kDa do not sufficiently restore blood viscosity upon reaching the transfusion trigger, causing microvascular collapse. This is in part restored by a blood transfusion, independently of the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells. These results lead to the proposal that effective blood substitutes must be designed to prevent microvascular collapse, manifested in the decrease of functional capillary density. Achievement of this goal, in combination with the increase of oxygen affinity, significantly postpones the need for a blood transfusion, and lowers the total requirement of restoration of intrinsic oxygen carrying capacity...|$|R

40|$|Peptide receptor-mediated {{radiotherapy}} of neuroendocrine {{and other}} somatostatin receptor-positive tumors with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs {{has been applied}} in several experimental settings. The kidneys are the organs responsible for dose-limiting toxicity attributable to the retention of radiolabeled octreotide in the renal cortex, leading to a relatively high radiation dose that may result in irreversible loss of kidney function. The administration of basic amino acids reduces renal uptake but does have significant side effects. We observed that gelatin-based plasma expanders induced tubular low-molecular-weight proteinuria in healthy volunteers, suggesting that components in these solutions can interfere with the tubular reabsorption of proteins and peptides. Here, we studied the effects of infusion of low doses of the <b>plasma</b> <b>expander</b> succinylated gelatin (GELO) on the renal uptake of 111 In-labeled octreotide (111 In-OCT). METHODS: Five healthy volunteers were given 111 In-OCT, first in combination with normal saline and 2 wk later in combination with GELO. Scintigraphic images of the kidneys as well as blood and urine samples were analyzed. To exclude a nonspecific hemodynamic effect of the <b>plasma</b> <b>expander,</b> the procedure was repeated with 5 other volunteers who received the carbohydrate-based <b>plasma</b> <b>expander</b> hydroxyethyl starch (HES). RESULTS: Low doses of GELO were able to effectively reduce the kidney retention of 111 In-OCT. The renal radiation dose was significantly reduced by 45 % +/- 10 % (mean +/- SD) (P = 0. 006), whereas HES showed no significant effect (0 % +/- 12 %). The infusion of GELO did not cause any side effects. CONCLUSION: GELO effectively reduces the renal uptake of 111 In-OCT.
