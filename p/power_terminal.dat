Based on the laminated bus-bar of a three-phase inverter in the electric vehicles that consists of asymmetrical parallel branches, this paper investigates the transient current imbalance sharing caused by the asymmetrical stray inductance in the parallel branches of the bus-bar from the view of energy storing and releasing of stray inductance for the first time. Besides, the partial self-inductance and mutual-inductance model of the parallel branches is set up.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} multiple aspects related to how fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> units (FPTU), {{as used in}} variable air volume systems, behave under as-built conditions. Whether this behavior conforms to accepted industry norms and expectations and how existing energy simulation tools react {{to a variety of}} input extremes based on program ?defaults? and ?rules of thumb?. The efforts by the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute to update existing energy models of FPTU?s raised the issue of quantifying the static pressure rise observed across FPTU?s. This study has corroborated existing laboratory results with in-situ ?field? measurements ranging between 0. 2 in. w. g. (50 Pa) to 0. 27 in. w. g. (67. 2 Pa). The in-situ measurements were expanded to include qualitative analyses of series and parallel FPTU leakage. The study demonstrated ? through observing temperature differences between the surround plenum and fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> unit induction port ? that there is no significant evidence of series FPTU leakage, while a single parallel FPTU was observed to have leaked. Coupling that data set with infrared (IR) images captured of pressurized parallel fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> units (usually considered normal operating conditions for parallel FPTU?s) showing evidence of leakage along the FPTU ?seams?, induction port and interface connections. The in-situ measurement also determined that ?field? FPTU?s operate under lower downstream static pressure conditions than those set by AHRI/ANSI 880. Ranging from 0. 0417 in. w. g. (10. 4 Pa) to 0. 1014 in. w. g. (25. 2 Pa). Previous research efforts independently quantified the two major inputs EnergyPlus requires to simulate fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> units (static pressure rise across the FPTU and motor efficiency). This study was expanded and aimed to determine which combination of the two inputs ? either within the quantified parameters or a combination of more extreme cases ? contributed to observable differences in energy consumption. The study concluded that the overall energy consumed by the simulated system does not change significantly, an observed difference of 2. 3 % annually between the greater extremes...|$|R

In this paper, we present a technique to compute approximately the state variables of a synchronous generator, purely from terminal measurements.

The method assumes the availablity of the measurements: real and reactive <b>power,</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage, and the field current.

40|$|Measurement of device current during {{switching}} characterisation of an {{insulated gate}} bipolar transistor (IGBT) requires a current sensor with low insertion impedance and high bandwidth. This study presents an experimental procedure {{for evaluating the}} performance of a coaxial current transformer (CCT), designed for the above purpose. A prototype CCT, which can be mounted directly on a <b>power</b> <b>terminal</b> of a 1200 V/ 50 A half-bridge IGBT module, is characterised experimentally. The measured characteristics include insertion impedance, gain and phase of the CCT at different frequencies. The bounds of linearity within which the CCT can operate without saturation are determined theoretically, and are also verified experimentally. The experimental study on linearity of the CCT requires a high-amplitude current source. A proportional-resonant (PR) controller-based current-controlled half-bridge inverter is developed for this purpose. A systematic procedure for selection of PR controller parameters is also reported in this study. This set-up is helpful to determine the limit of linearity and also to measure the frequency response of the CCT at realistic amplitudes of current in the low-frequency range...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Gait {{alterations}} {{of chronic}} knee arthritis {{before and after}} injection of local anesthesia was measured in the orthopedist’s office area. A portable gait analyzer {{was used to evaluate}} gait characteristics before and after injection of local anesthesia in the chronically arthritic knee. Gait was analyzed during a 400 -meter walk. Overall velocity and cadence increased 3. 3 % (p = 0. 016) and 2. 8 % (p = 0. 005). In-stance phase single and double support time (SLS and DLS) reduced 1. 3 % (p = 0. 003) and 3. 8 % (p = 0. 028). The ratio of SLS/DLS increased confirming a relatively increased duration in SLS {{as a percentage of the}} overall gait cycle. In swing phase the pulling power (initial swing), swing <b>power</b> (<b>terminal</b> swing) and ground impact increased 10. 3 % (p < 0. 001), 6. 8 % (p = 0. 003), and 4. 2 % (p = 0. 003). Patients demonstrated fatigability at the end of walking measured as diminished velocity. Fatigability decreased after injection of the arthritic knee. The study demonstrates the specific gait phase changes afforded by injection of local anesthesia into the chronically arthritic knee. This study may serve as a benchmark for the measure of possible improvements afforded by different therapy for the patient suffering from chronic knee arthritis...|$|E
