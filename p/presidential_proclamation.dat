5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention {{as a serious}} threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a <b>presidential</b> <b>proclamation</b> denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a <b>Presidential</b> <b>Proclamation</b> established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Presidential</b> <b>proclamations</b> {{are often}} {{dismissed}} as a practical tool for policy making because they {{are considered to be}} largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature. The administrative weight of these proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them [...] "delegated unilateral powers". Their issuances have on occasion led to important political and historical consequences {{in the development of the}} United States. George Washington's Proclamation of Neutrality in 1793 and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 are some of America's most famous <b>presidential</b> <b>proclamations</b> in this regard.

5|$|On September 16, {{shortly after}} he {{announced}} the Nixon pardon, Ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada, and for military deserters, in <b>Presidential</b> <b>Proclamation</b> 4313. The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service {{for those who had}} served less than two years of honorable service in the military. The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential Pardon and a change in Military discharge status. Full pardon for draft dodgers came in the Carter Administration.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2015 {{wilderness}} designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains {{were part}} of the largest unprotected roadless area in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of Congressional action that would designate the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a national monument by <b>presidential</b> <b>proclamation</b> under the Antiquities Act. Former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne initially studied the area for national monument status, but did not recommend it because Congressional action seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving increased attention when President Obama indicated he would designate a national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed wilderness areas, such as through the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} on unilateral presidential actions has recast {{our understanding of}} modern presidential policy mak-ing. However, our knowledge on this issue remains incomplete. In this article, the authors expand {{the literature on the}} unilateral presidency by exploring <b>presidential</b> <b>proclamations</b> from 1977 to 2005 (Presidents Carter to Bush) and iden-tifying the importance of these tools as a policy-making instrument in expanding presidential power. By carefully examining the use of <b>presidential</b> <b>proclamations,</b> the authors discover that a majority of <b>presidential</b> <b>proclamations</b> involve <b>presidential</b> authority under congressionally delegated powers of international trade (and presidents most often use this authority to propose new trade arrangements or modify existing trade agreements), and they use this power in coordination with (but largely independent of) Congress. Presidents also use proclamations on the issue of national parks and federal lands exclusively to initiate new federal arrangements to establish new national parks or protections for federal lands, often against the will of Congress...|$|R
