40|$|Total fat {{and salt}} {{contents}} are crucial factors for the nutritional quality of nuts. In the last years, {{several studies have}} reported the importance of nuts consumption to promote health benefits, especially those related with the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to compare the total fat and salt contents of 21 samples of natural and <b>processed</b> <b>nuts</b> (walnuts, pistachios, broad beans, corn, hazelnuts, cashews, almonds, peanuts and mixtures of different nuts). Natural nuts have nothing added, while processed have honey, salt and/or other ingredients. The selected nuts were analysed regarding their moisture, fat and salt contents. Moisture content was determined by gravimetric method. For total fat, acid hydrolysis followed by Soxhlet extraction with petroleum ether was used, while for salt determination Charpentier-Volhard’s titration was performed. The results are expressed in g/ 100 g of edible portion. Total fat content varied between 12. 3 ± 0. 3 and 72. 9 ± 0. 3 g/ 100 g, for corn and walnuts, respectively. With respect to salt content a range from 0. 0291 ± 0. 0 (natural walnuts) to 2. 65 ± 0. 0 g/ 100 g (pistachio) was obtained. The analysed natural nuts presented the lowest salt content (0. 0291 – 0. 105 g/ 100 g). World Health Organization recommends a daily salt intake below 5 g. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to increase the variety of natural nuts available in the market, since these have much lower contents of salt than the <b>processed</b> <b>nuts,</b> and at the same time provide significant amounts of unsaturated fatty acids.

The {{purpose of this}} research was to study the application of radio frequency (RF) energy in dehydration of in-shell Macadamia nuts and shorten the lengthy process times needed in conventional hot air drying operations. A pilot scale 27. 12 -MHz and 6 -kW RF system was used to determine the operational parameters, the drying curve, and the quality attributes of the <b>processed</b> <b>nuts.</b> The results showed that an electrode gap of 15. 5 cm and a hot air temperature of 50 °C provided an acceptable heating rate and stable sample temperatures, and were used for further drying tests. The drying curves showed an exponential decay and required 750 and 360 min to achieve the final moisture content of 0. 030 kg water/kg dry solid (3. 0 % dry basis) in whole nuts in hot air drying and RF heating/hot air combined drying, respective-ly. The drying kinetics of the nuts were described well by the Page model for hot air drying, but a logarithmic model was more suited for RF/hot air drying. Peroxide value and free fatty acid increased with the drying time both for hot air and RF drying but remained within acceptable range re-quired by the nut industry.

The world production of cashew raw nuts reached 4. 27 million tons in 2011. Vietnam is the top producer of raw nuts, and India is the first processor and exporter of <b>processed</b> <b>nuts.</b> The cashew market is expected to remain strong due to the high growth of production in some areas such as West Africa. For instance, a 40  % production increase has been observed in Nigeria over the last 5  years.

Cashew production is potentially a major value for smallholder farmers from emerging countries. Despite the relevance of cashew production on the international markets {{and the potential for}} boosting rural development and reducing poverty, a complete review on cashew is missing. Therefore, we review here the cashew production chain. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) several management practices, processing methods, and uses of products and by-products are published; (2) however, there is still a lack of knowledge due to a scattered research framework lacking integrated research programs; (3) smallholder farmers face major constraints limiting the development of cashew sector locally, ranging from difficult access to good planting material and training to lack of investment for innovating processing facilities; (4) among them, women, that account for up to 95  % of the workforce in the sector, receive lower wages and are subject to worse working conditions...|$|E
40|$|When the European Union {{decided in}} 2000 to allow {{chocolate}} to contain up to 5 % vegetal fats other than cocoa butter, shea butter was proclaimed as a promising substitute. Two years later, {{this has not}} happened. Palm oil, though of lesser quality, is taking over shea s promised place as a cocoa butter equivalent (CBE). What went wrong with shea rightly called women s white gold ? Shea butter is extracted from {{the fruits of the}} shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa, also known as Butryospermum paradoxum) which grows in the southern Sahelian zone, from Senegal in the west to Uganda and Sudan in eastern Africa. On average, one tree produces 15 to 20 kg of fruits, yielding 1. 5 kg of butter. <b>Processed</b> <b>nuts</b> fetch in general one and a half times more 200 /t) than the raw ones. Harvesting from the wild and processing the butter is done mainly by women. The butter is processed into cooking oil and consumed locally or exported as the basis for cosmetics or fat in foodstuffs. The downside is that the shea tree is hard to domesticate, starts bearing fruit only after 15 to 20 years and has a fluctuating yield. The combination of unreliable and small supply with low purchasing prices on intermediate trade markets has meant that shea has not become a strong CBE. Of the estimated total production of 1. 7 million t, only 65, 000 t is exported as a CBE and 3, 000 t for cosmetics. There is room for improvement if producers can organise themselves to guarantee a stable supply and establish direct links with such markets as the cocoa and cosmetics industries. In Burkina Faso, the UN fund for women (UNIFEM) has mediated a deal between producers and L Occitane, a French firm, which now buys directly from the Union des Groupements Kiswendsida (UGK). In 2001, L Occitane bought 60 t of butter directly from UGK, an umbrella organisation for 100 shea-producing women s groups.

40|$|Abstract. Drying of Cashew nut {{to remove}} testa {{is one of}} the most {{energy-intensive}} <b>processes</b> of cashew <b>nut</b> <b>process</b> industry. For this reason a hybrid dryer consisting of a solar flat plate collector, a biomass heater and a drying chamber is designed and fabricated. 40 kg of Cashew nut with initial moisture of 9 % is used in the experiment. The performance test of the dryer is carried out in two modes of operation: hybrid-forced convection and hybrid-natural convection. Drying time and drying efficiency during these two modes of operation are estimated and compared with the sun drying. The system is capable of attaining drying temperature between 50 º and 70 ºC. In the hybrid forced drying, the required moisture content of 3 % is achieved within 7 hours and the average system efficiency is estimated as 5. 08 %. In the hybrid natural drying, the required moisture content is obtained in 9 hours and the average system efficiency is 3. 17 %. The fuel consumption during the drying process is 0. 5 kg/hr and 0. 75 kg/hr for forced mode and natural mode, respectively. The drying process in the hybrid forced mode of operation is twice faster than the sun drying. The dryer can be operated in any climatic conditions: as a solar dryer on normal sunny days, as a biomass dryer at night time and as a hybrid dryer on cloudy days. Based on the experimental study, it is concluded that the developed hybrid dryer is suitable for small scale cashew nut farmers in rural areas of developing countries...|$|R
