5|$|December 2010 - A report, {{commissioned}} by outgoing Governor Lingle, is released which warns the <b>project</b> <b>could</b> {{cost at least}} $1.7billion more than the city’s projected $5.5billion price tag.|$|E
5|$|However, {{before work}} on this <b>project</b> <b>could</b> commence, NIPI ran out of money, was forced into bankruptcy, and was {{dissolved}} in 1989.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. In particular, the Manhattan <b>Project</b> <b>could</b> benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally intended}} to have Diamonds Are Forever re-create commercially successful aspects of Goldfinger, including hiring its director, Guy Hamilton. Peter R. Hunt, who had directed On Her Majesty's Secret Service and worked in all previous Bond films as editor, was invited before Hamilton, but due to involvement with another <b>project</b> <b>could</b> only work on the film if the production date was postponed, which the producers declined to do.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the <b>project</b> <b>could</b> begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, in an {{interview}} given to the French weekly magazine Air et Cosmos, Jean-Charles Marcos, CEO of Akka Research, explained that once developed and marketed the Air-Cobot should cost between 100,000 and 200,000 euros. He could meet civilian needs in nondestructive testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the <b>project</b> <b>could</b> be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile platform for the lower parts, and a drone for the upper parts. If funding is allocated then this second phase would take place during the period 2017–2020.|$|E
50|$|Recently, Sri Lanka {{has become}} one of the {{countries}} exporting fair trade tea to the UK and other countries. It is believed that such <b>projects</b> <b>could</b> reduce rural poverty.|$|R
50|$|Large {{cooperative}} <b>projects</b> <b>could</b> be endeavored (e.g. Open-source software projects, SETI@home). Communities {{of like-minded}} individuals were formed (e.g. MySpace, Tribe.net). Small regional companies were suddenly {{given access to}} a larger marketplace.|$|R
50|$|All toolchain {{command-line}} switches {{could be}} added to the Project / Settings dialog in Visual Studio. <b>Projects</b> <b>could</b> be generated using custom App wizards, code could be edited, compiled and built in Visual Studio.|$|R
5|$|Mini Metro was {{conceived}} in April 2013 for {{a video game}} development competition, with a prototype version being released freely for web browsers. During the game's conception phase, the developers imposed a set of constraints to limit its scope and ensure the <b>project</b> <b>could</b> reach a finished state. Production of the game continued following the event and an in-development version was released commercially on Linux, OS X, and Windows in August 2014. Mini Metro received its full release on PC platforms in November 2015, and on Android and iOS platforms in October 2016. The game received a positive reception from critics, with praise directed towards its intuitive interface, simple gameplay, and minimalist approach.|$|E
5|$|Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, at Pierce's request, led surveys {{with the}} Corps of Topographical Engineers of {{possible}} transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country. The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements, but Davis felt {{that such a}} <b>project</b> <b>could</b> be justified as a Constitutional national security objective. Davis also deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia, including {{the expansion of the}} United States Capitol and building of the Washington Monument.|$|E
5|$|The colony {{supported}} mostly rain-fed agriculture, {{with limited}} irrigation {{for its first}} 30 years. The only cash crops were nuts gathered close to the railroad between Kayes and Bamako. However, following successful tests of growing Egyptian cotton in West Africa during World War I, Émile Bélime began to campaign {{for the construction of}} a large irrigation system along the Niger river. Starting in 1921, significant irrigation projects around Koulikoro and later at Baguinéda-Camp and the Ségou Cercle began to bring water. The French believed this <b>project</b> <b>could</b> rival the major cotton growing centers of Egypt and the United States.|$|E

5|$|While {{national}} security concerns were {{cited as the}} grounds for rejection, politics {{played an important role}} as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if SNECMA pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this <b>project</b> <b>could</b> be {{the beginning of the end}} of American aerospace leadership.|$|E
5|$|Despite the support, {{the state}} caved {{to some of}} the {{complaints}} of the opposition, resulting in a delay of the project. By November1963, the state told Caroline officials that the design of bridges along NY330 required changing to new state highway standards. The state began working also on assessing property values of the land required for the new position. They stated that unless the state budget could not afford it, the project would begin the process in 1964. Patience ran thin by February1964 with the Caroline town officials, who demanded progress from the state, who stated that the <b>project</b> <b>could</b> not move forward until there was funding. By November1964, the state admitted nothing would happen until at least 1965, two years behind schedule. This time, the construction would be delayed due to delays in acquiring land and personnel.|$|E
5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy <b>Project</b> <b>could</b> be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for water and power is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E

50|$|The thesis which {{followed}} an independent (although supervised) research project had officially {{to be completed}} in not more than 3 to 9 months (depending on subject and university). However, the actual time students worked on these <b>projects</b> <b>could</b> again exceed the official duration by several months.|$|R
5|$|Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford {{proposals}} faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was {{an eastern}} bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; {{pass to the}} east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT's preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and a revelation that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not build on the path of the proposed bypass. In response to the payment scheme, Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the <b>project</b> <b>could</b> resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the MillsboroSouth area.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the <b>project</b> <b>could</b> be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E
