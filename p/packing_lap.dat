50|$|Albert started {{very quickly}} with Štybar right behind him. However halfway round the first lap Albert was already alone while Štybar {{got caught up}} by the <b>pack.</b> A <b>lap</b> later Pauwels had left the others and was gaining on Albert, but never {{actually}} got there. Meanwhile, in the background, the five other Belgian riders were together with Štybar hanging {{at the end of}} that group.|$|R
5000|$|... 1983: The {{rivalry between}} Waltrip and Bobby Allison came through in a {{dramatic}} finish. Allison, two laps down, pushed Dale Earnhardt past Waltrip on the final lap for the win. Waltrip and the Junior Johnson team were upset that Allison was seemingly [...] "blocking" [...] for Earnhardt; Allison claimed he was racing Joe Ruttman, also in the lead <b>pack</b> but <b>laps</b> down, for position.|$|R
50|$|World's Toughest Mudder in 2014 {{was held}} at Lake Las Vegas in Nevada and was a 5-mile course with {{obstacles}} such as a 35-foot drop into a lake {{during the day and}} swimming 300 yards while keeping a torch lit at night. Top finishers in 2014 were Ryan Atkins (19 laps, 95 miles, male solo), Amelia Boone (15 laps, 75 miles, female solo), and Team Wolf <b>Pack</b> (15 <b>laps,</b> 75 miles, team). World's Toughest Mudder 2015 was again held at Lake Las Vegas, with the top finishers being Chad Trammell and Amelia Boone.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she started}} off, holding the <b>pack</b> across her <b>lap,</b> {{and she tried}} the King's several gaits to see which one would lend itself more comfortably to the task before her. The trouble was that Sage King had no slow gait, even his walk was fast. And Lucy was {{compelled}} to hold him into that. She wanted to hurry, but that seemed out of the question. She tried to keep from gazing out toward the monuments, {{because they were so}} far away.|$|R
5000|$|On May 24, 1964, at the World 600 in Charlotte, Roberts had {{qualified}} in {{the eleventh}} position and {{started in the}} middle of the <b>pack.</b> On <b>lap</b> seven, Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson collided and spun out and Roberts crashed trying to avoid them. Roberts' Ford slammed backward into the inside retaining wall, flipped over and burst into flames. Witnesses at the track claimed they heard Roberts screaming, [...] "Ned, help me", from inside his burning car after the wreck. Jarrett rushed to save Roberts as his car was engulfed by the flames. Roberts suffered second- and third-degree burns over eighty percent of his body and was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition. Although it was widely believed that Roberts had an allergic reaction to flame-retardant chemicals, he was secretly an asthmatic, and the chemicals made his breathing worse.|$|R
50|$|The Top 4 drivers — Truex, Jr.; Sadler; Earnhardt, Jr.; and Kyle Busch —were {{able to get}} {{a strong}} start and pull away from the lead pack. Truex, Jr. led until he was passed on the inside by Hamlin on lap 75. Two laps later, Montoya took the lead. He led for one lap before being passed by Earnhardt, Jr., who had a shove from David Stremme. Two laps later, Jimmie Johnson claimed the lead with a shove from Earnhardt, Jr. Johnson led for one lap before being passed by Hamlin. On lap 82, Earnhardt, Jr. and his JR Motorsports driver Brad Keselowski got {{together}} on the back straightaway and went below the yellow line. Though Earnhardt, Jr. was able to blend back into the field, Keselowski ended up losing the draft and fell {{all the way to the}} back of the lead <b>pack.</b> On <b>lap</b> 83, Sam Hornish, Jr. took the lead.|$|R
50|$|Antonio Giovinazzi won {{what was}} a chaotic race after a mid-race {{accident}} shuffled the pack and elevated himself, Raffaele Marciello and Gustav Malja up the <b>pack.</b> On <b>lap</b> 15, a Arthur Pic collided with Sergio Canamasas through the second Lesmo. The pair were racing side-by-side and after barely leaving enough space through the corner, Pic lost control through the corner and counter-steered straight into Canamasas' rear wheel, sending him into a roll. Pic expressed frustration with the incident, although stewards later deemed him to be at fault for the incident - handing him a three-place grid penalty as a consequence. The safety car put Gasly from a comfortable first to fourth and now behind drivers on brand-new tyres. With four laps to go, it was Marciello leading from Giovinazzi and Malja. On the final lap, Giovinazzi benefited {{from the use of}} DRS and passed Marciello to take a home victory from Marciello (thereby making it an Italian one-two) and Malja. As well as this, Luca Ghiotto achieved the fastest lap, completing a successful race for the Italians on home soil.|$|R
5000|$|That {{would all}} {{change as the}} series went back to Pocono. Davey won the pole for the event and led 115 of the first 149 laps. But a lengthy pit stop during a caution flag {{sent him to the}} middle of the <b>pack.</b> On <b>lap</b> 150, Allison was {{charging}} back through the pack, followed closely by Darrell Waltrip. The two cars made contact and Davey went sliding into the grass off Pocono's [...] "tunnel turn". The car went airborne and began a series of violent flips before landing on top of an infield guardrail. Miraculously, Davey survived the crash. He was airlifted to the hospital with a severe concussion, along with a broken arm, wrist, and collar bone. His 33rd-place finish left him nine points behind Bill Elliott for the series title, but that seemed insignificant at the moment. Especially traumatizing was the fact that Pocono was the site of Davey's father Bobby's career-ending crash a few years earlier (see above). In fact, many worried fans wondered if the younger Allison's career was over.|$|R
5000|$|LaMothe {{was one of}} {{a number}} of Haitian runners sent to the Olympic Games by the [...] "Baby Doc" [...] Duvalier regime during the 1970s and 1980s - mostly picked from among Duvalier's {{personal}} friends - who gained notoriety by setting record worst times, many of which are still held. Other such athletes include Anilus Joseph, who started his 1972 10,000 metres qualifying heat too fast, leading the <b>pack</b> for two <b>laps</b> but dropping out with a mile still to run; Wilnor Joseph, whose 800 metres in 1976 took 2:15.26; and Charles Olemus, who ran for over 42 minutes to complete the 1976 10,000 metres race.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{featured}} {{a number of}} surprises and upsets, beginning with {{the withdrawal of the}} defending champion Dibaba due to a leg injury, replaced by Wude Ayalew. The race started awkwardly when the outer alley of the starting group, led by Florence Kiplagat, broke to the inside at the gun. Essentially Masai, Ayalew, Grace Momanyi and the other five runners on the outside who followed Kiplagat ran a course some 14 meters shorter than the twelve runners from the other larger alley. But confused officials did not recall the start or issue any disqualifications for the incident. Still, Inês Monteiro took the early lead with the outer runners falling in behind her. By {{the end of the first}} lap Yukari Sahaku and Yurika Nakamura had emerged as the pacesetters. After a kilometer, the Russian duo of Liliya Shobukhova and Mariya Konovalova took the lead. Konovalova held the point, marked by Nakamura at an even, leisurely pace for this crowd until just after eight laps to go when Linet Masai, who had been hanging around the back of the tight pack made a quick move to the front. All three Ethiopians rushed to mark the move. By the end of the lap, 2007 medallist Abeylegesse dropped out of the race and a quintet of runners ( [...] Masai, Melkamu, Defar, Ayalew and Grace Momanyi) had broken away from the rest of the <b>pack.</b> <b>Lap</b> times dropped from the 75 second average to 71, to 69. But Masai's pace slowed back to 70 then 71. Momanyi came up to take the lead with the Ethiopians changing their focus though Ayalew was struggling to keep on the back behind Masai. After taking the break for a lap, Masai returned to take the lead. As the runners approached the finish line for the bell, favourites Defar and Melkamu sprinted in front. Defar held the lead through the final turn, with Melkamu boxing Masai, neither could completely break away. With clear running room coming off the turn, Masai tried to get her long legs going. She wasn't able to make much progress, nor could Melkamu pass her teammate until Defar began to fade, unable to maintain her speed. Melkamu took the lead. 14 meters out, Masai passed Melkamu. Perhaps not noticing, Melkamu prematurely celebrated but Masai was a meter ahead to take the gold medal with a tactically-timed run. Defar, completely exhausted, eventually finished in fifth as Ayalew sprinted past Momanyi to take the bronze.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of the race, Stoner and Hayden had a battle that lasted many laps with the two pulling away from the chasing <b>pack,</b> trading fast <b>laps</b> between them. Casey Stoner {{gradually}} began to pull away as Hayden's tyres appeared to wear out slightly. Meanwhile Rossi was charging through the midfield, getting up to 8th position after only the first lap. Rossi quickly disposed of a number of riders in the first few laps, but lost vital time while attempting to overtake his teammate Jorge Lorenzo and former SBK champion James Toseland. Rossi was setting fast lap times but his entertaining battle with these two riders meant he was losing time, and all chances of catching Stoner and Hayden who were riding off into the distance were slowly fading.|$|R
50|$|At the lap 147 restart Lowndes {{led from}} Steven Richards and Greg Murphy. Tucked in behind were Max Wilson and James Courtney ahead of Tony D'Alberto, Fabian Coulthard, Warren Luff (about to pit for his penalty), Jason Bright and Luke Youlden. Courtney, on fresh tyres and {{cut through the}} <b>pack</b> and on <b>lap</b> 153 ducked under Max Wilson at Forrests Elbow for fourth place. Murphy, while faster than Richards was unable to get by, {{allowing}} Lowndes to build a comfortable buffer. On lap 158 Murphy finally moved into second position at Hell Corner and set off after Lowndes. Two laps later, Richards, fading badly on rear tyres was unable to stop Courtney move into third place. The gaps stabilised over the final laps and Lowndes took a two-second victory, earning himself and Jamie Whincup their third consecutive victory, a feat not managed since Peter Brock and Larry Perkins took their third consecutive win in the 1984 James Hardie 1000.|$|R

5000|$|Jimmie Johnson, {{racing in}} his 400th career Sprint Cup start, {{was back in}} the field for most of the race. He emerged from the <b>pack</b> with 16 <b>laps</b> to go and seized control with 10 to go, racing past Keselowski on the final restart. [...] A caution with six laps to go for debris bunched up the field, but Johnson held on staving off a last lap charge by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Mark Martin. [...] "I had a lot of {{confidence}} those final few laps, leading the train," [...] Johnson said. [...] "I knew just how fast this car was." [...] Keselowski finished fourth.

[...] She blamed inexperience for the late fall, saying [...] "I didn't know what to do, exactly" [...] in the final scramble. [...] Johnson, however, said that Patrick looked [...] "really comfortable" [...] all race. [...] "She held a great wheel, was smooth, took advantage of runs when she had them." ...|$|R
50|$|From {{the gun in}} the final, the two Japanese runner Misaki Onishi then Ayuko Suzuki {{took the}} pace out at a serious level, the women running the same pace as the {{pedestrian}} men's race through the first 2,000. After her 1500 metres win and world record, all eyes were clearly on Genzebe Dibaba. On the first lap Dibaba went {{to the back of}} the <b>pack.</b> After a <b>lap</b> she decided to move in behind the Japanese runners. Instantly she was marked by world leader Almaz Ayana. Three laps into the race, it was a string of African runners behind the Japanese, with a gap back to all the other non-Africans. From the pace of just under 74 seconds a lap, Ayana then upped the pace, followed immediately by Dibaba and the Kenyan team running as a group led by returning silver medalist Mercy Cherono. Laps started getting quicker, 68, 67, the field stringing out 65, 64 first only Dibaba was able to follow Ayana, then she was broken, Ayana out into an insurmountable lead with three laps to go and still accelerating. More than a hundred metres behind, Senbere Teferi was battling the last of the Kenyans, Viola Kibiwot for the bronze medal position. Ayana slowed a little over the last two laps, the pace falling back to 67 seconds but the damage was done and the race was decided. Ayana pushed home in 14:26.83 to break Genzebe's sister Tirunesh Dibaba's Championship Record. Well behind, Genzebe was content to just finish the race in silver medal position, but the battle for bronze was accelerating. Onto the home stretch, Teferi put her best move on Kibiwot and was sprinting home, but in the process she passed the slowing Dibaba. Dibaba finally noticed Teferi passing and turned into sprinting making for a close finish but Teferi had the edge and took the silver medal.|$|R
