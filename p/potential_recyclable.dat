50|$|TPE {{materials}} have the <b>potential</b> to be <b>recyclable</b> since {{they can be}} molded, extruded and reused like plastics, but they have typical elastic properties of rubbers which are not recyclable owing to their thermosetting characteristics. TPE also require little or no compounding, with no need to add reinforcing agents, stabilizers or cure systems. Hence, batch-to-batch variations in weighting and metering components are absent, leading to improved consistency in both raw materials and fabricated articles. Depending on the environment, TPEs have outstanding thermal properties and material stability when exposed to {{a broad range of}} temperatures and non-polar materials. TPEs consume less energy to produce, can be colored easily by most dyes, and allow economical quality control.|$|R

40|$|Dry water” (DW) is a {{free-flowing}} powder {{prepared by}} mixing water, hydrophobic silica particles, and air at high speeds. We demonstrated recently that DW {{can be used}} to dramatically enhance methane uptake rates in methane gas hydrate (MGH). Here, we expand on our initial work, demonstrating that DW {{can be used to}} increase the kinetics of formation of gas clathrates for gases other than methane, such as CO 2 and Kr. We also show that the stability of the system toward coalescence can be increased via the inclusion of a gelling agent to form a “dry gel”, thus dramatically improving the recyclability of the material. For example, the addition of gellan gum allows effective reuse over at least eight clathration cycles without the need for reblending. DW and its “dry gel” modification may represent a <b>potential</b> platform for <b>recyclable</b> gas storage or gas separation on a practicable time scale in a static, unmixed system...|$|R

By adding {{a certain amount}} of ethyl acetate (as non-solvent) into a cellulose/LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solution, and successively adding titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles (NPs), cellulose/TiO 2 composite monoliths with hierarchically porous structures were easily formed. The obtained composite monoliths possessed mesopores, and two kinds of macropores. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and Ultraviolet-visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis) measurements were adopted to characterize the cellulose/TiO 2 composite monolith. The cellulose/TiO 2 composite monoliths showed high efficiency of photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of methylene blue dye, which was decomposed up to 99 % within 60 min under UV light. Moreover, the composite monoliths could retain 90 % of the photodegradation efficiency after 10 cycles. The novel NIPS technique has great <b>potential</b> for fabricating <b>recyclable</b> photocatalysts with highly efficiency...|$|R

In the present work, we describe the composting of wet olive husks, using mechanically turned piles without forced ventilation, carried out to {{study the effects of}} partially composted oil-depleted husks as a starter for wet husks degradation. At the beginning of the composting process, protease and dehydrogenase activity, along with the microbial respiration, were higher in the piles with the starter, demonstrating a higher microbial activity in comparison with the piles without the starter. At the end of the process, the compost with the starter showed a deeper humification and a lower content of total organic carbon with respect to the compost without the starter, indicating a higher level of biodegradation and organic matter evolution. The main outcome of this research include the possibility to: (a) detoxify and de-odorize a bad-smelling waste into an hygienically safe product; (b) produce a green, mature, humified compost useful to restore soil fertility and texture in intensive and organic agriculture...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} current Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) practices in Haripur district {{in order to protect}} public health and the environment. Due to poor Solid Waste Management (SWM) practices in Pakistan, a large amount of waste goes to unsanitary landfills. This study reveals that at some extent, an effective waste management system was operating at household level in Haripur district diverting a significant amount of waste from landfill by mean of reuse and recycling of unwanted material. However, Municipal Authorities (MAs) are failing to treat the collected waste and it is disposed without reuse, recycling or recovery. This study explored the causes which are preventing an efficient MSWM system at household and MAs level. It was demonstrated that to effectively manage the waste, there is an urgent need of co-opertation between stakeholders dealing with Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). The analysis of quantity and composition of waste collected by MAs in the district suggested that there is a great <b>potential</b> to recover <b>recyclables</b> from the waste.

40|$|Lack {{of genuine}} concern for solid waste {{management}} practices and inefficiency of sol-id waste management system {{is one of the}} greatest environmental issues in Addis Ab-aba, Ethiopia. The Current Municipal Solid Waste Management System is extremely inefficient and ineffective. An illegal waste dumping, inefficient waste collection, and informal recycling are some of the issues that need to be immediately rectified. There-fore, this study was conducted in order to get a knowledge transfer from a developed country, Sweden, Östersund Municipality. The practical waste management and recy-cling activities undertaking in the city of Östersund have been assessed, evaluated and discussed in the study. Physical site visits, surveys, informal interviews, and group dis-cussions have also been conducted to be able to draw an immensely useful and tangi-ble recommendation for the improvement of Solid Waste Management and Recycling Scheme in Addis Ababa. Based on the experience acquired from Östersund the entire Solid Waste Management system in Addis Ababa has been evaluated and useful dis-cussions, recommendations, and conclusions have been drawn. Besides as recycling is one of the most significant waste management hierarchy components, it should have been given top priority in reducing the amount of waste generation in developing countries like Ethiopia. However, the recycling activities taking place in the country are highly limited and informal. Moreover, evaluation of the <b>potential</b> of <b>recyclable</b> wastes in Addis Ababa, discussion on how and why recycling needs to be given prece-dence and later comparison is made with Östersund Municipality in order to be able to gain knowledge from the Swedish experience. Besides, discussions were made in order to address decisive measures that need to be taken to implement the Swedish experience in the Solid Waste Management and Recycling sector in Addis Ababa Ethiopia in an environmentally friendly and economical way...|$|R

In the past various studies have been carried out on natural fiber composites [2]. Natural fibers are based on renewable materials and depending upon the source can be subdivided mainly into two major groups: plant fibers (based on agricultural resources) and animal fibers (based on resources derived from animals). The group of plant fibers can be subdivided into several classes: straw, seed, bast, leaf and wood fibers as depicted in Fig. 1.

40|$|Using {{microorganisms}} {{to mediate}} crystallisation of metals and minerals in open-culture bioreactors has <b>potential</b> to recover <b>recyclable</b> materials from dilute aqueous streams, {{but also to}} prevent their emission to the environment. Although this potential is already exploited in practice to some extent, biological crystallization for metal recovery is still largely a black box technology with limited {{understanding of the role}} of the microorganisms in the crystallization, and the differences with chemical crystallisation. Using biocrystallisation of scorodite (FeAsO 4. 2 H 2 O) and sphalerite (ZnS) as examples we propose that the role of microorganisms strongly depends on established saturation state of the solution. For scorodite, microorganisms are used to exert control over the crystallization as their ferrous iron-oxidizing activity keeps the solution slightly oversaturated. Also, the oversaturation level is kept homogeneous because of continuous biological formation of the reactant ferrous iron throughout the solution. In continuous bioreactor experiments on which we reported previously, scorodite crystal sizes still increased after 72 days of bioreactor operation indicating that indeed crystal growth was favored over nucleation. On the other hand, in our experiments with zinc sulfide, crystallization proceeded in highly oversaturated solutions in a continuous sulfate reducing bioreactor fed with a zinc sulfate solution and H 2 /CO 2 as electron donor and carbon source. The high oversaturation likely resulted in dominant primary nucleation in the bulk solution, with little or no control over crystal growth, even though agglomeration may still have occurred. This was exemplified by particle sizes which decreased in the bioreactor experiment and remained stable after already about 2 weeks of operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} waste {{minimization}} by reclamation and recycling is not new. However, it requires thorough {{integration into the}} waste management practices of the construction industry in the fast paced and expanding urban setting of Port Harcourt metropolis. The study investigates waste generation on construction and demolition sites in Port Harcourt, their market demand and <b>recyclable</b> <b>potential,</b> as a viable {{source of income for}} the informal sector, integral to establishing an inclusive waste management system. Primary data was obtained through the administration of structured questionnaires to construction companies and private developers, interviews with buyers of recyclables, and site visits. The literature and fieldwork reveals that there is a market demand in Port Harcourt for recycled construction waste such as for filling of pot holes on roads, aluminium sheets for smelting into low-grade cooking utensils, oxygenated wood to produce charcoal and firewood for road side sales of roasted food and construction of temporary wooden structures (Bacha) for low income earners. The response pattern also reveals that wastes are generated mostly for cement/concrete, broken blocks, timber and metals. This represents a potentially steady stream of sourcing for reclaimable and recyclable by-products, {{against the backdrop of the}} high proportion of construction of new buildings. Furthermore, the findings reveal that, there is no systematic medium of removal of construction wastes from their source, which often occur in new developing upper class neighbourhoods, where such wastes are carted away unsorted to open dumps or dumped in drains along roadways to low income neighborhoods where the market demand is. Recognizing the health and safety implications of scavenging at dumpsites, this study proposes the systematic integration of organized scavenging as a lucrative outlet for construction waste utilization in Port Harcourt, specifically targeted at direct sourcing and separation of materials generated on construction sites by certified scavengers...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. A {{number of}} environmental, social and {{economic}} problems are associated with waste disposal in landfill operations. The potential hazards associated with landfill operations are numerous and include fatal accidents, infrastructure damage, pollution of the local environment, harmful air emissions, to simple nuisance problems – such as dust, odour, vermin, and noise pollution. Further challenges include the availability of land and lack of municipal or other financing {{in the face of}} rising operation costs. Landfilling is, however, seen by many as an environmentally responsible and cost-effective solution to waste disposal. It is acknowledged however to lead to waste of resources by burying valuable materials that could have been reutilized. Careful engineering can resolve this shortcoming, yet the associated challenges and costs can become prohibitive. The regulatory environment also affects the prospects for adopting this approach to landfill site management in different contexts. The Mariannhill landfill site in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa, provides an opportunity to investigate both the range of challenges which these type of sites encounter, and the solutions which have been developed as a response. The central questions which this research seeks to answer are whether the practices adopted by the Mariannhill landfill site are replicable in other solid waste landfills around eThekwini and whether it can be viewed as an example of best practice in landfill site management more generally. The research finds that the main barrier to easy replication of systems followed at Mariannhill in other landfill sites is the difficulty in replicating the specific structures and character of management. Another key determining factor found is the prevailing attitudes to recycling and the environment in general in the society. Consumers choices are seen to be critical to the prospects for recycling of solid waste, including the size, degradability and <b>recyclable</b> <b>potential</b> of products purchased. In considering the potential for replication of the Mariannhill model as an example of best practice, it becomes clear that the technical aspects of operations at Mariannhill are the most easily replicable, yet other and equally important determinants of success are not easily replicable. These include the existing regulatory environment and prevailing societal attitudes towards recycling...|$|R
