40|$|Background: Lower-respiratory-tract {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most common acute illnesses managed in primary care. Few placebo-controlled studies of antibiotics have been done, and overall effectiveness (particularly in subgroups such as older people) is debated. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of amoxicillin for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection with those of placebo both overall and in patients aged 60 years or older. Methods: Patients older than 18 years with acute lower-respiratory-tract infections (cough of ≤ 28 days' duration) in whom pneumonia was not suspected were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to either amoxicillin (1 g three times daily for 7 days) or placebo by computer-generated random numbers. Our primary outcome was duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse. Secondary outcomes were symptom severity in days 2 – 4 and new or worsening symptoms. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment allocation.

40|$|Abstract Background Fractures of {{the distal}} radius are {{extremely}} common injuries in adults. However, the optimal management remains controversial. In general, fractures of the distal radius are treated non-operatively if the bone fragments {{can be held}} in anatomical alignment by a plaster cast or orthotic. However, {{if this is not}} possible, then operative fixation is required. There are several operative options but the two most common in the UK, are Kirschner-wire fixation (K-wires) and volar plate fixation using fixed-angle screws (locking-plates). The primary aim of this trial is to determine if there is a difference in the Patient-Reported Wrist Evaluation one year following K-wire fixation versus locking-plate fixation for adult patients with a dorsally-displaced fracture of the distal radius. Methods/design All adult patients with an acute, dorsally-displaced fracture of the distal radius, requiring operative fixation are potentially eligible to take part in this study. A total of 390 consenting patients will be randomly allocated to either K-wire fixation or locking-plate fixation. The surgery will be performed in trauma units across the UK using the preferred technique of the treating surgeon. Data regarding wrist function, quality of life, complications and costs will be collected at six weeks and three, six and twelve months following the injury. The primary outcome measure will be wrist function with a parallel economic analysis. Discussion This pragmatic, multi-centre trial is due to deliver results in December 2013.

40|$|Abstract Background Hip {{replacement}} (arthroplasty) {{surgery is}} a highly successful treatment for patients with severe symptomatic arthritis of the hip joint. For older patients, several designs of Total Hip Arthroplasty have shown excellent results {{in terms of both}} function and value for money. However, in younger more active patients, there is approximately a 50 % failure rate at 25 years for traditional implants. Hip resurfacing is a relatively new arthroplasty technique. In a recent review of the literature on resurfacing arthroplasty it was concluded that the short-term functional results appear promising but some potential early disadvantages were identified, including the risk of femoral neck fracture and collapse of the head of the femur. The aim of the current study is to assess whether there is a difference in functional hip scores at one year post-operation between Total Hip Arthroplasty and Resurfacing Arthroplasty. Secondary aims include assessment of complication rates for both procedures as well cost effectiveness. Methods/design All patients medically fit for surgery and deemed suitable for a resurfacing arthroplasty are eligible to take part in this study. A randomisation sequence will be produced and administered independently. After consenting, all patients will be clinically reviewed and hip function, quality of life and physical activity level will be assessed through questionnaires. The allocated surgery will then be performed with the preferred technique of the surgeon. Six weeks post-operation hip function will be assessed and complications recorded. Three, six and 12 months post-operation hip function, quality of life and physical activity level will be assessed. Additional information about patients' out-of-pocket expenses will also be collected. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 33354155 UKCLRN <b>portfolio</b> <b>ID</b> 4093 </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Osteoporotic hip {{fractures}} {{present a}} significant global challenge to patients, clinicians and healthcare systems. It {{is estimated that}} hip fracture accounts for 1. 4 % of total social and healthcare costs in the established market economies.

40|$|Background andnbsp;Achilles tendon {{injuries}} {{give rise}} to substantial long-lasting morbidity and pose considerable challenges for clinicians and patients during the lengthy healing period. Current treatment strategies struggle to curb the burden of this injury on health systems and society due to lengthy rehabilitation, work absence and reinjury risk. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous preparation that {{has been shown to}} improve the mechanobiological properties of tendons in laboratory and animal studies. The use of PRP in musculoskeletal injuries is on the increase despite the lack of adequately powered clinical studies. Methods and design andnbsp;This is a multicentre randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of PRP in patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR). All adults with acute ATR presenting within 12 days of the injury who are to be treated non-operatively are eligible. A total of 230 consenting patients will be randomly allocated via a remote web-based service to receive PRP injection or placebo injection {{to the site of the}} injury. All participants will be blinded to the intervention and will receive standardised rehabilitation to reduce efficacy interference. Participants will be followed up with blinded assessments of muscleandndash;tendon function, quality of life, pain and overall patientandrsquo;s functional goals at 4, 7, 13, 24 weeks and 24 months post-treatment. The primary outcome is the heel-rise endurance test (HRET), which will be supervised by a blinded assessor at 24 weeks. A subgroup of 16 participants in one centre will have needle biopsy under ultrasound guidance at 6 weeks. Blood and PRP will be analysed for cell count, platelet activation and growth factor concentrations. Ethics and dissemination andnbsp;The protocol has been approved by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee (Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee A, reference no 14 /SC/ 1333).

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{numbers of}} {{patients}} with three or more chronic conditions (multimorbidity) are increasing, and will rise to 2. 9 million by 2018 in the UK alone. Currently in the UK, conditions are mainly managed using over 250 sets of single-condition guidance, which {{has the potential to}} generate conflicting recommendations for lifestyle and concurrent medication for individual patients with more than one condition. To address some of these issues, we are developing a new computer-based tool to help manage these patients more effectively. For this tool to be applicable and relevant to current practice, we must first better understand how existing patients with multimorbidity are being managed, particularly relating to concerns over prescribing and potential polypharmacy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Up to four secondary care centres, two community pharmacies and between four and eight primary care centres in the West Midlands will be recruited. Interviewees will be purposively sampled from these sites, up to a maximum of 30. In this mixed methods study, we will perform a dual framework analysis on the qualitative data; the first analysis will use the Theoretical Domains Framework to assess barriers and enablers for healthcare professionals around the management of multimorbid patients; the second analysis will use Normalisation Process Theory to understand how interventions are currently being successfully implemented in both settings. We will also extract quantitative anonymised patient data from primary care {{to determine the extent of}} polypharmacy currently present for patients with multimorbidity in the West Midlands. DISCUSSION We aim to combine these data so that we can build a useful, fully implementable tool which addresses the barriers most amenable to change within both primary and secondary care contexts. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Favourable ethical approval has been granted by The University of Birmingham Research Ethics Committee (ERN_ 16 - 0074) on 17 May 2016. Our work will be disseminated through peer-reviewed literature, trade journals and conferences. We will also use the dedicated web page hosted by the University to serve as a central point of contact and as a repository of our findings. We aim to produce a minimum of three articles from this work to contribute to the international scientific literature.

40|$|Abstract Background Severe {{arthritis}} of {{the knee}} is a disabling condition, with over 50, 000 knee replacements performed {{each year in the}} UK. Isolated patellofemoral joint arthritis occurs in over 10 % of these patients with the treatment options being patellofemoral arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty. Whilst many surgeons believe total knee arthroplasty is the 'gold standard' treatment for severe knee arthritis, patellofemoral arthroplasty has certain potential advantages. Primarily, because this operation allows the patient to keep the majority of their own knee joint; preserving bone-stock and the patients' own ligaments. Patellofemoral arthroplasty has also been recognised as a less 'invasive' operation than primary total knee arthroplasty, facilitating a more rapid recovery. There are currently no published results of randomised clinical trials comparing the two arthroplasty techniques. The primary objective of the current study is to assess whether there is a difference in functional knee scores and quality of life outcome assessments at one year post-operation between patellofemoral arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. The secondary objective is to assess the complication rates for both procedures. Methods/design Patients who are deemed suitable, by an Orthopaedic Consultant, for patellofemoral arthroplasty and medically fit for surgery are eligible to take part in this trial. The consenting patients will be randomised in a 1 : 1 allocation to a total knee or patellofemoral arthroplasty. The randomisation sequence will be computer generated and administered by a central independent randomisation service. Following consent, all participants will have their knee function, quality of life and physical activity level assessed through questionnaires. The assigned surgery will then be performed using the preferred technique and implant of the operating surgeon. The first post-operative assessments will take place at six weeks, followed by further assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months. At each assessment time point all complications will be recorded. In addition, community and social care services usage will be collected using a patient questionnaire at 3, 6 & 12 months. The patients will then be sent an annual postal questionnaire. The questionnaire will ask about any problems, knee pain and function following their knee arthroplasty to monitor long-term function and failure rates. Discussion This trial is expected to deliver results in early 2013. Trial Registration ISRCTN: ISRCTN 34863373 UKCRN <b>portfolio</b> <b>ID</b> 6847 </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the prevalence and clinical severity of whooping cough (pertussis) in school age children presenting with persistent cough {{in primary care}} since the introduction {{and implementation of the}} preschool pertussis booster vaccination. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (November 2010 to December 2012). SETTING: General practices in Thames Valley, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 279 children aged 5 to 15 years who presented in primary care with a persistent cough of two to eight weeks' duration. Exclusion criteria were cough likely to be caused by a serious underlying medical condition, known immunodeficiency or immunocompromise, participation in another clinical research study, and preschool pertussis booster vaccination received less than one year previously. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence of recent pertussis infection based on an oral fluid anti-pertussis toxin IgG titre of at least 70 arbitrary units. Cough frequency was measured in six children with laboratory confirmed pertussis. RESULTS: 56 (20 %, 95 % confidence interval 16 % to 25 %) children had evidence of recent pertussis infection, including 39 (18 %, 13 % to 24 %) of 215 children who had been fully vaccinated. The risk of pertussis was more than three times higher (21 / 53; 40 %, 26 % to 54 %) in children who had received the preschool pertussis booster vaccination seven years or more previously than in those who had received it less than seven years previously (20 / 171; 12 %, 7 % to 17 %). The risk of pertussis was similar between children who received five and three component preschool pertussis booster vaccines (risk ratio for five component vaccine 1. 14, 0. 64 to 2. 03). Four of six children in whom cough frequency was measured coughed more than 400 times in 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis can still be found in a fifth of school age children who present in primary care with persistent cough and can cause clinically significant cough in fully vaccinated children. These findings will help to inform consideration of the need for an adolescent pertussis booster vaccination in the United Kingdom.

40|$|Background: Thirty-percent of {{patients}} with epilepsy are drug-resistant, and might benefit from effective noninvasive therapeutic interventions. Evidence is accumulating on the efficacy of autonomic biofeedback therapy using galvanic skin response (GSR; an index of sympathetic arousal) in treating epileptic seizures. This study aimed to extend previous controlled clinical trials of autonomic biofeedback therapy with a larger homogeneous sample {{of patients}} with temporal lobe epilepsy. In addition, we used neuroimaging to characterize neural mechanisms of change in seizure frequency following the therapy. Methods: Forty patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (age: 18 to 70 years old), on stable doses of anti-epileptic medication, were recruited into a controlled and parallel-group trial from three screening centers in the UK. Patients were allocated to either an active intervention group, who received therapy with GSR biofeedback, or a control group, who received treatment as usual. Allocation to the group was informed, in part, by whether patients could travel to attend repeated therapy sessions (non-randomized). Measurement of outcomes was undertaken by an assessor blinded to the patients' group membership. Resting-state functional and structural MRI data were acquired before and after one month of therapy in the therapy group, and before and after a one-month interval {{in the control group}}. The percentage change of seizure frequency was the primary outcome measure. The analysis employed an intention–to–treat principle. The secondary outcome was the change in default mode network (DMN) and limbic network functional connectivity tested for effects of therapy. The trial was registered with the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) <b>portfolio</b> (<b>ID</b> 15967). Findings: Data were acquired between May 2014 and October 2016. Twenty participants were assigned to each group. Two patients in the control group dropped out before the second scan, leaving 18 control participants. There was a significant difference in reduction of seizure frequency between the therapy and control groups (p b 0. 001 : Mann Whitney U Test). The seizure frequency in the therapy group was significantly reduced (p b 0. 001 : Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) following GSR biofeedback, with a mean seizure reduction of 43...|$|E

Our primary outcome was duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse. Secondary outcomes were symptom severity in days 2 — 4 and new or worsening symptoms. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment allocation. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2007 - 001586 - 15), UKCRN <b>Portfolio</b> (<b>ID</b> 4175), ISRCTN (52261229), and FWO (G. 0274. 08 N). Findings: 1038 patients were assigned to the amoxicillin group and 1023 to the placebo group. Neither duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse (hazard ratio 1 · 06, 95 % CI 0 · 96 — 1 · 18; p= 0 · 229) nor mean symptom severity (1 · 69 with placebo vs 1 · 62 with amoxicillin; difference ? 0 · 07 [95 % CI ? 0 · 15 to 0 · 007]; p= 0 · 074) differed significantly between groups. New or worsening symptoms were significantly less common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (162 [15 · 9 %] of 1021 patients vs 194 [19 · 3 %] of 1006; p= 0 · 043; number needed to treat 30). Cases of nausea, rash, or diarrhoea were significantly more common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (number needed to harm 21, 95 % CI 11 — 174; p= 0 · 025), and one case of anaphylaxis was noted with amoxicillin. Two patients in the placebo group and one in the amoxicillin group needed to be admitted to hospital; no study-related deaths were noted. We noted no evidence of selective benefit in patients aged 60 years or older (n= 595). Interpretation: When pneumonia is not suspected clinically, amoxicillin provides little benefit for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection in primary care both overall and in patients aged 60 years or more, and causes slight harms.

40|$|Background: Postinfectious cough {{is common}} in primary care, but has no proven {{effective}} treatments. Cysteinyl leukotrienes {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of postinfectious cough and whooping cough (pertussis). We investigated the effectiveness of montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, in the treatment of postinfectious cough. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, non-smoking adults aged 16 - 49 years with postinfectious cough of 2 - 8 weeks' duration were recruited from 25 general practices in England. Patients were tested for pertussis (oral fluid anti-pertussis toxin IgG) and randomly assigned (1 : 1) to montelukast 10 mg daily or image-matched placebo for 2 weeks. Patients chose whether to continue study drug for another 2 weeks. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated and stratified by general practice. Patients, health-care professionals, and researchers were masked to treatment allocation. Effectiveness was assessed with the Leicester Cough Questionnaire to measure changes in cough-specific quality of life; the primary outcomes were changes in total score between baseline and two follow-up stages (2 weeks and 4 weeks). The primary analysis was by intention to treat with imputation by last observation carried forward. Recruitment closed on Sept 21, 2012, and follow-up has been completed. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2010 - 019647 - 19), UKCRN <b>Portfolio</b> (<b>ID</b> 8360), and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 01279668). Findings: From April 13, 2011, to Sept 21, 2012, we randomly assigned 276 patients to montelukast (n= 137) or placebo (n= 139). 70 (25 %) patients had laboratory-confirmed pertussis. Improvements in cough-specific quality of life occurred in both groups after 2 weeks (montelukast: mean 2 · 7, 95 % CI 2 · 2 - 3 · 3; placebo: 3 · 6, 2 · 9 - 4 · 3), but the difference between groups did not meet the minimum clinically important difference of 1 · 3 (mean difference - 0 · 9, - 1 · 7 to - 0 · 04, p= 0 · 04). This difference was not statistically significant in any sensitivity analyses. After 2 weeks, 192 of 259 participants from whom data were available elected to continue study drug (99 [77 %] of 129 participants on montelukast; 93 [72 %] of 130 on placebo). After 4 weeks, there were no significant between-group differences in cough-specific quality of life improvement (montelukast: 5 · 2, 4 · 5 - 5 · 9; placebo: 5 · 9, 5 · 1 - 6 · 7; mean difference - 0 · 5, - 1 · 5 to 0 · 6, p= 0 · 38) or adverse event rates (21 (15 %) of 137 patients on montelukast reported one or more adverse events; 31 (22 %) of 139 on placebo; p= 0 · 14). The most common adverse events reported were increased mucus production (montelukast, n= 6; placebo, n= 2), gastrointestinal disturbance (montelukast, n= 3; placebo, n= 5), and headache (montelukast, n= 2; placebo, n= 6). One serious adverse event was reported (placebo, n= 1), which was unrelated to study drug (shortness of breath and throat tightness after severe coughing bouts). Interpretation: Montelukast is not an effective treatment for postinfectious cough. However, the burden of postinfectious cough in primary care is high, making it an ideal setting for future antitussive treatment trials.
