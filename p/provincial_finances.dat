He died at Halifax at the age of 59 and is buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia). An audit of the provincial accounts following his death found them deficient.|$|E

40|$|The federal Equalization {{transfer}} program makes fiscal {{resources of}} "have-not" provinces depend on fiscal conditions in "have" provinces, {{which tends to}} destabilize provincial finances: {{the data show that}} equalized revenues of receiving provinces are more volatile than own-source revenues. But this reflects the revenue risks facing the aggregate of all provinces, which an equalization program cannot insure. Controlling for aggregate risk, I find that the program has a significant stabilizing effect on <b>provincial</b> <b>finances.</b> Nevertheless, some improvements in revenue-sharing through the program might be contemplated. For example, a return to a national average capacity standard, from the five-province standard which has been in place since 1982, would increase insurance for idiosyncratic shocks by about one-third. ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{contributes}} to the growing literature on the political and institu-tional determinants of fiscal outcomes by studying the behavior of public spending in the Argentine provinces since the return to democracy in 1983. Argentina is a federal republic with 23 provinces, and <b>provincial</b> <b>finances</b> {{play an important role}} in the overall fiscal picture of the country, with approximately 50 percent of total government expenditures occumng at the subnational level. The Argentine provinces possess a considerable amount of diversity in terms of their party systems, executive-legislative relations, and fiscal behavior, making Argentina an ideal laboratory for this type of study. We begin in section 6. 1 with a description of a vitally important aspect of Argentina’s fiscal structure: its degree of vertical imbalance, by which a very large proportion of provincial spending is financed out of a common pool of tax revenues. Section 6. 2 summarizes our theoretical approach, which empha-sizes the common-property view of fiscal politics. Section 6. 3 presents the main hypotheses, and section 6. 4 contains the empirical analysis of the politi...|$|E
