"This note {{contains}} {{a request from}} an old client of ours, Dr. Phelps McCarthy, of Willow Lea House Academy, West Hampstead, that I should at once send him {{a young man who}} should be qualified to teach Latin and English to a small class of boys under fourteen years of age. His vacancy appears to be the very one which you are looking for.

50|$|It is a {{representative}} type of glutinous pounded tteok, and has varieties {{depending on the}} type of gomul (고물, coating) used. Gomul can be made with powdered dried soybeans, azuki beans, or sesame seeds, or sliced dried jujube. Subsidiary ingredients are mixed into the steamed rice while pounding it on the anban (안반, wooden <b>pounding</b> <b>board).</b> Patinjeolmi (팥인절미), and kkaeinjeolmi (깨인절미) are examples for the former, coated with azuki bean powder and sesame respectively. In ssuk injeolmi (쑥인절미) and surichwi injeolmi (수리취인절미) are artemisia and Synurus deltoides (AIT.) NAKAI) added.|$|R
50|$|Waste weirs {{are used}} to {{regulate}} {{the height of the}} water in the canal. Any water higher than the highest board in the waste weir would flow over the board, and out of the canal <b>pound.</b> <b>Boards</b> could be added or taken out to adjust the height of water. Waste weirs often had paddle valves at the bottom, allowing the canal to be completely drained for repairs, emergencies, or {{at the end of the}} boating season for winter. On some canals (e.g. the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal) with the exception of short levels, almost every level had a waste weir between the locks.|$|R
5000|$|Tteok {{is largely}} {{divided into four}} categories, such as [...] "steamed tteok" [...] (찌는 떡), [...] "pounded tteok" [...] (치는 떡), [...] "boiled tteok" [...] (삶는 떡) and [...] "pan-fried tteok" [...] (지지는 떡). The steamed tteok is made by {{steaming}} rice or glutinous rice flour in [...] "siru" [...] (시루), or a large earthenware steamer, so it is often called [...] "sirutteok" [...] (시루떡). It {{is regarded as the}} basic and oldest form of tteok. The pounded tteok is made by using a <b>pounding</b> <b>board</b> or mortar after steamed first. In making pan-fried tteok, the rice dough is flattened like a pancake and pan-fried with vegetable oil. The shaped tteok are made by kneading a dough with hot water which is usually shaped into balls.|$|R
50|$|The Arab Socialist Union {{was founded}} in Egypt in December 1962 by Gamal Abdel Nasser as the country's sole {{political}} party. The ASU {{grew out of the}} Free Officers Movement of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The party's formation was just one part in Nasser's National Charter. The Charter set out an agenda of nationalization, agrarian reform, and constitutional reform, which formed the basis of ASU policy. The programme of nationalisation under Nasser saw seven billion Egyptian pounds of private assets transferred into the public sector. Banks, insurance companies, many large shipping companies, major heavy industries and major basic industries were converted to public control. Land reforms saw the maximum area of private land ownership successively reduced from 200 to 100 feddans. A 90% top rate of income tax was levied on income over ten thousand Egyptian <b>pounds.</b> <b>Boards</b> of directors were required to have a minimum number of workers, and workers and peasants were guaranteed {{at least half of the}} seats in the People's Assembly. The Charter also saw a strong assertion of Arab nationalism, within the context of historical Egyptian nationalism.|$|R

He resigned from this position in April 2014 when it was revealed that he was made bankrupt in May 2012, with debts of more than £3 million, and owing £200,000 to HM Revenue and Customs.|$|R
50|$|In 1750, Rochester voted at a {{town meeting}} to {{establish}} a public school to teach writing and reading to the town's children. The vote was quickly overturned, which violated state laws mandating schools in each community. In 1752 the first public schooling began. The school lasted for 16 weeks and the school master was named John Forst. He was paid a salary of 15 <b>pounds</b> and <b>boarded</b> with a different family each month (this family received 30 cents a week from the city).|$|R
25|$|When a convict {{stowed away}} and escaped to Tahiti on the Parramatta, a ship Macarthur part-owned, Bligh {{demanded that the}} 900 <b>pound</b> Transport <b>Board</b> bond be forfeited. Macarthur refused to comply and the ship was seized when it returned. In December 1807 Bligh had an order issued for Macarthur {{to appear before the}} courts, which Macarthur refused to obey and {{subsequently}} was arrested and bailed for a trial on 25 January 1808. This trial led to the so-called Rum Rebellion, when the officers of the NSW Corps, who had been assigned to the court, sided with Macarthur and his allies: as a consequence, Bligh was overthrown by the Corps in a military coup on 26 January.|$|R

5000|$|Even {{though the}} Elco 77-footers posted the fastest speeds, all seven Elcos {{suffered}} from structural damage and severe <b>pounding</b> causing the <b>Board</b> {{to recommend a}} redesign to correct these deficiencies. Elco competed for the PT-71 to PT-102 contract but did not win due to their higher unit price.

5000|$|In 2013, {{the game}} was revised with the board now based on a {{simplified}} version of a city rather than a midway. The player tokens were replaced with a green car, blue ship, orange cat and black dog. The ticket booths were replaced with [...] "sold signs", cardboard pieces featuring cartoon caricatures of the player tokens. The $1, $2, $3, $4 and $5 notes were replaced with single-denomination [...] "Monopoly money" [...] notes, and the prices on the board were denoted with a Monopoly money currency glyph (an uppercase 'M' with two horizontal crossbars) instead of dollars or <b>pounds.</b> The <b>board</b> became more reminiscent of the standard Monopoly board, replacing the [...] "Rest Rooms" [...] (or [...] "Café", depending on the version of the board) with [...] "Jail" [...] and [...] "Uncle Pennybag's Loose Change" [...] with [...] "Free Parking". The four Railroad spaces, the Fireworks space, the Water Show and two Chance spaces were also eliminated, reducing the board size from 32 spaces to 24.|$|R

The sole survivor parachuted {{out of the plane}} and hid in the mountains before making it back to allied lines in Florence three months later. The fallen crew were buried in the cemetery in Montepiano shortly after the crash, their final resting place at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, USA.|$|R
5000|$|Efrati {{was one of}} {{the first}} members of the Batsheva Dance Company. In 1975, he left Batsheva and {{established}} Kol Demama (The Sound of Silence) integrating ten dancers with hearing impairment together with ten dancers with normal hearing. Efrati cued the hearing impaired dancers by <b>pounding</b> a <b>board</b> on the floor or having a dancer stomp on the floor, creating a vibration that could be picked up by the dancers feet, similar to theories of an elephant hearing via vibrations perceived through its feet. [...] Nijinsky is said to have used this method to cue his dancers for Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring, as the rhythms were too complex for Nijinsky’s dancers to follow. The dancers also get their cues from the vibration of bass notes in the music, eye contact, touch, movement of others, and lighting cues, all woven into the choreography. Kol Demama has a Tel Aviv school for dancers, teaching several hundred young dancers each year. Efrati intends Kol Demama to be judged on artistic grounds, [...] "I am neither a social worker nor therapist, I am a dance creator." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2009 {{began with}} a poor result at Southwell on 1 January on what was a slow track, coming last in a class 2 handicap. However he won 4 out of his next 6 rides, {{including}} 3 wins in a row, to put him as the top rated all-weather horse in the UK and also top of the prize money leaderboard the 2nd of his hat-trick of wins came with him having 9 stone 13 <b>pounds</b> on <b>board</b> (a personal best). However another 2 bad results {{at the end of}} the all-weather flat winter season saw him finish second to Scintillo in terms of prize money. In terms of rating he finished the all-weather winter season with an official rating of 112 (another personal best) which made him 2nd overall, but his Racing Post Rating (a reliable industry indicator) was 117 and that was the best of the season. These figures make him one of the best all-weather horses of all time, in what was a very competitive season.|$|R
2500|$|In April 1958, [...] Archibald MacLeish instigated the {{campaign}} for Pound's release which was successful. [...] He stayed on at St. Elizabeths for the next month, waiting for a passport, packing books and papers that were stored in Dorothy's apartment, leaving the hospital early in May. In June Dorothy and her husband, traveling with Marcella, [...] now acting nominally as <b>Pound's</b> secretary, <b>boarded</b> a ship for Italy. Upon their arrival they were met in Verona by Mary, Pound's daughter with Olga, and from there they traveled to Schloss Brunnenburg. In January 1959 tensions between the three women became intolerable. Dorothy, who lived in her own section of the castle, maintained legal guardianship and controlled his funds. A few months later, Dorothy took Pound and Marcella to Rapallo to visit Olga, and then traveled through Italy. In Sirmione Pound {{began to talk about}} marrying Marcella, and Dorothy used her legal power: {{by the end of the}} summer Marcella, 40 years younger than Pound, had been sent back to the US. Pound fell into a period of ill-health in 1960 that lingered through the early months of 1961. Dorothy eventually brought him to Rapallo, and unable to cope with him, she turned his care over to Olga.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they became}} a little more sane, and a waltz, or {{something}} like it, was got up. It was quite pretty, {{and some of the}} movements graceful; but the wild spirit of the glens seemed to re-enter them again rather suddenly. The females were expelled from the ring altogether, and the young men braced themselves for a little really heavy work; they dashed, flung, and hurled themselves about like maniacs, stood on their heads and walked on their hands; in short, became a company of acrobats, yet always kept up a sort of sympathetic attempt at time with the fiddler, who went on <b>pounding</b> his wooden <b>board</b> with his left heel and murdering an inconceivable multitude of young pigs with a degree of energy that was only equalled by that of those to whom he fiddled.|$|R
50|$|The first {{technical}} college in Queensland started in Brisbane in the 1870s. It operated entirely within the existing Brisbane School of Arts organisation, {{with the school}} of arts committee charging fees for its few subjects. The Queensland Government were involved from the early 1880s, providing a small grant to cover costs. However, the particular subjects remained completely within {{the control of the}} school of arts committee. From this initial grant the involvement of the government continued to increase. In the 1890s an endowment system matched revenue raised in fees on a pound for <b>pound</b> basis. A <b>Board</b> of Technical Education was established in 1902 to provide administrative support and distribute government subsidies. Later in the 1900s this board was abolished. The Queensland Government took over the running of technical education in Brisbane, and then across the state a decade later, with the passing of further legislation.|$|R
6000|$|Reader, {{the mode}} {{of dealing with the}} abominable [...] "coper" [...] traffic {{referred}} to by these men has at last happily been adopted, and the final blow has been dealt by the simple expedient of underselling the floating grog-shops in the article of tobacco. Very considerable trouble and expense have to be incurred by the mission, however, for the tobacco has to be fetched from a foreign port; but the result amply repays the cost for the men naturally prefer paying only 1 shilling per <b>pound</b> on <b>board</b> the mission-ship, to paying 1 shilling 6 pence on board the [...] "coper." [...] The smacksman's advantages in this respect may be better understood when we say that on shore he has to pay 4 shillings per pound for tobacco. But his greatest advantage of all--that for which the plan has been adopted--is his being kept away from the vessel where, while purchasing tobacco, he is tempted to buy poisonous spirits. Of course the anti-smoker is entitled to say [...] "it were better that the smacksman should be saved from tobacco as well as drink!" [...] But of two evils it is wise to choose the less. Tobacco at 1 shilling 6 pence procured in the [...] "coper," [...] with, to some, its irresistible temptation to get drunk on vile spirits, is a greater evil than the procuring of the same weed at 1 shilling in a vessel all whose surroundings and internal arrangements are conducive to the benefit of soul and body.|$|R
6000|$|All John's fortune was {{the house}} in Bedford Row, which, at his father's death, was let out into chambers, and brought in a clear hundred a year. Under his uncle's roof at Oldborough, where he lived with {{thirteen}} red-haired male and female cousins, he was only charged fifty <b>pounds</b> for <b>board,</b> clothes, and pocket-money, and {{the remainder of his}} rents was carefully put by for him until his majority. When he approached that period--when he came to belong to two spouting-clubs at Oldborough, among the young merchants and lawyers'-clerks--to blow the flute nicely, and play a good game at billiards--to have written one or two smart things in the Oldborough Sentinel--to be fond of smoking (in which act he was discovered by his fainting aunt at three o'clock one morning)--in one word, when John Perkins arrived at manhood, he discovered that he was quite unfit to be an attorney, that he detested all the ways of his uncle's stern, dull, vulgar, regular, red-headed family, and he vowed that he would go to London and make his fortune. Thither he went, his aunt and cousins, who were all [...] "serious," [...] vowing that he was a lost boy; and when his history opens, John had been two years in the metropolis, inhabiting his own garrets; and a very nice compact set of apartments, looking into the back-garden, at this moment falling vacant, the prudent Lucy Gorgon had visited them, and vowed that she and her John should there commence housekeeping.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} campaign, the English, {{aided by this}} alliance, were speedily successful. As Scotland, however, had sent the French five {{thousand}} men, and might send more, or attack the North of England while England was busy with France, it was considered {{that it would be}} a good thing to offer the Scottish King, James, who had been so long imprisoned, his liberty, on his paying forty thousand <b>pounds</b> for his <b>board</b> and lodging during nineteen years, and engaging to forbid his subjects from serving under the flag of France. It is pleasant to know, not only that the amiable captive at last regained his freedom upon these terms, but, that he married a noble English lady, with whom he had been long in love, and became an excellent King. I am afraid we have met with some Kings in this history, and shall meet with some more, who would have been very much the better, and would have left the world much happier, if they had been imprisoned nineteen years too.|$|R
6000|$|Jonathan Swift, born in 1667 {{after his}} father's death, was educated by his uncle Godwin, {{and after a}} not very {{successful}} career at Trinity College, Dublin, went to stay with his mother, Abigail Erick, at Leicester. Mrs. Swift feared that her son would {{fall in love with}} a girl named Betty Jones, but, as Swift told a friend, he had had experience enough [...] "not to think of marriage till I settle my fortune in the world, which I am sure will not be in some years; and even then, I am so hard to please that I suppose I shall put it off to the other world." [...] Soon afterwards an opening for Swift presented itself. Sir William Temple, now living in retirement at Moor Park, near Farnham, had been, like his father, Master of the Irish Rolls, and had thus become acquainted with Swift's uncle Godwin. Moreover, Lady Temple was related to Mrs. Swift, as Lord Orrery tells us. Thanks to these facts, the application to Sir William Temple was successful, and Swift went to live at Moor Park before the end of 1689. There he read to Temple, wrote for him, and kept his accounts, and growing into confidence with his employer, [...] "was often trusted with matters of great importance." [...] The story--afterwards improved upon by Lord Macaulay--that Swift received only 20 <b>pounds</b> and his <b>board,</b> and was not allowed to sit at table with his master, is wholly untrustworthy. Within three years of their first intercourse, Temple had introduced his secretary to William the Third, and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments.|$|R
6000|$|If, {{with natural}} indignation, {{he shut his}} door, and refuse {{to come to the}} Tabagie, they knock in a panel of his door; and force him out with crackers, fire-works, rockets and malodorous projectiles. Once the poor blockhead, {{becoming}} human for a moment, went clean away; to Halle where his Brother was, or to some safer place: but the due inveiglements, sublime apologies, increase of titles, salaries, were used; and the indispensable Phosphorescent Blockhead, and President of the Academy of Pedler's-French, was got back. Drink remained always as his consolation; drink, and the deathless Volumes he was writing and printing. Sublime returns came to him;--Kaiser's Portrait set in diamonds, on one occasion,--for his Presentation-Copies in high quarters: immortal fame, is it not his clear portion; still more clearly abundance of good wine. Friedrich Wilhelm did not let him want for Titles;--raised him at last to the Peerage; drawing out the Diploma and Armorial Blazonry, in a truly Friedrich-Wilhelm manner, with his own hand. The Gundlings, in virtue of the transcendent intellect and merits of this Founder Gundling, are, and are hereby declared to be, of Baronial dignity to the last scion of them; and in [...] "all RITTER-RENNEN (Tournaments), Battles, Fights, Camp-pitchings, Sealings, Sightings, shall and may use the above-said Shield of Arms,"--if it can be of any advantage to them. A Prussian Majesty who gives us 150 <b>pounds</b> yearly, with <b>board</b> and lodging and the run of his cellar, and honors such as these, is not to be lightly sneezed away, though of queer humors now and then. The highest Personages, as we said, more than once made gifts to Gundling; miniatures set in diamonds; purses of a hundred ducats: even Gundling, it was thought, might throw in a word, mad or otherwise, which would bear fruit. It was said of him, he never spoke to harm anybody with his Majesty. The poor blown-up blockhead was radically not ill-natured,--at least, if you let his [...] "phosphorescences" [...] alone.|$|R
