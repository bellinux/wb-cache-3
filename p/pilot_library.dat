40|$|Abstract—The <b>Pilot</b> <b>library</b> {{offers a}} new method for program-ming {{parallel}} clusters in C. Formal elements from Communi-cating Sequential Processes (CSP) were used to realize a process/channel model of parallel computation that reduces opportunities for deadlock and other communication errors. This simple model, plus an application programming interface (API) fashioned on C’s formatted I/O, are designed to make the library easy for novice scientific C programmers to learn. Optional runtime services including deadlock detection help the programmer to debug communication issues. Pilot forms a thin layer on top of standard Message Passing Interface (MPI), pre-serving the latter’s portability and efficiency, with little perfor-mance impact. MPI’s powerful collective operations can still be accessed within the conceptual model. Keywords—MPI; library; parallel programming; deadlock detection; CSP I...|$|E

Through in vitro high-throughput screening with the Colorado Center for Drug Discovery (C 2 D 2) <b>Pilot</b> <b>Library,</b> we identified hit compound 1, which {{was the basis for}} extensive structure−activity relationship studies.

40|$|Finding unique {{peptides}} {{to target}} specific biological surfaces {{is crucial to}} basic research and technology development, though methods based on biological arrays or large libraries limit the speed and ease with which these necessary compounds can be found. We reasoned that because biological surfaces, such as cell surfaces, mineralized tissues, and various extracellular matrices have unique molecular compositions, they present unique physicochemical signatures to the surrounding medium which could be probed by peptides with appropriately corresponding physicochemical properties. To test this hypothesis, a naïve <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of 36 peptides, varying in their hydrophobicity and charge, was arranged in a two-dimensional matrix and screened against various biological surfaces. While the number of peptides in the matrix library was very small, we obtained "hits" against all biological surfaces probed.

40|$|The {{identification}} of predominant microbial taxa with specific metabolic capabilities remains one {{the biggest challenges}} in environmental microbiology, because {{of the limits of}} current metagenomic and cell culturing methods. We report results from the direct analysis of multiple genes in individual marine bacteria cells, demonstrating the potential for high-throughput metabolic assignment of yet-uncultured taxa. The protocol uses high-speed fluorescence-activated cell sorting, whole-genome multiple displacement amplification (MDA), and subsequent PCR screening. A <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of 11 single amplified genomes (SAGs) was constructed from Gulf of Maine bacterioplankton as proof of concept. The library consisted of five flavobacteria, one sphingobacterium, four alphaproteobacteria, and one gammaproteobacterium. Most of the SAGs, apart from alphaproteobacteria, were phylogenetically distant from existing isolates, with 88 – 97 % identity in the 16 S rRNA gene sequence. Thus, single-cell MDA provided access to the genomic material of numerically dominant but yet-uncultured taxonomic groups. Two of five flavobacteria in the SAG library contained proteorhodopsin genes, suggesting that flavobacteria are among the major carriers of this photometabolic system. The pufM and nasA genes were detected in some 100 -cell MDA products but not in SAGs, demonstrating that organisms containing bacteriochlorophyll and assimilative nitrate reductase constituted < 1 % of the sampled bacterioplankton. Compared with metagenomics, the power of our approach lies in the ability to detect metabolic genes in uncultured microorganisms directly, even when the metabolic and phylogenetic markers are located far apart on the chromosome...|$|E

A <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of Type-II kinase inhibitors {{designed to fit}} into the ATP-binding pocket will be screened to determine HsPlk 4 inhibition activity, which will help characterize a novel drug compound. Methods: Two peptide substrates of varying concentrations (2 uM, 1 uM, and 0. 5 uM) were each combined with serial dilutions of HsPlk 4 (1. 25 uM, 0. 625 uM, 0. 313 uM, 0. 156 uM, 0. 078 uM, and 0. 039 uM). EZ Reader detected phosphorylation activity by measuring fluorescence of both substrate and product, which separated at respective time points based on electrophoresis. The subsequent part of the experiment will be to inhibit the kinase activity with molecular inhibitors. Results: The results showed HsPlk 4 activity with the modified PLKtide, (5 FAM) KKKTPSDSLYDDGLSKK(CONH 2). All reactions with the various concentrations of substrate 1 and HsPlk 4 showed phosphorylation activity. The reaction started within the first 10 minutes, quickly reaching maximal phosphorylation of substrate. No p-values were calculated due to lack of data. Conclusions: No overall conclusions can be drawn based on the current results. Results showed the reaction reached its saturation point, so methods need to be refined to obtain data within the first 10 minutes. HsPlk 4 phosphorylation of PLKtide confirmed the presumption that PLK family is a conserved family of Ser/Thr kinases.

40|$|The {{constitution}} and ring size of peptide-derived macrocycles directly influence target binding affinity and physicochemical properties. Here, we describe means to recapitulate key features of peptide-protein interaction linear motifs (LM) in diverse, macrocyclic small molecules. Large ring-forming reactions of exceptional substrate scope are achieved using latently reactive templates that engage peptide side chain functional groups. The template is activated to transiently generate either a cinnamyl carbocation or a palladium(π-cinnamyl) complex, which rapidly form carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds. Cyclizations occur {{at room temperature}} and are typically insensitive to peptide composition or ring size. Multiply reactive templates couple macrocyclization with additional annulation reactions to further restrict conformation, to mask polar groups, and to access complex polycyclic structures of reduced peptidic character {{in two or three}} synthetic steps. Divergent Friedel-Crafts macrocyclization reactions are of special utility for exploring multiple ring connectivities within a given peptide sequence. This method has been coupled to standard solid-phase peptide synthesis to prepare a <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of 1000 - 1700 template-bridged macrocycles, which derive from 384 sequences that mimic the aryl-rich consensus substrate LM of the mitotic regulator Pin 1. A new fluorescence polarization assay has been developed to support mixture-based screening of this library in 96 -well format. Hit validation, mixture deconvolution, and structure elucidation has led to the identification of two series of non-phosphorylated, macrocyclic ligands which bind the Pin 1 prolyl isomerase domain (Kd = 24 or 35 nM) with similar avidity to existing phosphorylated inhibitors. We show that binding affinity is directly influenced by core ring size and connectivity, in one example leading to a greater than seven-fold difference in affinity between isomeric macrocycles of identical ring size. These findings suggest that template-based methods should be useful for surveying the pharmacological properties of composite peptide macrocycles and for identifying new bioactive chemotypes by targeting protein surfaces via cognate consensus binding motifs...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of two parts describing independent projects {{that have led to}} the design, synthesis and validation of new techniques to initiate conformationally dynamic processes in peptides and proteins. In Part 1 the evolution of a small molecule antagonist of HIV- 1 viral entry into host cells is described. This research was conducted in collaboration with a number of collaborators to design and biologically characterize the inhibitors that were synthesized. Part 2 comprises the synthesis and photophysical validation of tetrazine-based phototriggers that can be incorporated with peptides and utilized to initiate conformational changes on the sub-nanosecond time scale for investigation by two-dimension infrared spectroscopy. Photophysical characterization of the newly developed phototriggers was conducted by Robin Hochstrasser and colleagues. ^ Small molecule CD 4 mimetics were discovered that can initiate the viral entry process {{in the absence of the}} native protein-protein interaction. The design, synthesis, and structure activity relationships of a <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of related congeners was initially utilized to identify small molecules with enhanced binding affinity for the HIV- 1 protein target, gp 120. One of the affinity-enhanced small molecule CD 4 mimetics proved useful in defined premature allosteric activation, a new method to release the energy stored within the HIV- 1 viral entry protein complex prior to cellular encounter. Unfortunately, the compounds described in this chapter also enhance viral entry in to certain host-cell models (i. e., the small molecules are viral entry agonists). Through virtual screening, design, and synthesis in conjunction with detailed biological and structural characterization of inhibitor-protein interactions, the HIV- 1 viral entry agonists were converted to antagonists utilizing interactions at two hotspots in the native protein-protein interaction. ^ In Part 2 the design, synthesis, and photochemical validation of the S,S-tetrazine phototrigger is described. The S,S-tetrazine chromophore photolyzes with sub-nanosecond time constants upon laser flash photolysis in the condensed phase. A method to inscribe the S,S-tetrazine phototrigger between the two cysteine residues in the peptide oxytocin, both in solution and during solid-phase peptide synthesis, was developed. ...|$|E

The advancement of linkers and cleavage strategies {{is of paramount importance}} for the success of this approach. This thesis is concerned with the development of a robust safety catch linker system aimed to allow a broad range of commonly used reagents to be employed in a synthetic sequence carried out on a solid support. Chapter 1 outlines the principles of solid phase {{organic synthesis}}, the terminology associated with this approach and the advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional solution phase methods. Common attachment and release strategies for various functional groups are described and the safety catch principle is introduced. Chapter 2 discusses the design features of the linker system. Proof of principle is demonstrated for the attachment and release strategies with a simple solution phase model system. Chapter 3 describes the adaptation of the linker system to the solid phase. Key transformations are modelled with solution phase experiments and subsequently applied to solid phase. The loading determination of the solid phase system is also described. Chapter 4 reports an assessment of the reactivity of the linker system in the coupling transformation of aliphatic alcohols and amines. The chemoselectivity and efficiency of the CAN debenzylation/cyclorelease protocol is also evaluated. Chapter 5 demonstrates the utility of the linker system with the optimisation of a simple synthetic sequence in solution followed by adaptation to the solid phase. The synthesis of a <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of aryl alcohols utilizing a Suzuki coupling on solid support is described. The attachment and release of amines is also demonstrated with solid phase examples. Chapter 6 examines the potential of the linker system as an analytical tool to assess the outcome of stereoselective transformations. A chiral auxiliary is attached to the solid phase by aid of the safety catch linker and released into solution. A solution phase model system is developed to aid preliminary investigations in solution prior to adaptation to the solid phase. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{create a}} college-level, {{four-year}} plan of library instruction in which assignments directly relate to students’ course work. To develop tools {{to assess the}} plan’s effectiveness in improving students’ library skills and contributing to their overall academic success. Design – Exploratory longitudinal cohort study employing <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> assignments, interviews, and questionnaires. Setting – Monteith College, one of eleven colleges at Wayne State University. Monteith was a small liberal arts college established in 1959 which stressed innovative teaching methods such as team-teaching, small-group discussion, and independent study (Worrell, 2002). Subjects – Teaching faculty from all three college divisions—social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities—and students at Monteith College. Over {{the course of the}} study the college employed between 15 and 30 faculty members and enrolled 300 to 700 students. Methods – The project team consisted of project director Patricia Knapp, a project librarian, and a project research analyst. The team worked with the teaching faculty to develop course-related library assignments. Students completed a series of assignments over several semesters as part of their course requirements. The assignment series changed {{over the course of the}} project. Students who entered in the fall of 1959 or the spring of 1960 completed Sequence A consisting of six assignments. Students who entered in the fall of 1960 completed Sequence B, six assignments that were a mixture of original and revised assignments. Students who entered in the spring or fall of 1961 completed two revised library assignments. In the summer of 1961, the investigators conducted the first of two small studies. They interviewed a random sample of 21 Monteith students about their experiences with the library and the required library assignments. The students also completed library performance tests such as choosing a subject heading to match a topic or deciphering an entry in a periodical index. This allowed the investigators to compare different measures of library competence and get feedback on the library assignments. In the summer of 1962, the investigators conducted a second small study of 40 Monteith students. The investigators evaluated the tests and other tools used in the first study. The investigators then analyzed student and faculty data collected from Sequences A, B, and C, and from the two sample studies. Data included faculty interviews and feedback from student participants in the sample studies. The investigators also analyzed questionnaire data and the completed student assignments. They analyzed data using nonparametric, small sample statistics. Main Results – Knapp’s results helped shape the final plan of instruction and assessment presented in her book-length published report The Monteith College Library Experiment. It should be stated again that the project objective was not to implement a plan of instruction and assessment but simply to develop one. One of the most important findings was that small sample studies can effectively test the reliability of library assignments. The sample studies allowed the team to “…define and measure library competence and to identify factors associated with its achievement” (Knapp, 1966, p. 17). On a different level, the project offered insight into the faculty-librarian relationship. The investigators found that faculty resisted librarian input into their courses. They also discovered that the most effective group size for developing library assignments was a small group of two to four people, but this sized group was conducive to informal meetings in which key players, often the librarian, were left out. When faculty did not share in decision-making, project morale was low. The project team reorganized and reassigned roles, and the project ran more smoothly. Knapp also learned about the faculty-student relationship. Knapp felt that some faculty simply passed on their knowledge to students rather than teaching students how to acquire it for themselves (Worrell, 2002). She found that student enthusiasm mirrored faculty enthusiasm about library assignments. Early in the project, faculty members presented library assignments to their students. The investigators discerned that both students and faculty were more amenable to the assignments when a librarian presented them and explained their purpose. Knapp (2000) agreed with Bruner who stated in The Process of Education that context is important when teaching any skill; students need to be able to relate the skills they are learning to the importance of why they are learning them (1960). Finally, Knapp learned that students need more than to understand library organization (such as cataloging and classification systems). Students also need to understand “the organization of scholarly communication” to foster true library competence (Knapp, 1966, p. 81). Whereas library organization concerns itself with subject and form, the organization of scholarship “reflect[s] discipline, ‘school,’ concept, and method” (Knapp, 2000, p. 10). Conclusion – The Monteith College Library Experiment ended in 1962 with a thoughtfully planned and tested program of library instruction. The final proposed program included 10 library assignments that were: of increasing complexity and aligned with the curriculum; intellectual with a focus on problem-solving; and feasible within the library’s parameters. Students would complete one or more of the assignments each semester for four years as part of specific course requirements. Knapp noted the program could be adapted to any college curriculum. It would require six years for implementation and assessment. This includes an initial year for planning in which teaching faculty and librarians would collaboratively develop course-related library assignments, four years for student completion of assignments, and a sixth year for assessment. Knapp outlined three levels of assessment. Investigators would assess the appropriateness of individual assignments through interviews and questionnaires collected from faculty and students, as well as completed student assignments. Knapp outlined two ways to assess library competence. First, Monteith faculty members would assess literature reviews in their subject specialties written by second semester seniors. Next, faculty from other Wayne State colleges would review papers from both Monteith and non-Monteith students to comparatively assess the students’ use of sources. Knapp proposed that faculty judgment would be the most valuable measure of the relationship between library competence and overall academic success. Knapp was prepared to implement her plan of instruction using all of her findings, but her proposal to move into phase two of the project was rejected by both the Office of Education, whose members cited economic reasons, and the Council on Library Resources, whose members were not satisfied that faculty were invested in the idea of curriculum-integrated library instruction (Worrell, 2002) ...|$|E
