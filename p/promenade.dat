5|$|Site {{preparation}} for L'Enfant <b>promenade</b> and plaza began in November 1965. Air rights over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $500 {{per year for}} 99 years on November 23, 1965. The actual groundbreaking for L'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays. The federal government was building the James V. Forrestal Building at {{the northern end of}} L'Enfant <b>promenade,</b> and the whole northern end of the <b>promenade</b> and the associated roadway was a year behind its construction schedule by June 1967. Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L'Enfant Plaza Corp's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules. The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and <b>promenade</b> opened to the public and businesses in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E

He felt the Chase <b>Promenade</b> might have served as a better forum and would have left the artist {{unfettered}} to choose from a wider range of pieces.|$|E

5|$|Second class' {{passengers}} were leisure tourists, academics, {{members of the}} clergy and middle class English and American families. The ship's musicians travelled in second class accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and for many of these passengers, their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. Second class children could read the children's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the second class <b>promenade.</b> Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the enclosed <b>promenade</b> in a stroller provided by the White Star Line.|$|E
