In one group of subjects, variable-ratio size was varied while the size of the lowest ratio was held constant. In a second group, the size of the lowest ratio was varied while variable-ratio size was held constant. For all subjects, the mean duration of postreinforcement pausing increased in the 2 -s component but not in the 8 -s component. Postrein-forcement pauses increased with increases in variable-ratio size (Group 1) and with increases in the lowest ratio (Group 2).

60|$|After {{some time}} {{he got up and}} went to the door of a room on the right of the verandah. That was the office. The office of Lingard and Co. He very seldom went in there. There was no {{business}} now, and he did not want an office. The door was locked, and he stood biting his lower lip, trying to think of the place where the key could be. Suddenly he remembered: in the women's room hung upon a nail. He went over to the doorway where the red curtain hung down in motionless folds, and hesitated for a moment before pushing it aside with his shoulder as if breaking down some solid obstacle. A great square of sunshine entering through the window lay on the floor. On the left he saw Mrs. Almayer's big wooden chest, the lid thrown back, empty; near it the brass nails of Nina's European trunk shone in the large initials N. A. on the cover. A few of Nina's dresses hung on wooden pegs, stiffened in a look of offended dignity at their abandonment. He remembered making the pegs himself and noticed that they were very good pegs. Where was the key? He looked round and saw it near the door where he stood. It was red with rust. He felt very much annoyed at that, and directly afterwards wondered at his own feeling. What did it matter? There soon would be no key--no door--nothing! He <b>paused,</b> <b>key</b> in hand, and asked himself whether he knew well what he was about. He went out again on the verandah and stood by the table thinking. The monkey jumped down, and, snatching a banana skin, absorbed itself in picking it to shreds industriously.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of conditioning systematic patterns of responding during brief discrete trials was studied by requiring hungry pigeons to key peck and then pause or to <b>pause</b> and then <b>key</b> peck {{in order to}} gain access to food. These schedules were highly effective in promoting decelerated and accelerated rates of responding, respectively, within individual trials; indeed, performance was quite similar to that observed when explicit external stimuli were correlated with “peck” and “pause” portions of the daily trials. Finally, schedules of reinforcement that did not selectively reinforce peck-pause or pause-peck patterns neither generated these patterns nor maintained them at the previous high levels. The results, therefore, confirm Shimp's (1976) proposal that organized groupings of discrete responses may function as operants—even in the absence of strict response-reinforcer contiguity...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiments}} evaluated whether {{transitions in}} reinforcer probability {{are necessary to}} induce attack in pigeons. In Experiment I, three of six pigeons exposed to response-contingent constant-probability food schedules and {{a photograph of a}} conspecific as a target exhibited sustained postreinforcement attack on the target. The postreinforcement pattern of attack developed {{over the course of the}} experiment and was accompanied by a reduction in the rate of postreinforcement key pecking and an increase in the postreinforcement <b>pause</b> in <b>key</b> pecking. These effects on key pecking resulted in unprogrammed variations in the probability of reinforcement which may have been responsible for the induction of attack. In Experiment II, the attack-inducing properties of a constant-probability response-independent food schedule were compared to a periodic food schedule matched for overall rate of food delivery and to a no-food condition. In addition to attack, the spatial location of the subjects was monitored during each interfood interval. The periodic and aperiodic food schedules generated very different patterns of spatial location. Postfood attack was induced by both food schedules, although the constant-probability schedule induced attack in fewer birds. The no-food condition was not effective in inducing attack in any birds. These experiments indicate that intermittent food schedules without reductions in reinforcer probability are sufficient to induce attack in some pigeons, although not as effective as schedules with transitions in reinforcer probability...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundFemale sexual {{receptivity}} {{offers an}} excellent model for complex behavioral decisions. The female must parse her own reproductive state, the external environment, and male sensory cues {{to decide whether}} to copulate. In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, virgin female receptivity has received relatively little attention, and its neural circuitry and individual behavioral components remain unmapped. Using a genome-wide neuronal RNAi screen, we identify a subpopulation of neurons responsible for pausing, a novel behavioral aspect of virgin female receptivity characterized in this study. ResultsWe show that Abdominal-B (Abd-B), a homeobox transcription factor, is required in developing neurons for high levels of virgin female receptivity. Silencing adult Abd-B neurons significantly decreased receptivity. We characterize two components of receptivity that are elicited in sexually mature females by male courtship: pausing and vaginal plate opening. Silencing Abd-B neurons decreased pausing but did not affect vaginal plate opening, demonstrating that these two components of female sexual behavior are functionally separable. Synthetic activation of Abd-B neurons increased pausing, but male courtship song alone was not sufficient to elicit this behavior. ConclusionsOur results provide an entry point to the neural circuit controlling virgin female receptivity. The female integrates multiple sensory cues from the male to execute discrete motor programs prior to copulation. Abd-B neurons control <b>pausing,</b> a <b>key</b> aspect of female sexual receptivity, in response to male courtship...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{alternative}} sources of food delivery on the key-peck responding of pigeons were examined. Pecking was maintained by a variable-interval 3 -min schedule. In {{the presence of this}} schedule in different conditions, either a variable-time 3 -min schedule delivering food independently of responding or an equivalent schedule that required a minimum 2 -s <b>pause</b> between a <b>key</b> peck and food delivery (a differential-reinforcement-of-other-behavior schedule) was added. The differential-reinforcement-of-other-behavior schedule reduced response rates more than did the variable-time schedule in most instances. The delay between a key peck and the next reinforcer consistently was longer under the differential-reinforcement-of-other-behavior schedule than under the variable-time schedule. Response rates and median delay between responses and reinforcers were negatively correlated. These results contradict earlier conclusions about the behavioral effects of alternative reinforcement. They suggest that an interpretation in terms of response–reinforcer contiguity is consistent with the data...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS“Reaching for Zen”:Practicing Vulnerability in LeadershipbyJaymee NgernwichitMaster of Fine Arts in Theatre and Dance (Design) University of California, San Diego, 2017 Professor Judith Dolan	As {{far back}} as I can remember, I've always wanted to posses the gift of drawing and medium control, to expunge from my dreams and demons the {{incredible}} urge to move another human being. I wished for a voice that could touch and inspire people despite life's hardships. Over the years of extreme and sometimes overzealous dedication (addiction) to attain that elusive artistic control, I lost control of who I was, what I honestly desired. Fear of uncertainty ravaged my innermost heart. 	Now {{nearing the end of}} this road, with the help of my mentors and colleagues I have come to the realization that a master's degree is half developing your process and half developing yourself as human being. You come to get a master's degree but what you are really learning is how to master yourself. You are your own piece of art. Everything evolves over time. The sacred <b>pause</b> is <b>key.</b> 	Once, I loathed failing and learned how to fear failure. Now, I have learned how embrace it, to sit with it and forgive myself for my shortcomings so that I may shift my perceptions and practice the art of vulnerability in leadership. This is an endless process and practice that only years of experience can foster without guarantee of success. And with that, I am humbled by this experience, strengthened by my challenges, and I sincerely hope that I am lucky enough to touch multitudes of people with my work someday...|$|R

40|$|The {{opening of}} Haydn’s Symphony No. 39 in G minor is {{interrupted}} by two unusually long grand pauses. These brief suspensions of the time continuum reveal Haydn’s search for new narrative strategies for a genre {{caught up in the}} tensions between the boisterous concert opener, courtly representation, the bourgeois concert hall and the demands of “connoisseurs. ” This use of the Generalpause points toward a period of upheaval in the development of symphonic forms in the 18 th century. A comparative analysis examining the primarily “punctuated” concept of form in the 18 th century in relation to the primarily thematic concept of form in the 19 th century and the synthesis of both in the writings of Anton Reicha can show that the process of developing formal functions becomes especially acute in Haydn’s Symphony No. 39, with the two grand <b>pauses</b> playing a <b>key</b> role. Such a reading of Haydn, which seeks to reconcile “historically informed” analysis with emphatic interpretation, illustrates how the spectacular grand pauses in the Symphony No. 39 can suggest a brief suspension of not only the work’s own immanent time but the historical time of 18 th-century music history...|$|R
40|$|Chloé. Attitudes is {{the very}} first {{exhibition}} dedicated to Chloé, {{a celebration of the}} Maison’s 60 -year contribution to fashion culture. Since 1952, its legacy of luxury prêt-à-porter clothing has consistently defined how modern women live. This spectacular and groundbreaking exhibition offers a playful interpretation of the Chloé spirit that spans seven decades. Featuring signature pieces from each of Chloé’s nine key designers – from the Maison’s progressive founder Gaby Aghion, to its present creative director Clare Waight Keller – the show is neither nostalgic nor chronological. It takes a thematic path through the very best of Chloé’s creativity, <b>pausing</b> at <b>key</b> moments within its history. This approach paints a picture of Chloé that is both familiar and yet unexpected. Iconic looks are presented alongside lesser-known yet equally influential designs. Many of these were rediscovered during the creation of the new archive developed since Waight Keller’s arrival. Most importantly, these are on display to the public for the very first time. The exhibition is curated and designed by renowned exhibition-maker Judith Clark and staged in the newly refurbished galleries of Le Palais de Tokyo. The centre’s exhibition space was expanded from 8, 000 to 22, 000 square metres in 2012, {{making it one of the}} largest cultural institutions devoted to contemporary culture in Europe. Chloé. Attitudes has been invited by the president of the palais, Jean de Loisy to inaugurate a cycle of exhibitions entitled “Fashion Program”, organised by estimated curators, celebrating key moments or outstanding figures in fashion history. The Chloé exhibition is presented as part of the autumn 2012 season of the Palais de Tokyo “imagine the imaginary” which explores the artist’s creative process from thought to creation. This theme is at the very heart of the Chloé. Attitudes concept. The exhibition presents the way in which la Maison Chloé has created an identifiable aesthetic and allure that has influenced women’s fashion. It is this ceaseless renewal of the imaginary that transforms the sensitivity of an era. The exhibition: Focusing equally on Chloé’s key designers and the Maison’s enduring themes, garment groupings serve to underscore Gaby Aghion’s original vision for the brand. The show encapsulates Aghion’s ambition to create an informal, stylish wardrobe for women who were no longer constrained by haute couture and its indoor lifestyle. This philosophy culminated in her first informal fashion show at the Café de Flore on Paris’s Left Bank in 1956. Visitors to the exhibition are also invited to consider these radical ideas from the perspectives of the celebrated designers under Aghion’s art direction: Gérard Pipart, Maxime de La Falaise, Karl Lagerfeld, Martine Sitbon, Stella McCartney, Phoebe Philo, Hannah MacGibbon and Clare Waight Keller. Seventy pieces drawn from the Maison’s newly formed archive introduce surprising new chapters to the brand’s traditional narrative. While Chloé’s beloved chiffon daywear prompts fond memories of the brand in the 1970 s, this association is challenged by the inclusion of bright, graphic prints from the 1960 s, references to the Bauhaus and details that echo the work of Aubrey Beardsley; vibrant and tongue-incheek surrealist elements mark the 1980 s. Never-before-published drawings dating from 1958 – 85 and iconic fashion photography by image-makers including Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, Jeanloup Sieff, David Bailey and Deborah Turbeville offer additional contexts for the clothing and suggest alternative interpretations of the classic Chloé woman...|$|R
