40|$|Genomic {{imprinting}} is a reversible {{phenomenon that}} affects the expression of genes depending on their parental origin. The best characterized human disorders resulting from an alteration of the imprinting process are Angelman and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndromes.</b> They are {{due to the lack}} of active maternal or paternal genes, respectively, from chromosome region 15 q 11 q 13. Most cases arise via interstitial deletions. We review evidence that other common cytogenetic alterations of this region, interstitial and supernumerary duplications, could be the reciprocal products of the deletions and are also affected by the imprinting phenomenon, given the predominance of maternally-derived duplications in patients ascertained due to developmental delays or autistic features...|$|R
40|$|Background It is {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{that there may}} be a genetic contribution to learning disability and neuropsychiatric disorders, stemming from evidence provided by family, twin and adoption studies, and from explicit syndromic conditions. Recently it has been recognized that in some cases the presentation of genetic syndromes (or discrete aspects of disorders) is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent. Such ‘parent-of-origin effects’ can be explained by a number of genetic mechanisms, a predominant one of which is genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting refers to the parent of origin-specific epigenetic marking of an allele of a gene, such that for some genes it is mainly the maternally inherited allele only that is expressed, whereas for others expression occurs mainly from the paternal copy. Methods Here we discuss the contribution of imprinted genes to mental dysfunction and learning disability, using clinical examples of association studies and explicit imprinting disorders (with particular emphasis to Angelman and <b>Prader–Willi</b> <b>syndromes),</b> and evidence from animal work. Results Clinical and animal studies strongly suggest that imprinted genes contribute to brain functioning, and when the genes or epigenetic processes are disrupted, this can give rise to neuropsychiatric problems. Another system to which imprinted genes provide a large contribute is the placenta and foetal development. Epidemiological studies suggest that this is also a key area in which dysregulation can give rise to learning difficulties. Conclusions Disruption of imprinted genes, or the epigenetic processes controlling them, can contribute to learning disability. These effects can be divided into two types: direct effects, such as those seen in explicit imprinting disorders such as Angelman and <b>Prader–Willi</b> <b>syndromes,</b> and indirect effects as manifest via changes in foetal programming...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{recurrent}} microdeletion syndrome causing mental retardation, epilepsy and variable facial and digital dysmorphisms. We describe nine affected individuals, including six probands: two with de novo deletions, two who inherited the deletion from an affected parent and two with unknown inheritance. The proximal breakpoint {{of the largest}} deletion is contiguous with breakpoint 3 (BP 3) of the <b>Prader-Willi</b> and Angelman <b>syndrome</b> region, extending 3. 95 Mb distally to BP 5. A smaller 1. 5 -Mb deletion has a proximal breakpoint within the larger deletion (BP 4) and shares the same distal BP 5. This recurrent 1. 5 -Mb deletion contains six genes, including a candidate gene for epilepsy (CHRNA 7) that is probably responsible for the observed seizure phenotype. The BP 4 -BP 5 region undergoes frequent inversion, suggesting a possible link between this inversion polymorphism and recurrent deletion. The frequency of these microdeletions in mental retardation cases is approximately 0. 3 % (6 / 2, 082 tested), a prevalence {{comparable to that of}} Williams, Angelman and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndromes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Copy number {{variations}} {{have been}} found in patients with neural tube abnormalities. In this study, we performed genome-wide screening using high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization in three children with tethered spinal cord syndrome and two healthy parents. Of eight copy number variations, four were non-polymorphic. These non-polymorphic copy number variations were associated with Angelman and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndromes,</b> and microcephaly. Gene function enrichment analysis revealed that COX 8 C, a gene associated with metabolic disorders of the nervous system, was located in the copy number variation region of Patient 1. Our results indicate that array-based comparative genomic hybridization can be used to diagnose tethered spinal cord syndrome. Our results may help determine the pathogenesis of tethered spinal cord syndrome and prevent occurrence of this disease...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSerotonin (5 -HT) is a neuromodulator-transmitter {{influencing}} global brain function. Past {{and present}} findings illustrate {{a prominent role}} for 5 -HT in the modulation of ponto-medullary autonomic circuits. 5 -HT is also involved in the control of neurotrophic processes during pre- and postnatal development of neural circuits. The functional implications of 5 -HT are particularly illustrated in the alterations to the serotonergic system, as seen {{in a wide range}} of neurological disorders. This article reviews the role of 5 -HT in the development and control of respiratory networks in the ponto-medullary brainstem. The review further examines the role of 5 -HT in breathing disorders occurring at different stages of life, in particular, the neonatal neurodevelopmental diseases such as Rett, sudden infant death and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndromes,</b> adult diseases such as sleep apnoea and mental illness linked to neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|Several genetic {{phenomena}} do {{not appear}} to conform the Mendel's low {{in the sense that they}} are not inherited in simple way through the generations. Such exceptions to Mendel's laws include new mutations, changes in chromosomes, expanded triplet sequences, and genomic imprinting. Many genetic diseases involve spontaneous mutations that are not inherited from generation to generation. Changes in chromosomes include nondisjunction, which is the most important cause of mental retardation, the trisomy of Dowen syndrome. Expanded triplet repeats are responsible for the next important cause of mental retardation, fragile X, and for Huntington's disease. Genomic imprinting occurs when the expression of a gene depends on whether it is inherited from the mother or from the father. In this paper the phenomenon of genomic imprinting is explained on the occurrence of Angelman and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndromes.</b> It's essential for the counselor to be able during the genetic counseling to recognize this phenomenon and to make a proper decision...|$|R
25|$|The first {{imprinted}} genetic disorders to {{be described}} in humans were the reciprocally inherited <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Angelman syndrome.

25|$|Feeding: A 2012 paper {{suggested}} that oxytocin neurons in the para-ventricular hypothalamus {{in the brain}} may {{play a key role}} in suppressing appetite under normal conditions and that other hypothalamic neurons may trigger eating via inhibition of these oxytocin neurons.

25|$|There {{are many}} growth {{abnormalities}} associated with 1p36 deletion syndrome. One common problem is delayed growth or difficulty in gaining weight. Even {{though some of}} the children may eat well, they still may not grow normally. In contrast, some children may develop hyperphagia, which is overeating, and may become obese. These children clinically resemble children with <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Developmental delay has also been severe in the patients with the Prader-Willi like characteristics.|$|E
40|$|There are {{at least}} 6 well-studied {{imprinting}} domains on human autosomes. Each domain is under the regulatory control of an ‘imprinting centre’ that harbours a differentially methylated region. A number of molecular mechanisms result in differential silencing of some genes within these domains and gene expression is tightly regulated in normal individuals. However, this makes them vulnerable to naturally occurring genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Nine recognisable developmental syndromes have been described due to abnormalities within these 6 domains: transient neonatal diabetes (TND; at 6 q 24); Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (at 11 p 15. 5; 2 imprinted domains); maternal and paternal uniparental disomy syndromes (at 14 q 32); Angelman and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndromes</b> (at 15 q 11 - 13), and pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1 b (at 20 q 12 - 13). Furthermore, it is now recognised that involvement at multiple domains can occur simultaneously and result {{in what has been}} described as the hypomethylation syndrome. TND and BWS are discussed in more detail as examples of imprinting disorders...|$|R
50|$|The {{mainstay}} of diagnosis is genetic testing, specifically DNA-based methylation testing {{to detect the}} absence of the paternally contributed <b>Prader-Willi</b> syndrome/Angelman <b>syndrome</b> (PWS/AS) region on chromosome 15q11-q13. Such testing detects over 97% of cases. Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis of PWS in all individuals, but especially those who are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds or in those individuals who have atypical findings.|$|R
40|$|In the {{accompanying}} paper [1], David Haig describes {{the conflict over}} the inter-birth interval (IBI) in humans. Evolutionary theory predicts a conflict between a mother (who favors a shorter IBI) and her breastfeeding infant (who favors a longer delay before the mother’s next child). Haig argues that selection on the infant to delay the next pregnancy {{is likely to have}} been strong over human history, and that waking to breastfeed at night represents a possible adaptation {{on the part of the}} infant, as it will tend to delay the mother’s resumption of ovulation. The argument is further supported by sleep patterns observed in infants with Angelman and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>Syndromes,</b> which reveal the extension of this conflict to imprinted genes within the offspring, where alleles favor a shorter IBI when maternally inherited and a longer IBI when paternally inherited. But what are the actual consequences of this conflict for human health? The evolutionary model indicates an arms race between the mother and infant strategies. That arms race will escalate until it reaches some sort of resolution. The cause and nature of that resolution will determine the severity of the fitness an...|$|R
25|$|Uniparental disomy {{denotes the}} {{situation}} where both chromosomes of a chromosome pair are inherited from the same parent and are therefore identical. This phenomenon most likely {{is the result of}} a pregnancy that started as a trisomy due to nondisjunction. Since most trisomies are lethal, the fetus only survives because it loses one of the three chromosomes and becomes disomic. Uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 is, for example, seen in some cases of <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Angelman syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{genetic disease}} is well {{understood}} {{and it is}} clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of Angelman syndrome and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndrome.</b> These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially hemizygous because of genomic imprinting, and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.|$|E
25|$|Katie Price {{gave birth}} to her first child, son Harvey Price, in Brighton in May 2002. Harvey's father is former footballer Dwight Yorke. Yorke denied {{paternity}} until Price proved it by DNA tests. Price has said she had intended to have at least one birth shown live over the Internet, but she later decided to keep it private. He was found to be blind, having a condition known as septo-optic dysplasia, meaning that the development of his optic nerve was unpredictable.

40|$|The use {{of growth}} hormone therapy in {{children}} with idiopathic short stature is a subject of great ethical debate. Problems like: benefits, side effects, safety, costs are discussed. Over the past two decades, the indications for the treatment with growth hormone (GH) in children have changed dramatically, widening from the classic GH deficiency to Turner’s <b>syndrome,</b> <b>Prader-Willi’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> chronic renal insufficiency, small-for-gestational age and particularly idiopathic short stature that become medicalised, allowing even the short normal child to become the subject for GH therapy. Every new therapeutical method has the tendency to overcome the initial limitations. The idiopathic short stature is a heterogeneous group and a diagnosis of exclusion [...] The ethical debate associated with the attempt to enhance the stature of a short but otherwise healthy child is extremely important. The GH treatment involves considerable financial resources {{which could lead to}} objections regarding the possible infringement of the principle of equal chances in case of limited access to treatment due to economic considerations. The principle of autonomy and responsibility in children is a very delicate issue, making the medical decision to use growth hormone individual and disputed (the existence of children who want to be small as adults is questionable). More long-term studies and ethical debates are needed in order to assess opportunity, consequences, efficiency and tolerance of GH treatment {{in children with}} short stature...|$|R

25|$|Despite the price, the 1990s {{became an}} era of {{experimentation}} to see what else growth hormone could help. The medical literature of the decade contains hundreds of reports of small trials of GH use in nearly every type of growth failure and shortness imaginable.

Patients with Bardet–Biedl syndrome and <b>Prader–Willi</b> <b>syndrome,</b> genetic syndromes which can lead to obesity in patients, also suffer from learning disabilities and muscular weakness, but all those who knew Lambert agreed that he was highly intelligent, was extremely strong physically, and, except for erysipelas and venous insufficiency (varicose veins) in his legs, did not suffer from any health problems. One contemporary commentator remarked that [...] "Mr. Lambert scarcely knows {{what it is to be}} ailing or indisposed".

Inv dup(15) chromosomes are commonly associated with mental retardation, epilepsy, behavioral problems and structural malformations. Though epilepsies associated with inv dup(15) chromosomes are often intractable, there have been very few reports regarding the seizure manifestations or types. We report a patient with severe mental retardation and intractable epilepsy, associated with an inv dup(15) chromosome.

40|$|Imprinting is an {{epigenetic}} {{mechanism that}} restrains {{the expression of}} about 100 genes to one allele depending on its parental origin. Several imprinted genes are implicated in neurodevelopmental brain disorders, such as autism, Angelman, and <b>Prader-Willi</b> <b>syndromes.</b> However, how expression of these imprinted genes is regulated during neural development is poorly understood. Here, using single and double KO animals for the transcription factors Neurogenin 2 (Ngn 2) and Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl 1), {{we found that the}} expression of a specific subset of imprinted genes is controlled by these proneural genes. Using in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR, we determined that five imprinted transcripts situated at the Dlk 1 -Gtl 2 locus (Dlk 1, Gtl 2, Mirg, Rian, Rtl 1) are upregulated in the dorsal telencephalon of Ngn 2 KO mice. This suggests that Ngn 2 influences the expression of the entire Dlk 1 -Gtl 2 locus, independently of the parental origin of the transcripts. Interestingly 14 other imprinted genes situated at other imprinted loci were not affected by the loss of Ngn 2. Finally, using Ngn 2 /Ascl 1 double KO mice, we show that the upregulation of genes at the Dlk 1 -Gtl 2 locus in Ngn 2 KO animals requires a functional copy of Ascl 1. Our data suggest a complex interplay between proneural genes in the developing forebrain that control the level of expression at the imprinted Dlk 1 -Gtl 2 locus (but not of other imprinted genes). This raises the possibility that the transcripts of this selective locus participate in the biological effects of proneural genes in the developin...|$|R

Among the latter group, no breakpoint heterogeneity could be detected with the available probes, and one YAC (810 f 11) showed a reduced signal on each inv dup(15), compared with that on normal chromosomes 15. The lack of breakpoint heterogeneity may be the result of a U-type exchange involving particular sequences on either homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids.
