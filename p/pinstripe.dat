50|$|Contrary to {{baseball}} legend, the Yankees {{did not start}} wearing <b>pinstriped</b> uniforms to make Babe Ruth look slimmer in the late 1920s and 1930s.

50|$|Although found {{mostly in}} men's suits, {{any type of}} fabric can be <b>pinstriped.</b> The Chicago Cubs' {{baseball}} uniforms have had <b>pinstripes</b> since 1907 and they are recognized as the first Major League Baseball team to incorporate <b>pinstriping</b> into a baseball uniform.

5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making his way across the islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, <b>Pinstripe</b> Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E

50|$|A <b>pinstriping</b> brush is {{the tool}} of {{traditional}} free hand pinstripers use for <b>pinstriping.</b> Freehand <b>pinstriping</b> {{is the most}} difficult method of <b>pinstriping</b> and the brush is an important tool for design. <b>Pinstriping</b> brushes have several different designs, Swords, Daggers, and Flats, as well as Double line brushes. The brush consists of a small wood dowel handle, string or brass fixture with adhesive and brush hairs traditionally made from squirrel hair (confusingly called camel hair). The small wood dowel is balanced so pinstripers can freely spin the brush between their fingers. The dowel's short length is so the brush does not hit the palm of the hand while the brush is placed in-between the index finger and thumb. The hair of a <b>pinstriping</b> brush is relatively long at approximately 2 inches,or more, compared to most artistic brushes of a similar size. This long length is to hold the necessary amount of paint to pull a long line.|$|R

5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a <b>pinstripe</b> suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
