The bridge was dedicated on August 20, 1938. In 1991, a new bridge was completed to the south, and the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was preserved in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> West Virginia Division of Highways, due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Eddermys Sanchez {{represented}} Belize in men's judo. He qualified {{by being}} awarded an invitational <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Tripartite Commission in June 2012.

He was the oldest person to represent Belize at the London Games at the age of 32, and made his first appearance in the quadrennial event. Sanchez faced Miklós Ungvári of Hungary in the Round of 32 after receiving a bye and was defeated by his opponent after 19 seconds and therefore eliminated from the competition.|$|E

After contractors surveyed the complex the final number of 2,390 added seats with five additional suites including more parking, restrooms and concessions was determined in December 2014 to increase capacity to a total of 67,890. The seating was put in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> summer of 2015.|$|E

They operated independently until they obtained official recognition from their home country's Scouting organization. In the United States, attempts at Cub programs began as early as 1911, but official recognition was not obtained until 1930.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the longest}} Wimbledon men's singles final in history, {{clocking}} in at four hours and forty-eight minutes. The match also featured numerous rain delays which meant the match finished in near darkness, at 21:15 BST, almost seven hours since the match started at 14:35 BST. It {{was to be the}} last Wimbledon final to be significantly affected by rain, as a retractable roof was being installed at Centre Court and would be in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Wimbledon Championships.|$|E
5|$|A {{reported}} {{block on}} player transfers into the club, set in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hull City board on 28 July 2010 until transfers out would substantially reduce the £39million-per-year wage bill, at first {{cast doubt on}} the new manager's efforts to build a squad capable of a quick return to the Premier League; nevertheless, Pearson brought several transfers and loan signings into the club in his bid to strengthen the squad for the season's campaign. The team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 years. This 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City {{on the last day of}} the 2010–11 season, Hull losing the match 3–0.|$|E
5|$|After {{narrowly}} surviving {{a vote of}} {{no confidence}} by 17 votes to 14 {{at a meeting of}} the party's Executive Committee in Glasgow on 16 May 2015, Murphy announced that he would step down as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in June. Stating that he wanted to have a successor in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> summer, he confirmed that he would no longer be standing for a seat in the Scottish Parliament. Before relinquishing the leadership role, Murphy drew up proposals for a number of party reforms, including the adoption of a one-member, one-vote ballot for future leadership contests. His resignation took effect on 13 June after his reforms had been provisionally accepted by Labour's executive committee. A timetable was also set out that would see a new leader elected on 15 August, while Gray was appointed as acting leader. Dugdale and Macintosh stood in the contest to choose Murphy's successor; Dugdale was subsequently elected as Scottish Labour's new leader with a 72% share of the vote. At the same time, Rowley became her deputy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time of Ranulph's {{death in}} 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there {{on the death of}} Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of October.|$|E

5|$|Cabral's discovery, {{and even}} his resting place {{in the land of}} his birth, had been almost {{completely}} forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition. This began to change beginning in the 1840s when Emperor Dom Pedro II, successor and son of Pedro I, sponsored research and publications dealing with Cabral's life and expedition through the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. This was part of the Emperor's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among Brazil's diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique Portuguese-speaking empire, surrounded by Hispanic-American Republics. The initial resurgence of interest in Cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his resting <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen (later Viscount of Porto Seguro). The completely neglected state in which Cabral's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Brazil and Portugal—the latter then ruled by Pedro II's eldest sister, Maria II.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{security}} regulations put in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Olympic organisers, spectators were {{not permitted to}} stand roadside along the course. Several prominent figures in cycling protested against this decision, including UCI president Pat McQuaid and two Australian riders, Stuart O'Grady and Cadel Evans, who competed in the men's race. McQuaid and O'Grady felt {{that the absence of}} people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but this plea was ignored.|$|E
