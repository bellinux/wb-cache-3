5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore <b>print</b> <b>color</b> fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore <b>print</b> <b>color,</b> fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch pine forests. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} has been {{reported}} as ranging in color from pinkish, to pinkish-brown, to rosy brown, to vinaceous-fawn. The variation in spore <b>print</b> <b>color</b> results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded. Spores are roughly oblong to oval, smooth, hyaline (translucent) to pale brown, and measure 11–17 by 4–5.5µm. They are covered in a gelatinous sheath. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, two- and four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 25–35 by 10–14µm. Pleurocystidia (found on the tube walls) are roughly cylindrical to fuse-shaped with rounded tips, and measure 37–50 by 5–8µm. Cheilocystidia (on the tube edges) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and measure 23–40 by 6–8µm. Caulocystidia {{at the top of}} the stipe have various shapes and dimensions of 25–45 by 10–15µm; at the stipe base, the caulocystidia are 30–40 by 7–23µm and are mostly club-shaped to roughly spherical to tear-shaped. The cap cuticle comprises a single layer of tangled hyphae that are 4–6µm thick.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The color {{reproduction}} {{is based on}} visual perception. The psychophysics experiments present the light source; illuminants and view background affect the results of color matching. Paper is a typical substrate for <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> matching and effects <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> greatly. Now almost all of print papers contain optical brightening agents, which changes significantly the <b>color</b> appearance of <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> and makes <b>color</b> shifting of <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> matching. This paper used CAT 02 chromatic adaptation models to transform the measurements of <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> in paper with and without OBA, compared the effect of <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> matching between before and after transforming with display, present the method using chromatic adaptation transforms to improve the accurate of <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> matching...|$|R

500|$|The spore <b>print</b> <b>color</b> {{ranges from}} brown to olive-brown. Spores are spindle shaped, {{measuring}} 15–19 long by 5–6µm. They have a smooth surface, and are inamyloid (i.e., not staining with Melzer's reagent). [...] The cap flesh is bilateral and imamyloid. The cystidia on the pores are present as conspicuous pleuro- and cheilocystidia. The cap cuticle is present as a hymeniform layer. Clamp connections are absent.|$|E
500|$|In its taxonomic history, {{the species}} {{has also been}} placed in Geophila by Lucien Quélet in 1886, and Psilocybe by Petter Karsten in 1879. Psilocybe {{specialist}} Gastón Guzmán excluded the taxon from the latter genus in his 1983 monograph, based on its roughened spores that lacked a germ pore, pale spore print, stem texture, and the tawny basal mycelium. Guzmán, who examined Smith's US collections, suggested that the material might be more appropriately considered a Galerina, [...] but Redhead and Smith noted that several features of Mythicomyces corneipes are inconsistent with placement in Galerina, including spore <b>print</b> <b>color,</b> presence of , stem texture, and tawny basal mycelium.|$|E

40|$|In {{a reverse}} Stroop task, {{observers}} {{respond to the}} meaning of a color word irrespective of the color in which the word is printed—for example, the word red may be printed in the congruent color (red), an incongruent color (e. g., blue), or a neutral color (e. g., white). Although reading of color words in this task is often thought to be neither facilitated by congruent <b>print</b> <b>colors</b> nor interfered with incongruent <b>print</b> <b>colors,</b> this interference has been detected by using a response method that does not give any bias in favor of processing of word meanings or processing of <b>print</b> <b>colors.</b> On the other hand, evidence for the presence of facilitation in this task has been scarce, even though this facilitation is theoretically possible. By modifying the task such that participants respond to a stimulus color word by pointing to a corresponding response word on a computer screen with a mouse, the present study investigated the possibility that not only interference but also facilitation would take place in a reverse Stroop task. Importantly, in this study, participants’ responses were dynamically tracked by recording the entire trajectories of the mouse. Arguably, this method provided richer information about participants’ performance than traditional measures such as reaction time and accuracy, allowing for more detailed (and thus potentially more sensitive) investigation of facilitation and interference in the reverse Stroop task. These trajectories showed that the mouse’s approach toward correct response words was significantly delayed by incongruent <b>print</b> <b>colors</b> but not affected by congruent <b>print</b> <b>colors,</b> demonstrating that only interference, not facilitation, was present in the current task. Implications of these findings are discussed within a theoretical framework in which the strength of association between a task and its response method plays a critical role in determining how word meanings and <b>print</b> <b>colors</b> interact in reverse Stroop tasks...|$|R

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost as Boletus chromapes. Cataloging the bolete fungi of New England, Frost published 22 new bolete species in that 1874 publication. Rolf Singer placed the species in Leccinum in 1947 {{due to the}} scabrous dots on the stipe, even though the spore <b>print</b> <b>color</b> was not typical of that genus. In 1968, [...] Alexander H. Smith and Harry Delbert Thiers thought that Tylopilus was a more appropriate fit as they believed the pinkish-brown spore print—characteristic of that genus—to be of greater taxonomic significance. Other genera to which it has been shuffled in its taxonomic history include Ceriomyces by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909, and Krombholzia by Rolf Singer in 1942; Ceriomyces and Krombholzia have since been subsumed into Boletus and Leccinum, respectively. Additional synonyms include Tylopilus cartagoensis, described by Wolfe & Bougher in 1993, and a later combination based on this name, Leccinum cartagoense.|$|E
500|$|The two-colored bolete {{has several}} {{species that are}} similar to it and the {{differences}} are minute in most cases. Boletus sensibilis differs from the two-colored bolete in that it has an immediate bruising reaction and is poisonous, causing stomach upset if ingested, and in some cases a severe allergic reaction. B.miniato-olivaceus has a full yellow stem and slightly lighter cap coloration. It also has a more immediate bruising reaction than the two-colored bolete and the stem is slightly longer in proportion to the cap. B.peckii differs from the two-colored bolete by having a smaller average size, a rose red cap that turns almost brown with age, flesh that is paler in color, and a bitter taste. B.speciosus differs from the two-colored bolete by having a fully reticulated stem, more brilliant colors, and very narrow cylindrical spores. Hortiboletus rubellus subsp. rubens and the two-colored bolete have been found to have almost no difference between them, and they cannot be distinguished by appearance alone. Boletus bicoloroide is very similar to the two-colored bolete, the major differences between them being B.bicoloroide has only been found in Michigan and has larger spores. B.bicoloroide is also slightly larger than the two-colored bolete, around [...] longer in the stem and [...] in the cap. This species has not been as thoroughly researched as the two-colored bolete, thus macrochemical tests, edibility, distribution range, and the spore <b>print</b> <b>color</b> are all unknown.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if current color matching procedures produce the desired color on the final printed package. A problem with printed items is that multiple departments and companies are involved with the choosing, specifying and approving of colors. This study evaluated one part of this procedure - the <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> standard. The <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> standard is used by the printer and packaging buyer to assure color consistency. However, there is often little understanding of light sources, color perception, chromatic adaptation, metamerism and ink dry-back. Color reference systems, like Pantone, recommend updating their color standards every six months to assure <b>color</b> consistency. Yet, <b>printed</b> <b>color</b> standards that are produced with less inert inks and a more reactive surface, are often used for years. This study evaluated the drying and ageing characteristics of ink both visually and spectrophotometrically, and showed that the current color matching procedures need to be improved to reduce the chance of off colors...|$|R
