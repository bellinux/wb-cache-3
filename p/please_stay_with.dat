5000|$|By 1945, the Sullivan {{brothers}} joined George with Arnold's show. They {{played a}} comedy act called Cicero and Oscar, opening shows for Arnold and His Tennessee Plowboys. George was Cicero and Rollin was Oscar. One evening the troupe {{stopped at a}} hotel. [...] "While we was checking in, this black man, a porter, was coming down the steps just covered with dirty linen. The desk clerk looked up and said, ‘Lonzo! Don’t you ever come down those front steps with dirty linen anymore,’" [...] recounted Rollin. Arnold then changed Cicero to Lonzo. According to Rollin, they would [...] "go out on the stage, and boy, we’d wang-bang them, get them all laughing {{and having a good}} time and Oscar got 20 minutes before Arnold. Then we introduced Eddy. Eddy came out on the stage, and he would sing ‘Mommy <b>Please</b> <b>Stay</b> Home <b>with</b> Me,’ and they’d all start bawling." [...] Rollin continued on the electric mandolin, recording for Arnold on November 21, 1945. By Arnold’s next two recording dates on March 20 and September 24, 1946, all three were playing as session musicians: George played bass and Johnny Sullivan played guitar.|$|R
