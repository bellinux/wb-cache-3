40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor protein (estrophilin) {{was determined}} in specimens from 359 primary breast cancers and from metastatic tumors of 214 patients. Ninety-eight patients were eventually treated by {{some form of}} endocrine therapy: 82 patients were treated by ablative therapy, and 16 by hormonal additive treatment. The records of 81 of the 98 patients whose tumors were characterized for estrogen receptor content and who had received some type of endocrine therapy were reviewed by a peer review group that assessed the objective data for these patients regarding objective remission or failure to treatment. A <b>positive</b> estrophilin <b>determination</b> was defined as receptor content greater than 250 fmole per gram of tumor for premenopausal females and greater than 750 fmole per gram of tumor for postmenopausal and previously castrated patients. Estrogen receptor determinations may be made from tumor specimens as small as 200 mg. Sixty-nine patients underwent some form of ablative therapy. Twenty-seven of these patients {{were found to have}} significant receptor determinations. Of those patients in whom a definite determination was made of their post-treatment response, roughly two-thirds experienced objective remissions. None of the 42 patients with negative estrogen receptor determination experienced an objective remission to ablative endocrine therapy. Only one of 6 patients with negative determinations benefited from additive hormonal therapy; 4 of 6 patients with <b>positive</b> <b>determinations</b> benefited from additive therapy. Not all women with receptor containing mammary cancer will respond favorably to endocrine therapy, but those patients whose tumors lack a critical amount of estrophilin have little chance of benefit from either endocrine ablation or hormone administration. The estrogen receptor content of the primary tumor indicates the hormonal dependency of the tumor and may be used to predict the response to endocrine treatment when recurrent disease appears...|$|R

His son, his housekeeper, and his lawyer, had all three tried over and over again to get him to make a will; and had never shaken his obstinate resolution to put off performing the only business duty he was ever known to neglect.

We focus on the three most extensively studied of these mice, Trp 53 +/-, Tg/AC, and RasH 2, and compare their performance with the traditional 2 -year rodent bioassay. Data on 99 chemicals were evaluated. Using the International Agency for Research on Cancer/Report on Carcinogens determinations for the carcinogenicity of these chemicals to humans as the standard for comparison, we evaluated a variety of potential testing strategies ranging from individual transgenic models to combinations of these three models {{with each other and with}} traditional rodent assays. The individual transgenic models made the "correct" <b>determinations</b> (<b>positive</b> for carcinogens; negative for noncarcinogens) for 74 - 81 % of the chemicals, with an increase to as much as 83 % using combined strategies (e. g., Trp 53 +/- for genotoxic chemicals and RasH 2 for all chemicals). For comparison, identical analysis of chemicals in this data set that were tested in the 2 -year, two-species rodent bioassay yielded correct determinations for 69 % of the chemicals. However, although the transgenic models had a high percentage of correct determinations, they did miss a number of known or probable human carcinogens, whereas the bioassay missed none of these chemicals. Therefore, we also evaluated mixed strategies using transgenic models and the rat bioassay. These strategies yielded approximately 85 % correct determinations, missed no carcinogens, and cut the number of <b>positive</b> <b>determinations</b> for human noncarcinogens in half. Overall, the transgenic models performed well, but important issues of validation and standardization need further attention to permit their regulatory acceptance and use in human risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: We {{face the}} absence of {{optimized}} standards to guide normalization, comparative analysis, and interpretation of data sets. One aspect {{of this is that}} current methods of statistical analysis do not adequately utilize the information inherent in the large data sets generated in a microarray experiment and require a tradeoff between detection sensitivity and specificity. Results: We present a multistep procedure for analysis of mRNA expression data obtained from cDNA array methods. To identify and classify differentially expressed genes, results from standard paired t-test of normalized data are compared with those from a novel method, denoted an associative analysis. This method associates experimental gene expressions presented as residuals in regression analysis against control averaged expressions to a common standard—the family of similarly computed residuals for low variability genes derived from control experiments. By associating changes in expression of a given gene to a large family of equally expressed genes of the control group, this method utilizes the large data sets inherent in microarray experiments to increase both specificity and sensitivity. The overall procedure is illustrated by tabulation of genes whose expression differs significantly between Snell dwarf mice (dw/dw) and their phenotypically normal littermates (dw/+, +/+). Of the 2352 genes examined only 450 – 500 were expressed above the background levels observed in nonexpressed genes and of these 120 were established as differentially expressed in dwarf mice at a significance level that excludes appearance of false <b>positive</b> <b>determinations.</b> Contact...|$|R

In the early twenty-first century this was confirmed by the first extensive exact cladistic analyses. In 2003 both David Unwin and Alexander Kellner introduced a clade Campylognathoididae; within Unwin's terminology this clade is the sister clade of the Breviquartossa within the Lonchognatha; applying Kellner's terminology it is the most basal offshoot within the Novialoidea.

30|$|In summary, Yelp {{offers a}} good {{opportunity}} to researchers who are interested in measuring and analyzing service quality of business venues with a high spatial resolution. Geo-localized venues could tell researchers where and how good a business venue (e.g, restaurant, bar, retail, etc.) is. In this regard, some researchers have tried to use Yelp reviews to analyze ratings of business venues from different perspectives, including influence of consumer reviews on purchase decisions (e.g., [14, 20]), fraud and credibility of reviews (e.g., [12, 15]), prediction of venue ratings (see [6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 29]), venue recommendation [4, 13, 22, 30]. Although more and more researchers are interested in Yelp data, exploiting geo-spatial information of Yelp data is missing in most of the aforementioned studies. In this paper, by exploiting geo-spatial information in Yelp data, we focus on spatial patterns of business venues with different levels of ratings. In this paper, we chosen a spatially constrained clustering method named ‘AMOEBA’ to identify clusters of high and low ratings. Basically, there are two reasons why we choose the AMOEBA algorithm in this study. First, compared to ordinary clustering methods (e.g., k-means and DBSCAN), spatially constrained clustering methods are less sensitive to spatial distance and are more suitable for spatially clustering applications. Second, the AMOEBA algorithm support identifying irregularly shaped spatial clusters; while most existing cluster identification techniques are dedicated to identifying circular spatial clusters. Those cluster identification algorithms make the implicit assumption that clusters are circular and compact regions [3]. Assuming that clusters are circular may lead to incorrect cluster size and false <b>positive</b> <b>determinations</b> [8]. Moreover, we compare spatial patterns of venues’ ratings by venue category in terms of similarity in spatial distribution of average rating of venues. Additionally, we compare the results based on Yelp restaurants with the results based on Foursquare restaurants to discuss the reliability of Yelp data.|$|R
