40|$|A {{vacuum pump}} that was {{integral}} to a pitch impregnation system had rapidly deteriorated, leading to compromise in {{quality of products}} being manufactured. It was found that a particular vacuum impeller rotor group had worn, with unacceptable vacuum levels being the result. A replacement rotor was installed whilst cause of premature failure was investigated. However, {{in a matter of}} just months of service, the replacement impeller group also deteriorated. Finding the underlying mechanism of failure and developing a cost effective solution to the problem became paramount in terms of both product quality and rapidly increasing production cost. It was determined that the root cause of failure was stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The leaded red brass vacuum <b>pump</b> <b>vane</b> rotors had become sensitised as a result of ammonia liberated directly from the coal tar pitch impregnation medium. It was determined that changing the material of construction to a stainless steel alternative would not provide a cost or process effective solution. Spray coating the brass vane rotors with an epoxy coating presented a quick simple and cost effective solution to the problem...|$|E
40|$|The modal {{analysis}} of the centrifugal pump and its assembly is performed using FEM technology. The mathematical model and FEA model are built for the original centrifugal casing and simulation is made to find the pump natural frequencies. The first ten natural frequencies were compared to pump operating speed and their multiples up to <b>pump</b> <b>vane</b> passing frequency as per HIS (Hydraulic Institute Standards - 9. 6. 4 - 2000) guidelines. In the original design, the first natural frequency in vertical direction of the pump {{is found to be}} thecause for resonance at the first multiple speed of the pump. The first natural frequency of the original model was found to be 63. 25 Hz which is very close to 62. 5 Hz of the pump operating speed by a margin of 1. 2 %. As per HIS clause 9. 6. 4. 4, the first natural frequency should be 10 % above or below the pump operating speed. Finally, the model was modified by stiffening the pump pedestals and again FEA analysis was carried out to find the natural frequencies. As a result of modification in design, the first natural frequency was increased to 74. 31 Hz which is above 10 % the pump operating speed i. e., 62. 5 Hz. Hence, the results of the modified design aresatisfied with HIS clause. The results also show that the higher the stiffness of the pump, higher the natural frequency is...|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> has {{a circular}} rotor rotating inside a larger circular cavity. The centers {{of these two}} circles are offset, causing eccentricity.

On the intake side of the <b>pump,</b> the <b>vane</b> chambers are increasing in volume. These increasing-volume vane chambers are filled with fluid forced in by the inlet pressure.

40|$|Variable {{displacement}} <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> represent one of {{the most}} innovative type of pump for automotive engines. The <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> with a sliding ring, is a mechanism that makes it possible to change the capacity of the pump {{as a function of the}} engine speed, allowing to optimize of the oil flow, according to the engine demand, with considerable power saving. The main components of a variable displacement <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are: <b>vanes,</b> rotor, inner rings and a sliding ring. During operation, the vanes are in contact with the inner surface of the outer (sliding) ring due to the effect of centrifugal loads; in addition high slip velocities occur in the contact area; as a consequence, a critical aspect of this kind of pumps is represented by the wear which takes place on the contact surfaces. Another potential mechanism of damaging process is attributed to vanes sticking in rotor cavities, causing a sudden increase in contact loads. This paper illustrates a summary of a research activity, which was carried out with the aim of analyzing the operating conditions of <b>vanes</b> <b>pumps.</b> The study was conducted with reference to <b>pumps</b> with <b>vanes</b> number ranging from 5 to 9, in order to evidence the influence of some design parameters on results.

In this paper, the friction torque characteristics of the balanced <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> especially the friction torque caused by the friction between a camcon-tour and vane tips are both experimentally and theoretically investigated. Although the friction force increaseswith vane thickness increasedue to increase in the vane force, themechanical effi-ciency of the vane pumpdoes not decreasewhen the cam lift becomes large as the vane thickness is increased. An important parameter 1 defined as the ratio to be obtained by dividing the cam lift by the vane thickness determines essentially the mechanical efficiency of the <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> The pumps with the same 1 have the same mechanical efficiencies, even if the cam lift or the vane thickness varies.

40|$|<b>Vane</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are simple}} in {{principle}} {{and can be}} mass produced inexpensively, making them well suited to the automotive industry. They also have many other applications, {{such as in the}} chemical industry and food industry. A common type of damage to a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is cavitation erosion on the side plates. If this damage is not detected in time, it could cause failure of the pump, which {{depending on the type of}} system may have safety implications, and in some cases a high cost from lost production whilst the system is shut down. This kind of damage is common on other types of pumps such as gear pumps and piston pumps. So a practical method for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pumps is required which does not necessitate removal of a pump from the working system. This paper presents a method of detecting and identifying cavitation damage on pump side plates via pump flow ripple. Power steering <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are used for this study, although the principles may also be applicable to other types of <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> and indeed to piston and gear pumps. The investigation has been done through measurement and simulation. A numerical model of a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is described, and simulated cavitation damage is introduced into the model. This damage is shown to have a clear effect on the simulated flow ripple. The pump flow ripple has also been measured experimentally using the Secondary Source Method, and artificial damage has been introduced into the pump. The damage is shown to have a clear effect on the measured flow ripple, consistent with the simulation results. Whilst the secondary source enables the measurement of flow ripple in laboratory conditions, it is generally impracticable for in-situ measurement for condition monitoring.
