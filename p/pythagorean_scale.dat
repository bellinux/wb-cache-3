What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time.

5000|$|It is {{said that}} the Pythagorean musical system {{was based on the}} Tetractys as the rows can be read as the ratios of 4:3 (perfect fourth), 3:2 (perfect fifth), 2:1 (octave), forming the basic {{intervals}} of the <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scales.</b> That is, <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scales</b> are generated from combining pure fourths (in a 4:3 relation), pure fifths (in a 3:2 relation), and the simple ratios of the unison 1:1 and the octave 2:1. Note that the diapason, 2:1 (octave), and the diapason plus diapente, 3:1 (compound fifth or perfect twelfth), are consonant intervals according to the tetractys of the decad, but that the diapason plus diatessaron, 8:3 (compound fourth or perfect eleventh), is not. The Tetractys known as the decad is an equilateral triangle formed from the sequence of the first ten numbers aligned in four rows. It is both a mathematical idea and a metaphysical symbol that embraces within itself—in seedlike form—the principles of the natural world, the harmony of the cosmos, the ascent to the divine, and the mysteries of the divine realm. So revered was this ancient symbol that it inspired ancient philosophers to swear by the name of the one who brought this gift to humanity.|$|R

The Chinese scale uses the same intervals as the <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale,</b> based on 2:3 ratios (8:9, 16:27, 64:81, etc.).

50|$|The <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale</b> is any scale {{which may}} be {{constructed}} from only pure perfect fifths (3:2) and octaves (2:1) or the gamut of twelve pitches constructed from only pure perfect fifths and octaves, and from which specific scales may be drawn.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{conception}} of the chromatic scale before the 13th century was the <b>Pythagorean</b> chromatic <b>scale.</b> Due to a different tuning technique, the twelve semitones in this scale have two slightly different sizes. Thus, the scale is not perfectly symmetric. Many other tuning systems, developed in the ensuing centuries, share a similar asymmetry. Equally spaced pitches are provided only by equal temperament tuning systems, which are widely used in contemporary music.|$|R

40|$|Following up on {{suggestions}} by Ervin Wilson, {{who showed}} that an infinity of recurrent sequences {{can be obtained}} from taking the sums of the diagonals of Pingala s Meru Prastala, known in the West as Pascal s Triangle, the author has generated a number of scales using these sequences. Among the sequences used are familiar ones such as the Fibonacci series, and other more exotic sequences. Just intonation scales made directly from the proportions of the number series are made, as well as <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scales</b> made from taking the Means the series tend to, and treating them as generating intervals for scales. The resulting scales are then divided into pseudo-White Key and-Black Key subsets using the Moments of Symmetry technique of Wilson and Chalmers. Examples of these scales, and the harmonies implied by them are heard as musical examples. Compositional work with these scales is then discussed, including using the intervals of the scales not only as generators for musical harmony, but also as generators for rhythm, timbre and spatialisation.

50|$|The {{history of}} music in Greece begins with the music of ancient Greece, largely {{structured}} on the Lyre and other supporting string instruments of the era.

5000|$|In {{the years}} 2000-2004, Marc Sabat and Wolfgang von Schweinitz worked {{together}} in Berlin {{to develop a}} method to exactly indicate pitches in staff notation. This method was called the extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI pitch notation. Sabat and Schweinitz take the [...] "conventional" [...] flats, naturals and sharps as a Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F proceeds C G D A E B F and so on. The advantage for musicians is that conventional reading of the basic fourths and fifths remains familiar. Such an approach has also been advocated by Daniel James Wolf and by Joe Monzo, who refers to it by the acronym HEWM (Helmholtz-Ellis-Wolf-Monzo). In the Sabat-Schweinitz design, syntonic commas are marked by arrows attached to the flat, natural or sharp sign, septimal commas using Giuseppe Tartini's symbol, and undecimal quartertones using the common practice quartertone signs (a single cross and backwards flat). For higher primes, additional signs have been designed. To facilitate quick estimation of pitches, cents indications may be added (downward deviations below and upward deviations above the respective accidental). The convention used is that the cents written refer to the tempered pitch implied by the flat, natural, or sharp sign and the note name. One of the great advantages of any such a notation {{is that it allows}} the natural harmonic series to be precisely notated. A complete legend and fonts for the notation (see samples) are open source and available from Plainsound Music Edition. Thus a <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale</b> is C D E F G A B, while a just scale is C D E F G A [...] B.|$|E
50|$|Johnson begins:That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.To works, however, of which the excellence is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale</b> of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, has been able to do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments.The reverence due to writings that have long subsisted arises therefore not from any credulous confidence in the superior wisdom of past ages, or gloomy persuasion of the degeneracy of mankind, but is the consequence of acknowledged and indubitable positions, that what has been longest known has been most considered, and what is most considered is best understood.Johnson then introduces Shakespeare:The poet, of whose works I have undertaken the revision, may now begin to assume the dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved from one generation to another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{extracted}} the notes of Iranian scale {{from the traditional}} music played by the great musician Shahnazi on the TAR. Then, by analyzing the spectrum of the notes and by using our special averaging we have found the pitch attributed to the components’ frequency and found the interval between the notes. The results are in comple agreement with <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale.</b> Pitch is a subjective quantity that attribute auditory sensation in terms of which sounds maybe ordered on a scale extending from low to high. For a pure tone pitch depends mainly on {{the frequency of the}} sound stimulus, but for complex tones or musical sounds pitch depends on partials of the complex tone and when the partials of a complex tone are not harmonic however the determination of pitch is more subtle. Indeed the vibrations of string instruments give rise to overtones which are not exactly multiples of fundamental, so the pitch of musical sound that we perceive is a subjective quantity related to frequencies of the overtones. In this paper we study the effect of partials in pitch of musical notes and by averaging between partials we introduce a subjective quantity which represents the pitch of musical note which is in quite agreement with experiments. As we know there are two famous scales for music, Aristoxenuss and Pythagoraean scale. The intervals in Aristoxenuss scale are    and in <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale</b> are   Farabi, the well-known philosopher, based Iranian traditional music on <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale</b> and our measurements of pitch and intervals of the notes show this scale has remained unchanged for a thousand years...|$|E

Chapter I deals with developing playing position. Body position [...] standing and sitting, holding the instrument [...] shoulder, arm, hand and finger position, and holding the bow [...] hand, arm, wrist and finger placements, are covered. The development of right hand technique is discussed in Chapter II. The specific motions which make up a bow stroke are detailed along with exercises to develop each particular motion. Various exercises are included to help with bow control-bow speed, pressure (or weight) and contact points. Such specific bowings as the slur (on a single string and across strings), detache, martele and spiccato are included. Chapter III is concerned with the development of the left hand technique. The motions of the fingers are considered and exercises to refine these motions are included. Specific finger patterns are developed in terms of specific tetrachord arrangements-major/minor and low and high augmented tetrachords. Various methods of achieving these patterns are included with suggested drills which lead into scale patterns. Finger contact and pressure is discussed as are the principles of shifting, and vibrato. In Chapter IV intonation is discussed in terms of theoretical relationships. Tempered vs. <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>scale</b> systems, whole and half-step measurements, scale development and harmonic concepts are considered. Physical problems such as ear training and pitch guides are included. Care, repair and tuning of the instruments with some suggested tuning routines are covered in a section on Mechanical Adjustments of the Instruments...|$|E
