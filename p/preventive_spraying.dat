40|$|RESIDUE STUDIES: Use of {{pesticides}} is steadily rising in Pakistan' agriculture. Rice {{is the second}} highest export of Pakistan earning sizeable foreign exchange. With a view to aver possibility of contamination of this commodity with undesirable quantities of pesticide residues which may adversely affect country's foreign trade. studies were undertaken with there pesticides popularly used on this crop; viz., diazinon (an organophosphate). Lindane (an organochlorine) and carbaryl (a carbamate). Results obtained indicated that residues of all the three insecticides do fall to negligible levels (Nil to 0. 6, Ni to 0. 46 and Nil to 0. 5 ppm respectively) within a month 0 application on the crop. Gamma BHC is commonly used for pest control in the region. Studies on behaviour of the insecticide from folia surfaces was studied in the laboratory and {{it was found that}} under summer conditions the insecticide is readily volatilize, from the leaves within few hours. Similar studies were undertake on DDT's fate from fallow agricultural area around Karachi Sindh. sprayed with the insecticide. In this case also it was: found that the insecticide is dissipated comparatively much slowly from plots covered with polythene sheet than from plot: left uncovered under local harsh summer conditions. Result: obtained on both these products/aspects have been incorporated in this dissertation. Rice is cultivated in Pakistan initially as a nursery wherefrom plants are transplanted to grow to maturity to yield the grain. Early-season pest attack from insects cause callous damage to the crop. To protect the crop from ravages of pests, <b>preventive</b> <b>spraying</b> with insecticide(s) is administered. Investigation were undertaken to see if the consumers are exposed to any health hazards if they feed on rice which had beer treated with DDT and fenitrothion in the nursery stage. It was found that DDT residues fell to 2. 0 3. 2 ppm level by the end of one week when 3 nursery treatments were made. With fenitrothion zero level of residues was reached in a week when three applications here made to rice nursery. Environmental pollution is caused by non-target crop spraying with persistent insecticides like DDT. An,assessmen 1 made in the agricultural areas of Punjab and NWFP had revealed, that residues of DDT were present upto 5 ppm in soil samples collected from sugarcane, tobacco, cotton and vegetable growing areas of the enumerated provirces. Subsequently, an experimen 1 was conducted to investigate as to how contamination of soil in agricultural fields occurs. A paddy growing area in Baluchistan which had aerially been sprayed with a DDT formulation was selected for the study. Results obtained revealed that though DD' residues, ten days after spraying, fell by 39. 11 and 84. 66...|$|E
40|$|Results of the {{research}} on beans carried out by the Dept. of Plant Pathology and Weed Science of Colorado State U. (USA) are briefly summarized. Surveys in the spring of 1984 and 1985 found many wild beans infected with, and/or colonized by, populations of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola and P. syringae pv. syringae. In an evaluation of bean seedlings in commercial fields no symptoms of Pseudomonas were detected. The effect of 2 spray programs (early and late) was evaluated in commercial bean plantings. The early and late <b>preventive</b> <b>spray</b> programs were equally effective in reducing epiphytic syringae-type pseudomonads. (CIAT...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} foliar {{treatments}} for prevention of Alternaria leaf spot was evaluated {{in the field}} on six varieties of Pima cotton. Disease was significantly reduced by protective sprays of mancozeb and micronized sulfur but not by foliar applications of urea in trials at the University of Arizona Safford Agricultural Center in Safford, AZ. Treatments had no significant effects on yields. Significantly fewer lesions developed on Pima variety UA 4 than on the other varieties. Disease pressure was relatively light, and even though scheduled <b>preventive</b> <b>sprays</b> with mancozeb were effective, fungicide applications probably would not increase yields under the environmental conditions of this experiment...|$|R
40|$|Extracts of nine {{plant species}} growing wild in Lebanon were tested for their {{efficacy}} against seven plant pathogenic fungi: Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria solani, Penicillium sp., Cladosporium sp., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis, Rhizoctonia solani and Sphaerotheca cucurbitae. Extracts {{of three of}} the plants, Origanum syriacum, Micromeria nervosa and Plumbago maritima, showed the highest levels of in vitro activity against spore germination and mycelial growth of the fungi tested. Inula viscosa showed high activity against spore germination but only moderate activity against mycelial growth. The other five plant species tested Calamintha origanifolia, Micromeria juliana, Ruta sp., Sideritis pullulans and Urginea maritima showed only moderate to low activity against these fungi. <b>Preventive</b> <b>sprays</b> with extracts of O. syriacum, M. nervosa, P. maritima and I. viscosa, applied at concentrations ranging between 4 and 8...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of various bactericides {{for the control}} of fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) in pear flowers was tested. Bactericides were applied preventively one day before, or curatively one or three days after artificial inoculation with pathogen concentrations of 104, 105 and 107 cfu ml- 1. The results indicated that a) <b>preventive</b> <b>sprays</b> were more effective than curative sprays; b) the effectiveness of curative sprays decreased progressively from the first to the third day; c) the infection was proportional to inoculum concentration, both in the water–sprayed (control) and in the bactericide–sprayed flowers. There was also significant interaction between bactericide and inoculum concentration. Best results were achieved with streptomycine (Agrept) at 0. 5 g and 1 g l- 1 H 2 O; oxolinic acid (S– 0208) 1. 5 g l- 1 H 2 O; and flumequine (Firestop) 2 ml l- 1 H 2 O.

50|$|The {{disease can}} be {{detected}} in orchards and on fruit {{by the appearance of}} lesions. Early detection is critical in quarantine situations. Bacteria are tested for pathogenicity by inoculating multiple citrus species with the bacterium. Simultaneously, other diagnostic tests (antibody detection, fatty-acid profiling, and genetic procedures using PCR) are conducted to identify the particular canker strain. Citrus canker outbreaks are prevented and managed in a number of ways. In countries that do not have canker, the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures. In countries with new outbreaks, eradication programs that are started soon after the disease has been discovered have been successful; such programs rely on destruction of affected orchards. When eradication has been unsuccessful and the disease has become established, management options include replacing susceptible citrus cultivars with resistant cultivars, applying <b>preventive</b> <b>sprays</b> of copper-based bactericides, and destroying infected trees and all surrounding trees within an appropriate radius.|$|R
40|$|Oxathiapiprolin {{is a new}} oomycide (piperidinyl {{thiazole}} isoxazoline class) {{discovered by}} DuPont which controls diseases caused by oomycete plant pathogens. It binds in the oxysterol-binding protein domain of Oomycetes. Growth chambers studies with detached leaves and potted plants showed remarkable activity of oxathiapiprolin against Pseudoperonospora cubensis in cucurbits. The compound affected all stages in the asexual life cycle of the pathogen. It inhibited zoospore release, cystospore germination, lesion formation, lesion expansion, sporangiophore development and sporangial production. When applied to the foliage as a <b>preventive</b> <b>spray</b> no lesions developed due to inhibition of zoospore release and cystospore germination, and when applied curatively, at {{one or two days}} after inoculation, small restricted lesions developed but no sporulation occurred. When applied later to mature lesions, sporulation was strongly inhibited. Oxathiapiprolin suppressed sporulation of P. cubensis in naturally-infected leaves. It exhibited trans-laminar activity, translocated acropetaly from older to younger leaves, and moved from the root system to the foliage. Seed coating was highly effective in protecting the developed cucumber plants against downy mildew. UV microscopy observations made with cucumber leaves infected with P. cubensis revealed that inhibition of mycelium growth and sporulation induced by oxathiapiprolin was associated with callose encasement of the haustoria...|$|R
40|$|Powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca mors-uvae) {{severely}} infects young shoots, {{stems and}} fruits of gooseberry (Ribes uva-crispa). Environmental friendly and biological control measures are being sought throughout the world. Especially in organic gooseberry growing effective control measures are needed, because powdery mildew infections {{may result in}} a total loss of the crop. In organic currant growing the number of adequate control methods is very limited. Sulphur as a fungicide against powdery mildew in e. g. gooseberry or table grape growing is not recommendable due to possible bleaching of berries and scorching of tender shoots. Various bicarbonate salts are suggested as a good option to control powdery mildew. In a field trial the effect of potassium bicarbonate (Armicarb) on the on the control of powdery mildew of gooseberry was evaluated. Four treatments; i. e. two preventive strategies and two curative strategies, were applied. PLants were sprayed until runoff. The percent of infected fruits and disease severity were assessed. In the unsprayed control plots very high disease incidences were observed; on average more than 90 % of the berries were infected with powdery mildew. The weekly (<b>preventive)</b> <b>spray</b> applications with potassium carbonate reduced the disease incidences on fruits significantly. On average approximately 10 % of the fruits were affected by powdery mildew. However, the number of spray applications was high. In conclusion, our results indicate that applications of potassium bicarbonate (as Armicarb) are effective in reducing the incidence and severity of American powdery mildew in gooseberry. Early spray applications are necessary to protect berries against powdery mildew infections. Future research will focus on reducing the number of applications, e. g. warning models based on powdery mildew of rose (Sphaerotheca pannosa) ...|$|R
40|$|Oidium mangiferae Berthet {{was found}} to be {{associated}} With the powdery mildew disease of mango. The air- borne conidia are released from the old tissue harboring the dormant fungal hyphae under favorable weather conditions, which produce the disease. Proper forecasting of release of airborne innoculum significantly reduced the required number of sprays needed for chemical control. Spore traps were used to monitor the concentration of airborne conidia during the months of February, March and April 1996 and l 997. Daily temperature and relative humidity were noted and the spore counts from the spore traps were correlated to the meteorological data. There was a positive trend between rising temperature, lowering relative humidity and number of spores in the air alter a low temperature, high humidity and cloudy spell of weather. The maximum spore occurrences were noted around 25 °C and relative humidity of 40 - 60 %. It took 5 - 8 days for the emergence of disease symptoms after the first detection of airborne conidia. Ten fungicides were tested on three mango varieties (Langra, Dashehari, and Anwar Retol). The <b>preventive</b> <b>sprays</b> at the stage of first detection of air born conidia were effective in controlling the disease. Optimal timing of two sprays of fungicide were sufficient to provide preventive control (> 90 %). The susceptibility of inflorescence varied with its developmental stage. Proper forecasting reduced the number of sprays from 7 to 2 or 3. There was no varietal difference in incidence of the disease or response to fungicide applications. During the course of this study, we identified seedling plants which consistently showed resistance to powdery mildew...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{fire blight}} is {{complicated}} by limitations on use of antibiotics in agriculture, antibiotic resistance development, and limited efficacy of alternative control agents. Even though successful in control, <b>preventive</b> antibiotic <b>sprays</b> also affect non-target bacteria, aiding the selection for resistance which could ultimately {{be transferred to the}} pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Trunk injection is a target-precise pesticide delivery method that utilizes tree xylem to distribute injected compounds. Trunk injection could decrease antibiotic usage in the open environment and increase the effectiveness of compounds in fire blight control. In field experiments, after 1 - 2 apple tree injections of either streptomycin, potassium phosphites (PH) or acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), significant reduction of blossom and shoot blight symptoms was observed compared to water- or non-injected control trees. Overall disease suppression with streptomycin was lower than typically observed following spray applications to flowers. Trunk injection of oxytetracycline resulted in excellent control of shoot blight severity, suggesting that injection is a superior delivery method for this antibiotic. Injection of both ASM and PH resulted in the significant induction of PR- 1, PR- 2 and PR- 8 protein genes in apple leaves indicating induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) under field conditions. The time separating SAR induction and fire blight symptom suppression indicated that various defensive compounds within the SAR response were synthesized and accumulated in the canopy. ASM and PH suppressed fire blight even after cessation of induced gene expression. With the development of injectable formulations and optimization of doses and injection schedules, the injection of protective compounds could serve as an effective option for fire blight control...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} behavioural {{risk factors}} for malaria in the Machadinho resettlement area in the Amazonian forests of Brazil. Analysis suggests that economic status {{and knowledge of the}} importance and behaviour of the mosquito in transmitting malaria are significant factors in determining prevalence risk, irrespective of whether <b>preventive</b> precautions (DDT <b>spraying</b> of houses, and clearing vector breeding sites) are undertaken in the endemic area. However, a higher economic status combined with better knowledge of the vector and DDT spraying decreases the risks of infection considerably. The results suggest that economic status [...] which is not easily subject to intervention [...] plays a more important role in transmission than is normally suspected, although preventive actions diminish the disease burden significantly. One might conclude that the landless and impoverished migrants who seek income, and independence in the jungle are destined to have malaria as one of their many burdens. A more positive implication is that control programmes must work harder and more intensively on behalf of poorer migrants in order to diminish the disease burden for these groups. malaria Brazil socioeconomic status risk...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In 2002, major human {{epidemics}} of West Nile Virus (WNV) {{were reported}} in five cities in the North East region of North America. The present analysis examines the climatic conditions that were conducive to the WNV epidemic, {{in order to provide}} information to public health managers who eventually must decide on the implementation of a <b>preventive</b> larvicide <b>spraying</b> program in Quebec, Canada. Two sets of variables, the first observed in the summer of 2002 and the second in the preceding winter were analysed to study their potential as explanatory variables for the emergence of the virus at epidemic levels. Results Results show that the climatic conditions observed in the year 2002 have contributed to the emergence of the virus and can be observed once every forty years on average. The analysis has shown that the 2002 events observed in several North East North American cities are characterized by two main variables: the number of degree-days below - 5 °C in the winter (DD- 5) and the number of degree-days greater than 25 °C in the summer (DD 25). Conclusion In the context of a declining rate of human and aviary infection to WNV, this element contributed to the decision to suspend the use of preventive larvicides in the province of Quebec in 2006 and for the foreseeable future. The second part of this study indicates that {{it is very important to}} estimate the risk that extreme values can be observed simultaneously in the summer and in the winter preceding the appearance of the virus. The proposed models provide important information to public health officials, weeks before the appearance of the virus, and can therefore be useful to help prevent human epidemics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Stemphylium vesicarium causes {{brown spot}} of pear. The fungus {{especially}} causes severe damage in southern Europe. In {{recent years the}} disease {{is also found in}} the Netherlands {{and to a lesser extent}} in Belgium. Conference is the cultivar most commonly grown in the Netherlands. This cultivar is one of the most susceptible cultivars. A two years experiment was started to test the most promising fungicides against S. vesicarium on Conference. Some of these fungicides were tested together with a warning system in order to reduce the number of sprays. The fungicides that were tested were: thiram, tolylfluanide, difenoconazole, tebuconazole, fludioxonil and trifloxystrobin. Fungicides in a <b>preventive</b> schedule were <b>sprayed</b> weekly from end of bloom until harvest. The fungicides applied according to the warning system were sprayed after an infection moment. Symptoms on leaves and on fruit were counted. The symptoms with S. vesicarium were reduced in the case of the best fungicide by 83 % on leaves and 49 % on fruit in 2002. The best fungicide reduced the incidence by 100 % and 89 % on leaves and fruit respectively, the following year. The number of fungicide treatments was reduced by 44 % in 2002 and 67 % in 2003 when the fungicides were sprayed according to the warning system. In 2002, there was no significant difference in disease incidence between the treatment sprayed weekly and sprayed according to the warning system on leaves and fruit. In 2003, fruit sprayed with fungicides after an infection were significantly more infected than fruit sprayed weekly but less infected than the untreated plots. This might be due to a change in the action threshold from 1000 points in 2002 to 1500 points in 2003...|$|R
