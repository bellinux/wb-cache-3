25|$|To {{accurately}} {{control the}} pulse, a full {{characterization of the}} pulse spectral phase is a must {{in order to get}} certain pulse spectral phase (such as transform-limited). Then, a spatial light modulator can be used in the 4f plane to control the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on this concept. Through the phase scan of the spatial light modulator, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed <b>pulse</b> <b>shape</b> at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). If the pulse shaper is fully calibrated, this technique allows controlling the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses using a simple optical setup with no moving parts. However the accuracy of MIIPS is somewhat limited with respect to other techniques, such as frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).|$|E

40|$|The most bandwidth-efficient {{communication}} {{methods are}} imperative {{to cope with}} the congested frequency bands. <b>Pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> methods have excellent effects on narrowing bandwidth and increasing band utilization. The position of the baseband filters for the <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> is crucial. Post-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> (a low pass filter is located after the modulator) can change signals from constant envelope to non-constant envelope, and non-constant envelope signals through non-linear device (a SSPA or TWT) can further spread the power spectra. Pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> (a filter is located before the modulator) will have constant envelope. These two <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> methods have different effects on narrowing the bandwidth and producing bit errors. This report studied the effect of various pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters with respect to bandwidth, spectral spikes and bit error rate. A pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaped</b> 8 -ary Phase Shift Keying (8 PSK) modulation was used throughout the simulations. In addition to traditional <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters, such as Bessel, Butterworth and Square Root Raised Cosine (SRRC), other kinds of filters or pulse waveforms were also studied in the pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> method. Simulations were conducted by using the Signal Processing Worksystem (SPW) software package on HP workstations which simulated the power spectral density of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaped</b> 8 -PSK signals, end to end system performance and bit error rates (BERS) as a function of Eb/No using <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> in an AWGN channel. These results are compared with the post-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaped</b> 8 -PSK results. The simulations indicate traditional <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters used in pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> may produce narrower bandwidth, but with worse BER than those in post-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping.</b> Theory and simulations show pre- modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> could also produce discrete line power spectra (spikes) at regular frequency intervals. These spikes may cause interference with adjacent channel and reduce power efficiency. Some particular pulses (filters), such as trapezoid and pulses with different transits (such as weighted raised cosine transit) were found to reduce bandwidth and not generate spectral spikes. Although a solid state power amplifier (SSPA) was simulated in the non-linear (saturation) region, output power spectra did not spread due to the constant envelope 8 -PSK signals...|$|R
40|$|Tremendous {{improvement}} {{has been}} made possible in wireless technology due to success of OFDM system which is a multi carrier modulation technique with capability to support high data rates. Despite its many advantages OFDM has failed against inter symbol interference (ISI), high sensitivity to Inter carrier interference (ICI), high peak to average power ratio (PAPR), phase noise and band limited channel. Hence the performance of an OFDM system is highly affected by the aforementioned undesired phenomenon. For this reason bandlimited system often employs <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> techniques. In this paper <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> of multi carrier signal is introduced by using various <b>pulse</b> <b>shapes</b> like Rectangular <b>pulse</b> (REC), Raised cosine pulse (RC), Better than raised cosine pulse (BTRC), Sinc power pulse (SP) and Improved sinc power pulse (ISP). The impulse responses and frequency spectrums have been evaluated and compared with system without using <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping.</b> Results obtained by simulation for OFDM system using <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> and without using <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> indicate that the performance of OFDM system with various <b>pulse</b> <b>shapes</b> is better than without using <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping.</b> Along with {{it can also be}} observed that among <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> ISP exhibits better performance.

40|$|International audiencePer-tone <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} time domain spectral shaping for DMT transmitters, e. g. VDSL modems. It shapes the spectrum of individual tones such that the stop band energy of each tone can be minimized. This in particular enables transmitter to use more tones without violating the PSD mask constraint for data transmission. In pertone <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> based DMT transmitters a fixed length <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter is typically used for every tone. The tones {{in the middle of the}} pass band however, contribute less to the overall stop band energy, so that using a high order <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter for these tones does not result in a significant reduction of the stop band energy. As a result a significant number of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter taps are wasted on the tones in the middle of the pass band and do not bring any performance gain. Using a variable length <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter which is designed such that the PSD mask constraint is not violated can then significantly reduce the total number of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter taps without compromising performance. In this paper, a resource allocation technique is presented for variable length <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter design using a dual problem formulation. This optimally solves the problem of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter tap distribution over tones for given PSD mask constraints, with a relatively low complexity...|$|R

2500|$|FROG and {{autocorrelation}} {{share the}} idea of combining a pulse with itself in a nonlinear medium. [...] Since a nonlinear medium will only produce the desired signal when both pulses are present {{at the same time}} (i.e. “optical gating”), varying the delay between the pulse copies and measuring the signal at each delay gives a vague estimate of the pulse length. [...] Autocorrelators measure a pulse by measuring the intensity of the nonlinear signal field. [...] Estimating the pulse length requires assuming a <b>pulse</b> <b>shape,</b> and the phase of the pulse electric field cannot be measured at all. [...] FROG extends this idea by measuring the spectrum of the signal at each delay (hence “frequency-resolved”), instead of just the intensity. [...] This measurement creates a spectrogram of the pulse, which can be used to determine the complex electric field as a function of time or frequency as long as the nonlinearity of the medium is known.|$|E
40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) {{has been widely}} adopted for modern wireless standards and become a key enabling technology for cognitive radios. However, one of its main drawbacks is significant spectral leakage due to the accumulation of multiple sinc-shaped subcarriers. In this paper, we present a novel <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> scheme for efficient spectral leakage suppression in OFDM based physical layer of IEEE 802. 11 af standard. With conventional <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters such as a raised-cosine filter, vestigial symmetry {{can be used to}} reduce spectral leakage very effectively. However, these <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters require long guard interval, i. e., cyclic prefix in an OFDM system, to avoid inter-symbol interference (ISI), resulting in a loss of spectral efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} flow {{maldistribution}} across the monolith of an axisymmetric catalyst assembly fitted to a pulsating flow test rig. Approximately sinusoidal inlet <b>pulse</b> <b>shapes</b> with relatively low peak/mean ratio {{were applied to}} the assembly with different amplitudes and frequencies. The inlet and outlet velocities were measured using Hot Wire Anemometry. Experimental results were compared with a previous study, which used inlet <b>pulse</b> <b>shapes</b> with relatively high peak/mean ratios.
