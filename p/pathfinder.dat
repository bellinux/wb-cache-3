40|$|Forty-five {{electronic}} <b>pathfinders</b> {{were selected}} from nine Canadian university libraries to assess their degree of conformity to suggested guidelines in the existing literature about <b>pathfinders.</b> The content and {{the format of the}} chosen <b>pathfinders</b> were assessed in terms of consistency and scope. Also considered were overall readability and whether they were effectively constructed to be used as starting points for further research. The analysis revealed that the guidelines were not uniformly followed, leaving some <b>pathfinders</b> more complex and less useful than others. Further, it demonstrated that specific guidelines must be created for electronic <b>pathfinders</b> because they pose particular problems that are not addressed in the current literature about <b>pathfinders</b> in general...|$|R
5000|$|From the mid-1990s, as the Internet {{became more}} popular, {{libraries}} began including web resources in their <b>pathfinders</b> {{and putting the}} <b>pathfinders</b> on their websites. Webliographies became popular, lists of web links that were curated by librarians on a topic. These differed from <b>pathfinders</b> {{because they did not}} focus on the library's collection. [...] As library services became increasingly accessible online, options for creating online <b>pathfinders</b> expanded, including webpages, LibGuides, and open-source content management systems.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a review of the {{literature}} on <b>pathfinders,</b> from the 1970 s to the present. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews a range of publications which describe the methodology of <b>pathfinders,</b> provide practical advice and information, present research results, to aid librarians and library administrators in how to best manage the production and marketing of <b>pathfinders.</b> Findings – It was found that not much has been written on <b>pathfinders.</b> A few articles on traditional <b>pathfinders</b> were published between 1972 and 1995. In 1996, the electronic format took over. Most of the articles are of a practical nature although some describe empirical research. One void in the literature that has been found is librarians' lack of knowledge of users' needs and preferences. This results in much time and effort being dedicated to the production of <b>pathfinders</b> but without any consideration of users, thus discouraging them from using the available resources. ...|$|R
5|$|Watney {{takes the}} rover to {{retrieve}} the nearby <b>Pathfinder</b> probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using the lander's camera, he establishes rudimentary communication with Earth, first with plastic bin lids, and then using hexadecimals. NASA instructs Watney to partially modify the rover's code to link with <b>Pathfinder</b> so they can communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival (and openly expresses it), and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Pathfinders</b> were a {{relative}} {{small group of}} soldiers. By comparison, the Reconnaissance Regiment from the formation of 1 Recce Commando at Oudtshoorn in 1972, to end of the Angolan/Bush war (1989) has over 450 qualified Recce operators; an average of 26 to 27 operators a year, while there were only 98 qualified <b>Pathfinders</b> from 1978 up to 1989, an average of 9 <b>Pathfinders</b> per year.|$|R
5|$|Scouting in South Africa, {{as in most}} British Colonies (such as Rhodesia), was {{originally}} segregated by race. This did not prevent black Scout groups from forming, and in the 1920s, black Scouts were given the name Klipspringers (a type of small antelope). The <b>Pathfinder</b> Council was formed in 1929.|$|E
5|$|The winter 1941–42 {{passed by}} with {{relative}} inactivity. In the spring 1942, Arthur Harris began his campaign over Germany in earnest with {{an attack by}} RAF Bomber Command upon Lübeck. Adolf Hitler, enraged by the attack, ordered the Luftwaffe to begin retaliatory strikes which began the so-called Baedeker Blitz. On 4 April Cunningham engaged and damaged a Baedeker raider He 111 <b>pathfinder</b> operating over Exeter. It was able to escape into cloud. KGr 100, the specialist German <b>pathfinder</b> unit, was now operating with new navigational aids which allowed them to fly through and navigate in thick cloud and rain. They deliberately operated whenever the weather proved more difficult for night fighters. Nevertheless, Cunningham made an interception {{on the night of}} the 23 May 1942.|$|E

5|$|<b>Pathfinder</b> : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (Reef Knot, Bowline, Sheet bend, Sheepshank, Figure-of-eight, and Clove hitch), basic first aid (treatment of open wounds and bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping.

5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade (Brigadier James Hill) {{began to}} land {{at the same time}} as the main {{elements}} of 5th Parachute Brigade, and suffered from the same problems. All of its constituent units were scattered throughout the area due to poor navigation, heavy cloud cover, and several of the drop-zones either not being marked correctly or marked correctly but incorrectly positioned due to <b>pathfinder</b> error.|$|E

The battalion was divided into four assault groups, one for each of the casemates of the battery, and was ready by 04:30, when the gliders carrying the sappers arrived over the battery.|$|E

5|$|The coup-de-main {{force had}} been {{followed}} closely by the pathfinders of the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, tasked with marking out the drop-zones and landing-zones {{to be used by}} the rest of the division. However, due to a combination of heavy cloud cover and poor navigation, only one <b>pathfinder</b> team was dropped correctly. The aircraft carrying the remainder had to make between two and three runs over their respective drop-zones before their teams jumped. Pathfinders assigned to DZ N were dropped wide, and did not manage to get to the drop-zone for thirty minutes. The team assigned to DZ K accidentally dropped onto DZ N without realising their error, and set up radio beacons and markers that caused a number of airborne troops to drop in the wrong area. A <b>pathfinder</b> team belonging to 9th Parachute Battalion, assigned to mark out the drop-zone area for the unit tasked with destroying the Merville artillery battery, was all but wiped out when an air-raid by RAF Avro Lancaster heavy bombers missed the artillery battery itself and bombed the area the team was in.|$|E

Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens also confirmed plans for an Obsidian-developed computer role-playing game. Urquhart had stated a desire to collaborate with BioWare again on a new Star Wars game.

5|$|Observations of binary pulsars provide strong {{indirect}} {{evidence for the}} existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA <b>Pathfinder)</b> having launched in December 2015.|$|E
