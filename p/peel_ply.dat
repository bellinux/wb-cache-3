40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate if atmospheric pressure plasma treatment could modify <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> prepared composite surfaces to create strong adhesive bonds. Two <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> surface preparation composite systems previously shown to create weak bonds (low fracture energy and adhesion failure) that were potential candidates for plasma treatment were Toray T 800 / 3900 - 2 carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) prepared with Precision Fabrics Group, Inc. (PFG) 52006 nylon <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> and Hexcel T 300 /F 155 CFRP prepared with PFG 60001 polyester <b>peel</b> <b>ply.</b> It was hypothesized that atmospheric pressure plasma treatment could functionalize and/or remove <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> remnants left on the CFRP surfaces upon <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> removal. Surface characterization measurements and double cantilever beam (DCB) testing were used {{to determine the effects of}} atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on surface characteristics and bond quality of <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> prepared CFRP composites. Previous research showed that Toray T 800 / 3900 - 2 carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites prepared with PFG 52006 <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> and bonded with Cytec MetlBond 1515 - 3 M structural film adhesive failed in adhesion at low fracture energies when tested in the DCB configuration. Previous research also showed that DCB samples made of Hexcel T 300 /F 155 carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites prepared with PFG 60001 <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> and bonded with Henkel Hysol EA 9696 structural film adhesive failed in adhesion at low fracture energies. Recent research suggested that plasma treatment could be able to activate these "un-bondable" surfaces and result in good adhesive bonds. Nylon <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> prepared 177 °C cure and polyester <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> prepared 127 °C cure CFRP laminates were treated with atmospheric pressure plasma after <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> removal prior to bonding. Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment was capable of significantly increasing fracture energies and changing failure modes. For Toray T 800 / 3900 - 2 laminates prepared with PFG 52006 and bonded with MetlBond 1515 - 3 M, plasma treatment increased fracture energies from 460 J/m 2. Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment also increased fracture energies of Hexcel T 300 /F 155 laminates prepared with PFG 60001 and bonded with EA 9696 from 1500 J/m 2. It was demonstrated that atmospheric pressure plasma treatment was able to transform poor bonding surfaces into acceptable ones by reversing the negative effects of incorrect <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> usage. To determine if the primary reason for adhesion was functionalization or removal, a number of experiments were performed. Surface characteristics of <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> only and plasma treated samples were determined using contact angle (CA) measurements, FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). CA was used to assess solid surface energy that was useful to determine wetting of the adhesive on the adherend, one requirement of adhesion. FTIR and XPS were used to analyze composite surface chemistry, including the identification of functional groups that were a product of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment, as well as contaminants that can inhibit adhesive bonding. SEM was used to capture surface morphology to identify <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> remnants and whether these remnants were physically removed or modified due to plasma treatment. This research supported that atmospheric pressure plasma treatment resulted in adhesion primarily due to functionalization of <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> remnants, though a removal mechanism was not disproven. It was also shown that surface energy exhibited potential for predicting adhesion. Lastly, this research indicated that plasma treatment is a robust surface preparation, as strong bonds were observed up to 30 days after treatment...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{preparation}} of the surfaces to be bonded {{is critical to the}} success of composite bonds. <b>Peel</b> <b>ply</b> surface preparation is attractive from a manufacturing and quality assurance standpoint, but is a well known example of the extremely system-specific nature of composite bonds. This study examined the role of the surface energy, morphology, and chemistry left by <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> removal in resulting bond quality. It also evaluated the use of contact angle surface energy measurement techniques for predicting the resulting bond quality of a prepared surface. The surfaces created by preparing three aerospace fiber-reinforced composite prepregs were compared when prepared with a nylon vs a polyester <b>peel</b> <b>ply.</b> The prepared surfaces were characterized with contact angle measurements with multiple fluids, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray electron spectroscopy. The laminates were bonded with aerospace grade film adhesives. Bond quality was assessed via double cantilever beam testing followed by optical and scanning electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces. The division was clear between strong bonds (GC of 600 - 1000 J/m 2 and failure in cohesion) and weak bonds (GC of 80 - 400 J/m 2 and failure in adhesion). All prepared laminates showed the imprint of the <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> texture and evidence of <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> remnants after fabric removal, either through SEM or XPS. Within an adhesive system, large amounts of SEM-visible <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> material transfer correlated with poor bond quality and cleaner surfaces with higher bond quality. The both sides of failed weak bonds showed evidence of <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> remnants under XPS, showing that at least some failure is occurring through the remnants. The choice of adhesive was found to be significant. AF 555 adhesive was more tolerant of <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> contamination than MB 1515 - 3. Although the bond quality results varied substantially between tested combinations, the total surface energies of all prepared surfaces were very similar. Single fluid contact angle measurements/water break tests were therefore not predictive of bond quality, and are recommended against. The multiple fluids used allowed the construction of wettability envelopes, a more detailed look at the surface energy profile. The envelopes of nylon and polyester prepared systems were noticeably different, but while potentially useful for detecting changes or errors in surface {{preparation of}} known systems, they were not valid for predicting bond quality in new systems. Ultimately, it was determined that wetting is a necessary but not sufficient condition for bonding...|$|E

Unidirecitonal {{pre-preg}} carbon fibers of ten <b>peel</b> <b>plies</b> were laid up at 0 -, 45 -, - 45 -, and 45 -degree stacking sequences on a flat and smooth aluminum (Al) plate, and then carbonized electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were placed {{on top of the}} last ply prior to vacuum curing in a vacuum oven. The PAN electrospun fibers were oxidized at 280 degrees C in an ambient condition for 1 hr and then carbonized at 850 degrees C for 1 hr in an argon (Ar) gas atmosphere. The resultant composite panels were cut into small pieces and subjected to a number of different characterization techniques. Thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) measurements clearly showed that significant reinforcement was achieved for the pre-preg/carbonized PAN fiber composites because of the enhanced interfacial bonding between the PAN nanofibers and the matrix. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) tests exhibited a shift of the glass transition temperature of the carbonized PAN nanofiber/composite, which may be helpful for high-temperature applications of the present composites. A Raman spectroscopy peak around 897 cm(- 1) indicated formation of the gamma-phase of the carbonized PAN fibers. The highest stretching peak of the CH 2 group was recognized within the range of 2, 500 - 2, 800 cm(- 1) for the carbonized fibers. The vibration peak of the C N group also appeared at 1, 452 cm(- 1) spectrum. TMA determined the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), indicating an improvement in stability of the composite material, which can be useful for structural health monitoring (SHM) as well as lightning strikes and electromagnetic interference shielding applications of new carbon fiber composites...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThe {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop an algorithm (based on mathematical function menus) to improve the {{signal to noise ratio}} between constituents of similar acoustic impedance in bonded out-of-autoclave carbon fiber reinforced polymer assemblies. In particular, <b>peel</b> <b>ply,</b> a release fabric that may be trapped between the adhesive and the substrate during the manufacturing process. The assemblies consist of a pre-cured resin infused out-of-autoclave 3 D woven fabric preform bonded to a pre-cured out-of-autoclave prepreg fabric substrate. Conventional ultrasonic nondestructive testing techniques and analysis software cannot consistently achieve signal to noise ratios that meet quantifiable rejection thresholds of accurately sized <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> inserts at the bonded interface (i. e. bondline) of the aforementioned assemblies. To demonstrate the approach, ultrasonic pulse echo with full waveform capture was used to inspect a reference standard (i. e. representation of configuration and complexity of the part to be inspected) with <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> inserts (sized according to minimum detectable requirements) placed between the film adhesive and the 3 D woven fabric preform. The ultrasonic signal was produced by a 64 element array transducer with a central frequency of 2. 8 Megahertz, utilizing a customary shoe and water bubbler.

The manufacturing procedures which {{include the use of}} adhesives, require extensive experimental testing in the different stages of the process. For instance, the quality of the adhesive and the compatibility with <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> fabrics are checked upon the reception of the material by means of DCB (Double Cantilever Beam) tests on pre-cracked specimens. Later on, the assembly of structural parts by means of bonded or co-bonded adhesive joints goes along with the manufacture of panels, prepared exactly under the same conditions, that will be tested to assess the quality of the joint in the structure. Moreover, the high sensitivity {{of the quality of the}} joint to several manufacture operations such as surface preparation of the adherents, contamination, moisture, curing conditions, etc. should be taken into account.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the development of a}} laser pretreatment method for glass fibre reinforced polypropylene surfaces for industrial applications. This work aims to create a reproducible surface for bonding low-energy polypropylene which adheres very poorly to most adhesives and forms to the matrix material for plastic composites. The combination of glass fibres with polypropylene in the form of hybrid yarns is intended to produce a low-cost and powerful engineered fibre composite with applications in high-technology industries. The key process is bonding the engineered fibre composite without modifying the material properties. This is done by adhesive bonding. For this purpose, various pretreatment processes were examined and compared, for example, surface degreasing, plasma pretreatment for final cleaning and activation, the use of <b>peel</b> <b>ply</b> and laser pretreatment. The laser pretreatment serves two purposes: the defined generation of different surface structures and t he exposure of glass fibres to be able to exploit the adhesive properties of glass surfaces. Moreover, two processes of artificial aging were performed to simulate potential boundary conditions during future use thus ensuring well-founded assessment of the pretreatments. Possible maximum initial adhesive strength is not the only key factor in favour of a decision to use adhesive bonding. Rather is the resistance to aging in real ambient conditions relevant for the long-term usage and stable bonding behaviour. Finally, the surface pretreatment methods are compared with each other, assessed and critical issues of surface pretreatment and material are validated...|$|E
40|$|The use of adhesively-bonded joints {{instead of}} the {{traditional}} types of joining can give reduced weight and increased stiffness in a structure. However, most industries have concerns {{about the use of}} adhesive joints in anything other than secondary structures, due to uncertainties over the long-term service life. This thesis discusses the prediction of the lifetime of adhesively-bonded composite structures. A fracture mechanics approach was used to characterise the fracture behaviour of an epoxy film adhesive, Cytec FM- 300 M, mainly using composite substrates prepared using wet <b>peel</b> <b>ply,</b> removing the need for any additional surface treatment. Aluminium alloy substrates were also used for some tests. Tapered double cantilever beam and double cantilever beam specimens were used to determine the mode I critical strain energy release rate, GIC, and end loaded split specimens were tested to obtain the mode II critical strain energy release rate, GIIC. Lastly, fixed ratio mixed mode specimens were used to obtain the relationship between GIC and GIIC when a joint undergoes mixed mode failure. For validation purposes, single lap joint and double scarf joint specimens were also tested. These data were then applied in finite element models using Abaqus. Two different modelling techniques were used, the virtual crack closure technique and cohesive zone modelling, CZM. Simulations of the tests performed were executed, in the process obtaining the CZM fitting parameters. Good agreement with the experimental data was verified for each of the models tested. Fatigue tests were also performed in order to obtain the mode I and mode II threshold values of the fracture energy below which crack growth did not occur, by executing double cantilever beam and end loaded split tests, respectively. For validation purposes, single lap joint fatigue tests were also performed to determine the threshold maximum load the joint could withstand without failure. Finally, using the CZM fitting parameters obtained in the quasi-static tests and the experimentally obtained threshold values of the fracture energy, modelling of single lap and double scarf joints was performed in order to predict the maximum load value for which no failure would occur when subject to cyclic loading. These predictions showed excellent agreement with the experimental results, showing that this simpler model can obtain good results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{tubes are}} a very good {{alternative}} to steel tubes in applications requiring low weight and high stiffness. For composite tubes to replace traditional steel tubes in demanding environments, {{such as in the}} subsea petroleum industry, more research on their behavior has to be made to qualify the performance. This thesis seeks to expand that knowledge by investigating the buckling behavior of composite tubes subjected to external hydrostatic pressure. To find a method of correctly predicting the stress and strain states on the tubes, a comparison between FEA and previously acquired strain data from external hydrostatic pressure testing of a composite tube has been carried out. The composite tube had a length of 600 mm and a diameter of 100 mm and was filament wound with a layup of [89 ^∘_ 1 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 45 ^∘_ 1] and instrumented with optical fiber to acquire the strain data. It was found that by modeling the cross section of the tube elliptic with 0. 46 % (" 0. 46 % ovality") of the mean diameter added and subtracted to the major and minor diameter of the ellipse respectively, a very good match between FEA and the strain data was found. Using the same ovality, seven different layups were analyzed to find an optimal layup for withstanding external hydrostatic pressure. Based on the optimal layup assessment, the most optimal layup, [89 ^∘_ 2 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 89 ^∘_ 2], was produced. The tube was cut into lengths of 300, 400 and 600 mm to assess the buckling behavior and FEA matching's dependency on length. The tubes were instrumented with optical fiber for strain measurements and tested in an autoclave. It was found that the [89 ^∘_ 2 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 89 ^∘_ 2] layup performed well having a buckling pressure of 9. 75 bar for the 600 mm long tube, 2. 79 times that of the [89 ^∘_ 1 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 45 ^∘_ 1] layup, despite being just 33. 5 % thicker. To achieve a good match in FEA for the [89 ^∘_ 2 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 89 ^∘_ 2] layup, the fiber direction E-modulus had to be increased by 12 % to 37738 MPa, compared to the predicted E-modulus from volume fraction scaling. The high E-modulus was concluded as being due to low void content coming from post winding compression of the tubes with <b>peel</b> <b>ply.</b> The ovality needed to achieve matching for the 600 mm long tube was 0. 01 %. Based on the matching of the shorter tubes it was concluded that longer tubes with the same layup will need an ovality close to 0. 01 % to simulate correct strain behavior...|$|E

Helium and oxygen were passed through the plasma source, whereby ionization occurred and ~ 10 16 cm - 3 oxygen atoms, ~ 10 15 cm - 3 ozone molecules and ~ 10 16 cm - 3 metastable oxygen molecules (O 2 1 &# 916; g) were generated. The plasma afterglow was directed onto the substrate material located 4 mm downstream. Surface properties of the plasma treated materials have been investigated using water contact angle (WCA), atomic force microscopy (AFM), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The work presented herein establishes atmospheric-pressure plasma as a surface preparation technique that is well suited for surface activation and enhanced adhesive bond strength {{in a variety of}} materials. Atmospheric plasma activation presents an environmentally friendly alternative to wet chemical and abrasive methods of surface preparation. Attenuated total internal reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to study the aging mechanism of the native oxide on silicon. During storage at ambient conditions, the water contact angle of a clean surface increased from - 1 to 0. 182 ± 0. 008 hr - 1 molecules/(cm 2 *s), decreasing as the fraction of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups increased from 49 % to 96 % on the SiO 2 surface. The adsorption of the organic contaminant could be suppressed indefinitely by storing the silicon wafers in the presence of activated carbon or in a freezer at - 22 °C. The enhancement of adhesive bond strength and durability for carbon-fiber reinforced epoxy composite, stainless steel type 410, and aluminum alloy 2024 was demonstrated with the {{atmospheric pressure}} helium-oxygen plasma. All surfaces studied were converted from a hydrophobic state with a water contact angle of 65 ° to 80 ° into a hydrophilic state with a water contact angle between 20 ° and 40 ° within 5 seconds of plasma exposure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the carbon atoms on the carbon-fiber/epoxy composite were oxidized, yielding 17 atom% carboxylic acid groups, 10 % ketones or aldehydes and 9 % alcohols. Analysis of stainless steel and aluminum by XPS illustrate oxidation of the metal surface and an increase in the concentration of hydroxyl groups in the oxide film. Following plasma activation, the total hydroxyl species concentration on stainless steel increased from 31 % to 57 %, while aluminum exhibited an increase from 4 % to 16 % hydroxyl species. Plasma activation of the surface led to an increase in bond strength of the different surfaces by up to 150 % when using Cytec FM 300 and FM 300 - 2 epoxy adhesives. Wedge crack extension tests following plasma activation revealed cohesive failure percentages of 97 % for carbon-fiber/epoxy composite bonded to stainless steel, and 96 % for aluminum bonded to itself. The bond strength and durability of the substrates correlated with changes in the specific surface chemistry, not the wetting angle or the morphological properties of the material. This suggests that enhanced chemical bonding at the interface was responsible for the improvement in mechanical properties following plasma activation. The surface preparation of polymers and composites using atmospheric pressure plasmas is a promising technique for replacing traditional methods of surface preparation by sanding, grit blasting or <b>peel</b> <b>ply.</b> After oxygen plasma activation and joining the materials together with epoxy, one observes 100 % cohesive failure within the cured film adhesive. Depending on the material, the lap shear strength can be increased several fold over that achieved by either solvent wiping or abrasion.
