40|$|AbstractPhosphogypsum is a {{by-product}} of processing phosphate rock for <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production</b> by acidulation with sulfuric acid. The size of phosphogypsum crystals {{is a major factor}} for the economics of the process as it greatly affects the filterability of the phosphoric slurry. Some minerals containing two major chemical components, silica and alumina, proved to be very effective additives for growth of phosphogypsum crystals. To analyze the effect of these components on crystal growth, many additives are tested in the industrial scale in present work. Tests were carried out in the industrial <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production</b> unit of PP 2 in Safi site.

It is shown that the addition of reactive silica for complexation of the F element, which is unfavorable to a good crystallization, is seen to be insufficient in the absence of alumina; the crystals are developed, but in a single direction and become like thin bars.

One of the main issues encountered in this process is related to the uncontrolled formation of mineral deposits at sensitive steps.

A collaborative project (CA 2 PHOS) between OCP and BRGM aims to develop a computational tool dedicated to predict and quantify these mineral deposits in the context of WPPA production.

The optimum crystal growth condition, which is pH of gel, CaCl 2 concentration and growth time, were investigated. The result shows that at optimum condition of pH 5. 80, CaCl 2 concentrations of 1. 2 M, and growth time of 144 hours, colorless crystals with the longest size of 3 mm, were obtained (72. 57 %).
