50|$|<b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> {{are often}} {{designed}} {{for a variety of}} clients, and can be programmed by the end users to suit their needs. Some large clients write their own specifications for vendors to implement. In some cases, <b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> are sold and supported by third-party distributors, while in other cases they are sold and supported directly by the vendor.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} cloud {{computing}} has {{given birth to}} the possibility of <b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> to be deployed as software as a service, which can be accessed directly from the Internet, using any internet browser. Using the previous advances in the communication protocols for POS's control of hardware, cloud-based <b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> are independent from platform and operating system limitations. Cloud-based <b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> are also created to be compatible {{with a wide range of}} POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's IPad. Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand <b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> to mobile devices, such as tablet computers or smartphones. These devices can also act as barcode readers using a built-in camera and as payment terminals using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader. A number of POS companies built their software specifically to be cloud-based. Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology.|$|E
50|$|It {{is clear}} that <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> is a term that implies {{a wide range of}} {{capabilities}} depending on the end-user requirements. <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> review websites cannot be expected to cover most let alone all the features; in fact unless one is a developer himself it is unrealistic to expect the reviewer to know all {{the nuts and bolts of}} a <b>POS</b> <b>system.</b> For instance a <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> might work smoothly on a test database during review but not when the database grows significantly in size over months of usage. And this is only one among many hidden critical functionality issues of a <b>POS</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

These transactions are now most often recorded by a <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> rather than a mechanical cash register.

5000|$|Despite {{the more}} {{advanced}} technology of a <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> as compared to a simple cash register, the <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer. During checkout the cashier can bypass scanning certain items or enter a lower quantity for some items thus profiting thereby from the [...] "free" [...] goods.|$|R

50|$|<b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} complex {{software}} systems available because of the features that are required by different end-users. Many <b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules. Sometimes purchase ordering, stock transferring, quotation issuing, barcode creating, bookkeeping or even accounting capabilities are included. Furthermore, each of these modules are interlinked if they are to serve their practical purpose and maximize their usability.|$|E

50|$|First {{launched}} in early 2008, Harbortouch {{started as a}} division of United Bank Card, but since 2012 has become the d/b/a name of the entire company.

In 2011, the company launched a <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> program which allows merchants to obtain a Harbortouch <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> with a monthly service fee and quarterly software support fee required.

50|$|<b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> are {{designed}} {{not only to}} serve the retail, wholesale and hospitality industries as historically is the case. Nowadays <b>POS</b> <b>systems</b> are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities {{such as the following}} are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is that a}} cloud-based <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> actually exposes business data to service providers - the hosting service company and the POS vendor which have access to both the application and database. The importance of securing critical business information such as supplier names, top selling items, customer relationship processes cannot be underestimated given that sometimes the few key success factors or trade secrets of a business are actually accessible through the <b>POS</b> <b>system.</b> This security and privacy concern is an ongoing issue in cloud computing.|$|R
5000|$|News {{reports on}} <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> hacking show that hackers are more {{interested}} in stealing credit card information than anything else. The ease and advantage offered by the ability of a <b>POS</b> <b>system</b> to integrate credit card processing thus has a downside. In 2011, hackers were able to steal credit card data from 80,000 customers because Subway's security and POS configuration standards for PCI Compliance - which governs credit card and debit card payment systems security - were [...] "directly and blatantly disregarded" [...] by Subway franchisees.|$|R
