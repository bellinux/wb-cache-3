5|$|At 17:30p.m. on 22 September, the Italian 35th Division under General Ernesto Mombelli {{joined the}} offensive, seizing Hill 1050 stronghold from the 302nd German Division and taking 150 prisoners.

At 14:00p.m. on 23 September, General Louis Franchet d'Espèrey announced that the initial <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation was to be modified. The Italians were ordered to strike Kičevo {{with the aim of}} preventing the enemy forces stationed at Monastir from reaching the railroad hub in Uskub, the 11th Colonial French Division was instead tasked with securing Prilep.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{successive}} remodelings and enlargements {{the architecture}} at Ashton Court {{is complex and}} seldom what it seems. The core of the house, a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which have in turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; {{while the majority of}} the house was built in the 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration has created an overall Gothic appearance.|$|E

The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible as a more crowded decoration, {{as can be seen}} in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, when India gained independence, {{the state}} of West Bengal was formed with 14 districts, as per {{partition}} <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then Bengal province of British India. The former princely state Koch Bihar joined as a district in 1950, and the former French enclave Chandannagore joined {{as part of the}} Hooghly district in 1954. The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 led to addition of Purulia district to the state and to enlargement of West Dinajpur district. Later, larger districts such as West Dinajpur, 24 Parganas and Midnapore were bifurcated. Till 24 June 2014 West Bengal was divided into 19 districts.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major {{excavations}} of the Garni fortress site led by Babken Arakelyan. Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian {{focused on}} the temple itself. It was not until almost twenty years later, on December 10, 1968, that the Soviet Armenian government approved the reconstruction <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple. A group led by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969. It was completed by 1975, almost 300 {{years after it was}} destroyed in an earthquake. The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones, except the missing pieces which were filled with blank stones intended to be easily recognisable. In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected not far from the temple.|$|E

5|$|Prescott's main {{secondary}} {{source for}} the history was Leopold von Ranke's Fürste und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert, a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the papacy. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical historical method, and considered his work {{to be the best}} of his predecessors on the subject. He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance. He had made a broad <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26. At this time, Prescott was a creditor of John White Webster, the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.|$|E

5|$|The Eleventh Five-Year <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union {{delivered}} a disappointing result: {{a change in}} growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. The Soviet Union still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically advanced than the Soviet Union.|$|E
