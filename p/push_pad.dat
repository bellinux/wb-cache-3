5000|$|Microjig's GRR-Ripper is {{a hybrid}} push device that {{combines}} {{characteristics of a}} push block with a <b>push</b> <b>pad.</b> It uses an adjustable base which allows it to straddle a table saw blade or {{be used as a}} <b>push</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
50|$|EN 1125 {{is one of}} two {{standards}} which govern exit {{devices in}} the EU. The other standard, EN 179, governs door handles, <b>push</b> <b>pads,</b> and other exit devices with emergency release functionality.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Push</b> <b>Pads</b> {{typically}} {{consist of}} one or two handles and a flat pad with a rubber underside to increase friction with the workpiece. They are typically used with jointers and router tables.|$|R
50|$|On {{the cargo}} {{aircraft}} variant CL-44D4 the entire tail section hinged. It could be opened using hydraulic actuators to load large items quickly. An inflatable seal at the hinge-break enabled cabin {{pressure to be}} maintained, and eight hydraulic-operated locks assured structural integrity. The tail could be opened from controls within the tail in 90 seconds. The flight controls at the joint were maintained by a system of <b>push</b> <b>pads.</b>|$|R
50|$|An airdrop {{is a type}} of airlift, {{developed}} during World War II to resupply otherwise inaccessible troops, who themselves may have been airborne forces. In some cases, it is used to refer to the airborne assault itself. Early airdrops were conducted by dropping or <b>pushing</b> <b>padded</b> bundles from aircraft. Later small crates with parachutes were pushed out of the aircraft's side cargo doors. Later cargo aircraft were designed with rear access ramps, lowerable in flight, that allowed large platforms to be rolled out the back.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "delta brake" [...] is a road bicycle brake named {{due to its}} {{triangular}} shape. [...] The cable enters at the centre, pulls {{a corner}} of a parallelogram linkage housed inside the brake across two opposite corners, pushing out at the other two corners on to the brake arms above the pivots, so that the arms below the pivots <b>push</b> <b>pads</b> in against the rim. [...] A feature of the design is that the mechanical advantage varies as a tangent function across its range, where that of most other designs remains fixed.|$|R
50|$|The VEF-TA {{had many}} {{different}} versions {{that ranged from}} classic style rotary phones to modern <b>push</b> button key <b>pad.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 29 November 2016 : The NSC {{slipping}} is completed, {{taking a}} total of fifteen days. It was <b>pushed</b> on teflon <b>pads</b> by hydraulic pistons, guided by lasers.|$|R
50|$|When {{the brake}} pedal {{of a modern}} vehicle with {{hydraulic}} brakes is pushed against the master cylinder, ultimately a piston <b>pushes</b> the brake <b>pad</b> against the brake disc which slows the wheel down. On the brake drum it is similar as the cylinder pushes the brake shoes against the drum which also slows the wheel down.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake caliper}} pistons then apply {{force to the}} brake <b>pads,</b> <b>pushing</b> them against the {{spinning}} rotor, and the friction between the pads and the rotor causes a braking torque to be generated, slowing the vehicle. Heat generated by this friction is either dissipated through vents and channels in the rotor or is conducted through the pads, which are made of specialized heat-tolerant materials such as kevlar or sintered glass.|$|R
40|$|Diamond disks are {{indispensable}} for dressing CMP pads. However, {{due to the}} poor leveling of diamond tips, only a few percents of diamond grits can penetrate the pad. As these few crystals are worn out, the plastic deformation of the pad becomes large relative {{to the amount of}} pad is cut. The polishing rate will then decline; and the scratch rate, increase. A novel technique has been developed to identify the cutting tips and their dulling process. The cutting paths become widen and shallow with more and more deformed pad material. Eventually, fewer and fewer scratch lines are present with most touching diamond <b>pushing</b> deformed <b>pad</b> around. Because there are only a handful of diamond grits that are engaged in cutting pad, the number of working crystals can increased substantially by improving the leveling of diamond tips. This improvement can increase the longevity of diamond disks that paves the way for future CMP of 18 inches wafers scheduled to make the debut in 2012...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{designs of}} weight {{training}} machines available for this exercise. The seated lever fly machine, and the Pec Dec. The seated lever fly involves grasping two handles at shoulder height, and pushing them together {{while keeping the}} elbows at a constant angle. When using the Pec Dec machine the hands grip two handles at head height, while the forearms <b>push</b> against two <b>pads</b> at chest height. The anterior deltoids are used as synergists in both variations. The biceps brachii act as a synergist in the seated lever exercise, {{but not on the}} Pec Dec due to the raised arm position.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Ascot Goat Race in Kampala, Uganda, {{began in}} 1993. The idea {{evolved from a}} pig race in Zimbabwe. The pig race {{was held in the}} garden of a local horse breeder (in Zimbabwe) to {{celebrate}} his birthday because he did not have enough space for a horse race. When Entebbe Sailing Club in Uganda considered fund-raising ideas, they adopted the idea of a pig race but substituted goats instead. It first started out {{on the grounds of the}} Kampala Rugby Club with 400 people in attendance. By 1998, it outgrew this facility and was moved to the Speke Resort, Munyonyo, in 1999 because it is the only location large enough to host the goat races, which grossed ten million UGX (Ugandan shilling) and attracted over 7,000 people in 2005. Along with size, the goat race also grew in scale. It quickly evolved into a whole day event modeled on the Royal Ascot horse races in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Unlike in Tobago, goats are not trained for speed or endurance; instead, goat handlers <b>push</b> a <b>padded</b> horizontal barrier behind the goats to keep the goats moving forward during the race. However, there still is prize money of more than 30 million UGX (Ugandan shilling) awarded to the winning goat's owners.|$|R
50|$|The basic Chamberlin has a piano-style keyboard. Underneath each key is an {{individual}} tape-playing mechanism. Each tape is prerecorded with various musical instruments or special effects. When the player presses down a key, a pressure <b>pad</b> <b>pushes</b> the tape on to a tape head and a pinch roller beneath the key catches the tape and pulls it forward into storage box (or on to a roller mechanism). As this occurs {{the sound of the}} tape is heard through an amplified speaker. When the player releases the key, the sound stops, and the tape rewinds by either metal spring rods (as on the early Chamberlins) or by a return-roller mechanism (as on the later M1 models). Each tape is only a few seconds long (8 seconds on many units).|$|R
50|$|A Boston brace {{is a form}} of thoracolumbosacral {{orthosis}} (TLSO). It is {{the most}} commonly used brace in the United States. It is a symmetrical brace. It corrects curvature by <b>pushing</b> with small <b>pads</b> placed against the ribs, which are also used for rotational correction (here it tends to be slightly less successful, however). These pads are usually placed in the back corners of the brace so that the body is thrust forward against the brace's front, which acts to hold the body upright. The brace opens to the back, and usually runs from just above a chair's seat (when a person is seated) to around shoulder-blade height. Because of this, it is not particularly useful in correcting very high curves. It also does not correct hip misalignment, as it uses the hips as a base point. This brace is typically worn 20-23 hours a day.|$|R
50|$|Since 1995, Khrunichev {{has been}} {{developing}} the Angara rocket family. The main purpose of Angara is to ensure Russia's independent access to space, as the rockets can be launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia {{as well as the}} upcoming Vostochny Cosmodrome, instead of having to rely on Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is located on the territory of Kazakhstan. Angara also does not use the toxic fuel that is used by Proton. The Angara programme has been hit by several delays. State funding started to reach appropriate levels only in 2005. In 2009, it was estimated that Angara had 95-97% completion rate over all major program indicators. The main stumbling block is the construction of the new launch pad in Plesetsk. Due to unrealistic deflator indices set by the Ministry of Defense, Khrunichev has not received enough money to order all necessary equipment for finishing the <b>pad,</b> <b>pushing</b> Angara's expected first flight to 2013. When completed, the Angara rockets are intended to replace several existing launchers, including Proton.|$|R
5000|$|SPoRT {{stands for}} [...] "Symmetric, Patient-oriented, Rigid, Three-Dimensional active," [...] which {{it intends to}} be. The brace is symmetrical, built with a plastic frame {{reinforced}} with aluminum rods. The brace corrects hip misalignments through padding. Large, sweeping, thick <b>pads</b> <b>push</b> the spine to a corrected position. To prevent overcorrection, however, the brace also has [...] "stop" [...] pads holding the spine from moving too far in the other direction. The brace runs from just above the chair to T3 in many instancesâ€”it is successful at correcting high thoracic curves. In front, it goes around the patient's breast and up, even to pushing against the collar bone. Though it sounds restricting, it has been tested for comfort while participating in athletics. The theory holds that the support that the brace gives will help the patient's body learn to work {{as though it had}} no curve muscularly. Then the muscles would be able to support the spine, preventing further collapse. This brace is used for all curve patterns and types, even ones considered past brace treatment by other schools. The brace is typically worn 22 hours a day, and often coupled with a physical therapy program.|$|R
50|$|The Lightning {{defeated}} the Canadiens in six games. In game one, Nikita Kucherov scored 2:06 into double overtime to give Tampa Bay a 2-1 win. This winning goal was controversial because the Lightning {{appeared to have}} been offside on the play, but nothing was called by the linesmen. Earlier at 2:56 of the first overtime period, Kucherov's apparent winning goal was waved off after officials ruled that he <b>pushed</b> Carey Price's <b>pad</b> into the net after the Montreal goalie made the initial save. The Lightning also won game two, 6-2, scoring four power play goals. Montreal's Brandon Prust was then fined $5,000 for his postgame derogatory public comments directed toward Referee Brad Watson, which he later apologized for the day afterward. In game three, Tyler Johnson scored with 1.1 seconds left to give Tampa Bay a 2-1 victory. The Canadiens stayed alive in game four, as Max Pacioretty recorded a shorthanded goal and two assists, as Montreal built a 5-0 second-period lead en route to a 6-2 win. Then in game five, P.A. Parenteau scored with 4:07 left in regulation to give the Canadiens a 2-1 victory. In game six, Ben Bishop stopped 18 of 19 Montreal shots, and Kucherov scored two goals, as Tampa Bay won 4-1 to take the series.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} vehicle uses of master {{cylinders}} are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders inside of brake calipers and/or drum brakes; these cylinders {{may be called}} wheel cylinders or slave cylinders, and they <b>push</b> the brake <b>pads</b> towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a drum, or a disc, a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, {{for their ability to}} withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement).|$|R
