40|$|Water vapor {{contributes}} to the radiation budget of earth and the <b>photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone.</b> Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the variation of water vapor in the research of global warming and ozone depletion. Noting that the saturation water vapor mixing ratio in the Cold-Point Tropopause (CPT) is not always a good estimate of water amount entering the stratosphere, Selkirk et al. (2010) defined the Tropopause Saturation Layer (TSL) using the cryogenic frostpoint hygrometer data taken in the tropical eastern Pacific during Northern Hemisphere summer. In the present study, the effectiveness of TSL is examined by using the SOWER data taken in the tropical western Pacific during Northern Hemisphere winter. The contribution of waves associated with the intraseasonal oscillation to dehydration will be discussed along with that of the seasonal variation in the TTL. The results will be reported at poster presentation...|$|E

Clear evidence is seen for the spin-forbidden formation of both of these products {{in conjunction with the}} triplet (ground) state co-fragment, {{as well as for the}} dissociation <b>of</b> internally excited <b>ozone</b> molecules to form both singlet products in a spin-allowed step. For O(1 D) the ratio of spin-forbidden to spin-allowed formation increases as the wavelength is increased, and is more pronounced at the peaks in the structured Huggins bands.

40|$|The <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region In Summer (POLARIS) {{mission was}} {{designed}} to investigate the natural summer decrease of stratospheric ozone levels. Both polar regions have large and distinct annual cycles of ozone column amounts. In northern spring, the average level is over 450 Dobson units (DU), decreasing to less than 275 DU by September. In order to cover this period of ozone decrease, POLARIS was conducted in three deployment phases from Fairbanks, Alaska, (650 N) {{during the summer of}} 1997. The principal measurement platforms were the NASA ER- 2 high-altitude aircraft and stratospheric balloons. Additional measurements were provided by ground-based instruments, sondes, and satellites. POLARIS observations included ozone, meteorological variables, particles, long-lived chemicals, and short-lived radicals. During the field deployments, several modeling and theoretical groups participated in flight planning and data evaluation activities. The interpretive studies in this Special Section of the Journal of Geophysical Research are a first comprehensive examination of the POLARIS data set, addressing stratospheric ozone abundances and its changes; the role of aerosols; details of the photochemistry of reactive species; transport of stratospheric air and the correlations of long-lived species; and measurement intercomparisons...|$|E
40|$|We use {{the first}} {{simultaneous}} in situ measurements of ClONO 2, ClO, and HCl acquired using the NASA ER- 2 aircraft during the <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) mission {{to test whether}} these three compounds quantitatively account for total inorganic chlorine (Cly) in the lower stratosphere in 1997. We find (ClO + ClONO 2 + HCl) /Cly = 0. 92 +/- 0. 10, where Cly is inferred from in situ measurements of organic chlorine source gases. These observations are consistent with our current understanding of the budget and partitioning of Cly in the lower stratosphere. We find no {{evidence in support of}} missing inorganic chlorine species that compose a significant fraction of Cly. We apply the analysis to earlier ER- 2 observations dating from 1991 to investigate possible causes of previously observed discrepancies in the inorganic chlorine budget. Using space shuttle, satellite, balloon, and aircraft measurements in combination with ER- 2 data, we find that the discrepancy is unlikely to have been caused by missing chlorine species or an error in the photolysis rate of chlorine nitrate. We also find that HCl/Cly is not significantly controlled by aerosol surface area density in the lower stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{inorganic}} chlorine (Cl_y,) partitioning in {{the summer}} lower stratosphere using in situ ER- 2 aircraft observations made during the <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) campaign. New steady state and numerical models estimate [ClONO_ 2]/[HCl] using currently accepted photochemistry. These models are tightly constrained by observations with OH (parameterized {{as a function of}} solar zenith angle) substituting for modeled HO_ 2 chemistry. We find that inorganic chlorine photochemistry alone overestimates observed [ClONO_ 2]/[HCl] by approximately 55 – 60 % at mid and high latitudes. On the basis of POLARIS studies of the inorganic chlorine budget, [ClO]/[ClONO_ 2], and an intercomparison with balloon observations, the most direct explanation for the model-measurement discrepancy in Cl_y, partitioning is an error in the reactions, rate constants, and measured species concentrations linking HCl and ClO (simulated [ClO]/[HCl] too high) in combination with a possible systematic error in the ER- 2 ClONO_ 2 measurement (too low). The high precision of our simulation (± 15 % 1 σ for [ClONO_ 2]/[HCl], which is compared with observations) increases confidence in the observations, photolysis calculations, and laboratory rate constants. These results, along with other findings, should lead to improvements in both the accuracy and precision of stratospheric photochemical models...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe middle {{atmosphere}} is generally {{defined as the}} region of the atmosphere located between the tropopause (8 – 17 km) and the mesopause (85 – 90 km). It includes the stratosphere, where the ozone layer takes place, and the mesosphere. The temperature and wind structure of this region is mainly driven by radiative processes (mainly on of solar radiation by ozone and infrared cooling by CO 2) and dynamic processes (propagation and breaking of planetary and gravity waves, meridional circulation from equator to poles in the stratosphere, and from summer pole to winter pole in the mesosphere). A good knowledge of these processes is required to understand the transport of constituents playing a role in the <b>photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> and the heat budget of the {{middle atmosphere}} determining its thermal structure. In-situ measurements at these high altitudes are not easy to perform and several remote sensing techniques have been developed to observe these regions from the ground and from space, among them infrasound measurement is a promising one. This article presents the main characteristics of dynamics and transport in the middle atmosphere and gives a review of the remote sensing techniques used to observe this region in complement to infrasound detection: lidars, radars, infrared and microwave sounders, and GNSS radio-occultation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> in {{the tropics}} was intensively {{investigated}} during a balloon campaign at Teresina/Brazil in June 2005. Our limb scanning UV/Vis mini-DOAS instrument was deployed on 3 balloon flights on June 14 (MIPAS-B), June 17 (LPMA/DOAS) and June 30 (LPMA/IASI). During one of this flights (MIPAS-B), we could surprisingly detect HONO in the tropical tropopause transition layer (TTL). Observed HONO profiles were almost time independent for three hours around local noon with maximum HONO concentrations of 1. 0 x 10 ^ 9 molec/cm 3 at 11 km. The measured UV/vis skylight spectra were analyzed applying the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. When combined with 3 D radiative-transfer modeling and an optimal estimation inversion technique, atmospheric concentration profiles of the targeted trace-gases can be inferred for each limb scan [Weidner et al., 2005]. Meteorological data and simultaneously measured O 3 and NO 2 indicate that the measured HONO can be best explained by intense radical photochemistry in the outflow of a meso-scale convective system, which possibly includes lightning produced NOX and HOX and, subsequent, HONO production. However, in order to explain {{the large amount of}} detected HONO by known chemical reactions, an elevated Leighton ratio and /or intense HOX photochemistry are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Two in situ CO 2 analyzers {{have been}} {{developed}} for deployment on the NASA ER- 2 aircraft and on stratospheric balloons. The ER- 2 instrument has had more than 150 flights during 21 deployments from 1992 to 2000, resulting in a dataset with nearly pole-to-pole coverage that includes data from all seasons in both hemispheres except austral summer. In-flight calibrations show that the typical long-term (i. e. flight-to-flight) precision of the instruments is better than plus or minus 0. 1 ppmv. The flight standards are traceable to standards held by the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory. The balloon instrument has had 8 balloon flights since September 1996, providing the first in situ observations of CO 2 above approx. 21 km. In addition, the balloon instrument has been flown onboard a Cessna Citation II aircraft for sampling between the surface and 10 km. In this paper, the instrumentation and calibration procedures for both instruments are described in detail.

40|$|Stratospheric {{measurements}} of NO, NO_(2), O_(3), ClO, and HO_(2) were made during spring, early summer, and late {{summer in the}} Arctic region during 1997 {{as part of the}} <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) field campaign. In the sunlit atmosphere, NO_(2) and NO are in steady state through NO 2 photolysis and reactions involving O_(3), ClO, BrO, and HO_(2). By combining observations of O_(3), ClO, and HO_(2), observed and modeled values of the NO_(2) photolysis rate coefficient (JNO_(2)), and model estimates of BrO, several comparisons are made between steady state and measured values of both NO_(2) and JNO_(2). An apparent seasonal dependence in discrepancies between calculated and measured values was found; however, a source for this dependence could not be identified. Overall, the mean linear fits in the various comparisons show agreement within 19 %, well within the combined uncertainties (± 50 to 70 %). These results suggest that photochemistry controlling the NO_(2) /NO abundance ratio is well represented throughout much of the sunlit lower stratosphere. A reduction in the uncertainty of laboratory determinations of the rate coefficient of NO + O_(3) → NO_(2) + O_(2) would aid future analyses of these or similar atmospheric observations...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to better {{constrain}} atmospheric water vapor mixing ratios and to understand the discrepancies between different measurements of water vapor in the stratosphere and troposphere, we have carefully examined data from the Harvard Lyman-alpha photofragment fluorescence hygrometer, which has flown on the NASA ER- 2 aircraft from 1992 through 1998. The instrument is calibrated in the laboratory before and after each deployment, and the calibration is checked by direct absorption measurements in the troposphere. On certain flights, the ER- 2 flew level tracks during which water vapor varied by up to 80 ppmv, under nearly constant atmospheric conditions. These flights provide a stringent test of our calibration via direct absorption and indicate agreement to within 3 %. During the 1997 <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region In Summer (POLARIS) mission, our Lyman-alpha instrument was compared with a new diode laser hygrometer from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Overall agreement was 5 % during the June/July deployment and 1 % for potential temperatures of 490 to 540 K. The accuracy of our instrument is shown to be +/- 5 %, with an additional offset of at most 0. 1 ppmv.

40|$|Combustion {{of large}} {{quantities}} of fuel at industrial sites generates various types of air pollutant, which represent {{a major source of}} environmental degradation. Shuaiba Industrial Area (SIA) is considered the most important industrial area in Kuwait because it is a centre for heavy industry. Analysis of the real-time monitoring data collected by a mobile laboratory showed that a number of high smog days were observed at SIA. The results indicated that in summer, especially in September, SIA is subject to ambient ozone concentrations equal to or exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 120 ppb. It was found that the days that show high photochemically reactive air exhibit similar pollutant levels and meteorological specifications. The results highlight the role of the sea breeze in transporting and circulating ozone and unconsumed ozone precursors. In order to understand the reasons for high ozone concentrations and to evaluate the nature <b>of</b> the observed <b>ozone</b> episodes, the Integrated Empirical Rate (IER) chemical reaction model was used. The IER model can be used to interpret the air ambient monitoring data and it is a valuable tool for assessing ozone precursor control strategies. A detailed evaluation using the IER model, performed for one day of SIA monitoring data, is presented in this paper as a case study. Moreover, a detailed discussion of the data interpretation is given using this day as an example to indicate whether the local <b>photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> peak <b>ozone</b> events is light-limited or NO x-limited. This information is needed in developing an effective emission control plan for the industrial site. It was concluded that for the light-limited air parcels monitored between 05. 00 hrs and 10. 30 hrs, hydrocarbon reduction is required for a reduction in ozone concentration. For the NO x-limited parcels detected between 10. 30 hrs and 18. 30 hrs, reduction in NOx emissions would reduce the ozone concentration. © Institution of Chemical Engineers...|$|R

In the unpolluted troposphere, where stratospheric inputs of odd nitrogen appear to represent the photochemical source of O 3, strong cloud reflectance increases the concentration of NO in the upper troposphere, leading to greatly enhanced rates <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> formation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) field mission was to obtain data to better characterize the summertime seasonal decrease of ozone at mid to high latitudes. The decrease in ozone occurs mainly in the lower stratosphere {{and is expected to}} result from in situ chemical destruction. Instrumented balloons and aircraft were used in POLARIS, along with satellites, to measure ozone and chemical species which are involved with stratospheric ozone chemistry. In order to close the seasonal ozone budget, however, ozone transport must also be estimated. Comparison to a global chemistry and transport model (CTM) of the stratosphere indicates how well the summertime ozone loss processes are simulated and thus how well we can predict the ozone response to changing amounts of chemical source gases. Moreover, the model gives insight into the possible relative magnitude of transport contributions to the seasonal ozone decline. Initial comparison to the Goddard CTM, which uses transport winds and temperatures from meteorological data assimilation, shows a high ozone bias in the model and an attenuated summertime ozone loss cycle. Comparison of the model chemical partitioning and ozone catalytic loss rates to those derived from measurements shows fairly close agreement both at ER- 2 altitudes (20 km) and higher. This suggests that the model transport is too active in resupplying ozone to the high latitude region, although chemistry failings cannot be completely ruled out.

This approach provides a complete and comprehensive representation of transport, emission, and <b>photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> various constituents from the surface to the mesopause region. A comparison of model results with observations indicates that the ozone distribution and variability are in agreement with observations throughout most of the model domain. Column ozone annual variation is represented to within 5 – 10 % of the observations except in the Southern Hemisphere for springtime high latitudes. The vertical ozone distribution is generally well represented by the model up to the mesopause region.

40|$|During the 1997 <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) mission, {{simultaneous}} in situ {{observations of}} NO_x and HO_x radicals, their precursors, and the radiation field were {{obtained in the}} lower stratosphere. We use these observations to evaluate the primary mechanisms that control NO_x−HNO_ 3 exchange and to understand their control over the partitioning between NO_ 2 and HNO_ 3 in regions of continuous sunlight. We calculate NO_x production (P_(NO) _x) and loss (L_(NO) _x) in a manner directly constrained by the in situ measurements and current rate constant recommendations, using approaches for representing albedo, overhead O_ 3 and [OH] that reduce model uncertainty. We find a consistent discrepancy of 18 % between modeled rates of NO_x production and loss (L_(NO) _x = 1. 18 P_(NO) _x) which is within the measurement uncertainty of ± 27 %. The partitioning between NO_x production processes is [HNO_ 3 + OH (41 ± 2) %; HNO+ 3 + hν (59 ± 2) %] and between NO_x loss processes is [NO_ 2 + OH, 90 % to > 97 %; BrONO_ 2 + H_ 2 O, 10 % to < 3 %]. The steady-state description of NO_x−HNO_ 3 exchange reveals the significant influence of the tight correlation between the photolysis rate of HNO_ 3 and [OH] established by in situ measurements throughout the lower stratosphere. Parametrizing this relationship, we find (1) the steady-state value of [NO_ 2]_(24 h-avg) /[HNO_ 3] in the continuously sunlit, lower stratosphere is a function only of temperature and number density, and (2) the partitioning of NO_x production between HNO_ 3 + OH and HNO_ 3 + hν is nearly constant {{throughout most of the}} lower stratosphere. We describe a methodology (functions of latitude, day, temperature, and pressure) for accurately predicting the steady-state value of [NO_ 2]_(24 h-avg) /[HNO_ 3] and the partitioning of NO_x production within these regions. The results establish a metric to compare observations of [NO_ 2]_(24 h-avg) /[HNO_ 3] within the continuously sunlit region and provide a simple diagnostic for evaluating the accuracy of models that attempt to describe the coupled NO_x−HO_x photochemistry in the lower stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{observations}} Of NO_ 2, NO, NO_y, ClONO_ 2, OH, O_ 3, aerosol surface area, spectrally resolved solar radiation, {{pressure and}} temperature {{obtained from the}} ER- 2 aircraft during the <b>Photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ozone</b> Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) experiments are {{used to examine the}} factors controlling the fast photochemistry connecting NO and NO_ 2 and the slower chemistry connecting NO_x and HNO_ 3. Our analysis uses “chemical coordinates” to examine gradients of the difference between a model and precisely calibrated measurements to provide a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of current photochemical models. The NO/NO_ 2 analysis suggests that reducing the activation energy for the NO+O_ 3 reaction by 1. 7 kJ/mol will improve model representation of the temperature dependence of the NO/NO_ 2 ratio in the range 215 – 235 K. The NO_x/HNO_ 3 analysis shows that systematic errors in the relative rate coefficients used to describe NO_x loss by the reaction OH + NO_ 2 → HNO_ 3 and by the reaction set NO_ 2 + O_ 3 → NO_ 3; NO_ 2 + NO_ 3 → N_(2) O_ 5; N_(2) O_ 5 + H_(2) O → 2 HNO_ 3 are in error by + 8. 4 % (+ 30 /− 45 %) (OH+NO_ 2 too fast) in models using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 1997 recommendations [DeMore et al., 1997]. Models that use recommendations for OH+NO 2 and OH+HNO_ 3 based on reanalysis of recent and past laboratory measurements are in error by 1. 2 % (+ 30 /− 45 %) (OH+NO_ 2 too slow). The + 30 %/− 45 % error limit reflects systematic uncertainties, while the statistical uncertainty is 0. 65 %. This analysis also shows that the POLARIS observations only modestly constrain the relative rates of the major NO_x production reactions HNO 3 + OH → H_(2) O + NO_ 3 and HNO_ 3 + hν → OH + NO_ 2. Even under the assumption that all other aspects of the model are perfect, the POLARIS observations only constrain the rate coefficient for OH+HNO_ 3 to a range of 65 % around the currently recommended value...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For {{almost half}} a century it was widely {{believed}} that the <b>photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> the stratosphere and hence ozone distribution were well understoood. As observations revealed a gap between observed and predicted values it was recognized that a number of substances acted as catalysts thereby increasing the destruction <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and that humanity could augment those catalysts and affect the ozone layer. Initial concern focused on nitrogen oxides from the exhausts of supersonic transport, but attention switched in the mid- 1970 s to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Although the theory <b>of</b> anthropogenic <b>ozone</b> depletion by CFCs found widespread scientific support the perceived threat was minimized in particular by successive model predictions downgrading the amount of depletion. The appearance <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> hole over Antarctica in the mid- 1980 s reopened the debate as to whether such depletion was anthropogenic or natural in origin. It also highlighted the model’s inadequate treatment of the processes occurring in the stratosphere and the importance of dynamics and radiative transfer in stratospheric ozone destruction. Scientific consensus again favours the anthropogenic depletion <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> layer. In conclusion it is considered that the degree of consensus outweighs the image of scientific uncertainty that is often portrayed in relation to the issue <b>of</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> depletion...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to obtain data concerning the concentration versus altitude of various constituents {{of interest in the}} <b>photochemistry</b> <b>of</b> the stratospheric <b>ozone</b> layer. Data pertinent to this objective are obtained using balloon-borne instruments to measure the atmospheric transmission and emission in the mid infrared. In addition to obtaining constituent profile information, the spectral data obtained are also used to identify absorption or emission features which may interfere with the retrieval of constituent data from satellite instruments using lower spectral resolution. The spectral resolution obtained with the solar spectral system is 0. 0025 cm(exp - 1) and represents about a factor of 5 greater resolution than any solar spectra previously obtained in this spectral region. As a result of the increase in spectral resolution, a large number of features are observed in these spectra which were not observed in previous studies. Identification and analysis of these features is in progress. The results of this analysis to date shows a number of HNO 3 features which have not been observed before, and these occur where they will interfere with the retrieval of other constituents. An example of the interference is the occurrence of features in the 780. 2 cm(exp - 1) region which overlap the ClONO 2 feature which will be used for retrieval of ClONO 2 by the CLAES instrument on UARS. A number of features due to COF 2 were also identified in the 1250 cm(exp - 1) region which may interfere with retrieval of N 2 O 5...|$|R
