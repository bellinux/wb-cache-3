5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are <b>pneumocystis</b> <b>pneumonia</b> (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E

5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems.

Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E

Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (<b>Pneumocystis</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name Trypanosoma cruzi.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Sylvester's boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, {{became aware}} that he had become {{infected}} with HIV; with no known medical cure, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died in September 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he {{moved into a new}} apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became too sick to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with <b>pneumocystis</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{reports on}} a first case of granulomatous <b>Pneumocystis</b> carinii <b>pneumonia</b> (PCP) in a human {{immunodeficiency}} virus-negative patient with antineu-trophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive Wegener’s granulomatosis whilst receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient presented with diffuse alveolar haemor-rhage, pauci-immune rapid progressive glomerulonephritis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the skin. Granulomatous <b>Pneumocystis</b> carinii <b>pneumonia</b> developed under immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisone. At the time <b>Pneumocystis</b> carinii <b>pneumonia</b> developed, there was a marked lymphopenia with a very low CD 8 + cell count in the blood. Grocott staining in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed no Pneumocystis carinii. The diagnosis was made via a video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy which showed granulomas containing high num-bers of Pneumocystis carinii cysts...|$|R

25|$|The term PCP, {{which was}} widely used by {{practitioners}} and patients, has been retained for convenience, with the rationale {{that it now}} stands for the more general <b>Pneumocystis</b> <b>pneumonia</b> rather than Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|The older {{species name}} Pneumocystis carinii (which now {{applies only to}} the Pneumocystis species that is found in rats) is still in common usage.

25|$|Pneumocystis {{infection}} {{can also}} be diagnosed by immunofluorescent or histochemical staining of the specimen, and more recently by molecular analysis of polymerase chain reaction products comparing DNA samples.

25|$|The causative {{organism}} of PCP is distributed worldwide and <b>Pneumocystis</b> <b>pneumonia</b> {{has been described}} in all continents except Antarctica. Greater than 75% of children are seropositive {{by the age of}} 4, which suggests a high background exposure to the organism. A post-mortem study conducted in Chile of 96 persons who died of unrelated causes (suicide, traffic accidents, and so forth) found that 65 (68%) of them had pneumocystis in their lungs, which suggests that asymptomatic pneumocystis infection is extremely common.|$|E
25|$|The disease PCP is {{relatively}} rare {{in people with}} normal immune systems, but common among people with weakened immune systems, such as premature or severely malnourished children, the elderly, and especially persons living with HIV/AIDS (in whom it is most commonly observed). PCP can also develop in patients who are taking immunosuppressive medications. It can occur in patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation or bone marrow transplantation and after surgery. Infections with <b>Pneumocystis</b> <b>pneumonia</b> are also common in infants with hyper IgM syndrome, an X-linked or autosomal recessive trait.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidemic}} of the immunodeficiency disease AIDS, {{which began in}} Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1930s as a mutation of the chimpanzee disease SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus), which was named Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), {{found its way to}} the shores of the United States as early as 1960, but was first noticed after doctors discovered clusters of Kaposi's sarcoma and <b>pneumocystis</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in young gay men in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco in 1981. This strain was called HIV-1. A second strain, called HIV-2 was discovered; it is presumed to have mutated from SIVsmm, a strain of the Simian virus present naturally in the sooty mangabey, a monkey found primarily along the African coast from Senegal to Ghana. HIV-2 is common in West Africa, but is much rarer in the United States than HIV-1, which is more virulent and progresses more quickly to the fully fledged AIDS disease.|$|E

40|$|URL] <b>Pneumocystis</b> carinii <b>pneumonia</b> {{occasionally}} {{appears in}} immunodeficient patients. While several reports {{have shown that}} <b>Pneumocystis</b> carinii <b>pneumonia</b> occurred in the early phase of starting infliximab treatment in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), the present case suggests {{for the first time}} that an increased dosage of infliximab may also lead to pneumonia. RESULTS: A 51 -year-old male had been taking 5 mg of infliximab for the treatment of CD for 10 years with no adverse events. Beginning in September 2013, the dose of infliximab had to be increased to 10 mg/kg because his status worsened. Thereafter, he complained of a fever and cough, and a CT scan revealed ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes of the bilateral lung with a crazy-paving pattern. Bronchoscopy detected swelling of the tracheal mucosa with obvious dilations of the vessels. A polymerase chain reaction using a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample detected specific sequences for Pneumocystis jirovecii; thus he was diagnosed with <b>Pneumocystis</b> carinii (jirovecii) <b>pneumonia.</b> After discontinuing infliximab and starting antibiotic treatment, his symptoms and CT findings were dramatically improved. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of an increased dosage of infliximab can cause <b>Pneumocystis</b> carinii <b>pneumonia</b> in CD patient...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{disease is}} common in HIV-infected {{patients}}. Diagnostic means, however, are often scarce in areas where most HIV patients are living.
