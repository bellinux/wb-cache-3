Clad in stained plywood with an angled timber fascia, the undersides of the lighting coves are pierced by regularly spaced square lights. The ceiling above these coves is clad in <b>perforated</b> <b>plywood.</b> Other light fittings are generally circular. Throughout the building the footings of the laminated timber arches are exposed.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{building}} materials to control indoor air humidity is studied in this paper. First, moisture capacity and transient response of building materials were investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. Effects of moisture-absorbing interior wall materials on indoor air humidity were measured in a full-scale room under controlled conditions with known ventilation rates and moisture production schedule. The measured interior surface materials included wood, porous wood fiberboard, gypsum board with hygroscopic insulation, <b>perforated</b> <b>plywood</b> board, and, in a reference case, aluminium foil. Second, numerical simu-lation tools for hygrothermal performance analyses of building envelope parts and for buildings {{as a whole}} {{were used to assess}} the impact of hygroscopic mass on indoor air humidity. Two levels of testing and simulation were carried out: First, the moisture capacity of building materials in dynamic conditions was tested in small-scale laboratory tests. Second, the materials were placed in a room with intermittent moisture production. Moisture production and ventilation rates were set to correspond to those typical in residential buildings. Mass transfer between the finishing materials and indoor air affects the humidity both in indoor air and in the building envelope. The effect of coatings and their vapor permeance on the moisture exchange was investigated. A sensitivity study looking at the hygrothermal material properties and their effects on the performance was carried out. The results show that building materials exposed to indoor air can have a strong effect on the indoor air humidity. Potentials, practical applications, and design concepts for utilizing the moisture-buffering effect of building materials are discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA multidirectional cage trap (MDC-Trap) was {{developed}} {{in order to assess}} small-scale directional movements of benthic invertebrates in streams. The trap can be operated with causing minimal disturbance to the stream bed and enables repeated sampling of identical patches of stream bottom. The MDC-Trap combines characteristics of net samplers with features of colonization-substrate samplers. It is made out of a <b>perforated</b> <b>plywood</b> box which is divided into nine compartments. Each compartment is loaded with a gravel-filled directional cage that can be colonized from one direction only. The modular design of the MDC-Trap allows assessing of up to nine different types of invertebrate movement simultaneously: upstream, downstream and lateral on the substrate surface as well as subsurface movements upstream, downstream and lateral. If necessary, distinctions can be made between left and right oriented movements. Furthermore, movements vertically upward from within the hyporheos can be recorded. The MDC-Trap was designed to be used in streams with coarse sand, gravel or pebble substrates. The device is constructed so that there is no clogging and, once exposed, the trap can be left in the stream indefinitely. The results of first field tests show that the MDC-Trap is suitable to characterize small-scale movements of invertebrates in gravel streams. Net longitudinal movement was in the downstream direction for most species, although the taxon-specific patterns varied considerably. In particular, Baetis rhodani and Hydropsyche spp. exhibited a clear preference for downstream movement by drifting or crawling and seldom displayed upstream or lateral movement. Preference for downstream movement was less pronounced for chironomids, Eucyclops serrulatus and Gammarus pulex. Other taxa were about equally distributed among the direction-sensitive subunits. No taxon exhibited large-scale upstream movement. These findings are in contrast to the idea of compensatory migrations...|$|E
