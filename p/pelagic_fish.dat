5|$|Hawksbills evidently reach {{maturity}} after 20 years. Their lifespan is unknown. Like other sea turtles, hawksbills are solitary {{for most}} of their lives; they meet only to mate. They are highly migratory. Because of their tough carapaces, adults' only predators are sharks, estuarine crocodiles, octopuses, and some species of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are also}} cut from grazing animals, usually farmed, other than cattle, {{including}} bison, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep, ostrich, pigs, reindeer, turkey, deer and zebu {{as well as}} various types of fish, especially salmon and large <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> such as swordfish, shark and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon and veal, these cuts are {{often referred to as}} chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish.</b> They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Skagen is Denmark's largest {{fishing port}} {{and the first}} in Europe for {{landings}} of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> primarily herring. Founded in 1960, FF Skagen {{is one of three}} companies supporting the Danish fish-meal industry; its processing plant is located on Skagen wharf. As of 2011, statistics from the Danish Fisheries Directorate list Skagen Harbour as the leading fishing port in Denmark in terms of both the quantity of catches and their value. Statistics for 2013 from NaturErhvervstyrelsen showed a year-on-year increase in fishing takings of 10 percent for a total value of DKK 3.4 billion (c. US $621 million). Harbour director Willy Bent Hansen reported that the Port of Skagen now represented over 25 percent of all fish landed in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.|$|E
25|$|Many large <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> are oceanic nomadic species which {{undertake}} long offshore migrations.

25|$|Examples of {{shallow water}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> found in both {{tropical}} and temperate waters around the world, are grey mullet, sprats and garfish. As <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> all these fish {{spend most of}} their time living in the water column away the sea floor.|$|E
25|$|Demersal {{fish are}} bottom feeders. They can be contrasted with <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> which live and feed {{away from the}} bottom in the open water column.

25|$|Marine <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> can {{be divided}} into pelagic coastal fish and oceanic <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish.</b> Coastal fish inhabit the {{relatively}} shallow and sunlit waters above the continental shelf, while oceanic fish (which may well also swim inshore) inhabit the vast and deep waters beyond the continental shelf.|$|E
40|$|The marine {{fisheries}} resources of India including the EE Zone of about 2 million sq. km are of considerable magnitude.

25|$|<b>Pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> {{range in}} size from small coastal forage fish, such as {{herrings}} and sardines, to large apex predator oceanic fishes, such as bluefin tuna and oceanic sharks. They are usually agile swimmers with streamlined bodies, capable of sustained cruising on long-distance migrations. The Indo-Pacific sailfish, an oceanic <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> can sprint at over 110 kilometres per hour. Some tuna species cruise across the Pacific Ocean. Many <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> swim in schools weighing hundreds of tonnes. Others are solitary, like the large ocean sunfish weighing over 500 kilograms, which sometimes drift passively with ocean currents, eating jellyfish.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs), ideally, manage human uses that threaten ecosystems, or components of ecosystems. During several recent MPA designation processes, concerns have arisen over the scientific justification for no-take MPAs, {{particularly those that}} restrict recreational <b>fishing</b> for <b>pelagic</b> species. An important question is: under what conditions might recreational <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> be compatible with the conservation goals of an MPA that is primarily focused on benthic communities? In 2005, an expert workshop of fisheries biologists, marine ecologists, MPA managers, and recreational fishermen was convened by NOAA's National MPA Center to evaluate the limited empirical data on benthic-pelagic coupling and to help provide practical advice on this topic. The participants (i) proposed a preliminary conceptual framework for addressing vertical zoning, (ii) developed preliminary guidelines to consider when evaluating whether to allow or restrict <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> in an MPA, and (iii) identified future research priorities for understanding benthic-pelagic coupling. A suite of ecological conditions where recreational <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> may not be compatible with benthic conservation were identified: (1) high relief habitats, (2) depths shallower than 50 - 100 m (depending upon the specific location), (3) major topographic and oceanographic features, and (4) spawning areas. Similarly, <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> {{is not likely to}} affect benthic communities adversely in many circumstances. Until further scientific study can shed more light on the issue of how benthic-pelagic linkages affect specific conservation targets, the proposed framework in this manuscript provides practical, easily-applied guidance for using vertical zoning to manage fishing in multiple use MPAs that focus on benthic conservation...|$|R
25|$|Other nearshore or {{shallow water}} fish {{live near the}} shore in depths of less than 10 metres.

25|$|Tuna in {{particular}} are of major importance to commercial fisheries. Though tuna migrate across oceans, trying to find them {{there is not the}} usual approach. Tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant, along the boundaries of currents, around islands, near seamounts, and in some areas of upwelling along continental slopes. Tuna are captured by several methods: purse seine vessels enclose an entire surface school with special nets, pole and line vessels which use poles baited with other smaller <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> as baitfish, and rafts called fish aggregating devices are set up, because tuna, as well as some other <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> tend to congregate under floating objects.|$|E
25|$|Midwater {{trawling}} is {{also known}} as pelagic trawling. Midwater trawling catches <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|E
25|$|Pelagic {{fisheries}} are fisheries for <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> that is, {{for fish}} that are offshore {{in the open}} ocean, such as small schooling forage fish, sometimes called bait fish, and larger fish who prey on them, such as tuna and ocean sharks.|$|E
