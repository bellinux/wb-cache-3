Subsequent studies showed that the biospherians' metabolism became more efficient at extracting nutrients from their food as an adaptation to the low-calorie, high nutrient diet.|$|E

50|$|Many {{potential}} {{pilots and}} navigators {{did not have}} the required education, but a lowering of standards would have been dangerous. Caradus devised and prepared a <b>pre-entry</b> course of educational training which covered elementary navigation, mathematics, elementary science and some service subjects. After a few weeks, however, it was found that men who were nominally up to standard were at a disadvantage on entering their service training in comparison with those who had done the <b>pre-entry</b> course. It was therefore decided that all except those with very high qualifications should take the course. The scheme was a great success and saw a vast {{increase in the number of}} graduates.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{eyewitness}} {{accounts of the}} fireball caused by the incoming meteorite and on the calibrated photographs of the track which it had left behind and which was visible for about half an hour, scientists have managed to calculate the orbit it followed before it impacted with Earth. Although none of the photographs captured the fireball directly, the fireball path was reconstructed from two calibrated photos taken minutes after the event, giving the entry angle. Eyewitness accounts {{in the vicinity of}} Whitehorse, Yukon accurately constrained the ground track azimuth from either side. It was found that the Tagish Lake meteorite had a <b>pre-entry</b> Apollo type orbit that brought it from the outer reaches of the asteroid belt. Currently, there are only eleven meteorite falls with accurately determined <b>pre-entry</b> orbits, based on photographs or video recordings of the fireballs themselves taken from two or more different angles.|$|E

For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because {{the angle of the}} shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed.|$|E

50|$|In 2002 Immigrations Service Ports Directorate {{achieved}} {{its highest}} number of refusals at the border ever, 50,362 as compared with 17,220 refusals at port in 1994.

By 2004, 31,930 passengers were refused entry at port and subsequently removed and, in 2010 the figure had markedly fallen to 18,276.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pre-entry</b> {{closed shop}} (or simply closed shop) {{is a form}} of union {{security}} agreement under which the employer agrees to hire union members only, and employees must remain members of the union at all times in order to remain employed. This is different from a post-entry closed shop (US: union shop), which is an agreement requiring all employees to join the union if they are not already members. In a union shop, the union must accept as a member any person hired by the employer.|$|E

50|$|Historically, in the United Kingdom {{entrants}} used {{first to}} complete a non media-studies related degree course, giving maximum educational breadth, prior to taking a specialist postgraduate <b>pre-entry</b> course.

There are now over 60 universities in the UK offering BA honours degrees in journalism. Postgraduate courses are more well-established, some of which are either recognised by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) or the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ).|$|E
5000|$|Dunn and Gennard found 111 United Kingdom {{cases of}} {{dismissals}} on {{the introduction of}} a closed shop, involving 325 individuals. They state [...] "While proponents of the closed shop may argue that an estimated minimum 325 dismissals is a relatively small number compared with the total population covered by closed shops, critics would see the figure as substantial arguing that one dismissal is one too many." [...] In relation to the <b>pre-entry</b> closed shop, they state [...] "Its raison d'être is to exclude people from jobs by denying them union membership". [...] All forms of closed shops in the UK are illegal following the introduction of the Employment Act 1990. They were further curtailed under section 137(1)(a) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (c. 52) passed by the Conservative government at the time. The Labour Party, then in opposition, had supported closed shops until December 1989, when it abandoned the policy in accordance with European legislation. However, Labour shadow arts minister Thangam Debbonaire announced to an Equity conference in May 2016 that she favoured {{the introduction of a}} [...] "limited" [...] closed shop for actors, as part of Jeremy Corbyn's pledge to strengthen and introduce a new package of employment rights beneficial to employees. Equity {{was one of the last}} trade unions in the United Kingdom to offer a <b>pre-entry</b> closed shop until the 1990 act.|$|E
