The convention had reverted to defining the atomic mass of hydrogen as 1, although at the level of precision of measurements at that time—relative uncertainties of around 1%—this was numerically equivalent to the later standard of oxygen = 16. However the chemical convenience of having oxygen as the <b>primary</b> <b>atomic</b> mass <b>standard</b> became ever more evident with advances in analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass determinations.|$|R
40|$|Laser cooling is a {{fundamental}} technique used in <b>primary</b> <b>atomic</b> frequency <b>standards,</b> quantum computers, quantum condensed matter physics and tests of fundamental physics, among other areas. It has been known since the early 1990 s that laser cooling can, in principle, be improved by using squeezed light as an electromagnetic reservoir; while quantum feedback control using a squeezed light probe is also predicted to allow improved cooling. Here we show the implementation of quantum feedback control of a micro-mechanical oscillator using squeezed probe light. This allows quantum-enhanced feedback cooling with a measurement rate greater than it is possible with classical light, and a consequent reduction in the final oscillator temperature. Our results have significance for future applications in areas ranging from quantum information networks, to quantum-enhanced force and displacement measurements and fundamental tests of macroscopic quantum mechanics...|$|R
