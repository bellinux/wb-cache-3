500|$|All {{tickets for}} the Wonder World Tour were sold {{exclusively}} through <b>paperless</b> <b>ticket</b> delivery, meaning that fans did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card {{used to make the}} purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry. All groups were to enter the concert together, and ushers issued seat locator slips. The method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008–10). However, it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing. This was done in response to the extensive ticket scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour and in order to give fans the opportunity to purchase good tickets at face value. Cyrus' manager and president of Morey Management Group, Jason Morey, stated, [...] "The focus was, 'How do we take all the information we gathered last time out and {{do a better job of}} it?' It was important to us to address the issue of demand. We thought that of every single option that was available out there, this was a really viable option, to go with the paperless ticketing." [...] As with the Best of Both Worlds Tour, one dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer.|$|E

40|$|We are {{interested}} in whether preventing resale of tickets benefits the capacity providers for sporting and entertainment events. Common wisdom suggests that ticket resale is harmful to event organizers' revenues and event organizers have tried to prevent resale of tickets. For instance, Ticketmaster has recently proposed <b>paperless</b> (non-transferrable) <b>ticketing</b> which would severely limit the opportunity to resell tickets. We consider a model that allows resale from both consumers and speculators with different transaction costs for each party. Surprisingly, we find that this wisdom is incorrect when event organizers use fixed pricing policies, in fact event organizers benefit from reductions in consumers' (and speculators') transaction costs of resale. Even when multiperiod pricing policies are used, we find that an event organizer may still benefit from ticket resale if his capacity is small. While <b>paperless</b> <b>ticketing</b> is suggested {{as a way to}} reduce ticket resale and prevent speculators from buying tickets, our results suggest that it may reduce the capacity providers' revenues in many situations. Instead, we propose ticket options as a novel ticket pricing mechanism. We show that ticket options (where consumers would initially buy an option to buy a ticket and then exercise at a later date) naturally reduce ticket resale significantly and result in significant increases in event organizers' revenues. Furthermore, since a consumer only risks the option price (and not the whole ticket price) if she cannot attend the event, options may face less consumer resistance than <b>paperless</b> <b>tickets...</b>|$|R

The NYWW network is currently providing coverage on the Hudson River, East River, and Upper New York Bay. With the wireless network in place, NY Waterway is able to take control of its fleet and passengers {{in a way that was}} not previously possible.

5000|$|The tour uses a [...] "paperless ticket" [...] system {{requiring}} concert attendees {{to present}} the credit card they used to purchase tickets {{as well as a}} photo ID upon entry at the venue. The measures are meant to combat ticket resellers. However, on the tour's opening night in Vancouver on 12 May 2017, attendees faced long queues to enter BC Place; some fans missed the performance of opening act Mumford & Sons. Live Nation officials blamed the delays on a mix-up regarding which gates at the stadium would accept <b>paperless</b> <b>tickets.</b> To recompense affected concertgoers, Ticketmaster is offering $50 gift cards for use against future events, while BC Place is offering free attendance to a Vancouver Whitecaps FC or BC Lions sporting event with a $20 food/beverage voucher.|$|R
500|$|The Wonder World Tour is {{the second}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Miley Cyrus.

It also became Cyrus' first tour not to incorporate performances as Hannah Montana, although [...] "Let's Get Crazy", an official Hannah-song, was performed. Alternative band Metro Station served as opening act for all tour venues. It was sponsored by Wal-Mart and promoted by AEG Live. All tickets from the Wonder World Tour were sold using <b>paperless</b> <b>ticketing,</b> {{in order to prevent}} ticket scalping similar to what had occurred during Cyrus' previous tour.
