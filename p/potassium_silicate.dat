40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} kaolin and calcite {{additives}} on the rye straw ash sintering behaviors were investigated. The rye straw ash {{has a high}} sintering tendency, with observation of severe fusion during combustion. The formation and melting of <b>potassium</b> <b>silicates</b> play key roles in sintering of the rye straw ash at elevated temperatures. Fusion characteristics temperatures of the rye straw ash were significantly increased upon kaolin and calcite addition. Kaolin addition led to formation of high temperature melting <b>potassium</b> aluminum <b>silicates,</b> which were revealed by XRD analyses. Due to formation of high temperature melting species due to kaolin addition, the severe sintering of the rye straw ash was significantly reduced. Addition of calcite provided CaO to react with silica in the rye straw ash, causing generation of high temperature melting calcium rich silicates. In addition, the dilution effect from calcite is a main reason for improved rye straw sintering behaviors...|$|R

However, the applications in which the work temperatures are relatively high remain as an obstacle to the use of more common polymeric adhesives.

This work deals with the adhesion of aluminium sandwich beams using geopolymeric adhesives.

40|$|Today, the {{naturally}} harvested wood {{material of}} the past, prized for durability, is increasing {{difficult to obtain}} in substantial quantities with no certainty of replenishing a diminishing resource. The building and heritage conservation industries {{are in need of}} an environmentally friendly wood-based product whose service life meets the expectations of its users. The wood preservative industry aims to mitigate this gap in the present-day wood industry by minimizing wood’s vulnerability to the consumptive natural environment. Generally, wood preservatives are chemicals that are toxic to common decay fungi and/or insects, or are chemicals that somehow modify or protect the wood against deterioration. The future of wooden heritage conservation is dependent upon ecologically sensitive preservative systems that incorporate sustainable forestry practice and species. This study seeks to begin this process by pairing the species radiata pine (Pinus radiata) with select low VOC formulas (borates, TWP, tung oil, permethrin and <b>potassium</b> <b>silicates)</b> to test for durability against eastern subterranean termite (Recticulitermes flavipes) damage...|$|R

40|$|The {{abrasion}} resistance of coated glass surfaces {{is an important}} parameter for judging lifetime performance, but practical testing procedures remain overly simplistic and do often not allow for direct conclusions on real-world degradation. Here, we combine quantitative two-dimensional image analysis and mechanical abrasion into a facile tool for probing the {{abrasion resistance}} of anti-reflective (AR) coatings. We determine variations in the average coated area, during and after controlled abrasion. Through comparison with other experimental techniques, we show that this method provides a practical, rapid and versatile tool {{for the evaluation of}} the abrasion resistance of sol-gel-derived thin films on glass. The method yields informative data, which correlates with measurements of diffuse reflectance and is further supported by qualitative investigations through scanning electron microscopy. In particular, the method directly addresses degradation of coating performance, i. e., the gradual areal loss of antireflective functionality. As an exemplary subject, we studied the abrasion resistance of state-of-the-art nanoporous SiO 2  thin films which were derived from 5 – 6 [*]wt% aqueous solutions of <b>potassium</b> <b>silicates,</b> or from colloidal suspensions of SiO 2  nanoparticles.
