25|$|The {{research}} Ricketts did on sardines was {{a seminal}} application of ecology to fisheries science, {{but it was}} not published as an academic paper. He is not widely recognized by fisheries scientists. The prominent fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly comments: “That’s probably {{due to the fact that}} his stuff isn’t widely available...

25|$|Midwater {{longliners}} – {{are usually}} medium-sized vessels which operate worldwide, purpose built to catch large <b>pelagics.</b> The line hauler is usually forward starboard, where {{the fish are}} hauled through a gate in the rail. The lines are set from the stern where a baiting table and chute are located. These boats need adequate speed to reach distant fishing grounds, enough endurance for continued fishing, adequate freezing storage, suitable mechanisms for shooting and hauling longlines quickly, and proper storage for fishing gears and accessories.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} into <b>pelagic</b> and demersal zones. <b>Pelagic</b> habitats are found near the surface or in the open water column, away {{from the bottom of the}} ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a <b>pelagic</b> habitat is said to be a <b>pelagic</b> organism, as in <b>pelagic</b> fish. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in demersal fish. <b>Pelagic</b> habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what ocean currents are doing.|$|R
40|$|Stomach {{contents}} and parasite faunas of 464 specimens of demersal fishes in 14 species were examined from the Carson Canyon {{region of the}} upper continental slope of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. Individual species tended to feed either primarily on benthic invertebrates or on <b>pelagic</b> food items. Most <b>pelagic</b> predators also fed on benthopelagic organisms. Prevalence of parasites was 46 percent, {{with an average of}} 5. 5 worms per fish. Prevalence of parasites was higher in benthic feeders (53. 1 %) than in <b>pelagic</b> fedders (28. 9 %). Relative abundance by group among benthic feeders was: Digenetic Trematoda 5. 8 %. Nematoda 53. 1 % and Acanthocephala 40. 9 %.

25|$|Many of the {{techniques}} used in kayak fishing {{are the same as}} those used on other fishing boats. The difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft. Contemporary kayaks can be equipped with fishing aids such as rod holders, electronic fish-finders and live-bait containers. Kayak anglers target highly prized bottom feeders like halibut and cod and also <b>pelagics</b> like amberjacks, tuna, sailfish, wahoo, and even marlin.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater {{fly fishing}} {{is most often}} done from a boat, either a shallow draft flat boat is used to pursue species such as bonefish, redfish, permit and tarpon in shallow waters, or from larger {{offshore}} boats for pursuing sailfish, tuna, dorado, marlin and other <b>pelagics</b> and may be done from shore, such as wading flats for bonefish or redfish or surf fishing for striped bass and other assorted fish. Typically, most trout fly fisherman need to practice new skills to catch saltwater fish on a fly rod. Ocean fish are usually harder to catch. They can be extremely spooky, and much larger. Trout fisherman need to practice with at least an 8 weight fly rod and accurately cast the line 30–90 feet {{if they are going}} to have success—particularly in the flat areas fishing for bonefish, redfish, permit, tarpon, jacks and more.|$|E
25|$|Yellowtail scad {{are a major}} species {{targeted}} by fisheries throughout the species range. Worldwide catch data are not available, although the FAO has catch data from Saudi Arabia showing 933 tonnes of the species was taken in 2001; an increase from 2000's catch of 875 tonnes. In Malaysia and presumably other South East Asian countries, the species makes up {{a high percentage of}} the pelagic catch. The fishery appears to be seasonal in some areas, with demersal species such as serranids and lutjanids making up the bulk of the catch most of the year while <b>pelagics</b> such as A. mate and scombrids make up the bulk of the catch between January and April. In other areas such as the Gulf of Thailand, it is taken year round. The species is taken by a variety of fishing methods including beach seines, gill netting, as well as hook and line methods involving jigging with lures. In parts of South East Asia, the yellowtail scad is a highly valued seafood prepared by boiling, steaming and frying. It may also by dried and salted to preserve the flesh.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pelagic</b> zone {{occupies}} 1,330 million km3 (320 million mi3) with a {{mean depth}} of 3.68 km and maximum depth of 11 km. Fish {{that live in the}} <b>pelagic</b> zone are called <b>pelagic</b> fish. <b>Pelagic</b> life decreases with increasing depth. It is affected by light intensity, pressure, temperature, salinity, the supply of dissolved oxygen and nutrients, and the submarine topography, which is called bathymetry. In deep water, the <b>pelagic</b> zone is sometimes called the open-ocean zone and can be contrasted with water that is near the coast or on the continental shelf. In other contexts, coastal water not near the bottom is still said to be in the <b>pelagic</b> zone.|$|R
25|$|Many large <b>pelagic</b> {{fish are}} oceanic nomadic species which {{undertake}} long offshore migrations. They feed on small <b>pelagic</b> forage fish, {{as well as}} medium-sized <b>pelagic</b> fish. At times, they follow their schooling prey, and many species form schools themselves.|$|R
50|$|This nudibranch is <b>pelagic</b> in {{a similar}} way to the nudibranch Glaucus atlanticus. Unlike some other <b>pelagic</b> animals, this species cannot swim or even float in water by itself, thus {{although}} it is <b>pelagic,</b> it is not considered to be planktonic.|$|R
25|$|The {{false scad}} is of major {{importance}} to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with fisheries off Morocco, Senegal {{and in the}} Mediterranean taking the highest numbers of fish. They are fished for primarily with trawls, purse seines and gill nets; although juveniles occasionally turn up inshore nets such as beach seines. The species {{is part of a}} number of fish that live a similar semi-pelagic lifestyle that make up what {{is often referred to as}} a 'small <b>pelagics</b> fishery'. Some of these are the similar Trachurus species, and due to these also being present in the catch, Caranx rhonchus is often not differentiated, leading to lower than accurate catch statistics. Furthermore, vendors are known to fraudulently market C. rhonchus as 'horse mackerel', which is strictly applied to members of Trachurus. To counter this, there has been research into determining fish species later in the marketing process by means of DNA analysis, a technique which has yielded strong results. FAO catch statistics indicate a current annual catch of between 1500 and 3700 tonnes per year from both Africa and Europe between 2002 and 2007. Older catch data indicates much more was taken between 1979 and 1992, with these years having catches between 4000 and 19000 tonnes. The species is sold fresh, frozen, smoked, salted, dried and is used for fish meal and oil.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The species {{compositions}} and {{densities of}} the littoral and <b>pelagic</b> zooplankton assemblages in Crater Lake were compared. The littoral and <b>pelagic</b> zooplankton assemblages of most lakes are typically different due to different habitat {{conditions in the}} two zones. The littoral zone of Crater Lake lacks many of the habitat characteristics, which distinguish a typical littoral zone from the <b>pelagic</b> zone. In fact, none of the water quality variables measured differed significantly between the littoral zone and epilimnion of the <b>pelagic</b> zone in Crater Lake. The littoral and <b>pelagic</b> zones of Crater Lake were sampled with twelve paired sites in August and again in September of 1995. For {{the purposes of this}} study, the littoral zone was defined as lakeward from the shoreline to the 10 m depth contour. At each paired site the <b>pelagic</b> assemblage was sampled to a depth of 120 m at the 200 m depth contour. Despite the almost identical water quality between the <b>pelagic</b> and littoral zones of Crater Lake, lack of vascular macrophytes in the littoral zone, and well-mixed epilimnion, the littoral zooplankton assemblage differed from the <b>pelagic</b> assemblage in both species composition and density. Several ubiquitous zooplankton taxa dominated both the littoral and <b>pelagic</b> zooplankton assemblages, although the density of these taxa as well as the relative abundance of these taxa differed between zones. These ubiquitous species reached their maximum densities in the metalimnion of the <b>pelagic</b> zone at a depth range of 10 to 60 meters below the lake surface and were considered primarily <b>pelagic.</b> A shift in wind direction between sampling periods influenced the distribution of <b>pelagic</b> zooplankton taxa in the littoral zone. Twenty-four taxa were recorded in the littoral zone, and aside from infrequent exceptions, none of these taxa were found in the <b>pelagic</b> zooplankton assemblage. Most of the littoral taxa were primarily adapted to the benthic zone...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 90 {{per cent}} of total catches in {{northern}} Sulawesi are <b>pelagic</b> fishes. About two-third {{of them are}} large <b>pelagic</b> fish, such as tunas (Katsuwonus, Thunnus, Euthynnus). However the National Assessment Stock Commission reported that availability of the large <b>pelagic</b> fishes in Sulawesi and Maluku Sea is just {{about one-third of the}} total <b>pelagic</b> fish resources. Even in the last report the large <b>pelagic</b> fishes in the region are indicating nearly overexploited. In contras, small <b>pelagic</b> fish such as mackerel scads, travellies, sardine, needlefish, Indian mackerel, and flyingfish is less than 40 per cent of the total allowable catch (TAC) exploited. Fishing activities on large <b>pelagic</b> fish by means of pole and line, longline etc. are mainly conducted by fishing industries based in the area of Bitung.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the trade-offs associated with vertical migration and swimming speed of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using an adaptive individual-based model. Simulations with varying distribution and occurrence of prey, {{with and without}} swimbladder constraints, and visual predation were performed. Most simulations resulted in cod migrations between the bottom and <b>pelagic</b> zones. In simulations with high probability of encountering <b>pelagic</b> prey, the cod spent the daytime in the <b>pelagic</b> zone, moving to the bottom to feed only when no <b>pelagic</b> prey were encountered. At night the cod stayed in the <b>pelagic</b> zone to attain neutral buoyancy. In simulations with low occurrence of <b>pelagic</b> prey or high visual predation pressure, the cod remained at the bottom feeding on the consistently present benthic prey. If the <b>pelagic</b> prey occurred far above the sea floor or there were no benthic prey, the cod abandoned all bottom contact. The study thus predicts that the probability of encountering energy-rich <b>pelagic</b> prey is the key factor in driving vertical migration in adult cod.

50|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} feeding ecology of the <b>pelagic</b> thresher. Its very slender tail and fine dentition suggest an exclusive diet of small, <b>pelagic</b> prey.

Therefore, little competition occurs between the <b>pelagic</b> thresher and other large oceanic piscivores such as billfishes, tunas, and dolphinfishes, which tend to feed near the surface. As in other threshers, <b>pelagic</b> threshers may swim in circles to drive schooling prey into a compact mass, before striking them sharply with the upper lobe of their tails to stun them. Because of this behavior, <b>pelagic</b> threshers are often hooked on longlines by their tails.|$|R
