In response to protests from seniors, he amended the plan in April 2009 to reduce both the income level at which seniors would have to start paying and the amount which those seniors would have to pay. Liepert said that the plan, $10 million {{more expensive than the}} one he had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay less than they did under the status quo. The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included chiropractic services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and sex change operations, at an annual savings of $700,000. While the Canada Health Act requires the federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all [...] "medically necessary" [...] procedures, Liepert maintained that the de-listed services were not [...] "medically necessary" [...] {{from the perspective of the}} Act, and said that he anticipated no trouble from the federal government.|$|E

2500|$|An {{investigation}} into the city's property taxes found that the homeowners of Bell were paying a rate {{higher than those of}} the affluent Beverly Hills.

Wendy Watanabe, Los Angeles County's auditor-controller, stated that residents of Bell <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 1.55% of their home's assessed value in taxes, 34% above the norm. State Controller John Chiang said the raised rate was illegal. Wantanabe said the average for the county is 1.16%.

Under California's state tax code, the nearly $3 million overpaid by Bell homeowners, should be redirected to local schools, however, on September 1, 2010, lawmakers approved AB 900 by Assemblyman Kevin De Leon (D- Los Angeles), which returns $2.9 million in property tax refunds directly to the overcharged city residents. On September 13, 2010 Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado, approved the bill. Because the Montebello Unified School District's boundaries include a small area of Bell, it was to receive a portion of the $2.9 million property tax refund slated to be returned to Bell under A.B. 900, which was signed into law by Lt.
