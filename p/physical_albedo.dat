40|$|Albedo {{characterizes the}} radiometric {{interface}} of land surfaces, especially vegetation, and the atmosphere. Albedo {{is a critical}} input to many models, such as crop growth models, hydrological models and climate models. For the extensive attention to crop monitoring, a <b>physical</b> <b>albedo</b> model for crops is developed based {{on the law of}} energy conservation and spectral invariants, which is derived from a prior forest albedo model. The model inputs have been efficiently and physically parameterized, including the dependency of albedo on the solar zenith/azimuth angle, the fraction of diffuse skylight in the incident radiance, the canopy structure, the leaf reflectance/transmittance and the soil reflectance characteristics. Both the anisotropy of soil reflectance and the clumping effect of crop leaves at the canopy scale are considered, which contribute to the improvement of the model accuracy. The comparison between the model results and Monte Carlo simulation results indicates that the canopy albedo has high accuracy with an RMSE < 0. 005. The validation using ground measurements has also demonstrated the reliability of the model and that it can reflect the interaction mechanism between radiation and the canopy-soil system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIsotopic and {{chemical}} compositions of meteorites, coupled with dynamical simulations, {{suggest that the}} main belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter contains objects formed in situ {{as well as a}} population of interlopers. These interlopers are predicted to include the building blocks of the terrestrial planets as well as objects that formed beyond Neptune (Bottke et al. 2006, Levison et al. 2009, Walsh et al. 2011). Here we report that the main belt asteroid (21) Lutetia - encountered by the Rosetta spacecraft in July 2010 has spectral (from 0. 3 to 25 mu m) and <b>physical</b> (<b>albedo,</b> density) properties quantitatively similar to the class of meteorites known as enstatite chondrites. The chemical and isotopic compositions of these chondrites indicate that they were {{an important component of the}} formation of Earth and other terrestrial planets. This meteoritic association implies that Lutetia is a member of a small population of planetesimals that formed in the terrestrial planet region and that has been scattered in the main belt by emerging protoplanets (Bottke et al. 2006) and/or by the migration of Jupiter (Walsh et al. 2011) early in its history. Lutetia, along with a few other main-belt asteroids, may contains part of the long-sought precursor material (or closely related materials) from which the terrestrial planets accreted.

Scattering functions for mixtures can be calculated, as well as corrections for comparisons of experimental transmission or reflection spectra with observational planetary spectra.

40|$|The authors {{developed}} a general numerical algorithm for obtaining simulated lightcurves of "spotted" asteroids and varied {{the most critical}} geometrical and <b>physical</b> parameters (<b>albedo</b> contrast, size, and position of the spots; polar coordinates, {{and shape of the}} asteroid). They then analyzed the case of 4 Vesta by assuming an axisymmetric ellipsoidal shape with a large brighter region on one hemisphere, in agreement with the results of photometric and polarimetric observations. Fitting the numerical simulations to the available data, the authors obtained the flattening of the ellipsoid (0. 79 ± 0. 03), the albedo contrast and geometry of the brighter region, and the orientation of the polar axis. If the derived flattening corresponds to the equilibrium shape of a nearly homogeneous body, a density of 2. 4 ± 0. 3 g cm- 3 can be inferred...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{population}} size and <b>physical</b> characteristics (<b>albedo,</b> size, and rotation rate) of near-Earth asteroids (NEA's) is biased by observational selection effects which are functions of {{the population}}'s intrinsic properties {{and the size of}} the telescope, detector sensitivity, and search strategy used. The NEA population is modeled in terms of orbital and physical elements: a, e, i, omega, Omega, M, albedo, and diameter, and an asteroid search program is simulated using actual telescope pointings of right ascension, declination, date, and time. The position of each object in the model population is calculated at the date and time of each telescope pointing. The program tests to see if that object is within the field of view (FOV = 8. 75 degrees) of the telescope and above the limiting magnitude (V = + 1. 65) of the film. The effect of the starting population on the outcome of the simulation's discoveries is compared to the actual discoveries in order to define a most probable starting population...|$|R

In this study {{a number of the}} criteria were calculated for a complex thermodynamic model and simple empirical models of freshwater lake ice, in conjunction with data from a year-long study on Crooked Lake, Antarctica. The simple models captured the system behaviour remarkably well, although the {{selection criteria}} suggested the physics-based approach was more generalizable.

The radar cross section (RCS) {{is the most common}} means of estimating the size of orbiting objects. However, the RCS is prone to error due to Mie scattering, compositional effects, geometrical effects, tumbling, and other dependencies. Optical measurement methods are theoretically much more accurate, but necessitate estimates of the object's albedo.

40|$|Detecting {{heat from}} minor planers {{in the outer}} solar system is challenging, yet it is the most {{efficient}} means for constraining the albedos and sizes of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and their progeny, the Centaur objects. These physical parameters are critical. e. g., for interpreting spectroscopic data, deriving densities from the masses of binary systems, and predicting occultation tracks. Here we summarize Spitzer Space Telescope observations of 47 KBOs and Centaurs at wavelengths near 24 and 70 µm. We interpret the measurements using a variation of the standard thermal model (STM) to derive the <b>physical</b> properties (<b>albedo</b> and diameter) of the targets. We also summarize the results of other efforts to measure the albedos and sizes of K. BOs and Centaurs. The three or four largest KBOs appear to constitute a distinct class in terms of their albedos. From our Spitzer results, we find that the geometric albedo of KBOs and Centaurs is correlated with perihelion distance (darker objects having smaller perihelia), and that the albedos of KBOs (bur not Centaurs) are correlated with size (larger KBOs having higher albedos). We also find hints that albedo may be correlated with visible color (for Centaurs). Interestingly, if the color correlation is real, redder Centaurs appear to have higher albedos. Finally, we briefly discuss the prospects for future thermal observations of these primitive outer solar system objects...|$|R
40|$|Projection-based {{appearances}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} computer graphics applications to impart different appearances onto physical surfaces using digitally controlled projector light. To achieve a compliant appearance, all points on the physical surface must be altered to the colours of the desired target appearance; otherwise, an incompliant appearance results in a misleading visualization. Previous systems typically assume to operate with compliant appearances or restrict themselves to the simpler case of white surfaces. To achieve compliancy, one may change the <b>physical</b> surface’s <b>albedo,</b> increase the amount of projector light radiance available or modify the target appearance’s colours. This paper presents an approach to modify a target appearance to achieve compliant appearance editing without altering the physical surface or the projector setup. Our system minimally alters the target appearance’s colours while maintaining cues important for perceptual similarity (e. g. colour constancy). First, we discuss how to measure colour compliancy. Next, we describe our approach to partition the physical surface into patches based on the surface’s colours and the target appearance’s colours. Finally, we describe our appearance optimization process, which computes a compliant appearance that is as perceptually similar as possible to the target appearance’s colours. We perform several real-world projection-based appearances and compare our results to naïve approaches, which either ignore compliancy or simply reduce the appearance’s overall brightness...|$|R

40|$|The post-Voyager {{knowledge}} of the photometric, colorimetric, spectral, and thermal properties of the Uranian satellites is reviewed, focusing on such fundamental <b>physical</b> properties as <b>albedo,</b> color, and surface texture. While albedo variations {{of at least a}} factor of 2 exist, color differences are almost absent (Miranda) or subdued (Oberon). In the case of Titania, the strong opposition effect reported by ground-based observers was confirmed by Voyager. Voyager did not observe the opposition parts of the phase curves of the other satellites. Voyager thermal observations of Ariel and Miranda suggest that both have highly porous regoliths, thermophysically similar to those of Jupiter's icy satellites. At the time of the flyby (south pole facing the sun), maximum surface temperatures reached or exceeded 85 K, but nighttime polar temperatures are predicted to drop to 20 to 30 K because each pole spends about 40 yr in darkness.

40|$|Modelling and {{understanding}} the surface energy balance is important for assessing the re-distribution of moisture and heat in soil and atmosphere. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) estimates turbulent heat fluxes using satellite earth observation data in the visible, near infrared, and thermal spectral domain. SEBS is capable of estimating atmospheric turbulent fluxes and surface evaporation from point to continental scale with reasonable accuracy. Validation of SEBS {{has been done on}} a limited set of case studies, which were either on field scale or regional scale. This study aims at validating the use of SEBS for a mesoscale catchment of 270 km 2, because this spatial scale is of great interest for many hydrological applications such as erosion modelling, groundwater modelling, crop growth modelling, etc. During a six-week field campaign in August and September 2003 all necessary input data for SEBS were acquired in the community of Sehoul in the province of Sala al Jadida about 20 km south-east of Rabat (Morocco). The fieldwork consisted of measuring meteorological parameters (pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, downward solar radiation) at a representative reference location and various soil moisture samples were collected and analysed. Radiance and reflectance data acquired by the Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 sensor were combined with the field measurements to derive land surface <b>physical</b> parameters (<b>albedo,</b> emissivity, temperature, vegetation coverage, etc.). In addition, a digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was used in the model. The SEBS algorithm was implemented in the GIS-based PCRaster Environmental Modelling Language. After processing all the inputs, the model results in evaporative fraction and evapotranspiration maps. SEBS was validated with a 1 D evapotranspiration model based on temporal soil moisture measurements that were taken with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) at three depths (5, 15 and 35 cm) and at ten locations representing common land use, soil and slope combinations of the study area. The suitability of SEBS for modelling evapotranspiration in mesoscale catchments will be discussed here. Furthermore, suggestions for improvement of the model will be give...|$|R
40|$|Infrared {{images and}} {{photometry}} were obtained {{to determine the}} spatial distribution and <b>physical</b> characteristics (temperature, <b>albedo,</b> size distribution, total mass, etc.) of the grains in the coma of Comet GZ. A 10. 8 m image of Comet GZ obtained on August 4 represents the first groundbased thermal-infrared image of a Comet. Among the most significant results are: (1) An estimate {{of the number of}} grains that the ICE spacecraft must have encountered, which led the plasma wave team to conclude that they could only detect impacts on the antennae and not on the whole body of the ICE spacecraft; (2) The discovery of a population of large grains (radius > 100 micrometer), not observed in most other comets, which formed a curved tail near the nucleus (within 80 arcsec or 34, 000 km); and (3) the detection of structure in the spatial distribution in the coma of the particle albedo, which was tentatively attributed to the presence of very fluffy grains which are likely to have multiple internal scattering of incident sunlight. The albedo map of Comet GZ was obtained by combining the 10. 8 micrometer image shown with a simultaneous image taken at 0. 68 micrometer, a bandpass which isolates the scattered continuum...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeasonal {{snow cover}} in the Northern Hemisphere is the largest {{component}} of the terrestrial cryosphere and {{plays a major role}} in the climate system through strong positive feedbacks related to albedo. The snow-albedo feedback is invoked as an important cause for the polar amplification of ongoing and projected climate change, and its parameterization across models is an important source of uncertainty in climate simulations. Here, instead of developing a <b>physical</b> snow <b>albedo</b> scheme, we use a direct insertion approach to assimilate satellite based surface albedo during the snow season (hereafter as snow albedo assimilation) into the land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms) and assess the influences of such assimilation on offline and coupled simulations. Our results have shown that snow albedo assimilation in both ORCHIDEE and ORCHIDEE-LMDZ (a general circulation model of Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique) improve the simulation accuracy of mean seasonal (October throughout May) snow water equivalent over the region north of 40 degrees. The sensitivity of snow water equivalent to snow albedo assimilation is more pronounced in the coupled simulation than the offline simulation since the feedback of albedo on air temperature is allowed in ORCHIDEE-LMDZ. We have also shown that simulations of air temperature at 2 meters in ORCHIDEE-LMDZ due to snow albedo assimilation are significantly improved during the spring in particular over the eastern Siberia region. This is a result of the fact that high amounts of shortwave radiation during the spring can maximize its snow albedo feedback, which is also supported by the finding that the spatial sensitivity of temperature change to albedo change is much larger during the spring than during the autumn and winter. In addition, the radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere induced by snow albedo assimilation during the spring is estimated to be- 2. 50 W m- 2, the magnitude of which is almost comparable to that due to CO 2 (2. 83 Wm- 2) increases since 1750. Our results thus highlight the necessity of realistic representation of snow albedo in the model and demonstrate the use of satellite-based snow albedo to improve model behaviors, which opens new avenues for constraining snow albedo feedback in earth system models...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, unstructured-mesh {{models have}} gained {{attention}} {{due to their}} flexibility in representing complex topography and variable spatial resolution. The Second generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model (SLIM, www. climate. be/slim) is an unstructured-mesh finite element model that is being developed at the Université catholique de Louvain (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium). The ocean model solves the shallow water equations {{by means of the}} discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. It features a 1 D river model, 2 D depth averaged model and a full 3 D model. After a general presentation of SLIM and its main applications, we will further focus on sea-ice modeling. The sea-ice component of SLIM has representations of both dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice processes and includes viscous-plastic rheology along with a complete parametrization of the atmospheric fluxes. Unstructured meshes, with their natural ability to fit boundaries and increase locally the mesh resolution, propose an alternative framework to capture the complex oceanic areas formed by coasts and islands. Such an example is illustrated by the numerous narrow straits constituting the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. A key point of unstructured meshes is that they allow the use of mesh adaptivity. A Lagrangian, adaptive sea ice model allowing the computational grid to move with the ice drift is currently being developed. In order to maintain a good quality of the mesh, the mesh has to be adapted during the simulation, involving particular mesh adaptation techniques. This Lagrangian version of the model has several interesting applications, such as the dynamical mesh refinement along any region of interest (e. g., the ice edge), buoys tracking, or the inclusion of material properties in the rheology. Among these applications, the ice age constitutes both an interesting diagnostic tool and parameter for determining the ice <b>physical</b> properties (<b>albedo,</b> strength, salinity, [...] .). There are basically two ways of modeling the ice age: as a bidimensional tracer or as a vertical tracer, but different definitions exist and lead to different interpretations. In this work, we first present the equation of evolution of the age in an onedimensional ice layer. This equation is applied to a stand-alone thermodynamic sea ice model and its numerical resolution is compared to the integration of the ice age thanks to Lagrangian particles in the vertical direction. Preliminary results of a simulation of the Arctic Basin are finally shown where the Lagrangian model is used to transport the vertical structure of ice ag...|$|R
40|$|Three {{weeks prior}} to the {{commencement}} of Cassini's 4 year tour of the saturnian system, the spacecraft executed a close flyby of the outer satellite Phoebe. The infrared channel of the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) obtained images of reflected light over the 0. 83 – 5. 1 μm spectral range with an average spectral resolution of 16. 5 nm, spatial resolution up to 2 km, and over a range of solar phase angles not observed before. These images have been analyzed to derive fundamental photometric parameters including the phase curve and phase integral, spectral geometric albedo, bolometric Bond albedo, and the single scattering <b>albedo.</b> <b>Physical</b> properties of the surface, including macroscopic roughness and the single particle phase function, have also been characterized. Maps of normal reflectance show the existence of two major albedo regimes in the infrared, with gradations between the two regimes and much terrain with substantially higher albedos. The phase integral of Phoebe is 0. 29 ± 0. 03, with no significant wavelength dependence. The bolometric Bond albedo is 0. 023 ± 007. We find that the surface of Phoebe is rough, with a mean slope angle of 33 °. The satellite's surface has a substantial forward scattering component, suggesting that its surface is dusty, perhaps from a history of outgassing. The spectrum of Phoebe is best matched by a composition including water ice, amorphous carbon, iron-bearing minerals, carbon dioxide, and Triton tholin. The characteristics of Phoebe suggest that it originated outside the saturnian system, perhaps in the Kuiper Belt, and was captured on its journey inward, as suggested by Johnson and Lunine (2005) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{road surface}} energy balance {{model has been}} {{modified}} to account for geographical variables of latitude, optical depth, sky view factor, slope and slope orientation for the West Midlands (UK). The <b>physical</b> variables of <b>albedo,</b> emissivity and surface roughness are also included. Using a satellite landcover classification, aided by a field analysis of urban canyon characteristics, {{it is possible to}} estimate the spatial variety of surface variables across the West Midlands. Spatial analysis of topography using a Geographical Information System (GIS) database calculated values at 1 km 2 resolution for the geographic variables. This enabled a spatial and temporal analysis of road surface temperatures across the West Midlands. Sensitivity analysis shows that the geographical variables which have the most significant influence on the model are slope angle and sky view factor, however all the physical variables could have a significant influence. Validation of the model against actual road surface temperature for 15 road weather sensors, for February 2000, gave r 2 values as high as 0. 84, however regression indicated that the model overestimated the minimum road surface temperature by 1. 16 °C, as opposed to the Meteorological Office model which underestimated by 1. 49 °C for the same period. Time slices of the model output, covering an area of 2400 km 2, show the development of a surface urban heat island in the West Midlands (UK). The intensity of the modelled heat island can be modified according to the values used for sky view factor in the rural areas surrounding the urban conurbation. Winter Solstice heat island intensity for calm clear nights in the West Midlands is calculated to be 4. 7 °C. The structure of the heat island suggests that current Open Road weather forecast zones are not applicable in simulated clear calm conditions because of the wide temperature variations caused by the degree of urbanisation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Sea ice {{thickness}} is {{an essential}} parameter for the estimation of energy, mass and momentum exchange and sea ice mass balance in the Southern Hemisphere. In situ methods of estimating the ice thickness distribution cannot provide the necessary areal coverage, while the coarse resolution of numerical models is unsuitable for parameterising small-scale processes. Remote sensing technology {{has the potential to}} address these issues of areal coverage and spatial resolution. A procedure for estimating the distribution of sea ice thickness using remote sensing data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor is presented. This procedure is based on the method described by Yu and Rothrock [1996] for Arctic sea ice and relies upon the assumptions a) that the surface temperature of thin sea ice is closely related to its thickness and b) that there is a linear vertical temperature gradient across the recently-formed sea ice. Considerable modifications have been made to the Yu and Rothrock method in order to apply it to Antarctic conditions. Broadband albedo, ice/snow surface temperature and near-surface air temperature were estimated for cloud-free AVHRR pixels identified by an "expert system" algorithm. These variables were used as inputs to a thermodynamic model to estimate ice thickness for two areas of the East Antarctic sector during the austral winter of 1995 and spring of 1996. The sensitivity of the model was examined with reference to the estimation of near-surface air temperature, effective thermal conductivity of snow, bulk transfer coefficients for heat and evaporation and the calibration of the satellite sensor's gain. Resultant ice thickness maps and frequency distribution histograms were compared with concurrent ship-based sea ice observations and digital aerial photography. Comparisons were also made with historical ("climatological") data including drill hole measurements, ship-based observations and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager-derived sea ice extent data. In spite of the relative lack of concurrent data to validate the results, the analysis of the 1996 data showed good agreement with ship-based observations from previous years and with estimates of areal coverage obtained from passive microwave data. The ice thickness distribution in the Prydz Bay area for the months of October and November is also consistent with ice drift patterns, regional iceberg distribution and ocean circulation described in the literature for that area. Important by-products of the method proposed are maps of ice/snow surface <b>physical</b> temperature and <b>albedo.</b> Comparisons with near-contemporary digital aerial photography demonstrated the procedure's ability to resolve features such as icebergs and large floes and the transition between areas of open water and/or thin ice and areas of thick, snow covered ice. The model's response to the presence of more than one surface type within a single pixel depends on their radiometric characteristics and relative concentration. The small number of images from August 1995 precluded a more detailed analysis, but {{it was clear that the}} larger solar zenith angles that occur in winter significantly affected the result. In spite of these problems, it was possible to interpret the thickness distribution in terms of the meteorological and geophysical condition...|$|R
