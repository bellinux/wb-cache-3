5|$|The case {{originally}} housed {{an instrument}} built in 1864 by the Manchester organ builders Kirtland & Jardine. The recently completed instrument was favourably reviewed in the London publication The Musical World. In the 1950s it was enlarged, rearranged, and converted to <b>pneumatic</b> action.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of <b>pneumatic</b> and electro-pneumatic key {{actions in the}} late 19th century {{made it possible to}} locate the console independently of the pipes, greatly expanding the possibilities in organ design. Electric stop actions were also developed, which allowed sophisticated combination actions to be created.|$|E
5|$|A later {{development}} was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead tubing to operate <b>pneumatic</b> valves throughout the instrument. This allowed a lighter touch, and {{more flexibility in}} {{the location of the}} console, within a 50-foot (15-m) limit. This type of construction was used in the late 19th century to early 20th century, and has had only rare application since the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The LEGO <b>pneumatics</b> {{components}} were first introduced {{as part of}} the LEGO Technic range in 1984. Since their introduction, LEGO <b>pneumatics</b> have featured in a variety of LEGO Technic and LEGO Educational (DACTA) products.|$|R
50|$|Precise {{control of}} {{velocity}} is achievable in hydraulics while due to compressible nature of gas, <b>Pneumatics</b> cannot have precise control over velocity.In Hydraulics, self-regulation action of oil {{can be used}} while in <b>pneumatics</b> oil mist has {{to be used for}} lubrication.The pressure range for hydraulics is 500-5000 psi while the pressure range for <b>pneumatics</b> is below 100 psiThe air after performing work can be sent into atmosphere, whereas oil has to be discharged into a tank.|$|R
50|$|Cost: <b>Pneumatics</b> are {{considerably}} {{less expensive to}} build and operate. For one, air is used as the compressed medium, {{so there is no}} need to provide means to drain or recover fluid. With increased working pressures, hydraulics require larger parts than <b>pneumatics.</b>|$|R
5|$|Prevention {{options for}} at-risk {{individuals}} include early and frequent walking, calf exercises, anticoagulants, aspirin, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent <b>pneumatic</b> compression. Anticoagulation {{is the standard}} treatment; typical medications include low-molecular-weight heparin or a vitamin K antagonist. Wearing graduated compression stockings appears {{to reduce the risk}} of post-thrombotic syndrome. The rate of DVTs increases from childhood to old age; in adulthood, about one in 1000 adults is affected per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspection}} robot of the European project Robair, funded from 2001 to 2003, {{is designed}} to mount on the wings and fuselage of an aircraft to inspect rows of rivets. To move, the robot uses a flexible network of <b>pneumatic</b> suction cups that are adjustable to the surface. It can inspect the lines of rivets with ultrasonic waves, eddy current and thermographic techniques. It detects loose rivets and cracks.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates <b>pneumatic</b> power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental <b>pneumatic</b> propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|Lucas, who had {{previously}} confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department {{to create their own}} versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving , enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a <b>pneumatic</b> R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.|$|E

Therein, it defeated BigNipper, Widow's Revengea machine reportedly constructed by the Razer team's wivesand Rick to reach its first series semi-final. Their next opponent was Spawn Again, which was armed with a <b>pneumatic</b> flipper. Equipped with a new lower front wedge, Razer {{was able to get}} underneath Spawn Again and crush it until it broke down. In the quarter finals, Razer faced S3, a cylindrical robot with a vertical spinning blade. Razer's arm sliced into S3's weapon controls, stopping the disc, which allowed Razer to dominate the fight and win on a judges' decision.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the <b>pneumatic</b> trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
5|$|Properly {{equipped}} {{aircraft are}} able to fly through snowstorms under Instrument Flight Rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise {{the safety of the}} aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing <b>pneumatic</b> boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in <b>pneumatic</b> planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of <b>pneumatic</b> seeding equipment.|$|E
5|$|The 509th Composite Group had an {{authorized}} strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, {{almost all of}} whom eventually deployed to Tinian. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta, known as the 1st Technical Detachment. The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s. These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, <b>pneumatic</b> actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt <b>pneumatic</b> jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
