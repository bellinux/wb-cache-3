40|$|In {{this work}} the author try to report {{some of the}} major changes that {{happened}} in the consumer behavior in the last decades and the impact of the <b>prices</b> <b>evolution</b> on consume. There are some concepts that are introduced in this report such as consume, consumer behavior, consumer <b>price</b> indices, market <b>evolution</b> and others. Although we are a step back, comparing to Europe the last developments are considerable and there are great expectations for the future. The author did not want to exhaust this vast subject but tried to show the importance of these changes in consume and economy itself...|$|R

The purpose of this figure, therefore, is to inform about the economic context in which the impact of the shock will be studied regarding its price effects. We start in 2000 since the total labour cost series is only available 2000 onwards, and we need full comparability across series.|$|R

We found that some domestic macroeconomic announcement linked by the monetary policy had a consistent influence on the stock <b>prices</b> <b>evolution.</b> We also identify that some US macroeconomic news {{have a significant impact}} on the Romanian stock exchange, a fact explained by the linkages between the Romanian stock market and the international financial markets. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{mathematical}} finance, the Black-Scholes {{equation is}} a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> of a European call or European put under the Black-Scholes model. Broadly speaking, the term may {{refer to a}} similar PDE that can be derived {{for a variety of}} options, or more generally, derivatives.|$|E
50|$|Since this {{stochastic}} {{differential equation}} (SDE) shows the stock <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> is Markovian, any derivative on this underlying {{is a function}} of time t and the stock price at the current time, S(t). Then an application of Ito's lemma gives an SDE for the discounted derivative process , which should be a martingale. In order for that to hold, the drift term must be zero, which implies the Black—Scholes PDE.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relevance}} {{and nature of}} shifts in relative prices at the regional level in Spain. Deviations in relative prices tend to be small (at most half a point of inflation annually) but persistent. They are determined by features intrinsic to deep economic integration, in particular, wage mechanisms operating at the national level. This is {{in stark contrast to}} evidence at the international level. Therefore, while acknowledging that divergent <b>price</b> <b>evolutions</b> are possible in the European Monetary Union, their nature will be different from those observed among Spanish regions.

40|$|An {{optimal control}} {{strategy}} devoted {{to manage the}} daily charging/discharging profiles of energy storage systems (ESSs) is {{described in the present}} paper. The proposed approach aims at minimizing microgrids (MGs) daily electricity costs considering both the real-time <b>prices</b> <b>evolution</b> and the effects of a significant presence of intermittent RES generation. Referring to MGs and electricity market modeling, which takes into account their main physical and economic constraints, an ESS charging/discharging strategy has been developed. The effectiveness of the proposed ESS management is verified on a MG case study. The measurements of the MG demand and RES production are used to simulate and compare the daily MG electricity costs and energy balances with and without the proposed ESS optimal control...|$|R
40|$|Using NAFTA’s {{effect on}} Mexico’s exports {{as a natural}} experiment, this paper conducts an {{empirical}} analysis on the explanatory power of the two strands of heterogeneous firms trade models: the heterogeneous firms trade (HFT) model and the quality heterogeneous firms trade (QHFT) model. The paper first discusses the common prediction of the two models on ‘new’ goods’ exports and on the contrasting prediction on unit <b>price</b> <b>evolution.</b> An empirical analysis shows a strong supportive evidence on the common prediction, i. e., NAFTA’s positive impact on ‘new’ goods exports from Mexico to the US. The paper then proposes {{a simple way to}} check the explanatory power of the models on unit <b>price</b> <b>evolution,</b> and finds no evidence in favour of either model.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a modern {{statistical}} {{approach to the}} analysis and modeling of dynamics in online auctions. Online auction data usually arrive {{in the form of}} a set of bids recorded over the duration of an auction. We propose the use of a modern statistical approach called functional data analysis that preserves the entire temporal dimension in place of currently used methods that aggregate over time thereby losing important information. This enables us to investigate not only the <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> that takes place during an auction, but also the dynamics of the <b>price</b> <b>evolution.</b> We show how functional data analysis can be combined with cluster analysis and regression-type models for data exploration and summarization, and for testing hypotheses about relationships between price formation and other relevant factors...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an evolutionary economic {{model for the}} <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> of stocks. Treating a stock market as a self-organized system governed by a fast purchase process and slow variations of demand and supply the model suggests that the short term price distribution has the form a logistic (Laplace) distribution. The long term return can be described by Laplace-Gaussian mixture distributions. The long term mean <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> is governed by a Walrus equation, which can {{be transformed into a}} replicator equation. This allows quantifying the evolutionary price competition between stocks. The theory suggests that stock prices scaled by the price over all stocks can be used to investigate long-term trends in a Fisher-Pry plot. The price competition that follows from the model is illustrated by examining the empirical long-term price trends of two stocks...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we address}} an {{investment}} problem where the investment {{can either be}} made immediately or postponed to a later time, {{in the hope that}} market conditions become more favourable. In our case, uncertainty is introduced through market price. When the investment is undertaken, a fixed sunk cost must be paid and a series of cash flows are to be received. Therefore, we are faced with an irreversible investment. Real options analysis provides an adequate framework for this type of problems by recognizing these two characteristics, uncertainty and irreversibility, explicitly. We describe algorithmic solutions for this type of problems by modelling market <b>prices</b> <b>evolution</b> by Markov jump processes. Irreversible investment, optimal stopping, dynamic programming, Markov jump processes...|$|R
40|$|A global {{methodology}} {{is developed}} to optimize concepts for extremely low energy dwellings, {{taking into account}} energy savings, environmental impact and financial costs over {{the life cycle of}} the buildings. Energy simulations are executed with TRNSYS. The ecological impact is evaluated through a life cycle inventory of the whole building, whereas costs are evaluated through a cost-benefit analysis. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved with a combination of genetic algorithms and the Pareto-concept. Firstly the optimization methodology is presented. Subsequently the main results are presented and a hierarchy of cost-effective energy saving measures is derived. Finally the impact of economic parameters, such as <b>price</b> <b>evolutions</b> and discount rate is discussed together with {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} extremely low energy buildings from an economic point of view...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{two-dimensional}} Kalman filter approach that, additional {{to the information}} contained in futures <b>prices</b> <b>evolution</b> over time, makes use of information contained in the term structure of commodity futures along a second dimension of maturities. This time-maturity surface reflects a complete realization of the stochastic process as an alternative to standard Kalman filtering of a limited vector of futures prices along the one-dimensional time line. Thus, the proposed methodology may use the full information from the entire surface dynamics, including links from all available maturities per period, which eventually should lead to more accurate model parameter estimates. The technique is illustrated using coal futures prices. commodity prices, spatial analysis, two-dimensional Kalman filter, energy markets, futures markets, stochastic dynamic model...|$|R

40|$|European {{countries}} have applied {{or are in}} the stage of applying various measures to support the introduction of biofuels in the transport sector. Some countries like Germany, France or Sweden have played a pioneer role and established a significant and stabile market for biofuels in their transport fuels. In {{the context of the}} revision of the European Biofuels Directive, the PREMIA project has made an impact assessment of measures and market conditions related to biofuels introduction in various European member states as experiences gained are very valuable for the future deployment of biofuels all over Europe. The assessment analysed production and consumption of biofuels, <b>price</b> <b>evolutions</b> (both for fossil and biofuels), feedstock production, the active policy measures and market conditions (e. g. position of car manufacturers, number of dedicated biofuel fuel stations).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compute the user cost of housing capital {{investment}} in four EU countries (France, Italy, Spain and the UK) following Poterba (1984, 1992) and Poterba and Sinai (2008) {{to investigate the}} role played by tax policy during the recent period. Our results suggest that current tax provisions – including both recurrent property taxes and mortgage interest tax deductions – bring about significant differences in the user cost of capital across income deciles. Taking a normative perspective, we also simulate the effects of taxing imputed rental income. In a sensitivity analysis, we show that house <b>price</b> <b>evolutions</b> have dominated other considerations about the user cost over the recent period, leading to large variations in the cost of housing investment. This even occurs when prospective homeowners incorporate a long-term view of the housing market. JRC. J. 2 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our work}} has been to study the behaviour of the European Central Bank towards the asset <b>prices</b> <b>evolution.</b> To do this, we have first examine the different arguments that are in favour or that fight the asset prices integration to the European Central Bank monetary policy objective. We have then estimated, with the general moment method, a European Central Bank reaction function for the 1999 : 1 - 2002 : 12 period. It seems, then, that the European Central Bank doesn’t react to asset prices level but to their volatility measured by their standart error. These results reveal, considering the period used here, the lender in last resort role that the European Central Bank has to play {{and that it has}} played just after the 2001 september events. 1 Ce document a été fabriqué par PDFmail (Copyright RTE Software...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The housing {{literature}} largely {{overlooks the}} <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> of similar assets sold sequentially, {{even though such}} sales often occur with new residential developments. The law of one price implies no persistent price pattern for identical assets sold sequentially. Nonetheless, the auction literature argues that changes in relative demand over the sales sequence and the reduction in valuation risk as later buyers use previous sales to validate asset values can lead to sales sequence effects on prices. The non-auction literature emphasizes rising prices from declining consumption risk as new housing subdivisions are built out. This paper examines the <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> in the condominium market where similar units are sold sequentially in a setting with minimal consumption risk. While we find statistically significant sequence-price effects that vary across sales phases and how quickly the development sells out, none are economically significant. We conclude that {{there appears to be}} no pervasive sequence-price relationship for sequential sales of similar property units...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of stylized facts {{suggests that there}} might be `universal' mechanism which drives <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> on financial markets in general. Based on empirical estimates of 10 major indices, we propose a stylized model of endogenous price formation on an aggregate level whose key issue is that <b>price</b> <b>evolution</b> is driven by the `market's' expectations about future growth rates of investment. The model is a multiplicative random process with a stochastic, state-dependent growth rate which establishes a negative feedback component in the price dynamics which admits some far reaching formal analysis. Generated return trails exhibit statistical properties such as 'volatility clustering', multi scaling, and a non-Gaussian distribution which is in quantitative in agreement with stylized facts from empirical asset returns. Additionally non-equilibrium entropies are also considered. These results suggests that the structure of the model mimicks a mechanism which is essential in driving price dynamics of financial markets in general.

40|$|We {{implement}} a master-slave parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) with a bespoke log-likelihood fitness function to identify emergent clusters within <b>price</b> <b>evolutions.</b> We use graphics processing units (GPUs) to {{implement a}} PGA and visualise the results using disjoint minimal spanning trees (MSTs). We demonstrate that our GPU PGA, implemented on a commercially available general purpose GPU, is able to recover stock clusters in sub-second speed, based on a subset of stocks in the South African market. This represents a pragmatic choice for low-cost, scalable parallel computing and is significantly faster than a prototype serial implementation in an optimised C-based fourth-generation programming language, although the results are not directly comparable due to compiler differences. Combined with fast online intraday correlation matrix estimation from high frequency data for cluster identification, the proposed implementation offers cost-effective, near-real-time risk assessment for financial practitioners.

40|$|We provide {{analytic}} pricing formulas for Fixed and Floating Range Accrual Notes {{within the}} multifactor Wishart affine framework which extends significantly the standard affine model. Using estimates for three short rate models, {{two of which}} are based on the Wishart process whilst the third one belongs to the standard affine framework, we price these structured products using the FFT methodology. Thanks to the Wishart tractability the hedge ratios are also easily computed. As the models are estimated on the same dataset, our results illustrate how the fit discrepancies (meaning differences in the likelihood functions) between models translate in terms of derivatives pricing errors, and we show that the models can produce different <b>price</b> <b>evolutions</b> for the Range Accrual Notes. The differences can be substantial and underline the importance of model risk both from a static and a dynamic perspective. These results are confirmed by an analysis performed at the hedge ratios level...|$|R
