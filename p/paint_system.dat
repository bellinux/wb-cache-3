The generalization of 2 D pixel-based paint models to point samples allows us to elegantly simulate paint transfer for 3 D objects. In contrast to mesh-based <b>painting</b> <b>systems,</b> an efficient dynamic resampling scheme permits arbitrary levels of <b>painted</b> detail.

40|$|Water-borne {{anticorrosive}} paints are acquiring increasing {{relevance for}} the anticorrosive protection of steel surfaces {{exposed to the}} atmosphere, mostly due to the restrictions imposed by environmental and health protection agencies, However, some companies continue to be reluctant to use paints of this type to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion. Part of this reluctance {{may be attributed to}} low confidence, mainly {{due to a lack of}} knowledge of the performance of water-borne <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> compared with traditional organic solvent-based <b>paint</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper presents results of experimental studies and includes technical considerations on the anticorrosive performance of <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> using water-borne or solvent-borne paints when exposed to atmospheres with different degrees of corrsivity. On the basis of the practical results and the considerations presented in this paper, it may be stated that water-borne <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> are currently available which present excellent anticorrosive behaviour, even in highly corrosive atmospheres.

40|$|Steel {{machine parts}} {{are exposed to}} {{electrochemical}} corrosion. This applies to many environments including atmosphere, soil, water, and even various fertilizers. High-carbon steel and low-alloyed steel are not stable (in terms of thermo-dynamics), do not feature effective passivation, and even the corrosion products do not form a stable protection layer. As a result, special anti-corrosion protection is critical. In heavy-corrosion environment, <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> containing Zn {{have proven to be}} very effective. Presented text describes verification of <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> with high Zn content and compares them to galvanic Zn coatings. Steel samples with protective coatings have been tested in condensation chamber with neutral salt-spray. This way, corrosion resistance of Zn-rich <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> and galvanic Zn coatings has been evaluated and compared. Galvanic Zn-coatings have shown complete decomposition during the chamber exposition. Thus, further testing was adopted for <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> only with a special attention being paid to gradual degradation of anti-corrosion layer.

40|$|The {{study of}} new <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> {{that are less}} harmful to the {{environment}} and to man than traditional solvent-borne systems, but have identical anti-corrosive characteristics, is an issue of great interest at the present time. The authors of this work have taken advantage of the opportunity to use different natural atmospheres in the Ibero-American region to study the behaviour of new water-borne, high-solids and powder <b>paint</b> <b>systems,</b> with and without pre-treatment. The study has involved coatings exposure in 7 natural atmospheres and different laboratory accelerated tests. It was completed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis, and adhesion, water up-take and electrochemical measurements. It has been concluded that water-borne acrylic <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> incorporating primers pigmented with zinc phosphate and others show deficient behaviour in marine atmospheres, but better behaviour in industrial atmospheres. In marine atmospheres, water-borne epoxy <b>paint</b> <b>systems,</b> including zinc-rich primers, together with epoxy and epoxy-polyurethane high-solids <b>paint</b> <b>systems,</b> present the most efficient anti-corrosive behaviour. The coatings obtained with epoxy and epoxy-polyester powder paints only show good behaviour, when applied on an adequate pre-treatment, in atmospheres of low to medium corrosivity category (C 2 -C 3). Finally, the best correlation was observed between the results of natural exposure in marine atmospheres, salt spray and water up-take measurements. It was not possible to verify good correlation between natural exposure and prohesion, adhesion and electrochemical tests. The latter are highly sensitive to the chemical nature of coatings, and seem to be significantly more useful when comparing coatings with more identical nature. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.

5000|$|The sparkle {{effect of}} the {{pigments}} in coating applications {{is controlled by the}} quantity of the added pigment.

The single light spots arising from the pigment structure and orientation in the <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> seem to spring back and forth when a painted metal plate is tilted. Also, the color of the other components of the paint has an influence in addition to the concentration of the pigment.
