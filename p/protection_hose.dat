The <b>Protection</b> <b>Hose</b> Company No. 1 Precision Drill Team was established in 1903, and is the oldest active fire department precision drill team in North America.Throughout its history, this team of volunteers has been the honour guard for the Governor-General, the Duke of Connaught and Princess Patricia in 1914, their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Niagara Falls in 1951, and several others. Their shiny chrome helmets were purchased in 1929 to replace the original white leather helmets and the fancy dress uniforms were purchased in 1976. The type of marching that is done is called close-order drill, where they use only half and quarter steps while touching shoulders much like the early British military used in warfare.|$|E

In the Hose Model [1], the customer specifies only the maximum traffic rate that can originate/terminate at each VPN site {{instead of the}} complete traffic matrix. <b>Protection</b> of <b>hose</b> VPNs from single link failures is considered. Simulation results are presented that compare the bandwidth of line and path protection. I...|$|R
