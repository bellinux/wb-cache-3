40|$|International audienceWith the {{financial}} crisis attacking every industry and the new sustainability requirements such as the extension of a system operation time <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> life (i. e. nuclear power plant), the importance of maintenance being effective and efficient {{is one of the}} top priorities for any industrial company. This challenge cannot be achieved only through conventional maintenance optimization models focusing mainly on few components but through maintenance programs based on "system thinking" considerations. In that way, managers need to have at their disposal new decision-making tools well adapted to support these considerations and allowing comparing off-line the impact of maintenance programs on complex system performances like costs and availability (Complex Maintenance Program Quantification - CMPQ). Thus, this paper proposes a model driven framework based both on the use of SysML to model a system-of-interest <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and maintenance and on the use of formal language AltaRica Data Flow to support model simulation...|$|R

The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanical performance of maritime pine wood degraded by fungi after being treated with a biocide followed by impregnation with a polymer product. Three commercially available products were used: a boron water-based biocide, an acrylic consolidant and an epoxy-based consolidant.
