Professional consciousness of the doctor is based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient's consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).|$|E
5|$|Published {{partially}} {{in response}} to Dissenting clergyman Richard Price's sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, <b>paternalism,</b> loyalty, chivalry, and primogeniture. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections, he argues that citizens {{do not have the}} right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid <b>paternalism</b> and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} <b>paternalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arkwright's {{innovations}} {{were not}} confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain. New Lanark in Scotland– also a World Heritage Site– was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark {{was identified as a}} potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's Masson Mill and {{at least two of the}} mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed <b>paternalism</b> further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and social control. Saltaire– another World Heritage Site– was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.|$|E
5|$|Hutton scored 2,049 runs at {{an average}} of 56.91 in the 1950 season. Batting {{effectively}} on a succession of early season rain-affected wickets, Hutton frequently top-scored for Yorkshire. Hutton's benefit match against Middlesex was affected by rain, but other events, collections and insurance for loss of play gave Hutton £9,713, a record at that point for a Yorkshire cricketer. Two-thirds of the amount was invested on Hutton's behalf by the Yorkshire committee, following their usual practice; Hutton resented this <b>paternalism</b> from the committee, particularly as he did not receive the full amount until 1972. Hutton played in three of the four Tests against West Indies. In the first Test, hampered by a finger injury, he scored 39 and 45 as England recorded their only victory of the series. The West Indies won the second Test, their first Test victory in England, and won the final two Tests to take the series 3–1; Hutton missed the third Test with lumbago but in the fourth Test scored 202 not out, carrying his bat through England's first innings. The West Indian spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine caused difficulties for all the batsmen except Hutton, who always appeared comfortable. Wisden praised his effort as unforgettable.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideology}} featured heavily during Disraeli's {{terms in}} government, during which considerable social reforms were passed. Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the party moved away from <b>paternalism</b> in favour of free market capitalism, but fears of extremism during the interwar period caused the revival of one-nation conservatism. The philosophy continued to be held by the Conservative party throughout the post-war consensus, influencing the decision to maintain Labour government Keynesian intervention in the economy, forming a welfare state and National Health Service. Later years saw the rise of the New Right, which attributed the country's social and economic troubles to one-nation conservatism. David Cameron, former leader of the Conservative Party, named Disraeli as his favourite Conservative and some commentators and MPs have suggested that Cameron's ideology contains an element of one-nationism. Other commentators have questioned the degree to which Cameron and his coalition have embodied One-Nation Conservatism, instead locating them in the intellectual tradition of Thatcherism. In 2016, Cameron's successor, Theresa May, referred to herself as a one-nation conservative in her first speech as prime minister and outlined her focus on social justice.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of <b>paternalism</b> - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Vrijdenkersvereniging De Vrije Gedachte (DVG) (English: Freethinkers {{association}} The Free Thought), is a Dutch atheist–humanist {{association of}} freethinkers. It {{was founded in}} 1856 and known by the name De Dageraad ("The Dawn") before assuming its present name in 1957. De Vrije Gedachte strives to use reason, natural science and logic to liberate humanity from prejudices, clerical <b>paternalism,</b> dogmas and false truths.|$|E
25|$|The Calumet Historic District are {{significant}} {{because of the}} existence of major components of the Michigan copper industry: mining and mining technology, immigration and ethnic settlement, <b>paternalism</b> and company towns, and labor organization. Although numerous mining companies operated in the Keweenaw Peninsula in the late 19th century, The Calumet and Hecla Mining Company had the greatest longevity, production, and influence in the Michigan industry, as well as exhibiting substantial technical innovation.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} held by Malthus {{as professor}} at the Haileybury training college, to his death in 1834, gave his theories some influence over Britain's administration of India. According to Peterson, William Pitt the Younger (in office: 1783–1801 and 1804–1806), on reading the work of Malthus, withdrew a Bill he had introduced that called for the extension of Poor Relief. Concerns about Malthus's theory helped promote {{the idea of a}} national population census in the UK. Government official John Rickman became instrumental in the carrying out of the first modern British census in 1801, under Pitt's administration. In the 1830s Malthus's writings strongly influenced Whig reforms which overturned Tory <b>paternalism</b> and brought in the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{standard}} ethical theory, respecting dignity {{can also be}} aligned with having a respect for people and their autonomous choices. People are then enabled {{to make decisions about}} their own treatment. Amongst other things this grounds the practice of informed consent that should be respected by the nurse, although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being incapacitated or having a mental illness that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an advance directive, outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of their inability to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted <b>paternalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although much {{of nursing}} ethics can appear similar to medical ethics, {{there are some}} factors that {{differentiate}} it. Breier-Mackie suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than moral dilemmas. Nursing ethics {{is more concerned with}} developing the caring relationship than broader principles, such as beneficence and justice. For example, a concern to promote beneficence may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of <b>paternalism,</b> where the health professional makes a decision based upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics.|$|E
25|$|The European {{members of}} the Basel Mission, however, did not to treat their African colleagues as adults, and kept {{them out of the}} church and mission {{administration}} with central decisions concerning the local church made in Basel, Switzerland. Clerk resented this <b>paternalism,</b> and felt that the Basel Mission should become decentralized and Africanized and tailored more to the local context, a view which he communicated strongly to the European missionaries. The coming of the First World War (1914-1918) gave the African missionaries a chance to undertake heavier responsibilities, even though they had not been trained for them. When the Basel Mission was expelled from the Gold Coast in 1917 during World War I, the Free Church of Scotland led by the minister, A. W. Wilkie took over their work.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, at {{the height}} of the Chartist movement, there was a general {{tendency}} towards reformism in the United Kingdom. This prompted much new legislation to be passed, such as the Parliamentary Reform Act 1832, the Factory Act 1833, the first instance of a Government grant for education in the same year and the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The Capitalist economic model had created shift patterns which left workers with free time, in contrast to the agrarian model, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers’ free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class <b>paternalism</b> rather than by demand from the lower social orders. Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.|$|E
25|$|Psychologically {{traumatic}} experiences often involve physical {{trauma that}} threatens one's survival {{and sense of}} security. Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include harassment, embarrassment, abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, sexual abuse, partner battery, employment discrimination, police brutality, judicial corruption and misconduct, bullying, <b>paternalism,</b> domestic violence, indoctrination, being the victim of an alcoholic parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in childhood), life-threatening medical conditions, and medication-induced trauma. Catastrophic natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, large scale transportation accidents, house or domestic fire, motor vehicle accident, mass interpersonal violence like war, terrorist attacks or other mass tortures like sex trafficking, being taken as a hostage or kidnapped can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme poverty or milder forms of abuse, such as verbal abuse, exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 17th century Birmingham's booming economy, {{dominated}} by the self-made merchants and manufacturers of the new metal trades rather than traditional landed interests; its expanding population and high degree of social mobility; and the almost complete absence from the area of a resident aristocracy; had seen it develop {{a new form of}} social structure very different from that of more traditional towns and rural areas: relationships were based more around pragmatic commercial linkages than the rigid <b>paternalism</b> and deference of feudal society, and the town was widely seen as one where loyalty to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy was weak. The first signs of Birmingham's growing political self-consciousness {{can be seen from the}} 1630s, when a series of puritan lectureships provided a focus for questioning the doctrines and structures of the Church of England and had a widespread influence throughout surrounding counties. A 1640 puritan-inspired petition raised by the townspeople against the local Justice of the Peace Sir Thomas Holte provides the first evidence of conflict with the country gentlemen who dominated local government.|$|E
500|$|Directly {{challenging}} Elkins's infantilization thesis, Blassingame {{argues that}} historians have focused {{too much on}} the Sambo personality type and the role of <b>paternalism.</b> [...] "The Sambo stereotype was so pervasive in antebellum Southern literature that many historians, without further research, argue that it was an accurate description of the dominant slave personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Phillips's {{interpretation}} of slavery was challenged by Kenneth M. Stampp in The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956) and Stanley M. Elkins in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life (1958). Stampp's study lacks the racist interpretation found in American Negro Slavery and approaches the {{issue from the}} position {{that there is no}} innate difference between blacks and whites. He questions the reality of plantation <b>paternalism</b> described by Phillips: [...] "the reality of ante-bellum <b>paternalism</b> ... needs to be separated from its fanciful surroundings and critically analyzed." [...] Elkins also dismisses Phillips's claim that African American slaves were innately submissive [...] "Sambos". He argues that slaves had instead been infantilized, or [...] "made" [...] into Sambos, by the brutal treatment received at the hands of slaveowners and overseers. Elkins compares the process to the infantilization of Jews in Nazi concentration camps.|$|E
500|$|One-nation {{conservatism}} (also {{known as}} one-nationism, or Tory democracy) {{is a form}} of British political conservatism that views society as organic and values <b>paternalism</b> and pragmatism. The phrase [...] "One-nation Tory" [...] originated with Benjamin Disraeli (1804–1881), who served as the chief Conservative spokesman and became Prime Minister in February 1868. He devised it to appeal to working-class men as a solution to worsening divisions in society through introducing factory and health acts, as well as greater protection for workers.|$|E

500|$|Despite slaveowner <b>paternalism</b> {{and charges}} of submissiveness, Blassingame contends, [...] "There is {{overwhelming}} evidence, {{in the primary}} sources, of the Negro's resistance to his bondage and of his undying love for freedom." [...] Blassingame outlines efforts of slaves to run away and rebel, particularly the Stono Rebellion of 1739, Charles Deslondes's revolt in 1811, Nat Turner's revolt of 1831, and the participation of fugitive slaves in Florida fighting with Seminoles during the Seminole Wars. Blassingame concludes that the Sambo and Nat stereotypes [...] "were real." [...] He explains, [...] "The more fear whites had of Nat, the more firmly tried to believe in Sambo in order to escape paranoia." ...|$|E
500|$|The early {{focus of}} the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) was on criticising anti-racist white liberals and {{liberalism}} itself, accusing it of <b>paternalism</b> and being a [...] "negative influence" [...] on black Africans. In {{one of his first}} published articles, Biko stated that although he was [...] "not sneering at the [...] liberals and their involvement" [...] in the anti-apartheid movement, [...] "one has to come to the painful conclusion that the [...] liberal is in fact appeasing his own conscience, or at best is eager to demonstrate his identification with the black people only insofar as it does not sever all ties with his relatives on his side of the colour line." ...|$|E
500|$|Ulrich Bonnell Phillips {{wrote the}} first major {{historical}} study of the 20th century dealing with slavery. [...] In American Negro Slavery (1918), Phillips refers to slaves as [...] "negroes, who {{for the most part}} were by racial quality submissive rather than defiant, light-hearted instead of gloomy, amiable and ingratiating instead of sullen, and whose very defects invited <b>paternalism</b> rather than repression." [...] American Negro Slavery is infused with racial rhetoric and upholds perceptions about the inferiority of black people common in the southern United States at the time. Although African American academics such as W. E. B. Du Bois criticized Phillips's depiction of slaves, the book was considered the authoritative text on slavery in America until the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|David Potter {{concludes that}} the Ostend Manifesto and the Kansas–Nebraska Act were [...] "the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration... Both brought down an {{avalanche}} of public criticism." [...] More important, says Potter, they permanently discredited Manifest Destiny and [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] as political doctrines. Historian Kenneth Nivison, writing in 2010, takes a more favorable view of Pierce's foreign policy, stating that his expansionism prefaced those of later presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, who served {{at a time when}} America had the military might to make her desires stick. [...] "American foreign and commercial policy beginning in the 1890s, which eventually supplanted European colonialism {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, owed much to the <b>paternalism</b> of Jacksonian Democracy cultivated in the international arena by the Presidency of Franklin Pierce." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Blassingame, the Sambo figure {{evolved from}} white Americans' attitudes toward Africans and African Americans as {{innately}} barbaric, passive, superstitious, and childlike. Southern writers felt {{a need to}} defend slavery from allegations of abuse and brutality leveled by northern abolitionists, so Sambo became a common portrayal to justify and explain the need for plantation <b>paternalism.</b> Finally, slaveowners used the Sambo stereotype to alleviate their own fears and anxieties about the potential rebelliousness of their slaves. Blassingame remarks, [...] "In this regard, Nat, the actual and potential rebel, stands {{at the core of}} white perceptions of the slave. With Nat perennially in the wings, the creation of Sambo was almost mandatory for the Southerner's emotional security. Like a man whistling in the dark to bolster his courage, the white man had to portray the slave as Sambo." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to {{mark the}} arrival of the community’s final homesteader.

But {{cooperative}} communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to [...] "our rather settled ideas" [...] that could [...] "provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [...] in the future." [...] Residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor.

500|$|Colonial {{themes were}} a {{constant}} thread in Sherwood's texts; The History of Henry Milner (1822–37), its sequel John Marten (1844), and The Indian Orphans (1839) all evince Sherwood's {{interest in these}} topics. Her writings on India reveal her strong sense of European, if not specifically British, superiority; India therefore appears in her works as a morally corrupt land in need of reformation. She wrote The History of George Desmond (1821) to warn young men {{of the dangers of}} emigrating to India. [...] Sherwood's books shaped the minds of several generations of young Britons. According to Cutt, Sherwood's depictions of India were among the few available to young British readers; such children [...] "acquired a strong conviction of the rightness of missions, which, while it inculcated sincere concern for, and a genuine kindness towards an alien people for whom Britain was responsible, quite destroyed any latent respect for Indian tradition." [...] Cutt attributes the growing <b>paternalism</b> of nineteenth-century British polices on India in part to the widespread popularity of Sherwood's books.|$|E
500|$|Levinson {{proposes that}} {{citizenship}} education {{can provide the}} [...] "cultural coherence" [...] that may be missing from a [...] "detached" [...] school—which would be a diverse community that prioritizes [...] "critical thinking, tolerance, and reflectiveness". She argues for a constitutional mandate to establish the [...] "autonomy-promoting aim of education" [...] regardless of public support, and asks for a [...] "culture change". Levinson distinguishes between parental and child rights, as laws exist for parents who do not act in their children's best interests. She adds that children are limited by the restricted scope of their parents' knowledge, and that the state should intervene to combat this small-mindedness {{in the interests of}} children. Specifically, she cites Christian criticism of curricular neutrality as a tactic to justify the imposition of their own [...] "limited and restrictive" [...] worldview, and that external knowledge increases the odds of their children not adopting their worldview. Her argument is that the limited worldviews resulting from [...] "excessive paternalism" [...] consequently stunt children's ability to develop adult autonomy or make rational decisions. Thus, state and parental <b>paternalism</b> should be limited where it will hurt individual [...] "capacity for autonomy".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the Conservatives had moved away from their one-nation {{ideology}} and were increasingly supportive of capitalism and free enterprise. During the interwar period, public fear of Communism restored the Conservative Party to one-nationism as it defined itself as the party of national unity and began to support moderate reform. As the effects of the Great Depression were felt in Britain, the party was drawn to even greater levels of state intervention. The Conservative Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin pursued an interventionist style of conservatism which won them democratic support because of its wide electoral appeal. Throughout the post-war consensus of the 1950s and 1960s, the Conservative Party was dominated by one-nation conservatives whose ideas were inspired by Disraeli. The social and economic policies of the consensus appealed to the <b>paternalism</b> of one-nation conservatism because they appeared to provide prosperity and alleviate social problems such as poverty and disease; this was intellectually developed by the [...] "new conservatism" [...] movement, led by Rab Butler. New conservatism attempted to distinguish itself from the socialism of Anthony Crosland by concentrating welfare on those in need and encouraging people to help themselves, rather than foster dependency on the state.|$|E
