50|$|Phthalic {{anhydride}} is {{a precursor}} to <b>phthalylsulfathiazole,</b> an antimicrobial, as well as phthalylsulfamethizole, phthalylsulfacetamide, and the antihelmintic phthalofyne.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phthalylsulfathiazole</b> {{belongs to}} the group of drugs called sulfonamides. The drug is a broad {{spectrum}} antimicrobial that can treat different types of infections including intestinal. The mechanism of action depends if based on competitive antagonism with para-aminobenzoic acid and inhibition of dihydropteroate synthetase activity, that in turn leads to impaired synthesis of dihydrofolic acid and as a result its active metabolite that is necessary for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine.|$|E

Molar eonductivities of the complexes indicate their non-electrolytic behaviour. Electronic, infrared and far IR-spectral studies suggest octahedral geometry for copper(II) complexes and tetrahedral geometry for mercury(II) complexes...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} N 4 dicarboxylic acid-substituted {{sulfonamides}} which resists absorp-tion from the gastrointestinal tract {{was found to}} produce varying degrees of intestinal bacteriostasis (1). Toxicological studies of succinylsulfathiazole, one of this series, have been described previously (2). Another compound in this group, 2 -(N 4 -phthalyl-sulfanilamido) -thiazole (<b>phthalylsulfathiazole)</b> 2 has re-cently engaged our attention. Preliminary reports (3, 4) indathd that this compound exerts a marked bacteriostatic effect on the intestinal coliform or-ganisms of dogs, and that smaller doses are required to produce this effect than are necessary with succinylsulfathiazole. ...|$|E
40|$|THE {{interest}} {{aroused by}} the treat-ment of coccidiosis in poultry with sulfanilamide (Levine, 1939) led to stud-ies with other compounds {{in an attempt}} to find a sulfonamide that would be effective without causing marked toxic manifesta-tions. Certain preliminary studies (Swales, 1944) using sulfamerazine (4 -methyl- 2 -sulfanilamidopyrimidine) and other stud-ies using a mixture of sodium sulfa-merazine 80 percent, 'Sulfathalidine' (<b>phthalylsulfathiazole)</b> 10 percent and sodium carbonate 10 percent (SS 2) (Gra-ham, Hawkins, Swales, Thorp) suggest that this mixture may be of value in the treatment of infections in poultry caused by Eimeria. These findings have prompted a study of the effects on young chickens of a diet containing sulfamerazine or a mixture of sodium sulfamerazine, 'Sulfathalidine' and sodium carbonate (SS 2). The only previous study of the toxic effects of sul-famerazine for chickens was devoted pri-marily to the effects on nervous tissue (Welch etal., 1943). Procedure: Thirty-five chicks, 32 days old, were divided into 5 groups of 7 each and allowed free access to a diet 1 for 1...|$|E
40|$|Haematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSC) are a rare {{population}} of cells {{that have the}} ability to self-renew and differentiate giving rise to various blood lineages, thereby reconstituting the whole haematopoietic system. This is an essential characteristic, exploited in bone marrow transplantation therapy in response to myeloablative treatment. Due to their rarity, the lack of sufficient HSC numbers for transplantation {{has proved to be a}} major clinical issue. Separately, in the development of leukaemia, acquired mutations in HSCs give rise to malignant cells. These cells, like HSCs, {{have the ability to}} self-renew and differentiate forming immature blasts and are termed cancer (leukaemic) stem cells. They are thought to remain in a quiescent state and are therefore not targeted by standard chemotherapy, inducing relapse in haematopoietic malignancies. In this study, a cross species stem cell based screen was conducted on a 12, 000 small molecule library across a range of adult and embryonic tissue types with a view to identifying compounds that would (i) expand HSCs ex vivo and in vivo for transplantation and (ii) eradicate cancer stem cells in leukaemia. A number of small molecules were identified as lead compounds and were assessed in our investigation. We found that Yohimbine, an alpha- 2 adrenergic receptor (adra- 2) antagonist, and Oxa- 22, cis- 2 -Methyl- 5 -trimethylammoniummethyl- 1, 3 -oxathiolane iodide (M 3 Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist) elicited a 2 - and 1. 5 - fold increase in HSC frequency (respectively) in vivo. Further competitive transplantation studies showed that Yohimbine and Oxa- 22 treated cells also enhanced the reconstitution of B cells and T cells respectively. In parallel, we also assessed Oxa- 22 and a third compound, Phthalylsulfathiazole- an antibacterial sulphonamide, in the leukaemic setting to ascertain whether compounds could target leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). We found that these compounds promoted proliferation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines. Furthermore, when Oxa- 22 and <b>Phthalylsulfathiazole</b> were administered in vivo models of AML, they accelerated disease progression by increasing the number of LSCs. Collectively, these results show that using small molecules we can target neuronal related pathways to enhance HSC number and function. Further investigation is required to elucidate the exact mechanisms of the compounds however, these data may prove to be influential in directing new methods of stem cell expansion for transplantation therapies. Small molecules targeting neuronal or antibacterial related pathways were also found to target malignant LSCs and alter their behaviour. By driving LSCs out of their dormant state, these small molecules may pave the way for potential targeting of LSCs in conjuction with standard current chemotherapies that incorporate and kill proliferating cancer cells...|$|E
