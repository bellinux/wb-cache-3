Varying processing conditions can produce different morphologies, which lead to different properties. Recent studies indicated that the final morphology is in fact dictated by the initial formation of crystallization precursor structures (i. e. shish-kebabs) under flow. In this article, factors that affect the shish-kebab formation in entangled polymer melts are systematically reviewed, including the concept of coil–stretch transition, chain dynamics, critical orientation molecular weight, phase transition during shish and kebab formations. In particular, recent experimental results from in situ rheo-X-ray studies and ex situ microscopic examinations have been presented to illustrate several new findings of flow-induced shish-kebab structures in polymer melts. (1) The shish entity consists of stretched chains (or chain segments) that can be in the amorphous, mesomorphic or crystalline state. (2) The kebab entity mainly arises from the crystallization of <b>coiled</b> <b>chains</b> (or chain segments), which seems to follow a diffusion-control growth process.

For example, there is an obvious change in pH along the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach (pH =  1 – 3) to the intestine (pH =  5 – 8), chronic wounds have pH values between 7.4 and 5.4 [40], and tumour tissue is acidic extracellularly [41, 42]. Therefore, unlike temperature changes, this property can be exploited for a direct response at a certain tissue or in a cellular compartment. The key element for pH responsive polymers {{is the presence of}} ionisable, weak acidic or basic moieties that attach to a hydrophobic backbone, such as polyelectrolytes [6, 10, 43].

However, we also show that the parameters of the Poland-Scheraga model are still not known with sufficient precision to quantitatively predict the fine structure of melting curves. This formulation of the Poland-Scheraga model opens the possibility to overcome this limitation by optimizing parameters with respect to an extended base of experimental data for short-, medium-, and long-chain melting.

In contrast conformation A, a predominantly random coiled composition of polypeptide chains, poorly supports cell spreading and proliferation. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the surface charge (zeta potential) and the surface roughness (by means of AFM) are comparable for (PLL-CS) 10 and (PLL-PGA) 10 films. A prominent dissimilarity was detected for the stiffness of these multilayers [17]. The mechanical properties of PEM assemblies may well be correlated to the conformation of their polypeptide <b>chains.</b> Random <b>coiled</b> <b>chains</b> are usually loosely assembled {{with a high degree of}} flexibility resulting in a low mechanical stiffness. The low stiffness is a result of the high degree of swelling caused by the CS chains. On the contrary, the backbones of polypeptide chains that self-assemble into intermolecular β sheets are tightly packed and their conformation is stabilized by a multitude of hydrogen bonds (peptide backbone) and salt bridges (side chains). This tightly packed polymer network consequently displays an elevated stiffness. Additionally, the hydration with water molecules may be sterically hindered and reduce the swelling of the films.|$|R
40|$|Polymer-induced drag {{reduction}} is the phenomenon {{by which the}} friction factor of a turbulent flow is reduced {{by the addition of}} small amounts of high-molecular-weight linear polymers, which conformation in solution at rest can vary between randomly coiled and rodlike. It is well known that drag {{reduction is}} positively correlated to viscous stresses, which are generated by extended polymers. Rodlike polymers always assume this favorable conformation, while randomly <b>coiling</b> <b>chains</b> need to be unraveled by fluid strain rate in order to become effective. The coiling and stretching of flexible polymers in turbulent flow produce an additional elastic component in the polymer stress. The effect of the elastic stresses on drag reduction is unclear. To study this issue, we compare direct numerical simulations of turbulent drag reduction in channel flow using constitutive equations describing solutions of rigid and flexible polymers. When compared at constant or 2, both simulations predict the same amount of drag reduction. Here o is the polymer volume fraction and r is the polymer aspect ratio, which for flexible polymers is based on average polymer extension at the channel wall. This demonstrates that polymer elasticity plays a marginal role in the mechanism for drag reduction. Multi-Scale PhysicsApplied Science...|$|R

The concentration {{dependence of the}} folding and unfolding rate constants was analyzed {{on the basis of the}} two alternative models, the intermediate-controlled folding model and the multiple-pathway folding model, that we had proposed previously.

The cleavage of the 6 - 120 disulfide bond resulted in acceleration of unfolding without changing the refolding rate, indicating that the loop closed by the 6 - 120 disulfide bond is unfolded in the transition state.

When wH was lower than 0. 1, (lnŁr) /c of lentinan in water-diluted DMSO exhibited the almost same value as that in pure DMSO and changed hardly with increasing t. Interestingly, (lnŁr) /c decreased to reach a minimum with a further increase of wH from 0. 1 to 0. 25 and then increased with a continuous increase of wH from 0. 25 to 0. 5.

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{phenomenon}} of polymer fracture is well know and well studied, {{it is still not}} well understood. If a polymer bond is put under sufficient stress, it will break. However, a polymer chain will, if possible relieve stresses by slippage or change of conformation. To reach a stress high enough to break it, the chain must have restricted movement. This is, to some extent, the case in a highly oriented system, such as a fibre. Orientation A polymer chain can be regarded as a one-dimensional system since its length is at least 1000 times its diameter. The polymer has very different properties along the chain as compared to across it. In a completely relaxed state, polymer <b>chains</b> are <b>coiled</b> randomly, which means that the total system will show the same properties in all directions. The chains can, however, be aligned, i. e., oriented in one direction, which means that the total system will, just as the chains, have different properties in different directions, known as anisotropy. A fibre is a highly oriented polymer system. Figure 1. The left part of the figure shows randomly <b>coiled</b> <b>chains.</b> This system has the same properties in all directions. To the right are oriented chains, which gives the system different properties along and transverse to the orientation axis. Crystallinity In addition to orientation, a polymer can also organise in crystallites. Not all polymers can crystallise, since not all types of polymer chains can arrange themselves well enough to form crystals. Polystyrene is, for example, completely amorphous. A polymer is never 100 % crystalline since it will always contain unordered parts, such as chain ends and flaws. Therefore, polymers with crystalline regions are called semi-crystalline. A polymer has to be semi-crystalline in order to be drawn into a fibre. In an unoriented polymer the crystallites are spherulitic with the same characteristics in every direction. When the polymer is oriented, the sperulites will be deformed and rearrange in a different type of crystal called a micro-fibril. This process is called cold drawing, see Figure 2...|$|R
