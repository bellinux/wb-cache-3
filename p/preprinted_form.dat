The direct layout analysis without separating the <b>preprinted</b> <b>form</b> from the added text is difficult and not efficient. Previous works use both local features and global layout knowledge to separate the pre-printed forms and the added text. Although for real applications, they are even exposed to a great improvement. This paper presents the first pixel-based image registration of color business documents based on the NonLocal-Means (NLM) method. We prove that the NLM, commonly used for image denoising, can be also adapted to images registration at the pixel level. Our intuition tends {{to look for a}} similar neighbourhood from the first image I 1 into the second image I 2 and provide both an exact image registration with a precision at pixel level and noise removal.

DESIGN: The process of retrospective case note audit was used to identify areas of poor performance, reiterate national guidelines, introduce a post-sedation advice sheet, and demonstrate improvement. SETTING: Emergency Department, Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton. SUBJECTS: Forty seven patients requiring sedation for relocation of a dislocated shoulder or manipulation of a Colles' fracture between July and October 1996 and July and October 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence that the following items had been documented: consent for procedure, risk assessment, monitored observations, prophylactic use of supplementary oxygen, and discharging patients with printed advice. Case note review was performed before (n = 23) and after (n = 24) the introduction of a sedation audit form. Notes were analysed for the above outcome measures. The monitored observations analysed included: pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, electrocardiography, and conscious level. RESULTS: Use of the form significantly improved documentation of most parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of the form, together with staff education, resulted in enhanced documentation of data and improved conformity with national guidelines. A risk management approach to preempting critical incidents following sedation, can be adopted in this area of emergency medicine...|$|E

40|$|The {{automation}} {{of business}} form processing is attracting intensive research interests {{due to its}} wide application an its reduction of the heavy workload due to manual processing. Preparing clean and clear images for the recognition engines is often taken for granted as a trivial task that requires little attention. In reality, hanfwritten data usually touch or cross the <b>preprinted</b> <b>form</b> frames and texts, creating tremendous problems for the recognition engine. In this paper, we contribute answers to two questions: "Why do we need cleaning an enhancement procedures in form processing systems?" and "How can we clean and enhance the hand-fileld items with easy implementation and high processing speed?" Here, we propose a generic system including only cleaning and enhancing phases. In the cleaning phase, the system registers a template to the input form by aligning corresponding landmarks. A unified morphological scheme is proposed to remove the form frames and restore the broken handwriting from gray or binary images. When the handwriting is found touching or crossing preprinted texts, morphological operations based on statistical features are used to clean it. In applications where a black-and-white scanning mode is adopted, handwriting may contain broken or hollow strokes due to improper thresholding parameters. Therefore, we have designed a module to enhance the image quality based on morphological operations.

The theoretical part of the paper summarizes findings of construction industry, works classification, selected risk factors of working conditions, health protection measures and the legislation in this field. This section is processed by the secondary analysis of data taken from literature, legislation and websites. In the practical part of the study, quantitative research was used, the interview method was selected and the data collection technique was that of a questionnaire. 270 questionnaires were distributed, 215 of them were returned back, the return rate was 75 %. The questionnaire contained 16 questions. They were submitted in a <b>preprinted</b> <b>form</b> to be filled in writing by employees of selected medium-sized construction companies. The questions were aimed at identifying the respondents, at finding their views and knowledge. The aim {{of this study was to}} create a list of professions that are used in construction industry, on the example of selected construction companies, to characterize the actual or potential exposure to risk factors regarding individual professions, and to determine how much the company employees are informed of the way preventive care measures are provided. Two hypotheses were set. Hypothesis 1, workers are informed in which work category they are classified, has not been confirmed. The research results have shown that a great number of employees do not remember that they were informed of the category into which their work had been classified. Hypothesis 2, workers are informed of the preventive care measures provision, has been confirmed. The employees proved that they had been sufficiently informed about the medical facility providing them with preventive care.

40|$|Introduction: A {{good work}} {{environment}} and good resources among district nurses’ and general nurses’ {{are important in}} the provision of good nursing care. For patient security it is also very important that resources and time are used in an appropriate way. A lot of time is spent on non-core activity, for example administration takes more and more time, which can result in feelings of stress. Aim: The aim was to describe how district nurses’ and nurses’ in primary care perceived their work environment, how their worktime content was distributed and if there was some connection between perceived work environment and the distribution of work time. Methods: A mapping of the content of the work was made in two parts. The first part was a survey where the respondents were asked about their perceived work environment, their work tasks and if they perceived stress. The second part was a time reporting, by self-reporting on a <b>preprinted</b> <b>form.</b> Results: Almost half of the district nurses’ and general nurses’ said that they seldom had to perform tasks which they wondered if were really necessary. More than 40 percent perceived that they sometimes had work tasks which placed demands beyond what could be expected of them. About 40 percent perceived that they often had enough time to do their work tasks and 30 percent perceived it sometimes. Stress was perceived some of the time by almost 40 percent. Most of the nurses’ thought the quality of care was good. The proportion of direct patient care was approximately 45 percent and indirect patient work approximately 24 percent. The proportion of other work varied with the proportion of quantitative requirements: there was enough time. Conclusion: Nearly half of the district nurses’ and the general nurses’ perceived that they seldom had work tasks they felt doubtful about and that they sometimes had work tasks which required more than could be expected of them. About two thirds said that they often or sometimes had enough time to do their work tasks. Nearly half perceived stress a part of the working time.

These areas are analyzed and compared in the practical part of the paper. The objective of the diploma paper was to ascertain what documentation is used by health-care establishments in the Czech Republic and to compare these internal materials. From 49 contacted establishments in all regions of the Czech Republic, the research covered 15 establishments that consented to cooperation and provided nursing documentation in a printed form. All obtained materials were analyzed and used in research. In order to attain the objectives, qualitative research was used. A record sheet, based on 12 areas of the Gordons model, was made up {{for the purposes of}} the comparison. Individual documentations were kept and processed, and are referred to in the paper under letters of the alphabet so that anonymity of the research is maintained. Individual materials were analyzed. The contents of the sheets were compared and evaluated. The collected data were processed by means of Microsoft Office Word program. From the results of the research it is apparent that the documentations maintained by all the health-care establishments have a similar composition. They contain the nursing anamnesis, nursing care plan and other documents examined in detail in the paper. The nursing anamnesis is divided into individual fields that are not based on any mode and whose number varies. Measuring techniques are used in the documentations.
