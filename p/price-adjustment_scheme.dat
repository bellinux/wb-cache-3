40|$|Motivated by the {{operational}} environment in high-tech industries, this paper examines the coordination between marketing and operations when {{time to market}} and capacity utilization are both main factors. In contrast to earlier joint lot-sizing literature which focuses on price-quantity coordination, our model captures the inter-relationship between order quantity, capacity level, and lead-time. Besides the setup and inventory holding costs considered in EOQ-type models, our model incorporates additional cost components for capacity consumption, WIP inventory, and lead-time (as related to the customer's safety stock cost). We first analyze the centralized system-optimum solution and a decentralized Stackelberg game solution for the model, then compare their asymptotic performance as different cost components vary. We examine three coordination schemes for marketing and operations. We show that the well-known quantity discount scheme does not coordinate the system in this setting. We propose a lead-time reduction scheme where operations offers a more favorable lead-time provided that marketing convinces the customer to place a larger order. We show that lead-time and order-size alone do not guarantee to coordination the system. It is essential to add a <b>price-adjustment</b> <b>scheme</b> {{in the form of}} a discount or extra-payment in order for the system to be perfectly coordinated. ...|$|E
