The plywoods of Eucalyptus grandis showed higher specific gravity and lesser thickness reduction {{in comparison with the}} other two species. The results of shear bonding tests were statistically the same between all species. The values of MOR and MOE of Eucalyptus grandis were statistically the same in comparison with Araucaria angustifolia and higher than Pinus taeda. In relation to effects of different formulations of adhesive, no differences for all evaluated properties were verified excluding water soaking shear bonding test...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} clinical efficacy of ascancol in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). The study was designed as open-controlled. Two matched groups of patients received the local treatment (monotherapy) with the ointment ascancol and with other semisolid medicinal forms (OSMF) <b>for</b> <b>external</b> <b>use</b> (hormonal, symptomatic indifferent ointments). All patients underwent a 3 - 9 months (catamnesis) run-in period, to assess their baseline conditions. Eighteen (80) patients with AD were investigated. From them 40 patients had undergone the local treatment with ascancol (monotherapy) and 40 patients were treated with OSMF <b>for</b> <b>external</b> <b>use.</b> Eighteen (80) patients, fulfilling the generally accepted diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka for the diagnosis of AD, who consecutively attended department of Clinical Allergology and Immunology of Institute of Pediatrics (median age of patients was 2 years— 6 months- 14 years) and “Asthma-school”- for allergic {{children and their parents}} (median age 37 years), were enrolled in this study; 50 male and 30 female concluded the study. Results of the investigation show us that ascancol causes positive changes in subjective indices, reflecting in antipruritic activity of the preparation and it is particularly important that, it clearly decreases such common objective indices, directly reflects dynamics of allergic process, as erythema and oozing. Generalizing results according to SCORAD index, in AD monotherapy with ascancol and with OSMF, according to comparison data of drying and antipruritic effects, ascancol is preferential than OSMF <b>for</b> <b>external</b> <b>use,</b> especially in early childhood...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the generic drug Wartocid® (Imiquimod cream 5 % <b>for</b> <b>external</b> <b>use)</b> in patients with external anogenital (venereal) warts (AGW). Materials and methods. The single-blind comparative, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 50 women aged 18 to 60 with an established clinical diagnosis of AGW in the vulva and perianal region. Patients in group 1 received placebo cream <b>for</b> <b>external</b> <b>use,</b> while patients in group 2 received therapy with Warto с id in a daily dose of 10 mg cream/cm 2   of skin area. The drug was applied every other day until the complete disappearance of AGW, but in any case, not more than 16 weeks. A follow-up was carried out for 4 more weeks. The study evaluated the dynamics of subjective and objective symptoms, the presence {{and the frequency of}} relapses, and the percentage of full treatment of AGW. Main results. Treatment with Warto с id resulted in a complete cure of AGW in 16 % of patients, and a reduction in the focus area of AGW in 36 % of patients. Against the background of the placebo no dynamics of the disease were reached. Neither serious adverse events nor clinically significant changes in blood tests, urine or serum biochemical parameters in any of the patients who received treatment with Warto с id were observed. Conclusion. The generic drug Wartocid has been proved to be effective and safe for AGW treatment and its effectiveness is similar to the original drug Aldara® (Imiquimod cream 5 % <b>for</b> <b>external</b> <b>use).</b> </p...|$|R
