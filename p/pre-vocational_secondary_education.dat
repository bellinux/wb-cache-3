40|$|In the Netherlands, many <b>Pre-Vocational</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education</b> {{schools are}} {{implementing}} elements of competence-based education. These learning environments {{are expected to}} elicit the use of deep information processing strategies and to positively influence learning outcomes. While questionnaires are often used to investigate the preferences of students for particular types of information processing strategies in other educational contexts, these instruments cannot simply be adopted unaltered for use in <b>Pre-Vocational</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education</b> where several characteristics of the students {{must be taken into}} account. This study explores the psychometric properties of three instruments for the measurement of student preferences for deep or surface information processing strategies in competence-based <b>Pre-Vocational</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education.</b> The utility of a semi-structured interview, a questionnaire, and the think-aloud method was investigated. The questionnaire appeared to be the most accurate instrument and allowed easy classification of students in terms of their information processing preferences. The think-aloud method provided profound insight into the information processing strategies that the students preferred for a learning task and the frequencies with which the strategies were used. The interview results largely corresponded to the results produced by the other measurement instruments, but the interview data lacked the expected richness and depth...|$|E

40|$|Since the Lisbon Summit in 2000, {{reducing}} {{school dropout}} rates {{has a high}} priority in Europe, especially in <b>pre-vocational</b> tracks in <b>secondary</b> <b>education.</b> One policy issue is improving the match be-tween <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> and senior <b>secondary</b> vocational <b>education</b> and allows a stronger focus on practical work in vocational education. Therefore, more and more schools for <b>secondary</b> <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> in the Netherlands set out a specific language education policy relating the language arts cur-riculum to the vocational curriculum. One assumes that students will be more motivated for language lessons when they are engaged in rich contexts, in meaningful language activities which they experience as relevant, since it serves a clear communicative purpose. To guide this process of curriculum integration we set out an instructional theory for language education {{in the setting of}} pre-vocational education. In this paper we present four course design parameters that constitute our interpretation of a community of learners for secondary pre- vocational L 1 -learning: 1) language learning as a meaningful activity; 2) language learning as a reflective activity; 3) language learning as a shared activity and 4) language learning as a focus on transferable learning outcomes. To check explore the practicality and theoretical value, we set up a design experiment as a collaborative enterprise of teachers and researchers, in which these parameters guided the joint enterprise. We con-fronted the theoretical framework with the analysis of a single case study, the design experiment, to elab-orate and validate this set of four design parameters. Therefore, we operated at three curriculum represen-tations: the (1) intended; (2) implemented; and (3) perceived curriculum. Discriminating these three rep-resentations served as data to review and revise the designed lessons as we ran them in two classes, as well as to adjust and refine the conceptual framework. The results show that the designers incorporated all four parameters and that all four contributed to the design somehow. Furthermore, we are better informed 58 ANNE TOORENAAR & GERT RIJLAARSDAMwhat kind of learning activities the four parameters can and can not generate, and how the four parame-ters interact in means-end relations...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{students}} from a prevocational secondary school are placed in training programmes in senior <b>secondary</b> vocational <b>education</b> that match with their abilities can be estimated by an indicator called External Efficiency. However, estimating the external efficiency of secondary schools is complex because placements of students in training programmes are a function of several social contexts and factors that are {{beyond the control of}} the <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> school. An example of such a factor is the admission policy of vocational institutions. Based on data of over 20, 000 students from the basic track in prevocational <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> and by estimating three multilevel models we tried to estimate the External Efficiency of secondary schools. The results of the multilevel models suggest that <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> schools differ in the {{extent to which}} they realized successful placements of students in training programmes. Furthermore, whether or not students were successfully placed in training programmes is more strongly dependent on the institutions for senior <b>secondary</b> vocational <b>education</b> than on the <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> schools...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} it is {{investigated}} {{to what extent}} contextualized and non-contextualized mathematics test items have a differential impact on examinee effort. Mixture item response theory (IRT) models are applied to two subsets of items from a national assessment on mathematics in the second grade of the <b>pre-vocational</b> track in <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> in Flanders. One subset focused on elementary arithmetic and consisted of non-contextualized items. Another subset of contextualized items focused on the application of arithmetic in authentic problem-solving situations. Results indicate that differential performance on the subsets is {{to a large extent}} due to test effort. The non-contextualized items appear to be much more susceptible to low examinee effort in low-stakes testing situations. However, subgroups of students can be found with regard {{to the extent to which}} they show low effort. One can distinguish a compliant, an underachieving, and a dropout group. Group membership is also linked to relevant background characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|To improve students’ {{transitions}} between successive educational levels, continuing learning pathways {{are being}} designed and implemented in many countries. This study {{was carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of the Green Lycea (GL) as critical cases of continuing learning pathways in vocational education in The Netherlands. The GL were compared with a traditional pathway (<b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> and secondary vocational education offered as separate programmes) in terms of students’ learning performance and transitions. GL students and comparable students following the regular pathway yielded the same mean final exam scores for four core subjects in the first phase of their educational programmes, despite the fact that GL students took this exam one year earlier than regular students because of the acceleration of the learning trajectory in the GL programme. Regarding the students’ transitions, the GL and the traditional pathway yielded comparable percentages of students who either did or did not obtain a <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> diploma; For the GL, however, the percentage of students who proceeded in secondary vocational education was higher. To conclude, it seems to be possible to improve students’ transitions between successive educational levels (with their learning performance being an important precondition) through continuing learning pathways such as the GL. In this regard, GL design characteristics as described and examined in this study can be valuable ingredients for continuing learning pathways internationally as well. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{rationale}} for the study is to enhance {{our understanding of how}} young people learn and engage with vocational subjects within the lower secondary years of compulsory education. The concept of pre-vocational education has recently emerged to describe the initial transitional phase of preparing young people for employment in specific occupational areas in the UK. Although there has been extensive research undertaken in work-based apprenticeship learning, very little research has emerged in pre-vocational education among 14 - 16 year olds in schools. The research undertakes such an enquiry based upon a case study of North Lanarkshire secondary schools. This local authority has been selected as it {{has one of the highest}} rates of young people participating in <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> in <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> and has been identified by a recent OECD report as a potential exemplar of best practice in this field.

40|$|With handhelds, it is {{possible}} to mix virtual with real-world data (i. e. locations and contexts) connecting virtual worlds to real life. Handheld games can be used to engage students with learning in their (school) environment. In a project called 'Games Atelier' innovative pedagogy was developed that stimulated students to create content with the use of mobile technology. The premise underlying Games Atelier is that the process of creating games improves students' learning experiences. In this paper experiences of 80 students from both <b>pre-vocational</b> and lower <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> working with 7 scenes (a platform to create games) were described. The aim of this investigation was to indicate how 7 scenes was used in <b>secondary</b> <b>education,</b> how many lessons were needed to create a meaningful game, how students experienced working with seven scenes and what students and teachers perceived as possible learning outcomes of creating and playing games. Preliminary results showed that in 12 - 14 lessons a meaningful game can be created. For the students it was hard to place themselves in the position of the player of the game when creating the assignments and they needed more guidance from their teacher especially in formulating the questions {{in a way that they}} would be clear to the player. Students mostly learned technically how to design a game. In addition to these technical skills, students learned very few other things such as measuring the temperature of water and the meaning of traffic signs. Several improvements were suggested such as working in two consecutive lessons, use of planning and pre-defined assessment and making the platform more user-friendly...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{perception}} of psychological needs and motivation in a student-centred and a teacher-centred learning environment are compared, using Self Determination Theory as a framework.

As predicted, multi-level analyses showed that students in the student-centred learning environment {{reported higher levels of}} perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness and motivation, measured by pleasure and effort. Furthermore, boys were less absent. Achievement shows no differences. These results suggest that a student-centred form of learning can be more beneficial for students’ motivation if granted autonomy is embedded in a supportive environment...|$|E

According to the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning such representations can be powerful learning tools. The study described here approaches this theory from the domain of history in co-construction tasks. In an experimental study, the dialogues of pupils who co-constructed either textual representations or multimodal representations integrated in a timeline were compared. The participants were 12 to 14 -year-old pupils in <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> who worked in dyads {{on a series of}} four history tasks.

40|$|This paper explores which {{learning}} environments – geared towards career learning in students –contribute to {{the acquisition of}} career competencies in students attending <b>pre-vocational,</b> <b>secondary</b> and higher vocational education. The learning environment is laid out into {{the organization of the}} curriculum and career guidance. The study makes a distinction between three career competencies: career reflection, career forming and networking. Two quantitative studies (8325 students and 537 teachers in total) in <b>pre-vocational,</b> <b>secondary</b> and higher vocational education took place in order to study the relationship between aspects of the learning environment and career competencies. A case study in <b>secondary</b> vocational <b>education</b> provides a description of what happens in conversations between the student, the teacher and a mentor from placement. Conversations are observed and analysed from a career learning perspective for formal characteristics, content, form, and relational components. The results show that career-directed guidance at school and on the job – including a dialogue with the student about concrete experiences that are focused on the future – contributes most to career competencies in students. Also a learning environment which is practice based and in which students have the opportunity to have a say in what and how they learn, contributes to career development of students...|$|R

We test this hypothesis by estimating social background effects on the choice between grade retention and enrolling in a lower track. Our analysis is based on three cohorts of pupils who made the transition from primary to secondary education in 1989, 1993 and 1999 respectively. Indeed, when compared to a transition to a lower track, we find the expected positive effect of social background on grade retention.

This article first explains the development of an authentic, competence-based performance assessment in <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> (pre-VET). Using these assessments in pre-VET, that is preparatory to VET, is important for motivating students for a future in VET. Second, in an action research 34 teacher teams of 11 pre-VET institutions implement the new assessment, supported by researchers and teacher coaches, to illuminate how it motivates students, prepares them for VET, and influences teaching and learning. Data from 76 teachers, 68 students, 24 teacher coaches and 3 researchers showed how implementing these assessments raised questions about changing educational content and pedagogy to fit a competence-based approach. Increasing teachers’ expectations of students, changing student-teacher interaction patterns, and developing teachers’ practical understanding of competencies and how they can be observed and discussed in assessments are some of the intriguing challenges that require further support for proper implementation of competence-based assessments and developing an aligned competence-based teaching and learning process. </p...|$|E
