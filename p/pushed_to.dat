5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> the sides of the main airway.|$|E

The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.|$|E

5|$|Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, George Ripley was <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> attend Harvard College by {{his father}} and {{completed}} his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School {{and the next year}} married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the Transcendental Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put Transcendental beliefs in practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model {{based on the work of}} Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

5|$|England {{abruptly}} {{retired in}} 1997 {{and was replaced}} by Jeff Brokamp, who had been principal of the Crest Hills Year-Round School, which had won awards for its all-year curriculum. Brokamp, with no previous arts experience, began to turn the school around. A new emphasis on academics, more Advanced Placement courses and more stringent audition standards that admitted only the most dedicated students led to better test scores and a higher level of artistic talent; Brokamp <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> expand the school's vocational training programs in photography, stage management, and costume design by 50percent.

When asked by Dawson to withdraw the remarks, Wray refused, prompting Dawson to name him and order his removal from the chamber. A unanimous motion was later passed to suspend Wray for two sitting days, or until he withdrew his remarks and delivered an apology to the chamber. Wray returned four days later, issuing an apology and retracting his remarks.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> the left or right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
