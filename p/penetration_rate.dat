The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) <b>penetration</b> <b>rate,</b> with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the use of unfrozen, diluted semen for in vitro fertilisation of bovine oocytes matured in vitro. In experiment 1, semen from each of two bulls was used on two consecutive days ("day-old" and "two-day-old" sperm) to explore the effect of sperm concentration on oocyte <b>penetration</b> <b>rates.</b> The sperm concentrations used were 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0 xl 06 /ml. <b>Penetration</b> <b>rates</b> were uniformly high when day-old sperm was used, but low <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> were obtained below 1 xl 06 /ml with two-day-old sperm. Unfrozen spem 1 appeared to give better <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> than frozen-thawed sperm at concentrations of 0. 5 - 2. 0 x 106 /ml. There was no relationship between sperm concentration and incidence of polyspermy. In experiment 2, sperm from the same two bulls were used to investigate the presence of Caprogen extender in the fertilisation medium. Caprogen inhibited penetration when present in concentrations greater than 1 Oml/litre. Experiments 3 and 4 studied the effect of heparin on <b>penetration</b> <b>rates.</b> In experiment 3, sperm from one bull was used to inseminate oocytes in medium containing 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 or 50 !Jg/ml heparin. There was no relationship between <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> and heparin concentrations in the medium, and average <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> were high for all concentrations. In experiment 4, five bulls were used to investigate <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> at heparin levels of O!Jg/ml (frozen-thawed and unfrozen sperm) and lO!Jg/ml (unfrozen sperm). The results obtained in experiment 3 with sperm from one bull were confirmed; penetration was obtained {{in the absence of}} heparin with all five bulls. Good penetration can be obtained in vitro with unfrozen sperm, and its greater longevity and viability make it a useful alternative to frozen semen for both commercial and research in vitro fertilisation programmes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{vehicular}} ad hoc {{network has}} great potential in improving traffic safety. One {{of the most}} important and interesting issues in the research community is the safety evaluation with limited <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> of vehicles equipped with inter-vehicular communications. In this paper, a stochastic model is proposed for analyzing the vehicle chain collisions. It takes into account the influences of different <b>penetration</b> <b>rates,</b> the stochastic nature of inter-vehicular distance distribution, and the different kinematic parameters related to driver and vehicle. The usability and accuracy of this model is tested and proved by comparative experiments with Monte Carlo simulations. The collision outcomes of a platoon in different <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> and traffic scenarios are also analyzed based on this model. These results are useful to provide theoretical insights into the safety control of a heterogeneous platoon...|$|R

The figure, Household Penetration of Selected Communications Technologies (right), illustrates U.S. household <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> of selected communications technologies, measured as a percentage of all households.

For example, it took decades for the telephone to achieve 50 percent <b>penetration</b> <b>rates</b> beginning in around 1900, but it took less than five years for cellphones to achieve the same <b>penetration</b> <b>rates.</b> In order to explain the increasing pace of adoption, some have pointed to supply-side issues such as reduced barriers to entry and lower costs of innovation, while others have argued that consumers drive adoption rates because they place a high value on the convenience of new innovations.|$|R
