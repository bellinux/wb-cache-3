50|$|However, {{supporters}} of NAP claim that any risky activity will be {{regulated by the}} free market when NAP is upheld. I.e. {{driving on a highway}} would involve risks but all parties involved (road owner, car drivers, <b>passengers,</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, neighbours) would have agreed upon the level of these risks for the highway to be economically viable. The road owner might require drivers to have a driving license and insurance, as well as certified vehicles. People living near the highway would have been compensated for the pollution and noise. If compensation or anti-pollution measures cost too much the highway will be built elsewhere, or not at all. Similar for flying, or polluting industries. Insurance companies will put a premium on all risky activities, making them either economically viable or not possible.|$|R

50|$|An {{insurance}} score - {{also called}} an insurance credit score - is a numerical point {{system based on}} select credit report characteristics. There is no direct relationship to financial credit scores used in lending decisions, as insurance scores are not intended to measure creditworthiness, but rather to predict risk.

Insurance scores are applied in personal product lines, namely homeowners and private <b>passenger</b> automobile <b>insurance,</b> and typically not elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|Deep neural {{perception}} and control networks {{are likely to}} be a key component of self-driving vehicles. These models need to be explainable - they should provide easy-to-interpret rationales for their behavior - so that <b>passengers,</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, law enforcement, developers etc., can understand what triggered a particular behavior. Here we explore the use of visual explanations. These explanations take the form of real-time highlighted regions of an image that causally influence the network's output (steering control). Our approach is two-stage. In the first stage, we use a visual attention model to train a convolution network end-to-end from images to steering angle. The attention model highlights image regions that potentially influence the network's output. Some of these are true influences, but some are spurious. We then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regions actually influence the output. This produces more succinct visual explanations and more accurately exposes the network's behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on three datasets totaling 16 hours of driving. We first show that training with attention does not degrade the performance of the end-to-end network. Then we show that the network causally cues on a variety of features that are used by humans while driving...|$|R

5000|$|In {{its balance}} of {{payments}} accounts, Japan has traditionally run a deficit in services. Trade in services includes transportation (freight and <b>passenger</b> fares), <b>insurance,</b> travel expenditures, royalties, licensing fees, and income from investments. The deficit in services rose steadily from US$99 million in 1960, to nearly US$1.8 billion in 1970 and to more than US$11.3 billion in 1980 which {{can be attributed to}} rising royalty and licensing payments for Japan's acquisition of technology from other industrial countries and to rising deficits in the trade-related services of transportation and insurance. The transportation deficit rose after the 1960s, as rapidly climbing labor costs made Japanese-flag vessels less competitive, leading to greater use of foreign-flag carriers (including many flag of convenience vessels actually owned by Japanese interests).|$|R

The word [...] "driving" [...] occurred in the context of other adventure activities; it therefore made better sense to understand it to entail driving over unmade roads or slippery, steep or otherwise exciting terrain. Since Drifter's, as a cross-border tour operator, was statutorily obliged to have <b>passenger</b> liability <b>insurance,</b> it would be perverse for it to have contracted out of this liability altogether.|$|R

40|$|In risk {{theory with}} {{application}} to insurance, {{the identification of}} the relevant distributions for both the counting and the claim size processes from given observations is of major importance. In some situations left-truncated distributions can be used to model, not only the single claim severity, but also the inter-arrival times between two consecutive claims. We show that left-truncated Weibull distributions are particularly relevant, especially for the claim severity distribution. For that, we first demonstrate how the parameters can be estimated consistently from the data, and then show how a Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test can be set up using modified critical values. These critical values are universal to all left-truncated Weibull distributions, independent of the actual Weibull parameters. To illustrate our findings we analyse three applications using real insurance data, one from a Swiss excess of loss treaty over automobile insurance, another from an American private <b>passenger</b> automobile <b>insurance</b> and a third from earthquake inter-arrival times in California.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} rate regulation {{on the structure of}} insurance markets for private <b>passenger</b> automobile <b>insurance.</b> The paper argues that states' restrictions on automobile insurers' rates of return will distort the structure of the market by distorting insurers' entry and output decisions. Cross-sectional analysis of the numbers of firms and the relative market shares of firms of different organizational characteristics supports this argument, especially for those states which impose the most stringent regulation. The analysis suggests that increased regulatory stringency lowers the total number of firms selling in the market, and lowers the number of low cost and national firms in the market. The market shares of these latter two groups of firms are also significantly lowered by increased regulatory stringency. These findings hold even after controlling for other factors which may influence the relative prevalence of these firms in the market, and are robust to the assumption that regulatory stringency in a state is itself partially determined by the number and market shares of large, low cost producers. ...|$|R
40|$|Rate {{regulation}} has a {{long history}} in insurance markets. In many states an important goal of regulation is to reduce price variation across purchasers, and specifically to reduce price levels for high-risk purchasers. That feature of rate regulation leads to price cross-subsidies from low-risk purchasers to high-risk purchasers. Consumers who are charged higher prices in order to finance cross-subsidies to high-risks may be less likely to purchase insurance and to reduce participation in insured activities. These adverse selection effects will lead to a higher proportion of high-risk consumers and a higher proportion of insurance purchased by high-risks. 1 In addition, because cross-subsidies reduce the links between insurance risk and insurance prices, all consumers face reduced incentives for loss prevention and safety investments due to moral hazard. The article tests the hypothesis that insurance price subsidies lead to higher insurance cost growth. To squarely focus on the impact of regulatory price subsidies rather than that of price regulation more generally, the paper makes use of data from the Massachusetts private <b>passenger</b> automobile <b>insurance</b> market. Cross-subsidies were explicitly built into the rate structure through rules that limit rate differentials and differences in rate increases across driver rating categories. Two approaches wer...|$|R
