50|$|The {{fire was}} a major {{disaster}} in terms of deaths, injury, loss of business, property and man-days, displacement of people, environmental impact in Jaipur, {{the capital city of}} the Indian state of Rajasthan and a popular tourist destination. As per eyewitnesses having factories and hotels around Indian Oil's Sitapura (Jaipur) Oil Terminal they felt presence of <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> in the atmosphere around 4:00 p.m. on 29 October 2009. Within the next few hours the concentration of <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> intensified making it difficult to breathe.

50|$|Westoning made news {{headlines}} on 11 September 1976 when, at 07:10am, a Texaco petrol tanker overturned in the High Street. The tanker subsequently caught fire and exploded, destroying eight houses. Twenty-one people were made homeless {{and over a}} hundred more were evacuated from their homes. Fortunately, nobody was injured in the blast {{but a number of}} fireman were hurt when their fire engine overturned on attending the scene. Eyewitness accounts state that petrol seeped into the surface water drainage system and cast iron inspection covers were blown into the air when the fire spread and ignited the <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> in the drains.|$|E
50|$|Unable to {{get close}} enough to safely fight the fire directly, the fire brigades forced high-expansion foam into {{ventilation}} shafts far from the fire. This created blockages that starved the fire of oxygen. By mid-afternoon the next day, the inferno was no longer burning, though the fire was by no means knocked down. Petrol continued to leak from the derailed wagons through the tunnel drainage and ballast and the vapour sporadically reignited when it came into contact with the hot tunnel lining. It also became apparent that <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> had leaked into the nearby River Roch, possibly creating explosive atmospheres in the nearby towns of Summit and Todmorden. Two hundred people were evacuated from their homes and workplaces in Walsden in response. They were allowed back home the next day.|$|E
5000|$|The North Queensland Herald {{described}} the Hotel as a symmetrical two-storied structure {{on the main}} thoroughfare from the railway. On the ground floor there was a bar with four parlours, hall entrances from both streets, an office, billiard room and dining room. It was framed with hardwood and silky oak chamfer boards and beneath the bar there was an extensive cellar with street access. The first storey contained 11 double bedrooms and four single rooms. A large sitting room featured a discreet private sitting room for ladies at {{the eastern end of}} the balcony. Guest amenities were provided by the three upstairs bathrooms. French lights, ornamental bracket scroll louvres and coloured glass panels with ornamental margin lights featured {{at the end of each}} hall. The Hotel was lighted throughout by aerogen gas; a pressurised mixture of air and <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour.</b> This method was described as being a [...] "novel system" [...] of lighting in the west.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} approach was {{that once a}} breach in the duty of care had been established, a defendant was liable for all the consequent damage no matter how unusual or unpredictable that damage might be. In Re Polemis while docked, workers employed to unload the ship negligently dropped a plank into the hold, which struck something, causing a spark that ignited <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> lying in the hold. The fire destroyed the whole ship. The Lords held that although the fire was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the plank falling, {{there had been a}} breach of the duty of care and all damage representing a direct consequence of the negligent act was recoverable. It was determined that once some harm was foreseeable, the defendant would be liable for {{the full extent of the}} harm. That particular consequences are possible does not make them reasonably foreseeable. This will particularly be the case when there are a significant number of links constituting the chain. The more links, the less likely that consequence may be considered reasonably foreseeable.|$|E
50|$|An {{isolated}} {{physical system}} may be inhomogeneous, or may be composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls. If an initially inhomogeneous physical system, without internal walls, is isolated by a thermodynamic operation, it will in general over time change its internal state. Or if it is composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls, it may change its state after a thermodynamic operation that changes its walls. Such changes may include change of temperature or spatial distribution of temperature, by changing the state of constituent materials. A rod of iron, initially prepared to be hot {{at one end and}} cold at the other, when isolated, will change so that its temperature becomes uniform all along its length; during the process, the rod is not in thermal equilibrium until its temperature is uniform. In a system prepared as a block of ice floating in a bath of hot water, and then isolated, the ice can melt; during the melting, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually its temperature will become uniform; the block of ice will not re-form. A system prepared as a mixture of <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> and air can be ignited by a spark and produce carbon dioxide and water; if this happens in an isolated system, it will increase the temperature of the system, and during the increase, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually the system will settle to a uniform temperature.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} petroleum exposure on the activity of hepatic mixed function oxidase enzymes, salivary elimination kinetics of antipyrine were determined in 19 petrol station attendants and compared with 19 controls. Antipyrine half life in petrol station attendants was shorter than in controls. Microsomal preparations (10 000 x g supernatants) were prepared from six male Porton rats exposed to <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> (5 ppm at an air flow rate of 41 /min for eight hours a day for three weeks) and six control rats maintained under the same conditions without exposure to <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour.</b> The rates of oxidative metabolism of antipyrine, aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, aniline, and benzo(a) pyrene were all increased by more than 45 % in the petrol-exposed rats.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was made of}} the potential of the TASER-X 26 ™ law enforcement electronic control device to ignite petrol vapours if used by an officer to incapacitate a person soaked in petrol, or within a flammable atmosphere containing <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour.</b> Bench scale tests have shown that a wooden mannequin with pig skin covering the chest was a suitable representation of a human target. Full scale tests using the mannequin have shown that the arc from a TASER-X 26 ™ is capable of igniting petrol/air vapours on a petrol-soaked person. Further tests in a 1 / 5 scale and a full scale compartment have shown that if a TASER is used within a compartment, a <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> explosion (deflagration) may be achieved.

40|$|In {{the complex}} {{hydrocarbon}} mixture in urban air, the alkenes and arenes {{are of particular}} interest with respect to impact on health and environment. Knowledge of hydrocarbon concentrations in urban air {{is essential for the}} assessment and prevention of health hazards and photochemical oxidant formation. Hydrocarbons in urban air were sampled on specially made triple-layer adsorbent cartridges. Easily carried equipment was used for the sampling. After thermal desorption, the hydrocarbons were analyzed by gas chromatography. An aluminium oxide column effected the separation of C 2 -C 6 alkenes. Detection was generally by flame ionization but optional photoionization detection was found to be advantageous for the selective detection of alkenes and alkadienes in the C 3 -C 5 region. A recently introduced technique based on differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) was compared with the gas chromatographic method for the determination of benzene and toluene in air. Proportions and exposure levels of hazardous hydrocarbons were determined in urban air. Ethene, propene, 1, 3 -butadiene and benzene made up approximately 5, 2, 0. 5 and 6 per cent by weight of non-methane hydrocarbons. The composition was different for cold-start and high-speed emissions. Among the four isomeric butenes, the 2 -butenes were prominent in <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> and methylpropene in exhaust. The composition of pentenes was similar in <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> and petrol exhaust. Concentrations of butadiene, reflecting outdoor urban exposure, were in the range of 0. 5 - 5 mg/m 3. The exposure of commuters to 22 volatile aromatic hydrocarbons of petrol exhaust was 5 - 10 times higher in cars than in trains. Generally, urban roadside concentrations of hydrocarbons decreased more than 10 -fold with increased distance from motor traffic...|$|E

40|$|Hydrocarbons in air were {{determined}} at pioneering European service stations equipped with vapour recovery systems. Vapour recovery was found capable of eliminating 99 % of exposure during refuelling and greater than 95 % of emissions to air. Vapour recovery {{is now being}} rapidly introduced at Swedish service stations {{as a result of}} demands concerning environmental and health hazards. The analytical technique used permitted samples corresponding to a single refuelling procedure to be analyzed. Sampling on an adsorbent tube was followed in the laboratory by thermal desorption and capillary gas chromatography. All prominent hydrocarbons were well separated on a methylsilicone phase. These include benzene and the alkenes of special interest with respect to health hazards. The particular importance of alkenes with respect to the formation of ozone and other photooxidants is discussed.

40|$|Samples {{of urban}} air {{hydrocarbons}} were taken on specifically made adsorbent cartridges and analysed by gas chromatography after thermal desorption. The four isomeric butenes and 1, 3 -butadiene were favourably resolved and {{separated from the}} abundant alkanes on an aluminium oxide PLOT column. The concentrations of butadiene, reflecting outdoor urban exposure, were {{in the range of}} 0. 5 - 5 micrograms/m 3. An approximate 1 : 4 ratio was observed between butadiene and propene which both originate predominantly from vehicle exhaust. The four butenes made up approximately 50 % of the propene concentration in exhaust-polluted air, with methylpropene greater than 1 -butene greater than trans- 2 -butene greater than cis- 2 -butene. <b>Petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> contributed less than exhaust but about five times more to the 2 -butenes than to methylpropene and 1 -butene.

40|$|A population-based-cross-sectional {{survey was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the potential risk of exposure to premium motor spirit (PMS) fumes in Calabar, Nigeria, among Automobile Mechanics (AM), Petrol Station Attendants (PSA) and the general population. Structured questionnaire was administered on the randomly chosen subjects to elicit information on their exposure to PMS. Duration of exposure was taken as the length of work in their various occupations. Venous blood was taken for methaemoglobin (MetHb) and packed cells volume (PCV). Mean MetHb value was higher in AM (7. 3 %) and PSA (5. 8 %) than in the subjects {{from the general population}} (2. 7 %). PCV was lower in PSA (30. 8 %), than AM (33. 3 %) and the subjects from the general population (40. 8 %). MetHb level was directly proportional, and PCV inversely related, to the duration of exposure. The study suggested increased exposure to petrol fumes among AM, PSA, and MetHb as a useful biomarker in determining the level of exposure to benzene in <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour.</b> Copyright © 2009 N.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the renal protective properties of aqueous leaf extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum from Nigeria against <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> – induced toxicity on the kidney of male albino rats. Fifty apparently healthy male albino rats aged 8 weeks and weighing between 165 g – 185 g were randomly divided into five groups of ten animals each. Group 1 served as control and were not treated with the plant extract or exposed to gasoline vapour. Group 2 served as negative control and were exposed to the gasoline vapour but not treated with the plant extract. Groups 3, 4 and 5 were treated with the plant extract at 20 mg/kg body weight, 40 mg/kg body weight, 60 mg/kg body weight respectively and exposed to the gasoline vapour for 5 hrs daily for 21 days. Results show that mean body weight of treated animals increased significantly (p≤ 0. 05) compared to negative control. Haematological parameters; PCV, Hb, Total bilirubin, WBC and RBC increased, while renal function biomarkers Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Cl- also increased in the treated animals compared to the negative control respectively.

40|$|Studies were {{performed}} {{on the effects of}} an experimental acute motor-car petrol (ethyl petrol 78) vapour intoxication on the circulatory system in rabbits. Some rabbits were kept for two hours in a specially constructed inhalation chamber in which they inhaled the air containing <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> of an average concentration of 310 mg/l. The recorded electrocardiogram showed a slowed-down heart rate, prolonged QT interval, disturbed repolarization period of the ventricles, and disturbed intraventricular conductivity. The statistically significant decrease in the sodium, potassium and magnesium levels found in the homogenates of the heart proves that the disturbances of the repolarization period of ventricles are due to electrolytic disturbances. Coexistant muscle lesion however cannot be excluded. A decrease in the histochemical activity of alkaline phosphatase in the heart muscle suggests the possibility of disturbances in the active transport. An increase in the ATP-ase reaction in the vessel endothelia of the heart muscle was also observed. A statistically significant decrease in at + a 2 globulins in the blood serum and an increase in the acid phosphatase caused most probably by its liberation from the tissue were also found as was a decrease in the activity of acid phosphatase in the heart muscle homogenates. Elektrokardiografsko ispitivanje kunića akutno otrovanih parama benzina pokazalo je ove promjene: usporenje srčane akcije, produženi P-Q interval, poremećenje vremena repolarizacije ventrikula i poremećenje intraventrikularne provodljivosti. U homogeniziranom tkivu srca nađeno je statistički značajno smanjenje natrija, kalija i magnezija.

40|$|During the {{delivery}} of unleaded petrol to a Snax service station on the Southend Arterial Road a small fire occurred in the manhole chamber containing the underground offset fill pipes. The manhole involved has four fill pipes and is constructed from GRP with a metal frame at the top. The pipes are plastic but have a metal transition fitting for connection to the tanker hose. When not in use the fittings have an aluminium cap with an o-ring seal in place. It is understood that {{the delivery}} driver had two hoses connected to the offset fill points and was delivering the product. One delivery had finished and he opened up the cap of the next fill point to commence delivery to that tank. He then went to place the cap on the pipe of the tank {{to which he had}} completed the first delivery when the ignition occurred. The fire was quickly extinguished and no one was hurt. Initially it was suspected that the probable cause of the ignition was static electricity igniting an uncommonly high concentration of <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour.</b> This is not an unreasonable assumption since the metal termination on the plastic pipe was ungrounded. In order for an ignition to occur at this point however there must be an electrostatic discharge between the cap and the termination fitting of sufficient energy to exceed the minimum ignition energy of the vapour mixture. Normally the caps made from aluminium are connected to the termination fitting by means of a short length of chain but in this case the chain was broken and consequently there was no electrical continuity between the fitting and the cap. It follows that electrostatic ignition would be reliant on either the fitting to be raised to high potential or the cap/delivery driver being raised to high potential...|$|E
40|$|Ambient air {{monitoring}} in {{the vicinity}} of three petrol service stations was undertaken to determine concentrations of three volatile organic compounds; benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). Quantitative measurements were undertaken using both diffusive and active sampling onto a solid adsorbent material followed by thermal desorption and a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) determination. Mean weekly BTX concentrations are reported for forecourt pumps, forecourt perimeter, roadside and background sampling locations over a four-week monitoring campaign. Diffusive sampling was performed using Chromosorb 106 and Tenax, and a high degree o f correlation was observed between the BTX concentrations measured using the two adsorbent materials. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test revealed {{no significant difference in the}} measured benzene concentrations, while the toluene and xylene levels differed significantly using the two adsorbent materials. The observed difference in the measured concentrations may be attributed to the lack of validation of the diffusive sampling rates for Tenax at environmental levels for one-week sampling periods. The observed rank order of BTX concentrations at the sampling locations was; forecourt pumps area > forecourt perimeter > roadside > background locations where mean BTX concentrations were 7. 3, 4. 5, 2. 2 and 0. 9 pg/m 3, respectively. The BTX concentrations measured at the forecourt pumps area of all three stations were approximately 5 to 15 times higher than the corresponding background levels. Concentrations measured in the forecourt pumps and perimeter areas were shown to be dependant on the scale of the service station and prevailing meteorological conditions. It is suggested that the volume of traffic is the predominant source of BTX measured at the roadside sampling locations. Mean background concentrations of BTX were approximately lpg/m 3. Ratios of measured BTX concentrations at forecourt pumps, forecourt perimeteT and roadside sampling locations were consistent with expected values. However, the BTX ratios at the background sampling location Station A seem to be influenced by an alternative source of xylene other than <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> or vehicular emissions. BTX concentrations measured at forecourt service areas in the current study were considerably lower than previous studies where levels of up to 187, 325 and 142 pg/m 3, respectively for BTX have been reported. Background concentrations were also shown to be lower than previously reported results, however, in the current study the background locations were sub-urban as opposed to the urban site selected for previous studies. Mean benzene concentrations at the forecourt pumps area were approximately 50...|$|E
