In the same year, Profs Lawrence Marks and Michael Kamins of the University of Southern California demonstrated that such effects were paradoxically optimised if claims made by the advertising were not hyperbolic, i.e. were true to life. In 1993, English adman John Bunyard, then at NW Ayer’s London office, demonstrated experimentally that systematic matching of the advertising's premise to actual experience created increments in purchasing {{that could not be}} explained by the additive effect of advertising and <b>product</b> <b>trial.</b> Bunyard proposed a new 'experiential' model whereby engineering trial of a product would take precedence over persuasive communications, and the experience itself would be psychologically optimized by accurately matching expectations set by advertising immediately beforehand.|$|E

However, studies have not fully understood and given only limited attention to the factors that foster members ’ prosocial behavior. The major objective {{of this study is}} the empirical investigation of the critical antecedents of citizenship behavior in virtual communities of consumption from the perspective of social exchange theory. Data were collected using a web-based survey from a well-known Taiwanese virtual community, Fashion Guide. The online survey yielded a total of 327 completed and valid questionnaires. To probe more deeply into whether citizenship behavior of a virtual community of consumption is influenced by <b>product</b> <b>trial,</b> two subsamples from <b>product</b> <b>trial</b> and non <b>product</b> <b>trial</b> members are compared. The study finds that social exchange theory helps foster citizenship behavior of the virtual community. In addition, analysis suggests that the influence strength of antecedents on citizenship behavior varies among Fashion Guide’s member types. The <b>product</b> <b>trial</b> members perceive a higher service quality and better social climate than the non <b>product</b> <b>trial</b> members, whereas the non <b>product</b> <b>trial</b> members perceive better information quality than the trial members.

40|$|Theory {{and past}} {{research}} suggests that greater levels of consumer involvement and product usage lead {{to higher levels of}} word of mouth (WOM). This paper presents some tests of hypotheses related to product usage and WOM, based on secondary consumer panel data from five fmcg <b>product</b> <b>trials.</b> The main findings are that brand usage range within a product category has a pervasive effect on pre-trial intentions to recommend the <b>trialled</b> <b>product,</b> as well as the actual number of WOM conversations generated by the trial and their effectiveness (the rate of attitudinal conversion based on interest generated). Frequency of product use only significantly affects the number of WOM conversations. Second, compared to non-users, being a loyal user of the <b>trialled</b> <b>product</b> (having used the brand more frequently than other brands) has a negative effect on WOM effectiveness, while non-loyal users' WOM is more effective compared to that of loyal users. The study thereby provides more evidence that loyal users are not necessarily the best targets of WOM marketing campaigns, and suggests that research on the interaction between involvement or product usage and loyalty in relation to firm-generated WOM may be an interesting area of further research...|$|R

The research shows that the process of new <b>product</b> <b>trial</b> might take some time for the consumer to adapt, since its still new and need enhancement of product knowledge to make it more consumer-friendly. Indonesia is a vast country comprising many islands with a lot of business opportunity that can be explored, especially towards its consumer buying behavior. In this era of Globalization, foreign brands have been doing their business and established their brands there. Therefore until now there are still new companies want to invest in Indonesia for strengthen their position and expand their market to Asia market. Focusing on expanding market, it also can be applied to German hair product company BERRYWELL®. BERRYWELL® is brand of TITANIA Fabrik GmbH, a company with its headquarter in Wülfrath, Germany.
