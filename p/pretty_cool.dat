IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system, calling it <b>pretty</b> <b>cool,</b> as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add [...] "a new strategy to the game", but Stahl called the system [...] "terribly lame".

Close to the red-brick lodge his two children, Kate and Harry, ran out from under the acacia trees, and waved to him, scrambling bare-legged on to the low, red, ivy-covered wall which guarded his domain of eleven acres. Mr. Bosengate waved back, thinking: 'Jolly couple--by Jove, they are!' Above their heads, through the trees, he could see right away to some Downs, faint in the July heat haze.

500|$|The {{strike was}} the harbinger of the 1995 {{season for the}} Yankees. Although the Red Sox jumped out to a fast start and {{finished}} the season in first place, the Yankees were not serious contenders for the division title. With the Yankees clinching the inaugural American League Wild Card {{on the last day}} of the season, the Yankees and Red Sox reached the post-season in the same season for the first time. Before the postseason began, Mattingly contemplated about the first-ever playoff series in the rivalry, saying, [...] "That would be <b>pretty</b> <b>cool.</b> It wouldn't hurt the rivalry any. There'd be a few deaths...just kidding". Both teams lost in separate ALDS series, with the Red Sox being swept by the Cleveland Indians and the Yankees losing in five games to the Seattle Mariners. For the Yankees, the loss led to another post-strike fallout: both Showalter and general manager Gene Michael were fired as a result of the loss. Similarly, the firing of Michael as Yankees manager and the loss in the 1981 World Series were fallouts from the strike that year. In fact, the 1981 strike was antecedence to the Yankees' demise and downfall of the 1980s and 1990s and the strike in 1994 was part of that demise.|$|E

[...] "Vegetables" [...] was reworked {{as a kind of}} campfire song, [...] "Wonderful" [...] traded its harpsichord, strings, and horns with a haphazardly-played organ, high-pitched backing vocals, and a doo-wop sing-along section, and the marimbas in [...] "Wind Chimes" [...] were replaced by organ and dissonant noise. The only songs not explicitly taken from Smile are [...] "Little Pad" [...] and [...] "Gettin' Hungry". Other tracks took elements of Smile era compositions to make something slightly different; [...] "She's Goin' Bald" [...] borrows the verse melody from a Smile fragment known as [...] "He Gives Speeches", [...] "With Me Tonight" [...] is a variation on [...] "Vegetables", and [...] "Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W.

The feature of having two riders per kart was praised by Justin Leeper and Andy McNamara of Game Informer; McNamara stated: [...] "Giving the player control of two different characters is <b>pretty</b> <b>cool</b> in single-player, but add a friend {{on the back of}} your kart in multiplayer and it opens the game up like never before." [...] GameSpy called Double Dash!! a [...] "great-looking, great-playing game that most gamers will instantly warm to."

500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason why I was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is <b>pretty</b> <b>cool,</b> I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E
