2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser <b>pipe</b> <b>gallery</b> and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E

5000|$|The inaugural {{exhibition}} of Excessivism {{took place in}} LA Artcore Brewery Annex gallery with the title [...] "Excessivist Initiative". And the Excessivism Manifesto was published in Downtown News weekly in September 2015. According to an art critic Shana Nys Dambrot the idea was conceived in the studio of the founder based on his personal realizations of his relationship as a consumer with the capitalist environment. [...] Excessivism {{was introduced to the}} Los Angeles art scene in November 2014 in the Red <b>Pipe</b> <b>gallery</b> in an exhibition titled Excess The New Norm.

50|$|The chancel {{furnishings}} are sparse and modern. On {{the south}} side of the chancel, the bishop's throne is a simple, substantial wooden chair, surmounted by a banner. The cathedral is sometimes the venue for musical concerts.The main organ was built and installed by Hele & Co of Plymouth in 1908 at a cost of £950. However, despite a comprehensive refurbishment this organ is no longer used mainly because of asbestos being found in the organ <b>pipe</b> <b>gallery.</b> The Allen organ currently used in the cathedral originally belonged to the noted organist Carlo Curley and was obtained in 2014 after his death. The wooden screens to the two side chapels were carved by Robert 'Mouse' Thompson with each displaying his characteristic mouse.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this task is to {{evaluate}} the effect of floor settlement on building structure, piping, and equipment foundations between column lines 1 and 2 and B and K of Bldg. K- 311 - 1 (see Fig. A- 1 in Appendix A) at East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Revision 0 of this document covers the 2005 annual inspection. Revision 1 addresses the 2006 annual inspection, Revision 2 addresses the 2007 annual inspection, and Revision 3 covers the 2008 annual inspection, {{as indicated by the}} changed report title. A civil survey and visual inspection were performed. Only a representative number of points were measured during the 2008 survey. The exact location of a number of survey points in Table A- 1 could not be accurately determined in the 2008 survey since these points had not been spray painted since 2003. The points measured are deemed adequate to support the conclusions of this report. Based on the survey and observations, there has been no appreciable change in the condition of the unit since the 2007 inspection. The subsidence of the floor presents concerns to the building structure due to the possible indeterminate load on the <b>pipe</b> <b>gallery</b> framing. Prior to demolition activities that involve the piping or removal of the equipment, such as vent, purge and drain and foaming, engineering involvement in the planning is necessary. The piping connected to the equipment is under stress, and actions should be implemented to relieve this stress prior to disturbing any of the equipment or associated piping. In addition, the load on the <b>pipe</b> <b>gallery</b> framing needs to be relieved prior to any activities taking place in the <b>pipe</b> <b>gallery.</b> Access to this area and the <b>pipe</b> <b>gallery</b> is not allowed until the stress is released...|$|E

25|$|The Rigole de la plaine carries {{water from}} the Sor tapped from an offtake at Pont Crouzet for {{irrigation}} before emptying into the Canal du Midi. In addition individual samples are collected from the water on the area between Revel and the seuil de Naurouze. In 1980 the Lac de la Ganguise was built near Castelnaudary providing a water reserve of 22 million m3. In 2005 the dam was raised to reach a capacity of 44 million cubic metres. Near the old basin of Naurouze the Naurouze pumping station helps to regulate {{the water in the}} Canal du Midi and the lake. An underground <b>pipe,</b> the <b>gallery</b> of Mandore, provides the Naurouze with additional {{water from the}} Rigole de la plaine to Lake Ganguise. Conversely, during the dry season, Lake Ganguise can supply the Canal du Midi if the water supply of the Rigole de la plaine is not enough.|$|R
2500|$|A {{prominently}} placed shepherd on {{the left}} side of the group is shown playing his bagpipes. Though the shepherds sometimes carry musical instruments, often including <b>pipes</b> (see <b>gallery</b> below), they are less often shown playing them at this solemn moment, as opposed to the earlier scene of the Annunciation to the Shepherds where an angel appears to them with their flocks. [...] If music is shown being performed beside the crib it is more often by angels. [...] A charming but atypical miniature in the 15th-century Flemish La Flora Hours in Naples shows a shepherd playing his bagpipes as his two companions dance for the infant Jesus and a delighted Virgin Mary sits to one side. [...] Outside his painting, Domeninchino had a serious interest in musical instruments and their design, which his paintings sometimes reflect. He designed and himself constructed instruments intended to be suitable for playing ancient music.|$|R

The concept art for the game's environments was mainly created by Naughty Dog {{employees}} Bob Rafei, Eric Iwasaki, Erick Pangilinan, Charlotte Francis and Jason Rubin. The jungle levels were originally to have featured ground fog, but this was abandoned when magazines and the public began to criticize other developers for using fog to hide polygon count. Sunlight and depth accentuation was experimented with for these levels. Naughty Dog created the sewer levels as a way to work some [...] "dirty" [...] locations in the game.

6000|$|At {{the strike}} of the gong Rivera sensed {{something}} impending. The house did not. Whatever {{it was it}} was there inside the ring with him and very close. Danny's earlier surety seemed returned to him. The confidence of his advance frightened Rivera. Some trick was about to be worked. Danny rushed, but Rivera refused the encounter. He side-stepped away into safety. What the other wanted was a clinch. It was in some way necessary to the trick. Rivera backed and circled away, yet he knew, sooner or later, the clinch and the trick would come. Desperately he resolved to draw it. He made as if to effect the clinch with Danny's next rush. Instead, at the last instant, just as their bodies should have come together, Rivera darted nimbly back. And in the same instant Danny's corner raised a cry of foul. Rivera had fooled them. The referee paused irresolutely. The decision that trembled on his lips was never uttered, for a shrill, boy's voice from the <b>gallery</b> <b>piped,</b> [...] "Raw work!" ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} surface flow {{visualization}} {{for use in}} cryogenic wind tunnels is described which requires injection of a cryogenic liquid onto the model while the tunnel is running. This necessitates {{the use of a}} substance that remains liquid over a large range of cryogenic wind tunnel operating temperatures. It is found that propane (C 3 H 8) is a suitable substance. Experiments are conducted in a subsonic cryogenic wind tunnel to assess the practical application of liquid propane flow visualization. The propane is stored in a chamber cooled by liquid nitrogen and when required is pumped through <b>pipes</b> to a <b>gallery</b> inside the model and then out onto the surface through small holes. To color the liquid a suspension of pigment particles is used. Propane is supplied to the cooled chamber in gaseous form from a standard liquefied gas cylinder. The sequence of events is illustrated on a propane temperature-entropy diagram. The use of liquefied propane for flow visualization in a cryogenic tunnel operating at pressures up to 40 atm appears to be feasible. Illustrative examples are provided...|$|R
60|$|The miller {{altered the}} {{appearance}} of the mill as little as possible. The big overshot-wheel was left in its place. The young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood. The dam was partly destroyed, and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed. Inside the mill the changes were greater. The shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were, of course, all removed. There were two rows of benches with aisles between, and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end. On three sides overhead was a gallery containing seats, and reached by a stairway inside. There was also an organ--a real <b>pipe</b> organ--in the <b>gallery,</b> that was the pride of the congregation of the Old Mill Church. Miss Phoebe Summers was the organist. The Lakelands boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each Sunday's service. The Rev. Mr. Banbridge was the preacher, and rode down from Squirrel Gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service. And Abram Strong paid for everything. He paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year; and Miss Phoebe two hundred dollars.|$|R
