50|$|The {{green wood}} hoopoe (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> is a large, up to 44 cm long, near-passerine {{tropical}} bird native to Africa. It {{is a member}} of the family Phoeniculidae, the wood hoopoes, and was formerly known as the red-billed wood hoopoe.|$|E
50|$|Acorn {{woodpeckers}} (Melanerpes formicivorus) {{are known}} to form communal roosts during the winter months. In these roosts two to three individuals will share a cavity during the winter. Within these tree cavities woodpeckers share their body heat {{with each other and}} therefore decrease the thermoregulatory demands on the individuals within the roost. Small scale communal roosting during the winter months has also been observed in Green Woodhoopoes (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus).</b> Winter communal roosts in these species typically contain around five individuals.|$|E
50|$|The black-billed wood hoopoe is {{very similar}} to the green wood hoopoe (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> in appearance, but lacks the greenish gloss on head and mantle and has a black beak rather than a red one, though there is {{sometimes}} a reddish tinge {{at the base of the}} beak. The sexes are similar and the adult bird is about 37 cm long. The plumage is generally black with a bluish or purplish gloss, and a row of white spots on the flight feathers giving a white bar on the wings in flight. The long, graduated tail has white spots at the edge.|$|E

40|$|Cooperatively {{breeding}} {{groups may}} be constrained in size by the territory available to them, or territories may {{be expanded to}} accommodate extra group members. Here, we show {{that there was no}} relationship between the number of adult green woodhoopoes <b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus</b> in a group and the size of its territory. Furthermore, territories were remarkably stable between seasons, with no significant changes in area, despite fluctuating group sizes. These results suggest that food was not limiting at the group sizes found in this study: sufficient resources were available within existing territories for groups that were expanding in size. Following an increase in group membership, a larger proportion of the available area was utilised. Groups also used a larger area in the non-breeding season compared to when breeding: in the latter instance, foraging was concentrated {{in the vicinity of the}} nest...|$|E
40|$|Groups {{of human}} {{soldiers}} increase their affiliative behaviour when moving into combat zones. Despite numerous other species also competing as groups, {{little is known}} about how potential intergroup conflict might influence current intragroup affiliative behaviour in non-human animals. Here, I show that allopreening (when one individual preens another) increases in groups of cooperatively breeding green woodhoopoes (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> when they enter areas where conflicts with neighbours are more likely. Self-preening, which is an indicator of stress in other species, did not increase in conflict areas, suggesting that the change in affiliative behaviour is not the simple consequence of greater stress. Instead, because it is the dominant breeding pair that increase their preening of subordinate helpers, it is possible that current affiliative behaviour is being exchanged for agonistic support in any intergroup conflicts that might ensue. These results are important for our understanding of group dynamics, cooperation and the evolution of sociality, but also bring to mind the intriguing possibilities of social contracts and future planning in birds...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{many social}} species, {{aggressive}} conflict between {{individuals in the}} same group (intragroup conflict) is often followed by increased allogrooming (when one individual grooms another) involving the protagonists and their relatives [1, 2]. Although conflict between groups (intergroup conflict) is also common (see [3]), {{there has been little}} consideration of its impact on intragroup affiliative behaviour (see [4] for an exception). Moreover, there has been no investigation of whether the different threat posed by different rival groups (for example, neighbours and strangers [5]) influences the level of subsequent affiliative behaviour. Experiments using playbacks to simulate territorial intrusions by green woodhoopoes (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus),</b> reported here, show that intragroup allopreening — the avian equivalent of allogrooming — increases significantly in response to strange groups, but not neighbouring groups, and that the increase is due to more allopreening of subordinate helpers by the dominant pair. This is the first experimental evidence for an influence of intergroup conflict on intragroup affiliative behaviour, and lends support to the recent idea that intragroup cooperation should increase most when the intergroup threat is highest [6]...|$|E
40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes and}} sexual {{differences}} in the acoustic structure of green woodhoopoe (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> ‘kek ’ calls were investigated in a wild population. At fledging, the calls {{of males and females}} were indistinguishable in terms of fundamental frequency, frequency modulation, peak frequency and call duration. After 3 - 5 months, however, the male voice ‘broke ’ (i. e. underwent a significant decrease in fundamental frequency), while there was no change in female call structure. Consequently, the fundamental frequency of adult male calls was 48 % lower than that of adult females, and there was no overlap in the call frequencies of the sexes in adulthood. The change in male voice occurred within a 2 - 3 week period and no intermediate call frequencies were recorded. The timing of the voice break did not correspond with a change in overall body size, suggesting that growth of the syrinx was not the proximate cause. However, it did coincide with the stage in development when male bill length grew to exceed that of all females and when males began to lose their distinctive brown throat patch, providing some indirect evidence that hormonal control may be important. 1...|$|E
40|$|Group {{displays}} involving vocal choruses are {{a prominent}} feature of many avian cooperative-breeding systems. The existence of group-specific vocal signatures within these choruses could assist territory owners when assessing {{the threat posed}} by different intruding groups. To investigate the possible presence of such signatures, I examined the choruses (‘rallies’) given by 22 green woodhoopoe, <b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus,</b> groups over two consecutive seasons. A rally involved the combined cackling of adult group members. Statistical analysis of midrally vocalizations, when all group members were calling, revealed that samples from the same group clustered in principal coordinate space, and the group clusters segregated from each other to a significant degree. This segregation might theoretically arise from differences in group size and sex ratio, especially since the vocalizations are sexually dimorphic. However, groups containing the same numbers of males and females had rallies that were significantly different acoustically. Groups that maintained the same composition of individuals produced acoustically similar rallies across seasons, while those that changed membership produced significantly different rallies. The group signature is therefore most likely to result from group members producing their own individual vocal programmes, but participating in a similar way for every rally. In a playback experiment, groups responded significantly more rapidly to strangers and to neighbours on the wrong boundary than t...|$|E
40|$|Theoreticians {{have long}} {{suggested}} {{that the amount of}} intergroup conflict in which a group is involved could influence the level of cooperation or affiliation displayed by its members. Despite the prevalence of intergroup conflicts in many social animal species, however, few empirical studies have investigated this potential link. Here, I show that intragroup allopreening rates are highest in green woodhoopoe (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> groups that have the greatest involvement in intergroup conflict. One reason for this relationship is a post-conflict increase in allopreening, and I demonstrate {{for the first time that}} both conflict duration and outcome influence subsequent allopreening rates: group members allopreened more following long conflicts and those they lost compared with short conflicts and those they won, perhaps because the former are more stressful. The increase in affiliative behaviour was the result of more allopreening of subordinate helpers by the dominant breeding pair, which may be because the breeders are trying to encourage helpers to participate in future conflicts; relative group size influences conflict outcome and helpers contribute more to conflicts than do the breeding pair. These results emphasize that our understanding of cooperation and group dynamics can be enhanced by investigations of how intergroup interactions affect intragroup processes...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{frequently}} use metabolites {{produced by}} symbiotic bacteria as agents against pathogens and parasites. Secretions from the preen gland of birds {{are used for}} this purpose, although its chemicals apparently are produced by the birds themselves. European hoopoes Upupa epops and green woodhoopoes <b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus</b> harbour symbiotic bacteria in the uropygial gland that might be {{partly responsible for the}} chemical composition of secretions. Here we investigate the antimicrobial activity of the volatile fraction of chemicals in hoopoe preen secretions, and, by means of experimental antibiotic injections, test whether symbiotic bacteria living within the uropygial gland are responsible for their production. Hoopoes produce two different kinds of secretions that differ drastically in their chemical composition. While the malodorous dark secretions produced by nestlings included a complex mix of volatiles, these chemicals did not appear in white secretions produced by non-nesting birds. All volatiles detected showed strong antibacterial activity, and a mixture of the chemicals at the concentrations measured in nestling glands inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains assayed. We found support for the hypothesized role of bacteria in the production of such antimicrobial chemicals because experimental clearance of bacteria from glands of nestlings with antibiotics resulted in secretions without most of the volatiles detected in control individuals. Thus, the presence of symbiotic bacteria in the uropygial gland provides hoopoes with potent antimicrobials for topical use...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Allopreening is a {{widespread}} but little-studied phenomenon in birds and is particularly prevalent in species where individuals are forced into close proximity. Such a situation facilitates the transfer of ectoparasites between individuals and allopreening has therefore been proposed to serve a hygienic function. In addition, allopreening might theoretically {{play a role in}} social communication. Green woodhoopoes (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> are cooperatively breeding birds that roost communally every night in a tree cavity and are thus susceptible to high ectoparasite loads. Our results suggest that allopreening {{of the head and neck}} (Bhead^), which cannot be efficiently self-preened, serves a primarily hygienic function: all individuals, irrespective of sex, dominance status, and group size, donated and received similar rates of head allopreening and terminated a similar proportion of bouts in which they were involved. Furthermore, there was a high occurrence of reciprocation and head allopreening occurred at a constant rate through-out the year. In contrast, allopreening of the rest of the body, which is accessible to the recipient itself, is likely to serve a primarily social function: body allopreening rates were higher in larger groups; dominant individuals received more body allopreening and terminated a significantly higher proportion of bouts than subordinates; and subordinates donated body allopreening at a higher rate than dominants. Moreover, bouts initiated by dominants were more likely to be reciprocated than those initiated by subordinates and body allopreening rates varied seasonally. Allopreening in the green woodhoopoe is therefore likely to serve a dual function, depending on the part of the body involved...|$|E
40|$|SummaryConflict {{between groups}} (intergroup conflict) {{is common in}} many social species [1 – 4] and is widely {{discussed}} as an evolutionary driver of within-group dynamics and social structure [2, 5]. However, empirical studies investigating the impacts of intergroup conflict {{have focused on the}} immediate aftermath [6 – 9], when behavioral changes may be the direct result of elevated stress levels [7] or territorial exclusions [9]. Demonstrations of longer-term effects, with behavioral changes persisting once increases in stress have diminished and full access to resources is again possible, would support proposed links to individual fitness and social evolution. Here we show that conflicts between neighboring groups of cooperatively breeding green woodhoopoes (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> have a lasting influence on decisions concerning roost cavities, a limiting resource vital for survival and breeding. Groups involved in extended conflicts in the morning were more likely to return to the zone of conflict that evening, roosting closer to territorial borders, than when intergroup interactions were short or did not occur. Extended morning conflicts also increased the likelihood that groupmates roosted together and preened one another at the roost, suggesting that intergroup conflict promotes consensus decision-making, social bonding, and group cohesion. Border roost use and allopreening increased more following conflicts that were lost rather than won. By demonstrating that both the intensity and outcome of intergroup interactions affect resource defense and associated within-group behavior many hours later, our results begin {{to bridge the gap between}} the immediate impacts of intergroup conflict and its role in social evolution...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn cooperatively {{breeding}} species, {{many individuals}} only start breeding long after reaching physiological maturity [1], and this delay {{is expected to}} reduce lifetime reproductive success (LRS) [1 – 3]. Although many studies have investigated how nonbreeding helpers might mitigate the assumed cost of delayed breeding (reviewed in [3]), few have directly quantified the cost itself [4, 5] (but see [6, 7]). Moreover, although life-history tradeoffs frequently influence the sexes in profoundly different ways [8, 9], it has been generally assumed that males and females are similarly affected by a delayed start to breeding [7]. Here, we use 24 years of data to investigate the sex-specific cost of delayed breeding in the cooperatively breeding green woodhoopoe (<b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus)</b> and show that age at first breeding is related to LRS differently in males and females. As is traditionally expected, males that started to breed earlier in life had greater LRS than those that started later. However, females showed the opposite pattern: Those individuals that started to breed later in life actually had greater LRS than those that started earlier. In both sexes, the association between age at first breeding and LRS was driven by differences in breeding-career length, rather than per-season productivity. We hypothesize that the high mortality rate of young female breeders, and thus their short breeding careers, is related to a reduced {{ability to deal with}} the high physiological costs of reproduction in this species. These results demonstrate the importance of considering sex-specific reproductive costs when estimating the payoffs of life-history decisions and bring into question the long-held assumption that delayed breeding is necessarily costly...|$|E
40|$|Red-billed Woodhoopoes, <b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus,</b> {{produce a}} pungent smelling {{secretion}} from their uropygial gland. Previous researchers have noted this odour {{and there has}} been much speculation on its function. This encouraged me to undertake this study to determine the origin of the odour and the role that the secretion plays. The chemical analysis of this secretion shows that it consists of 17 compounds including acids, aldehydes, lactones and other miscellaneous compounds. Cultures of the secretion showed the presence of a symbiotic bacterium resident within the gland. Antibiotic treatment of the gland suggested that this bacterium was instrumental in the synthesis of the secretion of P. purpureus. This bacterium has not previously been identified and has been proposed as 'Enterococcus phoeniculicola' (GenBank accession number: AYO 28437). The secretion was synthesized and the responses of a range of 13 pathogenic and one parasitic bacteria were tested against it and its individual constituent compounds. The synthetic secretion and seven of its constituent compounds inhibited the growth of these bacteria. However, exposing feather mites resident upon the birds to the synthetic secretion did not illicit any significant response from these mites. Wanless (1998) showed that the synthetic secretion causes an averse reaction in cats. In this study I was able to identify indole, phenol and propionaldehyde as being responsible for eliciting this reaction in cats. A similar averse reaction is shown by Rock Monitor Lizards, Varanus albigularis, upon encountering mice tainted with the synthetic secretion. This is the first demonstration of a symbiotic relationship between birds and bacteria in which the modification of the birds' uropygial oils affords the birds some protection against pathogens and preators...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographies. A {{study was}} made of two Redbilled (Green) Woodhoopoe <b>Phoeniculus</b> <b>purpureus</b> populations {{spanning}} an eight year period (1981 - 1988) and 258 'flock-years', in the eastern Cape Province of South Mrica. The main objectives {{of the study were}} to investigate (1) why woodhoopoes live in groups; (2) why nonbreeders do not breed; and, (3) why nonbreeders provision young that are not their own? Ecological and demographic data were gathered in addition to detailed behavioural observations of 54 woodhoopoe flocks. The following experimental manipulations were performed: (1) breeders were removed from flocks to (a) monitor dispersal patterns and restructuring of flocks; and, (b) observe behavioural reactions by remaining birds; (2) cavity availability was (a) decreased, to enable quantification of availability; and, (b) increased, by addition of nest/roost boxes to an area which supported no permanent woodhoopoe territories; and, (3) stimuli, associated with the food provisioning response of adult birds, were manipulated to investigate the evolutionary basis of allofeeding behaviour Variability in social and reproductive behaviour reflects environmental selection pressures, in the form of roost-cavity availability, with a reduction in cavity availability leading to increased group size. The group-territorial social system and high level of inbreeding of Redbilled Woodhoopoes have evolved primarily in response to environmental constraints on dispersal, rather than by particular benefits that arise from group living. Therefore, the habitat-saturation hypothesis best explains group living of woodhoopoes. Behavioural dominance hierarchies ensure that dominance relationships are well-defined among potential competitors (for breeding status), and thereby minimize disruption to flock cohesion upon the death (or removal) of a breeder. If competition for a breeding vacancy arose {{at the time of the}} breeder's death, the resultant delay in occupancy of the breeding vacancy would increase the likelihood of competition from unrelated birds. The establishment of such hierarchies is therefore adaptive in the context of the direct component of kin selection. The presence of nonbreeding helpers do not increase fledgling success, breeding frequency, survivorship (of any age, sex or social class), or number of breeder-offspring produced. Because no unambiguous indirect fitness benefits could be shown to result from helping behaviour (specifically allofeeding), I propose that the unselected (misdirected parental care) hypothesis is a viable alternative to the 'functional hypotheses. ' This hypothesis is supported by observations/manipulations of misdirected food provisioning by both breeders and helpers...|$|E
