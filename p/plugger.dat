25|$|Successive {{generations of}} the Remick family made major {{contributions}} {{to the growth of}} their adopted country. Jerry’s grandfather, the original Jerome Hosmer Remick, was a famous music publisher and businessman in the late 19th century – early 20th century Detroit. His grandfather's company was one of the leading Tin Pan Alley publishing houses. The legendary George Gershwin worked as a song <b>plugger</b> for Jerome H. Remick in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and {{composition}} with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell and Joseph Brody. He {{began his career}} as a song <b>plugger,</b> but soon started composing Broadway theatre works with his brother Ira Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, who refused him, where he began to compose An American in Paris. After returning to New York City, he wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and the author DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure, Porgy and Bess is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|By age 14, Fred {{had taken}} on the musical {{responsibilities}} for their act. He first met George Gershwin, who {{was working as a}} song <b>plugger</b> for Jerome H. Remick's music publishing company, in 1916. Fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists. Astaire was {{always on the lookout for}} new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless quest for novelty and perfection. The Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with Over the Top, a patriotic revue, and performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time as well.|$|E
50|$|Even before World War II {{it became}} a center of {{activity}} for the popular music industry, especially music publishing and songwriting. Scores of music publishers had offices in the Brill Building. Once songs had been published, the publishers sent song <b>pluggers</b> to the popular bands and radio stations. These song <b>pluggers</b> would sing and/or play the song for the band leaders to encourage bands to play their music.|$|R
50|$|One of MacNelly's {{friends and}} colleagues at the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Gary Brookins, had {{assisted}} MacNelly in filling in doing finish work. Brookins was a fan of <b>Pluggers</b> and could replicate MacNelly's style. Exhausted after his son's death, MacNelly gave the strip to Brookins to take over in early 1997. <b>Pluggers</b> is still being produced by Brookins and is syndicated in more than 60 newspapers in the United States.|$|R

25|$|Former Hawthorn player Rodney Eade {{took over}} the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into a {{competitive}} force. The Swans ended the minor round {{on top of the}} premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after <b>Plugger</b> Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to , which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the MCG.|$|E
500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} <b>plugger</b> James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{rationale}} {{of this in}} vivo {{study was}} to evaluate and compare different obturation techniques for the intracanal conveyance of Endoflas in the primary molars using conventional radiography. Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight children (4 – 9 years old) with total of 45 pulpally infected primary mandibular molars indicated for pulpectomy were categorized into three groups (i) endodontic <b>pluggers,</b> (ii) lentulospirals, and (iii) NaviTips, respectively, for obturation with Endoflas. The level of obturation {{and the presence of}} voids were evaluated radiographically, and the obtained data were statistically analyzed using Chi-square test. Results: The results showed {{no significant difference between the}} three techniques to deliver Endoflas. Motor-driven lentulospirals showed better results (64. 4 % optimal fillings) compared to the <b>pluggers</b> (62. 2 %), but NaviTips showed poor results (48. 9 %) for the level of obturation (P > 0. 05). Voids were observed in all the techniques used. <b>Pluggers</b> and lentulospirals showed similar results with greater void-free canals, whereas NaviTip system showed more voids which was statistically not significant (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Motor-driven lentulospiral and <b>pluggers</b> were almost equally efficient to fill Endoflas to an optimal level, devoid of voids, and both were considered better compared to NaviTip system...|$|R

2500|$|... "Song pluggers" [...] were pianists {{and singers}} who {{represented}} the music publishers, making their living demonstrating songs to promote sales of sheet music. Most music stores had song <b>pluggers</b> on staff. Other <b>pluggers</b> were employed by the publishers to travel and familiarize the public with their new publications. Among the ranks of song <b>pluggers</b> were George Gershwin, Harry Warren, Vincent Youmans and Al Sherman. A more aggressive form of song plugging was known as [...] "booming": it meant buying dozens of tickets for shows, infiltrating the audience and then singing the song to be plugged. At Shapiro Bernstein, Louis Bernstein recalled taking his plugging crew to cycle races at Madison Square Garden: [...] "They had 20,000 people there, we had a pianist and a singer with a large horn. We'd sing a song to them thirty times a night. They'd cheer and yell, and we kept pounding away at them. When people walked out, they'd be singing the song. They couldn't help it." ...|$|R

"Satan Wears a Satin Gown" [...] is the {{prototype}} of another recurring motif in Laine's oeuvre, the [...] "Lorelei" [...] or [...] "Jezebel" [...] song (both {{of which would be}} the titles of later Laine records). The song, which has a loosely structured melody that switches in tone and rhythm throughout, was pitched to Laine by a young song <b>plugger,</b> Tony Benedetto, who would later go on to achieve success as Tony Bennett. Laine recognized the younger singer's talent, and gave him encouragement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, {{he worked in}} public {{relations}} and as a song <b>plugger,</b> helping to promote tunes like Bob Merrill's [...] "How Much Is That Doggie In The Window." [...] From there, {{he worked as a}} radio producer and co-host at WMCA (and briefly thereafter at WMGM), [...] working with personalities such as Laraine Day on the late night interview program [...] "Day At Night" [...] and with Eva Gabor. At the same time, he was doing promotion for several baseball players, including Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays, and his radio beginnings may be attributable to his connection with the New York Giants, whose manager, Leo Durocher, was the husband of Laraine Day. His work on those shows earned him his own late-night show that often featured his wife as co-host, as was popular at the time. [...] For a while in the 1950s he was president of the National Conference of Disk Jockeys.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plugger</b> is a 4x4 {{off-road}} vehicle, or [...] "mud-plugger". <b>Plugger</b> is {{the most}} laid-back character at Silver Hatch and he never gets rushed or panic-stricken. In the UK version, he speaks with a soft Caribbean accent; in the US version, he speaks in a mild Southern drawl. He often uses his telescopic winch to rescue Roary and Maxi from mud, gravel, or sand. <b>Plugger</b> can often be heard uttering his catchphrase [...] "No need to race, Plugger's on the case!". He {{is also known as}} Lugga.|$|E

40|$|Several {{different}} {{techniques for}} placing calcium hydroxide into root canals have been proposed, such as amalgam carriers, vertical <b>pluggers,</b> McSpadden compactors, Lentulo drills, files and special syringes. Because correct filling {{of the root}} canal is necessary for calcium hydroxide paste to act effectively, {{the aim of this}} research was to study different techniques of root canal filling with calcium hydroxide pastes in dog teeth. The placement of calcium hydroxide with a file, absorbent paper points and vertical <b>pluggers</b> presented the lowest number of empty spaces in the three thirds of the root canal, followed by the Lentulo drill and the McSpadden compactor.

In {{the summer of}} 1955, he was employed as a song <b>plugger</b> by pop music publisher Dave Toff, who, Shaper said, discouraged him from writing lyrics, stating [...] "there was no future in the business for writers". Shaper was then persuaded to move to Robbins Music by Alan Holmes, leaving {{his job as a}} <b>plugger</b> in August 1958. In Robbins Music, a higher quality acclaimed label, he began writing songs under the mentorship of Alan Holmes and Joy Connock, marking the beginning of his writing career.|$|E

50|$|A song <b>plugger</b> or song {{demonstrator}} was a vocalist or {{piano player}} employed by department and music stores and song publishers {{in the early}} 20th century to promote and help sell new sheet music, which is how hits were advertised before quality recordings were widely available. Music publisher Frank Harding has been credited with innovating the sales method. Typically, the pianist sat on the mezzanine level of a store and played whatever music was sent up {{to him by the}} clerk of the store selling the sheet music.
