Nesse processo, as narrativas que percorrem o trabalho artístico, se intensificam e se reinventam no instante presente da produção poética. Esta pesquisa tem como pressuposto básico problematizar a prática teatral a partir dos conceitos de memória e micropercepção, através da intervenção de três catalisadores, quais sejam, os acasos, os afetos e os <b>punctums.</b> A reflexão teórica é acompanhada pelo recorte de algumas pedagogias direcionadas ao trabalho do ator, como os métodos interpretativos de Constantin Stanislavski, Jerzy Grotowski e da investigação prática da autora junto ao Grupo Matula Teatro, Campinas/SP, desde 2000. Abstract: The {{territory}} of the actor creation is a reservoir of experiences in continuos flow. In this process, the narratives that run through the artwork, intensify and reinvent themselves in the present moment of the poetic production. This research wishes to discuss the theater practice from the concepts of memory and microperception, through the intervention of three catalysts, namely, the "accidents", the affections and the <b>punctums.</b> The theoretical discussion is accompanied by some pedagogies focused {{on the work of}} the actor, as the interpretative methods of Constantin Stanislavski, Jerzy Grotowski and the practical research of the author with the Group Theatre Matula, Campinas / SP, since 2000...|$|R
40|$|A full-term {{baby girl}} {{weighing}} 2. 9 kg was born by normal delivery. The anomaly scan at 20 weeks (including a 3 D facial scan) was normal. She {{was born in}} good condition, but was noticed to have bilateral purple-coloured tense mobile, non-pulsatile masses below the medial canthus (figure 1). At 6 h of age, she had a cyanotic episode with airway obstruction soon after feeding. She underwent resuscita-tion, during which a naso-gastric tube was passed through each nostril, excluding choanal atresia. An ultra-sound scan confirmed bilateral cystic enlargement of the lacrimal ducts (14 mm), with some debris present. A diag-nosis of bilateral congenital dacryocystocele was made. Probing both cysts under local anaesthetic through the lacrimal <b>punctums</b> resulted in the release of mucoi...|$|R
25|$|The pressus is a {{compound}} neume, usually involving an initial neume {{followed by an}} oriscus and a <b>punctum.</b> The initial neume may be a virga ({{in which case the}} virga + oriscus may be together called a virga strata), in which case the pressus indicates three notes; if the initial neume is a pes, then the compound indicates a four-note group. Just as with the oriscus itself, the interpretation is unsure. When chant came to be notated on a staff, the oriscus was normally represented as having the same pitch as the immediately preceding note.|$|E

60|$|I {{ask those}} {{who say they have}} a {{positive}} idea of eternity, whether their idea of duration includes in it succession, or not? If it does not, they ought to show the difference of their notion of duration, when applied to an eternal Being, and to a finite; since, perhaps, there may be others as well as I, who will own to them their weakness of understanding in this point, and acknowledge that the notion they have of duration forces them to conceive, that whatever has duration, is of a longer continuance to-day than it was yesterday. If, to avoid succession in external existence, they return to the <b>punctum</b> stans of the schools, I suppose they will thereby very little mend the matter, or help us to a more clear and positive idea of infinite duration; there being nothing more inconceivable to me than duration without succession. Besides, that <b>punctum</b> stans, if it signify anything, being not quantum, finite or infinite cannot belong to it. But, if our weak apprehensions cannot separate succession from any duration whatsoever, our idea of eternity can be nothing but of INFINITE SUCCESSION OF MOMENTS OF DURATION WHEREIN ANYTHING DOES EXIST; and whether any one has, or can have, a positive idea of an actual infinite number, I leave him to consider, till his infinite number be so great that he himself can add no more to it; and {{as long as he can}} increase it, I doubt he himself will think the idea he hath of it a little too scanty for positive infinity.|$|E
60|$|Animalization {{in general}} is, we know, contra-distinguished from {{vegetables}} in general by {{the predominance of}} azote in the chemical composition, and of irritability in the organic process. But {{in this and the}} foregoing classes, as being still near the common equator, or the <b>punctum</b> indifferentiæ, the carbonic principle still asserts its claims, and the force of reproduction struggles with that of irritability. In the unreconciled strife of these two forces consists the character of the Vermes, which appear to be the preparatory step for the next class. Hence the difficulties which have embarrassed the naturalists, who adopt the Linnæan classification, in their endeavours to discover determinate characters of distinction between the vermes and the insecta.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the latter}} part of the seventeenth century, the {{doctrine}} of epigenesis, thus advocated by Harvey, was controverted, on the ground of direct observation, by Malpighi, who affirmed that the body of the chick is to be seen in the egg, before the <b>punctum</b> sanguineum makes it appearance. But, from this perfectly correct observation a conclusion which is by no means warranted was drawn; namely, that the chick, as a whole, really exists in the egg antecedently to incubation; and that what happens in the course of the latter process is no addition of new parts, [...] "alias post alias natas," [...] as Harvey puts it, but a simple expansion, or unfolding, of the organs which already exist, though they are too small and inconspicuous to be discovered. The weight of Malpighi's observations therefore fell into the scale of that doctrine which Harvey terms metamorphosis, in contradistinction to epigenesis.|$|E
60|$|The result to {{individual}} Men of Letters {{is not the}} momentous one; they are but individuals, an infinitesimal fraction of the great body; they can struggle on, and live or else die, {{as they have been}} wont. But it deeply concerns the whole society, whether it will set its light on high places, to walk thereby; or trample it under foot, and scatter it in all ways of wild waste (not without conflagration), as heretofore! Light is the one thing wanted for the world. Put wisdom in the head of the world, the world will fight its battle victoriously, and be the best world man can make it. I called this anomaly of a disorganic Literary Class the heart of all other anomalies, at once product and parent; some good arrangement for that would be as the <b>punctum</b> saliens of a new vitality and just arrangement for all. Already, in some European countries, in France, in Prussia, one traces some beginnings of an arrangement for the Literary Class; indicating the gradual possibility of such. I believe that it is possible; that {{it will have to be}} possible.|$|E
6000|$|The masquerades and galas {{in honor}} of Prince Henri, from a grandiose Hostess, who had played with him in childhood, were many; {{but it is not}} with these that we have to do. One day, the Czarina, talking to him of the Austrian {{procedures}} at Zips, said with pique, [...] "It seems, in Poland you have only to stoop, and pick up what you like of it. If the Court of Vienna have the notion to dismember that Kingdom, its neighbors will have right to do as much." [...] [Rulhiere, iv. 210; Trois Demembremens, i. 142; above all, Henri himself, in OEuvres de Frederic, xxvi. 345, [...] "Petersburg, 8th January, 1771."] This is supposed, in all Books, to be the <b>PUNCTUM</b> SALIENS, or first mention, of the astonishing Partition, which was settled, agreed upon, within about a year hence, and has made so much noise ever since. And in effect it was so; the idea rising practically in that high head was the real beginning. But {{this was not the first}} head it had been in; far from that. Above a year ago, as Friedrich himself informed us, it had been in Friedrich's own head,--though at the time it went for absolutely nothing, nobody even bestowing a sneer on it (as Friedrich intimates), and disappeared through the Horn-Gate of Dreams.|$|E
6000|$|The {{problem for}} Spenser was a double one: how to commend poetry {{at all to}} a {{generation}} which thought it effeminate trifling,[298] and how he, Master Edmund Spenser, of imagination all compact, could commend his poetry to Master John Bull, the most practical of mankind in his habitual mood, {{but at that moment}} in a passion of religious anxiety about his soul. Omne tulit <b>punctum</b> qui miscuit utile dulci was not only an irrefragable axiom because a Latin poet had said it, but it exactly met the case in point. He would convince the scorners that poetry might be seriously useful, and show Master Bull his new way of making fine words butter parsnips, in a rhymed moral primer. Allegory, as then practised, was imagination adapted for beginners, in words of one syllable and illustrated with cuts, and would thus serve both his ethical and pictorial purpose. Such a primer, or a first instalment of it, he proceeded to put forth; but he so bordered it with bright-colored fancies, he so often filled whole pages and crowded the text hard in others with the gay frolics of his pencil, that, as in the Grimani missal, the holy function of the book is forgotten in the ecstasy of its adornment. Worse than all, does not his brush linger more lovingly along the rosy contours of his sirens than on the modest wimples of the Wise Virgins? [...] "The general end of the book," [...] he tells us in his Dedication to Sir Walter Raleigh, [...] "is to fashion a gentleman of noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline." [...] But a little further on he evidently has a qualm, as he thinks how generously he had interpreted his promise of cuts: [...] "To some I know this method will seem displeasant, which had rather have good discipline delivered plainly in way of precepts or sermoned at large,[299] as they use, than thus cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devices." [...] Lord Burleigh was of this way of thinking, undoubtedly, but how could poor Clarion help it? Has he not said, ...|$|E
60|$|But {{as little}} can we {{conceive}} the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. The line is Time + Space, under {{the predominance of}} Time: Surface is Space + Time, under the predominance of Space, while Line + Surface as the synthesis of units, is the circle in the first dignity; to the sphere in the second; and to the globe in the third. In short, neither can the antagonists appear but as two forces of one power, nor can the power be conceived by us but as the equatorial point of the two counteracting forces; of which the hypomochlion of the lever is as good an illustration as anything can be that is thought of mechanically only, and exclusively of life. To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the <b>punctum</b> saliens, and the power itself in its eminence. Even in these, the most abstract and universal forms of all thought and perception—even in the ideas of time and space, we slip under them, as it were, a substratum; for we cannot think of them {{but as far as}} they are co-inherent, and therefore as reciprocally the measures of each other. Nor, again, can we finish the process without having the idea of motion as its immediate product. Thus we say, that time has one dimension, and imagine it to ourselves as a line. But the line we have already proved to be the productive synthesis of time, with space under the predominance of time. If we exclude space by an abstract assumption, the time remains as a spaceless point, and represents the concentered power of unity and active negation, i.e. retraction, determination, and limit, ab intra. But if we assume the time as excluded, the line vanishes, and we leave space dimensionless, an indistinguishable ALL, and therefore the representative of absolute weakness and formlessness, but, for that very reason, of infinite capacity and formability.|$|E
60|$|The Unknown.--I wish {{to guard}} you against the {{adoption}} of any hypothesis on this recondite and abstruse subject. But however difficult {{it may be to}} define the exact nature of respiration, yet the effect of it and its connexions with the functions of the body are sufficiently striking. By the action of air on the blood it is fitted for the purposes of life, and from the moment that animation is marked by sensation or volition, this function is performed, the <b>punctum</b> saliens in the ovum seems to receive as it were the breath of life in the influence of air. In the economy of the reproduction of the species of animals, {{one of the most important}} circumstances is the aeration of the ovum, and when this is not performed, from the blood of the mother as in the mammalia by the placenta, there is a system for aerating as in the oviparous reptiles or fishes, which enables the air freely to pass through the receptacles in which the eggs are deposited, or the egg itself is aerated out of the body through its coats or shell, and when air is excluded, incubation or artificial heat has no effect. Fishes which deposit their eggs in water that contains only a limited portion of air, make combinations which would seem almost the result of scientific knowledge or reason, though depending upon a more unerring principle, their instinct for preserving their offspring. Those fishes that spawn in spring or the beginning of summer and winch inhabit deep and still waters, as the carp, bream, pike, tench, &c., deposit their eggs upon aquatic vegetables, which by the influence of the solar light constantly preserve the water in a state of aeration. The trout, salmon, hucho, and others of the Salmo genus, which spawn in the beginning or end of winter, and which inhabit rivers fed by cold and rapid streams which descend from the mountains, deposit their eggs in shallows on heaps of gravel, as near as possible to the source of the stream where the water is fully combined with air; and to accomplish this purpose they travel for hundreds of miles against the current, and leap over cataracts and dams: thus the Salmo salar ascends by the Rhone and the Aar to the glaciers of Switzerland, the hucho by the Danube, the Isar, and the Save, passing through the lakes of the Tyrol and Styria to the highest torrents of the Noric and Julian Alps.|$|E
60|$|So much I {{have said}} of {{the manner in which}} Thackeray did his work, endeavouring to {{represent}} human nature as he saw it, so that his readers should learn to love what is good, and to hate what is evil. As to the merits of his style, {{it will be necessary to}} insist on them the less, because it has been generally admitted to be easy, lucid, and grammatical. I call that style easy by which the writer has succeeded in conveying to the reader that which the reader is intended to receive with the least possible amount of trouble to him. I call that style lucid which conveys to the reader most accurately all that the writer wishes to convey on any subject. The two virtues will, I think, be seen to be very different. An author may wish to give an idea that a certain flavour is bitter. He shall leave a conviction that it is simply disagreeable. Then he is not lucid. But he shall convey so much as that, in such a manner as to give the reader no trouble in arriving at the conclusion. Therefore he is easy. The subject here suggested is as little complicated as possible; but in the intercourse which is going on continually between writers and readers, affairs of all degrees of complication are continually being discussed, of a nature so complicated that the inexperienced writer is puzzled at every turn to express himself, and the altogether inartistic writer fails to do so. Who among writers has not to acknowledge that he is often unable to tell all that he has to tell? Words refuse to do it for him. He struggles and stumbles and alters and adds, but finds at last that he has gone either too far or not quite far enough. Then there comes upon him the necessity of choosing between two evils. He must either give up the fulness of his thought, and content himself with presenting some fragment of it in that lucid arrangement of words which he affects; or he must bring out his thought with ambages; he must mass his sentences inconsequentially; he must struggle up hill almost hopelessly with his phrases,--so that at the end the reader will have to labour as he himself has laboured, or else to leave behind much of the fruit which it has been intended that he should garner. It is the ill-fortune of some to be neither easy or lucid; and there is nothing more wonderful in the history of letters than the patience of readers when called upon to suffer under the double calamity. It is as though a man were reading a dialogue of Plato, understanding neither the subject nor the language. But it is often the case that one has to be sacrificed to the other. The pregnant writer will sometimes solace himself by declaring that it is not his business to supply intelligence to the reader; and then, in throwing out the entirety of his thought, will not stop to remember that he cannot hope to scatter his ideas far and wide unless he can make them easily intelligible. Then the writer who is determined that his book shall not be put down because it is troublesome, is too apt to avoid the knotty bits and shirk the rocky turns, because he cannot with ease to himself make them easy to others. If this be acknowledged, I shall be held to be right in saying not only that ease and lucidity in style are different virtues, but that they are often opposed to each other. They may, however, be combined, and then the writer will have really learned the art of writing. Omne tulit <b>punctum</b> qui miscuit utile dulci. It is to be done, I believe, in all languages. A man by art and practice shall at least obtain such a masterhood over words as to express all that he thinks, in phrases that shall be easily understood.|$|E
