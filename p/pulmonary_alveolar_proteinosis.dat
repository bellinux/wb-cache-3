To date, there remains no clear understanding of the underlying mechanism(s). Pulmonary toxicity studies in rats and mice have demonstrated the development of mediastinal lymph node hyperplasia and granulomas of mediastinal lymph nodes and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues following exposure to indium tin oxide. Given the association between exposure to other metals and the development of immune-mediated diseases, these studies were undertaken to begin to investigate the immuno-modulatory potential of unsintered indium tin oxide (uITO) in a mouse model.

30|$|Bronchoscopy with {{bronchoalveolar lavage}} (BAL) remains {{diagnostic}} {{in up to}} two-thirds of ARF cases in immunocompromised patients and is associated with therapeutic changes in 30 – 50  % of patients [57, 60, 64, 66 – 84]. In addition, rate of respiratory deterioration in the hours following BAL is substantial, one-third of patients without invasive mechanical ventilation experiencing significant respiratory worsening [57, 64]. In one RCT, researchers compared diagnostic strategies in critically ill patients without invasive mechanical ventilation. These strategies were an invasive strategy with systematic BAL and a non-invasive strategy including a first-line non-invasive test (Additional file 1) along with subsequent BAL in patients without a diagnosis or in those requiring mechanical ventilation [64]. In that study, the need for mechanical ventilation, patient mortality, {{and the rate of}} patients without a diagnosis after the diagnostic workup were similar to both strategies [64]. Although these results suggest that BAL was well tolerated, they also challenge the diagnostic benefits of first-line BAL when compared with a non-invasive diagnostic workup. BAL remains mandatory in cases of failure to obtain a diagnosis non-invasively or if deemed necessary to validate a clinical or radiological suspicion (e.g., infiltrative <b>pulmonary</b> disease, <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis).</b> In the same line, pretest probability should be the primary trigger in drawing optimal diagnostic workup rather than patients’ condition (with vs. without MV for example) or associated conditions (thrombocytopenia for example). When required, the rate of clinical worsening following BAL in patients requiring mechanical ventilation remains limited [57, 85].|$|R

40|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Alveolar</b> Proteinosis(PAP) is a {{rare disease}} of unknown etiology, {{characterized}} by the accumulation of proteinoceous material in the alveoli that is rich in lipid and is positive on periodic acid-Schiff(PAS) stain. PAP is rare in children. Two forms are encountered in pediatric practice: congenital <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> (CAP) and a later–onset form that is generally less severe. Broncho-alveolar lavage {{is the key to}} diagnosis. Therapeutic lung lavages are the only effective treatment for severe cases. Other therapeutic trials have been proposed such as: lung transplantation, adminstration of GM- CSF and gene-therapy. This case series presents six cases of PAP which were diagnosed by open lung biopsy in Mofid children hospital in Tehran capital city over a three-year period (2003 – 2006) and one in 1998.

40|$|<b>Alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> is an {{uncommon}} lung disease presenting in primary or secondary forms, characterised by surfactant derived proteinous material accumulation within the lungs. The most effective treatment remains whole lung lavage under general anaesthesia. We have recently performed whole lung lavage in a 46 -year-old patient with <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> who presented with severe dyspnoea and hypoxia. During the left lung lavage, outwards flow was enhanced at random either by manual clapping or by mechanical chest percussion with a vest airway clearance system. The protein and surfactant protein A {{concentrations in the}} 13 successive samples of the left lavage solution showed an exponential decline, not different between manual clapping and chest mechanical percussion.

40|$|Mutation of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene by {{homologous}} recombination caused <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> in mice. To further discern {{the role of}} GM-CSF in surfactant homeostasis, the synthesis of GM-CSF was directed to the respiratory epithelium of GM-CSF-hull mutant mice (GM-/-) with a chimeric gene expressing GM-CSF {{under the control of}} the promoter from the human surfactant protein-C (SP-C) gene.

SP-A, -B, and -C mRNAs were unaltered in lungs from GM-CSF-deficient and -replete mice. Expression of GM-CSF in respiratory epithelial cells of transgenic mice restores surfactant homeostasis in GM-/- mice. From these findings, we conclude that GM-CSF regulates the clearance or catabolism rather than synthesis of surfactant proteins and lipids...|$|R
