40|$|AbstractSeven of nine <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> that {{distinguish}} human (HSA) and chimpanzee karyotypes are chimpanzee-specific. In {{this study we}} investigated whether the two extant chimpanzee species, Pan troglodytes (common chimpanzee) and Pan paniscus (bonobo), share exactly the same <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions.</b> The methods applied were FISH with breakpoint-spanning BAC/PAC clones and PCR analyses of the breakpoint junction sequences. Our findings for the homologues to HSA 4, 5, 9, 12, 16, and 17 confirm {{for the first time}} at the sequence level that these <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> have identical breakpoints in the common chimpanzee and the bonobo. Therefore, these inversions predate the separation of the two chimpanzee species 0. 86 – 2 Mya. Further, the inversions distinguishing human and chimpanzee karyotypes may be regarded as early acquisitions, such that they are likely to have been present at the time of human/chimpanzee divergence. According to the chromosomal speciation theory the inversions themselves could have promoted human speciation...|$|R

Usually, E. bulbosa has a heteromorphic long chromosome pair, the result of a <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversion</b> in one of the long chromosomes, which makes it sexually sterile.|$|E
50|$|Improved {{characterization}} of the genomic architecture of chromosome 1 in a new genomic assembly has allowed for more refined analysis of the location and sequence of DUF1220 domains. Included among the findings was the identification of 20 additional DUF1220 domains in the genome that were added via a duplication from 1q21.2 to 1p11.2. This in turn may have mediated the HLS <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversion</b> on chromosome 1, an important evolutionary event.|$|E
40|$|Heterozygotes for <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> are {{expected}} to be semisterile because recombination in the inverted region produces aneuploid gametes. Newly arising <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> should therefore be quickly eliminated from populations by natural selection. The occasional polymorphism for such inversions and their fixation among closely related species have supported the idea that genetic drift in very small populations can overcome natural selection in the wild. We studied the effect of 7 second-chromosome and 30 third-chromosome <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> on the fertility of heterokaryotypic Drosophila melanogaster females. Surprisingly, fertility was not significantly reduced in many cases, even when the inversion was quite large. This lack of underdominance is almost certainly due to suppressed recombination in inversion heterozygotes, a phenomenon previously observed in Drosophila. In the large sample of third-chromosome inversions, the degree of underdominance depends far more on the position of breakpoints than on the inversion's length. Analysis of these positions shows that this chromosome has a pair of ``sensitive sites'' near cytological divisions 68 and 92 : these sites appear to reduce recombination in a heterozygous inversion whose breakpoints are nearby. There may also be ``sensitive sites'' near divisions 31 and 49 on the second chromosome. Such sites may be important in initiating synapsis. Because many <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> do not reduce the fertility of heterozyotes, we conclude that the observed fixation or polymorphism of such rearrangements in nature does not imply genetic drift in very small populations...|$|R

40|$|The {{karyotype}} {{of barley}} {{has been subjected}} to an extensive experimental reconstruction with respect of both fundamental and applied aspects (for review see Taketa et al. 2003). Reciprocal translocations have been the basic type of structural rearrangements used in this species along these lines. To my knowledge, there are very few attempts to use <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> as morphological markers for identification of barley chromosomes. For a long time our efforts were aimed at induction by gamma-irradiation of <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> which affect asymmetrically the morphology of barley chromosomes. Three homozygous lines, namely, I- 11, I- 44 and I- 39, containing such <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> in chromosomes 2 H, 5 H and 6 H, respectively, were produced so far. The morphology of reconstructed chromosomes is described in this paper. Dry seeds of both standard two-rowed spring barley variety “Freya ” and translocation line T- 1586, originating from the same variety were used as experimental material. Doses between 100 and 200 Gy of gamma-rays were applied in order to produce chromosomal rearrangements.

50|$|The <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversion</b> of the Y-chromosome (inv(Y)) {{is a rare}} {{chromosomal}} heteromorphism {{which is}} hereditary. It has no clinical significance or reproductive disadvantage. It is studied in Gujarati Muslims of South Africa, 8 inv(Y) men opposed to 9 normal men. The p49a/TaqI and p49a/PvuII haplotypes were determined and found that 8 inv(Y) possessed identical TaqI and PvuII where as 7 different TaqI and 8 different PvuII haplotypes observed in the 9 normal men. So It is concluded that inv(Y) has common genetic origin in Gujarati Muslims of South Africa. The origin is traced to Kholvad, a small village near Surat, and some neighbouring villages. It is probably originated through random genetic drift in reproductively isolated community, maintained by strict endogamy based on religious and linguistic affiliations.|$|E
40|$|Wedge shells {{belonging}} to the Donacidae family are the dominant bivalves in exposed beaches in almost {{all areas of the}} world. Typically, two or more sympatric species of wedge shells differentially occupy intertidal, sublittoral, and offshore coastal waters in any given locality. A molecular cytogenetic analysis of two sympatric and closely related wedge shell species, Donax trunculus and Donax vittatus, was performed. Results showed that the karyotypes of these two species were both strikingly different and closely alike; whilst metacentric and submetacentric chromosome pairs were the main components of the karyotype of D. trunculus, 10 – 11 of the 19 chromosome pairs were telocentric in D. vittatus, most likely as a result of different <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions.</b> GC-rich heterochromatic bands were present in both species. Furthermore, they showed coincidental 45 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 5 S rRNA and H 3 histone gene clusters at conserved chromosomal locations, although D. trunculus had an additional 45 S rDNA cluster. Intraspecific <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> were also detected in both D. trunculus and D. vittatus. The close genetic similarity of these two species together with the high degree of conservation of the 45 S rRNA, 5 S rRNA and H 3 histone gene clusters, and GC-rich heterochromatic bands indicate that <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversions</b> contribute to the karyotype divergence in wedge shells...|$|R

50|$|Familial {{eosinophilia}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder. Genetic linkage gene mapping family studies localize the gene {{responsible for this}} disease to chromosome 5 at position q31-q33, between markers D5S642 and D5S816. Studies on other disorders associated {{with high levels of}} blood eosinophils (e.g. childhood asthma, schistosomiasis) have likewise linked eosinophilia to the q31-q33 area of chromosome 5. The 5q31-q33 region contains a cytokine gene cluster that includes genes for Interleukin 3, interleukin 5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Each of these genes functions to promote the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophil precursor cells. Nonetheless, no gene polymorphisms were found within the promoters, exons, or introns of these 3 genes or in the regions' IL-3/GM-CSF enhancer. In addition to these studies, 8 affected members of a family with familial eosinophilia had peripheral blood or bone marrow cells that carried the same chromosome abnormality, a <b>pericentric</b> <b>inversion</b> of chromosome 10, inv (10) (p11.2q21.2).
