25|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} faced by pediatric safety and quality efforts {{is that most of}} the work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for <b>pediatric</b> <b>patient</b> safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced. Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with {{suspected}} cervical spine injuries (CSI) often {{receive a}} computed tomography (CT) scan as an initial diagnostic imaging test. While sensitive, CT of the cervical spine carries significant radiation {{and risk of}} lethal malignant transformation later in life. Plain radiographs carry significantly less radiation and could serve as the preferred screening tool, provided they have a high functional sensitivity in detecting <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with CSI. We hypothesize that plain cervical spine radiographs can reliably detect <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with CSI and seek to quantify the functional sensitivity of plain radiography as compared to CT. We analyzed data from the NEXUS cervical spine study to assess the sensitivity of plain radiographs {{in the evaluation of}} CSI. We identified all <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> who underwent plain radiographic imaging, and all <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> found to have CSI. We then determined the sensitivity of plain radiographs in detecting <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with CSI. We identified 44 <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with CSI in the dataset with age ranging from 2 to 18  years old. Thirty-two of the 44 <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> received cervical spine plain films as a part of their workup. Plain films were able to identify all 32 <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with CSI to yield a sensitivity of 100  % in detecting injury victims (95  % confidence interval 89. 1 - 100. 0  %). Plain radiography was highly sensitive for the identification of CSI in our cohort of <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> and is useful as a screening tool in the evaluation of pediatric CSI...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Inhibitors of {{mammalian}} {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) are increasingly used as therapy for <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} (TSC). The uncertainty over the efficacy and safety of mTOR inhibitor therapy {{for the treatment of}} <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with TSC emphasizes the necessity for a synthesis of existing evidence. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy and safety of mTOR inhibitor therapy for the treatment of <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with TSC. The PubMed, EmBase and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched, and studies of mTOR inhibitor therapy and non-mTOR inhibitor therapy in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with TSC (< 18 years old) were selected. Eleven studies met the inclu-sion criteria. There was evidence of a significantly increased response rate in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with TSC treated with mTOR inhibitor therapy compared with those treated with non-mTOR inhibitor therapy (odds ratio, 24. 71; 95 % confidence interval, 7. 46 - 81. 72; P< 0. 001). The majority of studies reported few adverse events. There was an increased incidence of mouth ulceration, stomatitis, convulsion and pyrexia in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with TSC treated with mTOR inhibitor therapy. In conclusion, mTOR inhibitor therapy is an efficacious and safe treatment for <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with TSC...|$|R

25|$|Research {{indicates}} {{there are}} wide ranges and overlaps of survival probabilities of the Immediate and Delayed categories, and other START limitations. The same physiologic measures can have markedly different survival probabilities for blunt and penetrating injuries. For example, a START Delayed (second priority) {{can have a}} survival probability of 63% for blunt trauma and a survival probability of 32% for penetrating trauma with the same physiological measures – both with expected rapid deterioration, while a START Immediate (first priority) can have survival probabilities that extend to above 95% with expected slow deterioration. Age categories exacerbate this. For example, a geriatric patient with a penetrating injury in the Delayed category can have an 8% survival probability, and a <b>pediatric</b> <b>patient</b> in the Immediate category can have a 98% survival probability. Issues with the other START categories have also been noted. In this context, color-coded tagging accuracy metrics are not scientifically meaningful.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{attempted}} human {{liver transplant}} {{was performed in}} 1963 by Dr. Thomas Starzl, although the <b>pediatric</b> <b>patient</b> died intraoperatively due to uncontrolled bleeding.

2500|$|In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624), surgeon of the Duke of Nemours and anatomist, {{published}} {{a report of}} four successful [...] "bronchotomies" [...] he had performed.

He also described the first known tracheotomy performed on a <b>pediatric</b> <b>patient.</b> A 14-year-old boy swallowed a bag containing 9 gold coins in an attempt to prevent its theft by a highwayman. The object became lodged in his esophagus, obstructing his trachea. Habicot performed a tracheotomy, which allowed him to manipulate the bag so that it passed through the boy's alimentary tract, apparently with no further sequelae. Habicot suggested that the operation might also be effective for patients suffering from inflammation of the larynx. He developed equipment for this surgical procedure that are similar in many ways to modern designs.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Episure Autodetect syringe, a {{spring-loaded}} syringe, is a loss-of-resistance syringe with {{an internal}} compression that applies constant {{pressure on the}} plunger. As the principle of loss-of-resistance {{is the same for}} adult and for <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients,</b> the Episure Autodetect syringe should be able to identify correctly the epidural space also in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients.</b> METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out for all <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients,</b> in which the Episure Autodetect syringe was used for locating the epidural space between 2007 and 2011 in our department. RESULTS: In 17 <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> (9 months- 14 years, 7. 5 - 43 kg weight), the Episure syringe was used. In all 17 patients, the epidural space was correctly identified using the spring-loaded syringe as evidenced by satisfactory analgesia. No accidental dural punctures or false loss-of-resistances were observed. CONCLUSION: The spring-loaded Episure Autodetect syringe might be a potentially useful loss-of-resistance syringe for identification of the epidural space in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Common to all <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> {{receiving}} {{enteral nutrition}} is {{the inability to}} consume calories orally. This is often secondary to issues of inadequate weight gain, inadequate growth, prolonged feeding times, weight loss, a decrease in weight/age or weight/height ratios, or a persis-tent triceps skinfold thickness 5 % for age. Enteral nutrition requires enteral access. In the neonatal period the nasoen-teric route is usually used. In <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> requiring long-term enteral access, surgically, endoscopically, or radio-logically placed percutaneous feeding tubes are common. Jejunal feeding tubes are used in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with gastric feeding intolerance or persistent gastroesophageal reflux.

In this report, taliglucerase alfa pharmacokinetics were assessed in adult and <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> with Gaucher disease from separate multicenter trials of 30 Units/kg and 60 Units/kg doses infused every 2 weeks. Serial blood samples were obtained from adult patients following single-dose administration on day 1 (n = 26) and multiple doses at week 38 (n = 29), and from <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> following administration of multiple doses of taliglucerase alfa for 10 - 27 months (n = 10). In both adult and <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients,</b> maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last measureable concentration (AUC 0 -t), and from time zero to infinity (AUC 0 -∞) were higher after 60 Units/kg dose than 30 Units/kg dose. No tendency for accumulation or change in taliglucerase alfa pharmacokinetic parameters over time from day 1 to week 38 was observed with repeated doses of 30 or 60 Units/kg in adults. After multiple doses, mean (range) dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters were similar for adult versus <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> receiving 60 Units/kg: Cmax expressed in ng/mL/mg was 42. 4 (14. 5 - 95. 4) in adults and 46. 6 (34. 4 - 68. 4) in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients,</b> AUC 0 t expressed in ng • h/mL/mg was 63. 4 (26. 3 - 156) in adults and 63. 9 (39. 8 - 85. 1) in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients,</b> t 1 / 2 expressed in minutes was 34. 8 (11. 3 - 104) in adults and 31. 5 (18. 0 - 42. 9) in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients</b> and total body clearance expressed in L/h was 19. 9 (6. 25 - 37. 9) in adults and 17. 0 (11. 7 - 24. 9) in <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients.</b> These pharmacokinetic data extend the findings of taliglucerase alfa in adult and <b>pediatric</b> <b>patients.</b> ClinicalTrials. gov.
