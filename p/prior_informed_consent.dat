25|$|Aboriginal title can be {{extinguished}} by {{the general}} government, but again, the requirement to do this varies by country. Some require the legislature to be explicit when it does this, others hold that extinguishment can be inferred from the government's treatment of the land. In Canada, the Crown cannot extinguish aboriginal title without the explicit <b>prior</b> <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> of the proper aboriginal title holders. New Zealand formerly required consent, but today requires only a justification, akin to a public purpose requirement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the limited Corporate Social Responsibility literature on the subject of indigenous peoples’ right to free, <b>prior</b> and <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> to mining sector projects. Within the already contested field of corporate human rights responsibilities, free, <b>prior</b> and <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> is a particularly controversial area, comprising as it does sensitive components of self-determination, group and cultural rights, and disputed land entitlements. The research establishes that the right has only penetrated the mining sector to a very limited extent and that the lack of consensus that exists both at an international and industry level regarding free, <b>prior</b> and <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> is the likely cause of this. However, the paper does note that two companies are operationalising the right as part of their indigenous peoples’ engagement processes. This suggests an emerging area of best practice that is not constrained by the confusion found surrounding the right elsewhere and which potentially has important implications for the respect of indigenous peoples’ rights and protection of their dignity...|$|R
