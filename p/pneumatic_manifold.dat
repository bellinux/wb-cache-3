40|$|Microfluidic devices with {{peristaltic}} {{pumps and}} valves have been fabricated {{based on the}} thermal plastic materials by using the rapid hot-embossing method. Two types of configurations of the microfluidic devices are presented. Both of them {{are based on the}} use of membrane layer made of thermoplastic elastomer materials. The frequency and pressure dependence of the pumping rate are studied and compared among the conventional, S-shape and U-shape designs. The maximum flow rate of the conventional peristaltic design is about 2 times of that of the U-shape design with the identical microfluidic channel under the same operation pressure. The advantage of S-shape and U-shape peristaltic design over the conventional design is that the number of electromagnetic valves used in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>manifold</b> can be reduced. A simple rotary microfluidic device with peristaltic pumps was fabricated and the microvalving, micropumping and micromixing operations have been demonstrated.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the interference e⁄ects between two and three cylinders of Þnite height immersed in a turbulent boundary layer at subcritical Reynolds numbers has been conducted in a boundary layer wind tunnel, utilizing a <b>pneumatic</b> averaging <b>manifold</b> system to measure the ßuctuating force at various levels. Measurements of mean drag and lift force coeƒcients, mode-generalized RMS drag and lift force coeƒcients, and mode-generalized drag and lift force spectra, {{for a range of}} cylinder spacings, conÞgurations, and various angles of attack, are presented. The interference levels observed were found to depend strongly on the spacing, angle of attack, and the arrangement of the cylinders with respect to each other. The investigation of these relationships for Þnite cylinders should prove insightful to those interested in such phenomena. (1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. 1...|$|R
