Continued research in <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> is needed to support technology based efforts to reduce fire losses. Motivated by this, a study of radiation and flow characteristics of two laboratory scale buoyant diffusion flames, mimicking <b>pool</b> <b>fire</b> behavior, was undertaken. ^ Radiation is the primary mode of fire spread in case of accidents. Temporally and spectrally-resolved radiation data from flames are critical for validation of numerical models for fire protection engineering. In the present work, time series of spectral radiation intensities were measured in a 7. 1 cm ethylene (C 2 H 4) <b>pool</b> <b>fire.</b> Both soot and gaseous species (CO 2 and H 2 O) significantly contribute to the radiation output. Autocorrelations and power spectral densities (PSD) of the radiation data reflect the 2 Ì† 2 puffing 2 Ì† 2 phenomenon typically observed in <b>pool</b> <b>fires.</b> ^ Stochastic time series models have been successfully applied to radiation calculations in momentum-driven jet flames in the past. Due to fundamentally different flow characteristics, previous time series models cannot be extended to <b>pool</b> <b>fires.</b> Therefore, a new model was developed to simulate radiation time series in <b>pool</b> <b>fires.</b> Autocorrelations, PSD and probability density functions (PDF) of the simulated radiation time series matched well with the measurements in the 7. 1 cm C 2 H 4 fire, thus validating the new model. ^ Understanding of fire flow fields is important since fire size, and hence the radiation output, {{is related to the}} fire induced flow field.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The fire hazards {{associated}} with polypropylene wall linings sub-jected to small ignition sources, were evaluated using large scale experiments and cone calorimetry. A series of seven ignition sources with increasing sever-ity as recommended in BS 5852 {{were used in}} the tests. The results obtained in-dicate that ignition of the polypropylene linings is likely when exposed to igni-tion sources 5 to 7 as defined in BS 5852. It was observed that the melting behaviour of the polypropylene wall linings significantly affected the burning behaviour. A <b>pool</b> <b>fire,</b> consisting of melted polymer, formed {{at the base of the}} wall which then controlled the fire growth processes. The rate of flame spread on the lining surface which depended on the growth of the <b>pool</b> <b>fire</b> was slow because the thin polymer sheet could only supply a limited amount of melted polymer to the pool. The estimated heat release rates from the <b>pool</b> <b>fire</b> were close to the values measured in the cone calorimeter at the heat flux level of 25 kW m- 2. KEY WORDS: polypropylene, cone calorimeter, heat release rate, <b>pool</b> <b>fire,</b> flame spread, ignition, small ignition source. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{describes}} an experimental and theoretical inves-tigation of extinction limit of diesel <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> suppressed by water mist. A downward-directed nozzle produced a fine water spray over small-scale opposed diesel <b>pool</b> <b>fires.</b> The fire extinction limit is obtained from minimum nozzle injection pressure or maximum fire size {{when the fire}} extinguishment took place. For the conditions tested, {{it is observed that}} there are two distinct regions in the relationship between the injection pressure and fire size, i. e., a fire suppression region and a fire intensification region. The transition of the two regions is dependent on the effective water flux and the plume-spray thrust ratio. It is also revealed that the fuel surface cooling is the dominant mechanism for diesel <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> at extinction limit in the tests. The failure to cause fire extinction is mainly due to the insufficient water flux applied to remove enough heat from the fuel surface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSmall-scaled ethanol {{circular}} <b>pool</b> <b>fire</b> {{experiments were}} conducted in a self-designed low pressure experiment tank to investigate the influence of ambient pressure on the combustion characteristics of the <b>pool</b> <b>fire.</b> The difference of combustion characteristics under different pressure environment were investigated, combustion characteristics of ethanol <b>pool</b> <b>fire,</b> such as fuel's mass burning rate, flame shape, flame centre-line temperature and plume velocity in different ambient pressure conditions were measured. The experiment {{results show that the}} mass burning rate decrease when the ambient pressure decrease, and the variation could be well fitted by a power function. Plume centre-line velocity also decrease with the ambient pressure. Generally, flame height would increase with the decreasing of the ambient pressure, until reaching the turning point, and then decrease. Temperature rise of plume centre-line take a power function of height and heat release rate...|$|R
40|$|The UK Health & Safety Executive are {{responsible}} for advising on ways {{to ensure the safety}} of employees within the workplace. One of the main areas of concern is the potential problem of unwanted fire, and it has been identified that within the area of large-scale storage in warehouses, there is an uncertainty posed by large quantities of thermoplastic. Some forms of thermoplastic exhibit melt-flow behaviour when heated, and a large vertical array exposed to a fire may melt and ignite forming a <b>pool</b> <b>fire</b> in addition to a wall fire. This project is largely experimental, and aimed at quantifying the effect of a growing <b>pool</b> <b>fire</b> fuelled by a melting wall on overall fire growth rate. The <b>pool</b> <b>fire</b> has been found to increase melting and burning rates, producing a much faster growing fire. It has also been found that - 80...|$|R

It attempts to examine a full-scale compartment (2 mÃ— 2. 5 mÃ— 11 m) fire test simulated in an underground train carriage. Fire scenarios use large <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> of a flammable liquid (Heptane <b>pool</b> <b>fires).</b> The fire scales are changed to various sizes (1. 2 MW ~ 4 MW).

Researches on combustion characteristics of large petroleum fires {{have been conducted}} by many research groups.
