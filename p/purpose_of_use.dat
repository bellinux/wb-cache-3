500|$|Among the {{influences}} of the verdict include Sega v. Accolades effect on the criteria for fair use and the responsibilities of trademark holders in legal examinations. [...] Although Accolade had copied entire Genesis games {{in order to identify}} the TMSS, the court gave little weight to the criterion on the amount of the copyrighted work being copied, {{in light of the fact}} that Accolade had done so in order to create their own compatible software. [...] Likewise, the nature of the work was also given less weight, essentially establishing a two-factor approach to evaluating fair use in the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and impact on the market. [...] It was also the first time that the Lanham Act was interpreted to mean that confusion resulting from the placement of one's trademark on another work by means of a security program is the fault of the original registrant of the trademark.|$|E
500|$|To {{determine}} {{the status of}} Accolade's claim of fair use of Sega's copyrighted game code, the court reviewed four criteria of fair use: {{the nature of the}} copyrighted work, the amount of the copyrighted work used, the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> and the effects of use on the market for the work. Of note to the judges in reviewing Sega's copyright claim was the difference in size between the TMSS file and the sizes of Accolade's games. As noted by Judge Reinhardt in writing the opinion of the court, the TMSS file [...] "contains approximately twenty to twenty-five bytes of data. Each of Accolade's games contains a total of 500,000 to 1,500,000 bytes. According to Accolade employees, the header file is the only portion of Sega's code that Accolade copied into its own game programs." [...] This made the games overwhelmingly original content, and according to Judge Reinhardt, to the benefit of the public to be able to compete with Sega's licensed games, especially if the games were dissimilar as contended in the appeal. The court did not accept the argument that Accolade's games competed directly with Sega's, noting that there was no proof that any of Accolade's published games had diminished the market for any of Sega's games. Despite claims from Sega's attorneys that the company had invested much time and effort into developing the Genesis, and that Accolade was capitalizing on this time and energy, the court rejected these claims under the notion that the console was largely functional, and its functional principles were not protected under the Copyright Act of 1976. On the matter of reverse engineering as a process, the court concluded that [...] "where disassembly {{is the only way to}} gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law." ...|$|E

Unlike the Salinger (1919-2010) case, there was no privacy issue since Wright was dead. The court said: [...] "Walker has used the letters not to recreate Wright's creative expression, but simply to establish facts necessary to her biography, which often relies on her personal association with the late novelist."The court found that only small amounts had been used, Walker had not taken the core or heart of the work, and the market value of the copyrighted work would not be affected.The court therefore issued a summary judgment dismissing the request for an injunction against publication.The court dismissed the claim of breach of contract, and other claims were also dropped. Ellen Wright appealed the decision on her copyright claim, which was reduced to a claim of infringement of copyright in the unpublished letters from Wright to Walker and in the unpublished journal.|$|E
