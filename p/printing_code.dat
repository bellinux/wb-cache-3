A simple solution takes {{into consideration the}} fact that in the quality printing mode ChiWriter outputs bit-image <b>print</b> <b>codes</b> which can be redirected into a file (default extension [...]bin).

Utility chipbm converts used by ChiWriter subset of bit-image <b>print</b> <b>codes</b> into a file Portable anymap (.pbm) which is loaded by many graphical utilities.

This property is related to a system being able to correctly parse formulas that it printed itself. In current systems it happens regularly that this fails. We argue that a good interactive theorem prover should be Pollack-consistent. We show with examples that many interactive theorem provers currently are not Pollack-consistent.

Our system makes sure that the identifier is indeed issued by the authorized organiza-tion, and the size of pair of identifier and its authenticator is small enough to be written in a 2 -D code. Furthermore, the proposed system has compatibility with the existing 2 -D code reading software.
