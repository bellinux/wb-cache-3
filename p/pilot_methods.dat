40|$|Abstract. The <b>pilot</b> <b>method</b> as a meta-heuristic is a {{tempered}} greedy method {{aimed at}} obtaining better solutions while avoiding the greedy trap by looking ahead for each possible choice. Repeatedly a master solution is modified; each {{time in a}} minimal fashion to account for best choices, where choices are judged {{by means of a}} separate heuristic result, the pilot solution. The <b>pilot</b> <b>method</b> may be seen as a meta-heuristic enhancing the quality of (any) heuristic in a system for heuristic repetition. Experiments show that the <b>pilot</b> <b>method</b> as well as similar methods can behave quite competitively in comparison with well-known and accepted meta-heuristics. In this paper we review some less known results. As a higher time complexity is usually associated with repetition, we investigate a simple short-cut policy to reduce the running times, while retaining an enhanced solution quality. Furthermore, we report successful experiments that incorporate a distinguishing feature of the <b>pilot</b> <b>method,</b> which is the extension of neighborhoods into “local ” search, creating tabu search hybrids...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As a metaheuristic {{to obtain}} {{solutions}} of enhanced quality, we formulate the so-called <b>pilot</b> <b>method.</b> It is a tempered greedy method {{that is to}} avoid the greedy trap by looking ahead for each possible choice (memorizing the best result). Repeatedly, a so-called master solution is modified, each time in a minimal fashion {{to account for the}} “best ” choice, where all choices have been judged by means of a separate heuristic result, the “pilot ” solution. We apply the method to the well-known Steiner problem in a weighted graph, that is, the problem is to determine a subgraph of minimum total weight spanning a set of given vertices. The <b>pilot</b> <b>method</b> may be seen as a system for heuristic repetition. As a higher time complexity order is usually associated with repetition, we propose policies to reduce the running times, while retaining an enhanced solution quality. Where possible, to encourage application of the <b>pilot</b> <b>method</b> to other combinatorial problems, we formulate in general terms. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Recovery Colleges aim to assist people in the journey to recovery through education, bringing together both professional and lived experience of mental health challenges in a non-stigmatising college environment. Following promising evaluation results elsewhere in the UK, a decision was taken to pilot a Recovery College in Mid Essex for one year, beginning in the autumn of 2013. The North Essex Research Network (NERN), a group of current or former mental health service users, was commissioned to evaluate the <b>pilot.</b> <b>Methods</b> Recovery College students completed measures of social inclusion and mental wellbeing {{at the beginning of their}} college attendance (baseline) and again three months later (follow-up).

At follow-up the majority of participants rated their experience of the college very positively. Additional comments on the questionnaires and the views of participants in the focus groups and interview support the quantitative results.

The goals of this study were twofold: (1) to <b>pilot</b> <b>methods</b> for collecting EDA data in young children and (2) to examine hypothesized relationships among EDA, and sensory symptoms and repetitive behaviors in children with ASD as compared with children with typical development. EDA was recorded on 54 young children with ASD and on 33 children with typical development (TD) during a protocol that included baseline, exposure to sensory and repetitive stimuli, and play. Parents completed standardized questionnaires regarding their child's sensory symptoms and repetitive behaviors. Frequency and type of repetitive behavior during play was coded offline. Comparisons between EDA data for ASD and TD groups indicated no significant between-group differences in any measures. Parents of children with ASD reported more abnormal responses to sensory stimuli and more repetitive behaviors, but scores on these measures were not significantly correlated with EDA or with frequency of observed repetitive behaviors. Parent report of frequency and severity of sensory symptoms was significantly correlated with reports of repetitive behaviors in both groups. Although parents of children with ASD report high levels of sensory symptoms and repetitive behaviors, these differences are not related to measured EDA arousal or reactivity. © 2014 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

Objectives: To determine the value and feasibility of conducting an effectiveness trial of the If I Were Jack Relationship and Sexuality Education (RSE) intervention in a convenience quota sample of post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. Secondary objectives were to assess acceptability to schools, pupils (male/female, aged 14 – 15 years) and parents/guardians; to identify optimal delivery structures and systems; to establish participation rates and reach, including equality of engagement of different socioeconomic and religious types; to assess trial recruitment and retention rates; to assess variation in normal RSE practice; to refine survey instruments; to assess differences in outcomes for male and female pupils; to identify potential effect sizes that might be detected in an effectiveness trial and estimate appropriate sample size for that trial; and to identify costs of delivery and <b>pilot</b> <b>methods</b> for assessing cost-effectiveness. Design: Cluster randomised Phase II feasibility trial with an embedded process and economic evaluation. Intervention: A teacher-delivered classroom-based RSE resource – an interactive video drama (IVD) with classroom materials, teacher training and an information session for parents – to immerse young people in a hypothetical scenario of Jack, a teenager whose girlfriend is unintentionally pregnant. It addresses gender inequalities in RSE by focusing on young men and is designed to increase intentions to avoid UTP by encouraging young people to delay sexual intercourse and to use contraception consistently in sexual relationships. Main outcome measures: Abstinence from sexual intercourse (delaying initiation of sex or returning to abstinence) or avoidance of unprotected sexual intercourse (consistent correct use of contraception). Secondary outcomes included Knowledge, Attitudes, Skills and Intentions. Results: The intervention proved acceptable to schools, pupils and parents, as evidenced through positive process evaluation.

40|$|Historically, {{children}} {{were considered to}} rarely experience sleep problems and daytime sleepiness in middle childhood (5 – 12 -years of age), however more recent findings indicate this may have changed.

Links have also emerged between shorter sleep duration in children, and an increased risk of obesity in childhood and adulthood. Although {{a number of studies have}} investigated children’s sleep internationally, data are limited on both average sleep duration and the stability of sleep patterns of New Zealand children. This study aimed to collect normative data on the sleep of 6 – 8 -year-olds, living in New Zealand, across both school and non-school nights, identify modifiable factors that impact on children’s sleep within the family environment, explore the relationship between children’s sleep and BMI, and <b>pilot</b> <b>methods</b> for potential future research. Actigraphy and diaries were used for seven consecutive days and nights, as well as a questionnaire incorporating the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), with 52 families living in the Wellington region. Stable objectively measured sleep patterns were identified, consistent with findings of Nixon et al. (2008). School night sleep duration was found to be, on average, longer than non-school night sleep, and parents tended to over-estimate their children’s sleep duration. Mean school night sleep duration was 9. 9 hours (SD = 0. 5) and non-school night sleep duration was 9. 5 hours (SD = 0. 7). No differences were identified between boys’ and girls’ sleep, and the 14 % of children categorised as being overweight did not exhibit significantly different sleep patterns from the rest of the sample. Modifiable factors of technology and caffeine use were associated with differences in children’s sleep, as were non-modifiable familial factors of shiftworking adults living in the home, childcare duration and finishing times, and younger children in the household. Recommendations for future research include increasing the size and diversity of the sample, extending actigraphic recording to at least 10 consecutive days and nights to incorporate two weekends, using PSG with a sub-sample of children, and implementing a longitudinal study...|$|E

Initiated by Trish Bould, Colin Harper, Belinda Mitchell in September 2005. The project engages debates in Fine Art and Fine Art Education Part one: An interactive and site specific work, Hartley Library University of Southampton 16 May – 27 June. Drawing Spaces: Picturing Knowledge, explodes {{the process of creating}} an artwork in the public space of a library, inviting contribution and providing access into what is usually a closed activity. The work, places drawing and art making at the centre of research activities in the University Library creating a dialogue between different research practices. ‘Drawing Spaces’ activates drawing as a forum through which, links can be established across traditional subject boundaries. A site specific work in Hartley Library has been used to activate and develop relationships with staff and students in other subject areas. Contributions were received from Maths, Physics, Engineering, Education, History, Oceanography, Medical Sciences, Economics, English, Archaeology, Design, Textile Conservation {{as well as from the}} Visual Arts. The project has established methods through which staff and students can work together on research activities and has involved students from a range of programmes at Winchester. Debates about Fine Art Practice and about Learning and Teaching are activated through the different parts of the project. Debates include: Research As a Means of Teaching, Sites of Interaction and Exchange (comparisons between the socialisation of space within a library and a lecture room as sites of art making and drawing), Authorship, Materiality and Process. Alongside the activities of the project, Trish Bould has establishing a web-based resource on blackboard.

The purpose of this study was to apply demographic techniques to primary historical education data to enable the progress of pupils to be quantified and to allow comparisons to be made among different Education Districts and longitudinally over a period of some three decades. The present work applies demographic methods using cohort and period analyses to overcome difficulties in direct comparisons of historical education data because of differences in population structure and differing examination pass rates in various Education Districts. This approach allows the determination of retention rates of pupils both by age and by level from Standard 4 to Standard 6 using primary data from the nineteenth century. In addition, gender differences in retention by age are analysed from the 1880 s to the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Previous published work considered school attendance only in general terms and usually on a national basis, but generally without analysing specific educational data on gender differences. Studies prior to the present work have suggested that in the nineteenth century Education Districts differed in school enrolments (Hodder, 1996) and it is thus likely that there were differences in school retention of pupils between various Education Districts. Pilot research to the present work developed demographic methods for studying retention of pupil populations allowing for changes in the number and structure of the pupils populations over time (Hodder, 2005). These <b>pilot</b> <b>methods</b> are applied in the present research to study pupil retention in all thirteen Education Districts over the approximately 30 years from the 1880 s. In addition to age and level cohorts, gender differences are analysed. Direct comparisons among all Education Districts and over time are now possible. This study has used a novel approach to the analysis of historical education data. The results enable comparisons to be made among all thirteen Education Districts and across several decades; such comparisons have not previously been possible and will facilitate future research on the possible factors affecting pupil retention particularly in relation to employment opportunities for school leavers and differences according to gender.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Central to {{the design}} of a {{randomised}} controlled trial (RCT) is a calculation of the number of participants needed. This is typically achieved by specifying a target difference, which enables the trial to identify a difference of a particular magnitude should one exist. Seven methods have been proposed for formally determining what the target difference should be. However, in practice, it may be driven by convenience or some other informal basis. It is unclear how aware the trialist community is of these formal methods or whether they are used. PURPOSE: To determine current practice regarding the specification of the target difference by surveying trialists. METHODS: Two surveys were conducted: (1) Members of the Society for Clinical Trials (SCT) : participants were invited to complete an online survey through the society's email distribution list. Respondents were asked about their awareness, use of, and willingness to recommend methods; (2) Leading UK- and Ireland-based trialists: the survey was sent to UK Clinical Research Collaboration registered Clinical Trials Units, Medical Research Council UK Hubs for Trial Methodology Research, and the Research Design Services of the National Institute for Health Research. This survey also included questions about the most recent trial developed by the respondent's group. RESULTS: Survey 1 : Of the 1182 members on the SCT membership email distribution list, 180 responses were received (15 %). Awareness of methods ranged from 69 (38 %) for health economic methods to 162 (90 %) for pilot study. Willingness to recommend among those who had used a particular method ranged from 56 % for the opinion-seeking method to 89 % for the review of evidence-base method. Survey 2 : Of the 61 surveys sent out, 34 (56 %) responses were received. Awareness of methods ranged from 33 (97 %) for the review of evidence-base and <b>pilot</b> <b>methods</b> to 14 (41 %) for the distribution method. The highest level of willingness to recommend among users was for the anchor method (87 %). Based upon the most recent trial, the target difference was usually one viewed as important by a stakeholder group, mostly also viewed as a realistic difference given the interventions under evaluation, and sometimes one that led to an achievable sample size. LIMITATIONS: The response rates achieved were relatively low despite the surveys being short, well presented, and having utilised reminders. CONCLUSION: Substantial variations in practice exist with awareness, use, and willingness to recommend methods varying substantially. The findings support the view that sample size calculation is a more complex process than would appear to be the case from trial reports and protocols. Guidance on approaches for sample size estimation may increase both awareness and use of appropriate formal methods...|$|E

A 28 -min, double-sided tape cassette containing extracts of sex workers talking candidly about their work was compiled from oral history recordings. The aims were to pilot process issues in compiling the collaborative resource, and to stimulate discussion of health and safety issues, exploring whether the resource could potentially enhance positive changes in sex workers' knowledge and awareness, self-esteem, and lifeskills. In a limited pilot distribution, 15 sex workers and seven outreach workers in London listened to the tape and completed short evaluation questionnaires. The paper sets out {{strengths and weaknesses of}} the <b>pilot</b> <b>method,</b> linking these to broader critical reflections on issues raised about peer education to, for and by sex workers...|$|R

A self-complete iterative double smoothing rule (^h_IDS) is introduced as a <b>pilot</b> <b>method.</b> The asymptotic properties of both ^h_IDS and ^h_MDS are investigated. It is shown that ^ h MDS performs asymptotically very well. Moreover, it is asymptotically negatively correlated with h ASE, the minimizer of the averaged squared error. The asymptotic performances of ^h_MDS and of the iterative plug-in method, ^h_IPL (Gasser et al., 1991) are compared. A comparative simulation study is carried out to show the practical perfor- mance of ^h_MDS and related methods. It is shown that ^h_MDS {{seems to be the}} best in the practice. Finite sample negative correlations between the chosen bandwidth selectors and h ASE are also studied. ...|$|R
