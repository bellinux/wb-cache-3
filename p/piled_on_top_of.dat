25|$|In Indonesia, sweet {{potatoes}} are locally known as ubi jalar (lit: spreading tuber) and are frequently fried with batter {{and served as}} snacks with spicy condiments, along with other kinds of fritters such as fried bananas, tempeh, tahu, breadfruits, or cassava. In the mountainous regions of West Papua, {{sweet potatoes}} are the staple food among the natives there. Using the bakar batu way of cooking (free translation: burning rocks), rocks that have been burned in a nearby bonfire are thrown into a pit lined with leaves. Layers of sweet potatoes, an assortment of vegetables, and pork are <b>piled</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the rocks.

25|$|However, Alessandro Volta, {{a friend}} and fellow scientist, disagreed, believing this {{phenomenon}} was caused by two different metals joined together by a moist intermediary. He verified this hypothesis through experiment, and published the results in 1791. In 1800, Volta invented the first true battery, which {{came to be known}} as the voltaic pile. The voltaic pile consisted of pairs of copper and zinc discs <b>piled</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each other, separated by a layer of cloth or cardboard soaked in brine (i.e., the electrolyte). Unlike the Leyden jar, the voltaic pile produced a continuous electricity and stable current, and lost little charge over time when not in use, though his early models could not produce a voltage strong enough to produce sparks. He experimented with various metals and found that zinc and silver gave the best results.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2010 Al Jazeera {{broadcast}} {{photographs that}} appeared to show the aftermath of Sri Lankan Army soldiers massacring civilians and executing Tamil Tigers {{in the final stages}} of the civil war. The graphic images showed dead bodies <b>piled</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each other, often naked. One of the photos showed what is believed to be the dead body of Prabhakaran's son. Some of the photos showed naked bodies with blindfolds and hands tied behind their backs. They appear to have been executed. Al Jazeera could not verify the authenticity of the photographs. It had obtained them from Tamils who said they had obtained the photos from someone in the Sri Lankan military. The Sri Lankan government reacted by calling the photos lies and fabrications. It claimed that some of the photos were the same as those broadcast by Channel 4 News in May 2010.

25|$|All mountain-building strata {{consists}} of sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid {{down on the}} seabed. The base of the mountain comprises muschelkalk beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains lead and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the Höllental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from {{the foot of the}} Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze {{it can be seen that}} this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were <b>piled</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> one another.|$|E

500|$|As well as {{supporting}} the Australian Army, Cannan was {{also responsible for}} providing {{a broad range of}} goods and services to the Americans. In no other theatre of war was local procurement of supplies by US forces as extensive or important as in the South West Pacific. Australian Reverse Lend Lease came to USD $1.1 billion, representing 13% of all reciprocal aid to the United States. Such figures understate the value of Australian aid, for every ton of supplies procured in Australia meant a ton that {{did not have to be}} shipped across the Pacific Ocean. This required the same shipping space as two tons of supplies shipped across in the Atlantic Ocean, the distance there being half as great. Cannan was responsible for rationing the American forces in Australia until the American Quartermaster Corps felt capable of taking over the function in 1943. When requirements to support the British Pacific Fleet were <b>piled</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> American demands and an increasing tight Army manpower situation, Cannan protested the [...] "lavishness and extravagance which characterised US demands whilst the Australian services' demands were being subjected to rigid scrutiny and economies", citing examples, and urged that economies be made on goods and services supplied to Allied countries. However the government was reluctant to take any action that might not be welcomed by American military and political leaders. Nonetheless, Prime Minister John Curtin did successfully persuade General Douglas MacArthur to rationalise his use of Australian resources in order to provide accommodation for the British Pacific Fleet.|$|E
