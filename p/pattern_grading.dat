The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate changes in diastolic function induced by surgical ventricular reconstruction at 2 time intervals after surgery (discharge and follow-up) and to assess the impact of diastolic changes on clinical outcome. MethodsA total of 129 patients (65 ± 9 years, 14 women) underwent echocardiographic Doppler evaluation before surgical ventricular reconstruction, at discharge, and at follow-up (median 7 months). Patients with mitral regurgitation were excluded. Diastolic <b>pattern</b> was <b>graded</b> as follows: 0 (normal), 1 (abnormal relaxation), 2 (pseudo normalization), 3 (restrictive, reversible), and 4 (restrictive, irreversible). ResultsAt follow-up, 28 (21. 7 %) of 129 patients showed a restrictive diastolic <b>pattern</b> (<b>grade</b> 3 – 4; group 1) and 101 did not (diastolic <b>pattern</b> <b>grade</b> 0 – 2; group 2). Preoperative and postoperative factors strongly associated with late diastolic restriction included sphericity index (higher in group 1), ventricular shape (nonaneurysmal shape more frequent in group 1), internal dimensions (greater in group 1), diastolic pattern (higher in group 1), ejection fraction (lower in group 1); left atrial dimensions (greater in group 1); mitral regurgitation rate (higher in group 1). At multivariate analysis the most powerful predictors of restriction were preoperative pseudonormalization of diastolic pattern (diastolic pattern 2) and septolateral dimensions (short axis). Overall, ejection fraction improved from 33 % ± 9 % to 40 % ± 9 % to 40 % ± 9 %; P =. 001; end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes decreased (112 ± 41 to 73 ± 21 to 88 ± 28 mL/m 2, respectively; P =. 001; and 77 ± 38 to 44 ± 17 to 52 ± 24 mL/m 2, respectively; P =. 001); New York Heart Association class improved (2. 4 ± 0. 8 to 1. 6 ± 0. 6; P =. 001).

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 <b>Pattern</b> <b>grading</b> is {{a method}} of {{creating}} multiple sizes of a garment style. Grading to extreme sizes is not recommended since the design and drape of the garment can be distorted. Researchers suggest that customized fit is a solution for creating sizes in a garment style. However, manufacturers continue to grade patterns because it saves time and costs less to produce the multiple sizes needed in production. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between fabric grain orientation and <b>pattern</b> <b>grading</b> and whether grading changes the drape of the garment. Different fabric grainlines and grade reference lines were used to determine the influence of traditional x and y coordinate grading methods on pattern shape and garment drape. A bias grain was used to determine if traditional x and y coordinate grading methods were appropriate for bias garments. It was thought that a bias garment would need new grade rules since the stretch of the bias could affect the overall fit and hang of the garment. A parametric model was developed in OptiTex™ software to represent a Misses size 12 and a dress pattern was then created and fit to this model. The pattern and model were then graded to a size 6 and a size 22. From the data, it appears that traditional grading methods and grading to larger and smaller sizes does not substantially affect the angle to the grainline at the grade points on the pattern perimeter. The center grade reference line in both the lengthwise and the bias dress was sufficient to produce additional garments that were similar to the base size pattern. The fit and drape of the original base size garment had the greatest influence on the fit and drape of the derived sizes. Therefore, if the garment grading increments are based on anthropometric data the fit and drape should be acceptable for individuals that are represented in the size data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Small-delay defects (SDDs) {{have become}} a major concern in {{nanometer}} technology designs. Traditional timingunaware transition-delay fault (TDF) ATPGs are not efficient in detecting SDDs since they tend to detect delay faults via shorter paths. Timing-aware ATPG tools have been proven to result in significantly large CPU runtime and pattern count. In this paper, we present a hybrid procedure that grades patterns {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in detecting SDDs and selects the most effective ones. The grading procedure is performed on a large repository of patterns generated by n-detect TDF ATPG and takes advantage of n-detect capability in detecting a delay fault n times from different paths. 1 -detect TDF ATPG is performed after <b>pattern</b> <b>grading</b> and selection to ensure same fault coverage as timingaware ATPG’s is obtained.

The body, which is ovoid in plan, is not exposed on surface, and is surrounded on all sides by fresh country rock. A narrow feeder conduit containing rocks of nepheline normafive composition extends downward from the orebody. The nature of the mineral zonation and the absence of hydrothermal alteration in the rocks above the Emery Lode are indicative of closed system conditions during mineralization. The ore fluid composition calculated on a basis of observed compositional changes in the host rocks resembles fluids which have been observed in experimental studies on alkaline rocks under hydrous conditions, and contains essentially water, soda, alumina, and silica, with lesser amounts of magnesium, calcium, copper, and sulfur. It is inferred that most of the metals were transported as anionic oxycomplexes in this alkaline fluid. These fluids reacted with country rocks, evolving continuously in consequence, l ading ultimately to the formation of a sericitic halo at the outer extremity of the orebody. Subsequent retrograde reaction resulted in zonation of ore and gangue mineral assemblages. The inferred composition of the ore fluid suggests an alkaline, undersaturated source magma...|$|E
