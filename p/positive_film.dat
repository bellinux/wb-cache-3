500|$|After the film's initial release, {{critical}} reception {{continues to}} be <b>positive.</b> <b>Film</b> scholar Andy Klein wrote that the film is [...] "almost a distillation of [...] post-1986 work. Even if the plot is full of holes, and the emotional tug isn't quite as strong as in The Killer, the action sequences (nearly the whole movie) are among the greatest ever filmed". Mark Salisbury of Empire Magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "Infinitely more exciting than a dozen Die Hards, action cinema doesn't come any better than this." [...] Salisbury compared Hard Boiled to Woo's American films, stating that his Hong Kong films are [...] "not as slick as his later films, [...] more inventive and stylised and [...] great early performances from Fat and Leung". Empire placed the film at number 70 in their list of [...] "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" [...] in 2010. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film the highest rating of four stars, proclaiming it {{to be one of}} Woo's best films.

500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and <b>positive</b> <b>film</b> from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E
500|$|Based {{on common}} misconceptions and {{stereotypes}} about men in nursing, Greg's profession is repeatedly {{brought up by}} Jack Byrnes in a negative context and the character of Greg Focker {{has come to be}} one of the best known film portrayals of a male nurse. Even though men dominated the profession in earlier times, there has been a feminization of the nursing profession over the course of the last century which has caused men in nursing to often be portrayed as misfits by the media. A common stereotype is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice, either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one. Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non-masculine attributes. Jack Byrnes is often seen openly criticizing Greg's career choice per his perception of nursing being an effeminate profession. In their book Men in Nursing: History, Challenges, and Opportunities authors Chad O'Lynn and Russell Tranbarger present this as an example of a negative portrayal. Commenting on the same issue but disagreeing, Barbara Cherry in her book Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, & Management called the portrayal of Greg as a nurse [...] "one of the most <b>positive</b> <b>film</b> portrayals of men who are nurses" [...] and commented that Greg [...] "humorously addresses and rises above the worst of all stereotypes that are endured by men in this profession." [...] Sandy and Harry Summers in the book Saving Lives: Why the Media's Portrayal of Nurses Puts Us All at Risk postulate that Greg's character, although intelligent and firm in his defense of his profession, [...] "might have done more to rebut the stereotypes" [...] while also reporting that [...] "some men in nursing" [...] expressed their opinions that it would have been better to not present the stereotypes at all.|$|E

40|$|Affective {{films are}} often used in emotion {{research}} and negative films are frequently used as an analogue for trauma (trauma film paradigm). However, different films are used with possibly distinct consequences. We aimed to investigate specific effects of four negative films covering distinct themes (physical, sexual, traffic and food), and tested neutral and <b>positive</b> <b>films</b> with matching content. Self-reported emotional responses and heart rate during the films were examined (immediate responses) as well as intrusions of the films in the subsequent week (delayed responses). Within each theme, negative films were rated as more unpleasant than the positive and neutral counterparts. They also evoked more negative emotions and more intrusive memories. Across themes, the four negative films {{did not differ in}} terms of valence and arousal, but clearly differed on immediate (e. g., disgust, embarrassment, heart rate) and delayed (intrusions) effects. Thus, we urge researchers to carefully select negative films for their studies, as different films seem to evoke distinct emotional responses. In addition, using <b>positive</b> <b>films</b> within the same themes is recommended in order to control for effects of arousal. In general, the specific film material should be considered when comparing effects across studies...|$|R

40|$|A {{solution}} {{is needed to}} counteract violent news, Internet, and other negative media images and management behaviors in the workplace, in order to boost engagement and prosocial behaviors at work. The purpose of this phenomenological {{study was to explore}} the attitudes of working professionals toward prosocial behaviors and employee engagement in the workplace as affected by transpersonal Hollywood films. An organization 2 ̆ 7 s ability to survive is directly related to empowerment and innovation. Classic films provide a gateway for transpersonal experiences that could change behavior and thoughts. Peterson and Seligman 2 ̆ 7 s transformational typology involving 6 character virtues and 24 strengths was the basis for coding 8 <b>positive</b> <b>films</b> that were viewed by participants. Data collection consisted of 2 in-depth interviews, 8 written film questionnaires, and an exit interview from a criterion-based, purposeful sample of 10 adult working nonmanagerial professionals living in Los Angeles, employed in any industry except the entertainment industry. Six to 10 participants, according to researchers, are an appropriate number for saturation. The most prevalent strengths mentioned were social intelligence and perspective, followed by integrity, hope and open-mindedness. Frequent phrases that corresponded to the 6 virtue categories were wisdom/knowledge and humanity. The results revealed that <b>positive</b> <b>films</b> could be a boon for industrial/organizational issues involving recruitment, training, motivation, and prosocial behaviors.
