5|$|The Mostyns' {{principal}} residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so {{the family}} rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 18th century the gatehouse {{was used as a}} courthouse and the main house as cheap housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers.|$|E

Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls {{from room to room}} {{until it was too late}} to extinguish.|$|E

25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as damp proofing considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in <b>partition</b> <b>walls,</b> others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} shophouses {{could easily}} be re-used for modern businesses, such as restaurants, cafes, bars and small shops. The interior of the buildings could be modified with the new use in mind, in some cases using new non-traditional interior ornamentation, materials, and colours. For instance, {{the interior of the}} Opera Cafe at No. 40 Boat Quay was modified to create an ambiance similar to an opera stage-set. The ground floor of the Lim Family Shophouse at No. 58 Boat Quay was converted into a Japanese restaurant. The upper floor is used as a weekend flat for the Lim family, who lived in the building since 1908. The architect Mok Wei Wei created more open space by demolishing some of the original <b>partition</b> <b>walls,</b> but kept and restored the original teak floors, paint colour on the window frames, wooden balcony doors, and tile roofs. The historic blackwood furniture and art pieces were also restored and re-used.|$|E

However, the most demanding part of the project was the construction, transport and installation of the armoured turrets and the armament itself. Two companies had been previously contracted for the construction of other fortifications in Sweden, Swedish AB Bofors-Gullspång and French Compagnie des Forges de Châtillon, offers from both companies existed already in 1901, {{but it was not until}} after tests conducted in December 1902 that the Swedish company was contracted and given royal approval on 26 May 1903.

500|$|The tornado struck several skyscrapers as {{it moved}} across {{downtown}} Fort Worth {{over the course of}} approximately a minute between 6:25 p.m CST (00:25 UTC) and 6:26p.m. CST (00:26 UTC). The first high-rise building impacted was the nine-story Cash America building, which was nearly destroyed by the tornado. All windows on the building's northwestern and southwestern faces were blown out by the strong winds, and the travertine stone façade framing the building's exterior crumbled. While a number of interior <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> and suspended ceilings collapsed, the building's steel frame remained intact. The tornado also peeled some of the brick masonry off the dome and five-story prayer tower of a nearby Baptist church. The tornado was at its peak strength when it struck the ten-story Mallick Tower, causing the building to lose most of its glass exterior. High-speed debris thrown up by the tornado broke windows in adjacent low-rise office and condominium buildings. Similar damage occurred to several other high-rises including the 35-story Bank One Tower, which lost 80percent of its 3,000windows; the Union Pacific Resources Building lost 1,300of its 5,000windows. The tornado eventually dissipated at 6:28p.m. CST (00:28UTC) near Interstate 35W after having spent ten minutes on the ground {{over the course of a}} four mile long and 250yd (230m) wide path. Across Fort Worth, 212homes were damaged, of which 28were destroyed.

40|$|Abstract A {{characterization}} of gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers has been performed {{in terms of}} pressure drop behavior and heat transfer performance. The gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers differ by <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> material, <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and flow arrangement. The pressure drop behavior has been analyzed due to the pressure losses in different sections of the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers. Increased pressure losses in front of and behind the micro channels have been detected due to modified geometries in the inlet and outlet distribution chambers. The heat transfer performance has been determined in terms of thermal effectiveness. The comparison among different <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> materials and <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thicknesses showed no significant criteria {{of the influence of}} thermal conductivity on the thermal effectiveness. An assessment due to an overall heat exchanger effectiveness has been performed to compare the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers. For this purpose, the overall exergy loss has been calculated by combination of thermal effectiveness and pressure losses. A strong impact of the exergy loss due to pressure drop has been detected which influences the overall exergy loss of the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers...|$|R
500|$|Upon its foundation, whenaccording to Green (1990)it {{was said}} to be a [...] "temporary expedient", the school was based at Stafford House, in East Street in the centre of Tonbridge. Previously used by private tutor Isaac Fleming in 1878, it was a {{building}} whose central urban position was, Taylor (1988) said, a [...] "major asset, and possibly the only one"; Headmaster Bryant [...] "bore its numerous shortcomings, its bricked ambience and grasslessness". Positioned in a narrow street and originally designed for 20 boarders, traffic noise, awkward arrangement and low pitch of the classrooms and the distance of the school from its playing fields made the building far from ideal. It underwent repairs and alterations to the value of £300, carried out by a local builder; several <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> were knocked down to form larger rooms, although this still restricted the bench length in even the widest of the rooms to , and 18 pupils. The floor of the main schoolroom was restored and lavatory closets and urinals were installed. Later, a carpentry shed was placed in the yard, and a [...] "Mr Russell" [...] was appointed as its first occupant in October 1889. [...] "Mr Beeching's field" [...] was usedat what Taylor (1988) considered [...] "an extortionate sum"for games, but it was unavailable for four months of the year when it was used to grow hay. Beeching ended this arrangement in April 1889, at which time the school used the [...] YMCA field, for £20 per year. In June of that year, a shed to house cricket equipment was constructed at the cost of £13/10s. It was soon decided that there was a need for more [...] "wholesome" [...] surroundings, and it was generally accepted that south Tonbridge would be more suitable {{for the development of a}} new school.|$|E
