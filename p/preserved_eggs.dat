This paper {{develops}} a rapid and nondestructive method for discrimination of lead (Pb) in <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> with different processing methods by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics. Ten batches of 331 unleaded eggs and six batches of 147 eggs processed with usage of PbO were collected and analyzed by NIR spectroscopy.

Traditionally, the gelling of <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> is tested {{intuitively}} by feeling the slight vibrations that {{occur when the}} preserved egg is tapped with a finger. However, the effects of extended tapping and individual subjectivity lead to inaccurate results.

Distinct vibration analysis revealed that a decay below 80 represents complete gelling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis reveals an area under curve of 0. 963, a cut-off point at 0. 000 (x axis) and 0. 882 (y axis), and a decay rate of 84. 7995. The accuracy was 96. 7 %.

While microscopic analysis of eggs in sediments of archeological sites often allows their taxonomic identification, this method is rarely effective at the species level, and requires both the survival of intact eggs and their proper identification.

However, so far it has mostly been applied to individual eggs isolated from archeological samples. To increase the throughput and taxonomic accuracy, as well as reduce costs of genotyping methods, we adapted a PCR-based approach coupled with next-generation sequencing to perform precise taxonomic identification of parasitic helminths directly from archeological sediments.

40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} a rapid and nondestructive method for analyzing the shelf life of <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> (pidan) by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and nonlinear multivariate calibration. A major concern with a nonlinear model {{is that the}} noncomposition-correlated spectral variations among pidan objects of different batches and production dates would unnecessarily increase model complexity and cause overfitting and degradation of prediction. To reduce the negative influence of unwanted spectral variations, stacked least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) with an ensemble of 62 commonly used preprocessing methods is proposed to automatically optimize data preprocessing and develop the nonlinear model. The analysis results indicate that stacked LS-SVM can obtain stable calibration model, and the prediction accuracy is improved compared with models with single-preprocessing methods. Since LS-SVM is much faster than its ordinary counterparts, stacked LS-SVM with ensemble preprocessing can be performed within an acceptable computational time. When the objects and spectral variations are very complex, the proposed method can provide {{a useful tool for}} data preprocessing and nonlinear multivariate calibration...|$|E
40|$|In this study, reduced {{graphene}} oxide (rGO) was electrochemically {{deposited on}} the surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) to prepare a disposable sensor for fast detection of Pb 2 + in foods. The SEM images showed that the rGO was homogeneously deposited onto the electrode surface with a wrinkled nanostructure, which provided 2 D bridges for electron transport and a larger active area for Pb 2 + adsorption. Results showed that rGO modification enhanced the activity of the electrode surface, and significantly improved the electrochemical properties of SPCE. The rGO modified SPCE (rGO-SPCE) was applied to detect Pb 2 + in standard aqueous solution, showing a sharp stripping peak and a relatively constant peak potential in square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). The linear range for Pb 2 + detection was 5 ~ 200 ppb (R 2 = 0. 9923) with a low detection limit of 1 ppb (S/N = 3). The interference of Cd 2 + and Cu 2 + at low concentrations was effectively avoided. Finally, the rGO-SPCE was used for determination of lead in real tap water, juice, <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> and tea samples. Compared with results from graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS), the results based on rGO-SPCE were both accurate and reliable, suggesting that the disposable sensor has great potential in application for fast, sensitive and low-cost detection of Pb 2 + in foods...|$|E

Data were pooled from gill net collections made in 1985 - 86 and 1999, resulting in a wide length range of mature female yellow perch (172 - 332 mm TL). The length - fecundity relationship was: log 10 F = - 3. 220 + 3. 223 log 10 TL (r 2 = 0. 89), where F = fecundity and TL = total length in mm. The mean <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> volume increased with yellow perch TL and was represented by the equation: log 10 V = - 2. 06 + 1. 10 log 10 TL (r 2 = 0. 48), where V = <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> volume (mL), and TL = total length.

40|$|Mechanisms of brood {{reduction}} {{were studied}} in Fiordland crested penguins (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) on Open Bay Islands from July through October 1989. I quantified behavioural and environmental causes of egg and chick loss {{at the time}} of laying, during incubation, and after hatching to evaluate hypotheses advanced to explain the unique patterns of hatching asynchrony and egg dimorphism in eudyptid penguins. Although first eggs experienced lower survival than second eggs and most losses occurred during the laying interval, aggression between adult penguins did not appear to contribute to egg loss at any time. Similarly, egg mortality was not influenced by the effects of nest crowding or cover, or by the degree of intraclutch egg dimorphism. Egg temperatures were measured throughout the incubation period with thermocouples implanted in <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs.</b> Recorded temperatures increased markedly after the laying of the second natural egg, but did not differ between eggs of different sizes within a nest. First eggs were not consistently incubated in the anterior nest position and that position did not confer a thermal disadvantage. However, first eggs hatched later than second eggs. Retarded brood patch development may contribute to lower egg temperatures during the laying interval. Chicks from larger, second-laid eggs were larger at hatching, and grew more rapidly than their siblings. Overt aggression between feeding chicks was not observed and begging and feeding rates appeared to be similar. Nonetheless, large chicks experienced higher survival to the creche stage. Intra-clutch egg dimorphism was negatively correlated with the number of days two chicks survived in the same nest, but there was no relationship between survival and hatching asynchrony...|$|E
40|$|Protoporphyrin (PP) and biliverdin (BV) {{give rise}} to the {{enormous}} diversity in avian egg coloration. Egg color serves several ecological purposes, including post-mating signaling and camouflage. Egg camouflage represents a major character of open-nesting birds which accomplish protection of their unhatched offspring against visually oriented predators by cryptic egg coloration. Cryptic coloration evolved to match the predominant shades of color found in the nesting environment. Such a selection pressure {{for the evolution of}} colored or cryptic eggs should be present in all open nesting birds and relatives. Many birds are open-nesting, but protect their eggs by continuous brooding, and thus exhibit no or minimal eggshell pigmentation. Their closest extant relatives, crocodiles, protect their eggs by burial and have unpigmented eggs. This phylogenetic pattern led to the assumption that colored eggs evolved within crown birds. The mosaic evolution of supposedly avian traits in non-avian theropod dinosaurs, however, such as the supposed evolution of partially open nesting behavior in oviraptorids, argues against this long-established theory. Using a double-checking liquid chromatography ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry routine, we traced the origin of colored eggs to their non-avian dinosaur ancestors by providing the first record of the avian eggshell pigments protoporphyrin and biliverdin in the eggshells of Late Cretaceous oviraptorid dinosaurs. The eggshell parataxon Macroolithus yaotunensis can be assigned to the oviraptor Heyuannia huangi based on exceptionally preserved, late developmental stage embryo remains. The analyzed eggshells are from three Late Cretaceous fluvial deposits ranging from eastern to southernmost China. Reevaluation of these taphonomic settings, and a consideration of patterns in the porosity of completely <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> support an at least partially open nesting behavior for oviraptorosaurs. Such a nest arrangement corresponds with our reconstruction of blue-green eggs for oviraptors. According to the sexual signaling hypothesis, the reconstructed blue-green eggs support the origin of previously hypothesized avian paternal care in oviraptorid dinosaurs. Preserved dinosaur egg color not only pushes the current limits of the vertebrate molecular and associated soft tissue fossil record, but also provides a perspective on the potential application of this unexplored paleontological resource...|$|E
40|$|The Lourinha Formation, {{cropping}} out on {{the western}} shore of Portugal, dated from the Late Kimmeridgian to latest Tithonian-earliest Berriasian, has produced an extensive record of fossil vertebrates, including nine localities with nests, eggs and embryos. In four of these localities, Paimogo N and S, Casal da Rola and Peralta, associated with dinosaur egg material, several thinner eggshell fragments were recovered. Besides the fragments, 3 partial eggs were found. In a fifth locality, in Cambelas, a nest with 13 mostly well <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> was recovered. In average, these eggs are 42 mm long and 26 mm wide. A preliminary observation suggested a crocodilian affiliation based on eggshell features such as tabular ultrastructure, wedge-shaped shell units and triangular blocky extinction. We found that, excluding the small nest, all the samples exhibit a clear, outer diagenetic layer (DL) with recrystallized and secondary calcite. The typical crocodiloid ultrastructure and shell units are present, although faint and not always clearly defined; strong sub-horizontal fracturing precludes a more extensive description. No ultrastructure is observable in the nest sample. The presence of basal plate group knobs on the inner eggshell surface are also diagnostic. Three layers can be differentiated {{in three of the}} samples, with an inner or mammillary layer corresponding to the dark basal knobs, a medium layer characterized by the presence of the tabular ultrastructure, and an outer layer, below the DL, distinguishable from the medium layer by a darker thin band. Furthermore, all the samples show the distinct triangular blocky alternating extinction. The thicknesses range between 163 μm and 392 μm, which is consistent with values for fossil crocodiloid eggshells. The density of the mammillae is very similar to what is observable in extant eggshells, as are the pores, with long, straight canals. Moreover, the ellipsoid shape of the eggs is typically crocodilian, even though such shape is shared with some dinosaur eggs. Thus, this analysis allows us to ascribe it to the oofamily Krokolithidae, making it the oldest crocodylomorph eggs known so far, as well as the best record for eggs of non-crocodylian crocodylomorphs. Based on the morphological characters, we tentatively assign it to the oogenus Krokolithes. The structure of crocodilian eggshells is very conservative and has seemingly remained unchanged since at least the Late Jurassic...|$|E

40|$|Introduced in the 1960 s and 1970 s, Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and Bighead Carp (H. nobilis), collectively called Asian Carp in the US, have {{invaded the}} Mississippi River Basin and are {{expanding}} their range, threatening ecosystem integrity. Impounded sections on the Upper Mississippi River associated with lock and dams may be poor habitats for reproduction and recruitment {{due to their}} lentic flow characteristics and perceived lack of adequate spawning habitat. However, tributaries connected to the impounded sections possess several requirements needed for successful spawning and observations of adults are becoming more prevalent. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the reproductive status of Asian Carp populations in these tributary systems. Models have been created to determine the thermal and hydrologic suitability of rivers for reproduction. However, these models focus on the general feasibility of reproduction in a river and do not attempt to pinpoint river locations best suited for adult spawning. Furthermore, efforts to confirm areas of current establishment have largely relied upon the detection of early life stages. However, discrepancies and lack of information on morphological egg characteristics of Asian Carp and native species has made traditional visual identification of fish eggs difficult and unreliable. Therefore, the overarching goal of this thesis {{was to provide a}} set of tools to predict, identify, and analyze Asian Carp reproduction. The three main objectives to achieve this goal were to develop an egg identification tool that could identify Asian Carp eggs preserved in ethanol, to determine reproductive dynamics in three tributary rivers connected to the mainstem Upper Mississippi River, and to develop a GIS model to predict the most likely locations for Asian Carp reproduction in the Des Moines River. Results demonstrate that a combination of morphometric measurements from genetically identified ethanol <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> in a random forests classification model was a good alternative for Asian Carp (Bighead, Grass and Silver carps combined) egg identification. Back calculated spawn dates of Asian Carp eggs and larvae collected in the Des Moines, Iowa and Skunk rivers suggest that peak spawning occurs during late May and June, coinciding with a substantial decrease in adult GSI and increase in post spawn females; however, spawning occurred as late as August. Egg and larval spawn dates were within the spawning optimum when water temperatures were 18 to 30 ÃÂ°C and channel velocities were 0. 7 m/s or higher. Spawning occurred on rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph at 24 and 48 h intervals, indicating a rising hydrograph was not necessary for spawning. Densities of eggs and larvae were higher in the downriver section compared to the upriver section within each tributary during both years. Densities among tributaries were similar in 2014 and but were significantly higher in the Des Moines River than the Iowa and Skunk rivers during 2015. Densities among the three confluence sites were similar for the Iowa and Skunk during each year. However, densities among sites associated with the Des Moines River confluence were higher in the mainstem Upper Mississippi River in 2014 and higher in the tributary site near the mouth in 2015. Back-calculated drift distances of eggs indicated reproductive GIS models were able to predict reproduction areas in the upper portions of the lower Des Moines River but were less successful at identifying areas where reproduction was documented in the lower portions. Collectively, this thesis documents the first observations of Asian Carp spawning in Upper Mississippi River tributaries in Iowa. Back calculated drift distances of eggs, spatiotemporal variation in egg and larval densities, and adult reproductive assessments suggest that Asian Carp reproduction may be ubiquitous throughout some tributaries, such as the Des Moines River; however, reproductive concentration varies annually. Asian Carp reproduction and subsequent establishment in the Upper Mississippi River tributaries could provide sources of recruitment for the impounded sections of the Upper Mississippi River and other areas of poor reproduction, further expanding Asian Carp distribution in the US...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to probe into the relationship between spectrum analysis and eggshell with non-destructive and non-contact inspecting strategies.

Besides, figuring out a non-contact automatic eggshell crack inspecting system is a special objective in the future.

Improving the eggshell quality detector under the automatic eggshell cracks inspecting system to decrease the damage and inaccuracy of the surface eggshell. Integrating previous researching result, complete the eggshell detector and develop the facilities of “eggshell crack inspecting system. ” And the electronic design of eggshell crack detector has been developed. The automatic inspecting system represents the first device for both hen and duck eggs. A non-contact eggshell crack spectrum analysis is developed with Laser Doppler Vibrometer. The experiment shows complete eggshells have two main resonant frequencies in the spectrum analysis. Cracked eggshells have three main resonant frequencies in the spectrum analysis. In this way, no matter the frequency range of Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement is between 0 - 10 k Hz, 0 - 5 k Hz, or 0 - 1 k Hz, the scan measurement for cracked eggshells can be judged as long as the third resonant frequency is found and the single measurement far the cracked eggshells can be judged as long as the third resonant frequency is found. Therefore, Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement is a new breakthrough for eggshell crack measurement.

Data were pooled from gill net collections made in 1985 - 86 and 1999, resulting in a wide length range of mature female yellow perch (172 - 332 mm TL). The length- fecundity relationship was: log 10 F =- 3. 220 + 3. 223 log 10 TL (r 2 = 0. 89), where F = fecundity and TL = total length in mm. The mean <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> volume increased with yellow perch TL and was represented by the equation: log 10 V =- 2. 06 + 1. 10 log 10 TL (r 2 = 0. 48), where V = <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> volume (mL), and TL = total length. These results reveal that larger females produced both more and larger eggs than smaller females. Therefore, intense harvest targeting large yellow perch (primarily females) in the 1980 s and 1990 s may have {{had an effect on}} {{the quantity and quality of}} eggs spawned by the population, possibly resulting in reduced recruitment. 3 Fecundity may be defined as the spawning potential of fish for a particular season or alternatively, the number of ripening eggs in a female prior to the next spawnin...|$|R
