500|$|Lavigne {{released}} her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, {{was released in}} summer 2009 in Europe, {{and later in the}} US and Canada. When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, [...] "I wanted [...] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [...] Black Star won the 2010 Best [...] "Women's Scent Mass" [...] by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, Forbidden Rose, which took two years to develop. It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, <b>praline</b> agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. Its message is an extension of Black Star's [...] "follow your dreams", though the tagline for the new perfume is [...] "Dare to Discover". The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is [...] "Dare to discover more".

The latter is perhaps best represented in the [...] "Cheese Shop" [...] and by Cleese's Mr <b>Praline</b> character, the man with a dead Norwegian Blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named [...] "Eric".

40|$|In this study, <b>pralines</b> {{manufactured}} by hand were evaluated sensorially. These <b>pralines</b> {{were obtained from}} dark chocolate containing 60 % cocoa components, filled with Apis mellifera carnica Poll drone larvae, blossom honey and a blossom honey/pollen mixture from the protected region of Stara Planina-Eastern Serbia (a specific botanical region). The objectives {{of this study were}} investigations related to the use of sensory analysis for quality assessment of new functional products with potential benefits for human health, in particular of desserts based on dark chocolate <b>pralines</b> filled with different bee products characterized by a specific botanical and geographic origin, as well as of their storage properties and expected shelf life. Sensory quality (appearance, texture, odor and taste were evaluated by a group of experienced panelists immediately after the production (day 0), and then after 30, 90 and 180 days of storage under ambient conditions (temperature 18 – 20 °C). The results were statistically analyzed by the two-factorial analysis of variance (MANOVA) and with the LSD-test. It is possible to conclude that the storage time and composition of dark chocolate <b>pralines</b> containing different honey-bee products have statistically highly significant (p < 0. 01) influence on the sensorially evaluated properties of <b>pralines...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The powder made by {{grinding}} up such caramel-coated nuts is called pralin, {{and is an}} ingredient in many cakes, pastries, and ice creams. After this powder has been mixed with chocolate, it becomes <b>praliné</b> in French, which gave birth to what is known in French as chocolat <b>praliné.</b> The word <b>praliné</b> is used colloquially in France and Switzerland to refer to these, known simply as [...] "chocolates" [...] in English, i.e. various centres coated with chocolate. [...] In mainland Europe, the word <b>praline</b> {{is often used to}} mean either this nut powder or the chocolate paste made from it, widely used to fill chocolates, hence its use (by synecdoche) in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom to refer to filled chocolates in general. In the United Kingdom, the term can refer either to <b>praline</b> (the filling for chocolates) or, less commonly, to the original whole-nut pralines.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Ross' Monty Python Encyclopedia {{notes that}} Mr <b>Praline</b> {{has become a}} beloved figure within the Python canon.
