30|$|Inspection of the {{photographs}} of the plots shows that a shrub layer had started to develop in the unplanted plot by 14 years and a tree stratum was present by 37 years. Of particular note is that this area now has a shrub layer of the density (but not richness) found in the jarrah forest and also a dense litter layer (Figure  1). The <b>planted</b> <b>plot</b> had developed a dense tree stratum by 14 years, along with a dense understorey. However, by 37 years the understorey had almost completely disappeared, leaving a dense litter layer (Figure  2). The seeded plot immediately developed a shrub layer by 2 years and this was still present after 14 years. However, it had completely collapsed by 37 years, leaving a dense litter layer and stems of dead, short-lived understorey species such as Acacia spp. (Figure  2). Throughout {{the duration of the}} study the forest underwent fluctuations in shrub density, having experienced at least one forest fire, although it did not change appreciably in structure over the entire 37 -year period (Figure  1).|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{conversion}} of plantations into natural forests has attracted increasing attention, but {{little is known about}} how to convert a windthrown plantation into a natural forest. We examined the initial 3 -year effects of salvage logging, site preparation, planting, and weeding in comparison with the effects of legacy retention after a typhoon blowdown on the changes in terrestrial environments and plant compositions and the similarity of the species composition to that of the intact natural forest. Our major findings are as follows: (1) A homogeneous, sunny, and flat environment continued for 3 years in the planted and weeded plot, whereas a heterogeneous environment was observed in the legacy retention plot; however, the light environment changed slightly in the <b>planted</b> <b>plot.</b> (2) The species composition in the planted plots changed greatly due to invasion by annual, biennial, and perennial herbs and early successional trees. Alien species also invaded the planted row. Conversely, the species composition changed little in the legacy retention, which was likely due to the presence of residual plants that prevented shade-intolerant species from being established. (3) The legacy retention, followed by the residual row, was the closest to the natural forest with respect to species composition, whereas the planted row was the most dissimilar from the natural forest. Legacy retention appears to be the most appropriate way to restore a natural forest immediately after a windthrow, yet supplemental planting may be necessary to restore the desired broadleaved species...|$|E
40|$|Douglas W. TallamyThe {{proliferation}} of alien plants and their widespread replacement of native plants {{is predicted to}} negatively affect the insect community. Conservation biocontrol seeks to protect natural enemies, such as predators and parasitoids, through methods such as habitat management, in which plants are used to provide necessary resources to natural enemies. Native plants may support a stronger population of natural enemies than exotic plants. Bagworm and polyphemus moth larvae were placed in alien and native <b>plant</b> <b>plots,</b> and their survival was tracked until pupation. It was predicted that <b>plots</b> <b>planted</b> with native plants would have enhanced natural enemy communities, resulting in increased mortality in caterpillar larvae. Thus, larval survival {{would serve as a}} relative measure of the natural enemy community in <b>plots</b> <b>planted</b> with alien <b>plants</b> versus <b>plots</b> <b>planted</b> with native plants. No difference was found between the survival of bagworm larvae between alien and native plots.

40|$|Grapevine leafroll {{disease is}} one of the most severe viral {{diseases}} of grapevine worldwide. It is associated to a range of closterovirid species named Grapevine leafroll-associated virus (GLRaV) - 1, - 2, etc. In France, GLRaV- 1 and - 3 (genus Ampelovirus) are highly prevalent in vineyards and are disseminated along with exchange of infected material, as well as by natural vectors, the scale insects (Hemiptera, Pseudococcidae and Coccidae). Deeper knowledge on the epidemiology and the transmission of leafroll (Herrbach et al., APS book, in press) will help to improve the protection of grapevine against this severe syndrome. Virus–vector specificity studies revealed that the pseudococcid Phenacoccus aceris is able to vector the ampeloviruses GLRaV- 1, - 3, - 4, - 5, - 6, and - 9, as well as the vitiviruses Grapevine virus A (GVA) and GVB (Le Maguet et al., 2012, EJPP). This emphasizes the attention to be paid to this Holarctic widespread species. In addition, the coccid Neopulvinaria innumerabilis was shown to transmit GLRaV- 1 and GVA (Le Maguet, 2012, PhD thesis). Finally, the retention over two weeks of the RNA of GLRaV- 1, - 3 and GVA in the viruliferous vector was assessed by RT-PCR in the pseudococcid Heliococcus bohemicus and the coccid Parthenolecanium corni. The spatio-temporal dispersal of leafroll in a young vineyard in Burgundy has been surveyed over 8 years (Le Maguet et al., 2013, Phytopathology). Leafroll symptoms spread rapidly from the edges to virtually the entire plot. Biostatistical and molecular analyses showed that the vectors and the ampelovirus originated from the adjacent plots, heavily Ph. aceris–infested and GLRaV- 1 – infected, highlighting the risk generated by leafroll-affected neighboring plots to newly healthyplanted plots. Field experiments were set up to estimate the possible natural spread by the wind of Pa. corni L 1 and L 2 larvae from infested vineyards to a newly <b>planted</b> <b>plot,</b> by using sticky traps (Hommay et al., 2012, ICVG). Results reveal that L 1 larvae ('crawlers') were commonly trapped and that some of them were viruliferous.

Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted in Indiana to measure growth of different cover crops and their effects on soil properties. The objective of the greenhouse experiment was to study the response of three varieties of oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus) 2 ̆ 7 Groundhog 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Maximus 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Terranova 2 ̆ 7 to two soil bulk densities (1. 15 and 1. 45 g/cm 3) and two plant populations (50 and 163 plants/m 2). The experiment was arranged as a randomized complete block design and was conducted in spring and repeated in fall 2010. The lower radish populations, compared to the higher population, had greater tuber length and diameter, greater total shoot and root N concentrations, and lower leaf dry weight and N mass per bucket. Radishes grown with higher soil bulk density had smaller shoot height and greater tuber diameter than when grown at the lower soil bulk density. Groundhog had greater leaf dry weight, greater tuber length, smaller tuber diameter, and higher shoot N mass compared to Maximus and Terranova, which {{did not differ from}} each other. Root N concentrations were higher in Maximus than the other varieties. ^ The objective of the field experiment at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) was to evaluate the effects of different cover crops on soil aggregation, water infiltration rate, plant N and soil NO 3 and NH 4 concentrations. The experimental design was split-plot, with 4 blocks, two planting dates, six cover crop species including teff (Eragrostis tef), pearlmillet (Pennisetum glaucum), hybrid sorghum sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor x S. bicolor var. Sudanese), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and non-dormant alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and the fallow control plot. On early planted plots, cowpea and sudangrass produced more biomass than the other treatments, and cowpea had the highest shoot N mass and concentration. On late planted plots, radish scavenged the same amount of N from a fertilizer application and residual soil N as was fixed and scavenged by cowpea. The study at ACRE showed that non-legume plots had higher soil NO 3 and NH 4 concentrations at the early sampling date due to fertilizer addition, but decreased over time due to N uptake by the cover crops. On the legume plots, soil NO 3 concentrations increased over time due to nitrogen fixation. On the late planted plots, the control plot had higher NO 3 concentrations than other treatments since there were no crops to scavenge soil N. Aggregate stability analyses in November on the early planted plots showed that grass cover crops had greater aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) than other treatments, where teff had the greatest and control had the lowest aggregate MWDs. Aggregate analyses from the late <b>planted</b> <b>plot</b> showed that teff again had the greatest but radish and control plots had the lowest aggregate MWDs.

40|$|Abstract: Drained depressional {{wetlands}} {{are typically}} restored by plugging ditches or breaking drainage tiles to allow recovery of natural ponding regimes, while relying on passive recolonization from seed banks and dispersal to establish emergent vegetation. However, in restored depressions {{of the southeastern}} United States Coastal Plain, certain characteristic rhizomatous graminoid species may not recolonize because they are dispersal-limited and uncommon or absent in the seed banks of disturbed sites. We tested whether selectively planting such wetland dominants could facilitate restoration by accelerating vegetative cover development and suppressing non-wetland species. In an operational-scale project in a South Carolina forested landscape, drained depressional wetlands were restored in early 2001 by completely removing woody vegetation and plugging surface ditches. After forest removal, tillers of two rhizomatous wetland grasses (Panicum hemitomon, Leersia hexandra) were transplanted into singlespecies blocks in 12 restored depressions that otherwise were revegetating passively. Presence and cover of all plant species appearing in <b>planted</b> <b>plots</b> and unplanted control plots were recorded annually. We analyzed vegetation composition after two and four years, during a severe drought (2002) and after hydrologic recovery (2004). Most grass plantings established successfully, attaining 15 %– 85 % cover in two years. <b>Planted</b> <b>plots</b> had fewer total species and fewer wetland species compared to control plots, but differences were small. <b>Planted</b> <b>plots</b> achieved greater total vegetative cover during the drought and greater combined cover of wetland species in both years. By 2004, planted grasses appeared to reduce cover of non-wetland species in some cases, but wetter hydrologic conditions contributed more strongly to suppression of non-wetland species. Because these two grasses typically form a dominant cover matrix in herbaceous depressions, our results indicated that planting selected species could supplement passive restoration by promoting a vegetative structure closer to that of natural wetlands...|$|R

The objectives of this study were to verify the spatial dependence of the fresh biomass of snap beans and to dimension the number of plants and harvests that are necessary to improve experimental accuracy in trials. The data of the fresh biomass of snap beans from uniformity trials carried out in a greenhouse and in the field with semivariograms were created with data transformed into indicators. Thus, they were combined on scenarios of plot size and harvest grouping, and they were adjusted to the spherical, exponential and Gaussian models. A response surface was also applied, with the variation coefficient as a dependent variable and the numbers of <b>plants</b> per <b>plot</b> and harvests as independent variables. The estimates of the semivariogram models parameters indicated a weak spatial dependence. The average of the fresh biomass of snap beans is distributed randomly in the trials, and it is not influenced by the number of <b>plants</b> per <b>plot</b> or by the number of grouped harvests.

In this system, water and nutrition are two important things for plant to growth. In the tropical area such as Indonesia, air temperature is main constraint in the plant production system. Increasing air temperature inside the greenhouse has positive correlation to the raising temperature of nutrient solution which affected to the ability of the plant to absord the nutrition. The effective way to anticipate increasing of its temperature is by using the cooling system of nutrient solution before circulated to the plant.

Regardless of treatment, densities of scale insects parasitized by Encarsia citrina (Craw.) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) were often positively correlated with total densities of scales available.

However, high parasitism rates were occasionally correlated with low densities of scales in the subsequent generation. Neither the amount of flowers themselves nor flowering plant biomass were associated with parasitism rate or scale density. The combined results indicate euonymus scale populations were likely influenced by a combination of parasitism by E. citrina and some unknown factor(s) unrelated to the presence of flowering plants. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{pine weevil}} (Hylobius abietis (L.)) {{is one of}} the most {{destructive}} pests in Swedish conifer plantations. Many efforts have been made to reduce its damage by the use of insecticides, planting site preparation, physical barriers and other management practices. A number of studies show the importance of ants in pest management in different systems. In this study I test the hypothesis that a high density of ants reduces damage on conifer seedlings by the pine weevil. The study was conducted on two clearcut areas in the Lunsen forest S of Uppsa-la, Sweden. In total, 900 Norway spruce seedlings (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were <b>planted</b> (divided into <b>plots</b> with 25 seedlings) and different measures of the weevil’s damage were assessed, i. e. proportions of attacked and girdled seedlings, and mean feeding area. Densities of the ant species Formica polyctena and Myrmica ruginodis were obtained weekly by pitfall traps placed in each <b>planting</b> <b>plot.</b> No significant relationship between ant density and weevil damage was found when tested by means of the Spearman’s correlation. Results elucidating the process of pine weevils damaging seedlings are reported...|$|R
40|$|The final project {{monitoring}} {{results show that}} the manatee grass transplanting effort was completed successfully. First, the donor site monitoring indicated that disturbances caused by harvesting were fully mitigated within the two year study period. Second, about 1300 m 2 of manatee grass were established in an area previously devoid of this species. Third, {{at the end of the}} study period the per unit area above ground biomass of the restored manatee grass in several of the <b>planting</b> <b>plots</b> was similar to, or may have exceeded the biomass of the donor grass at the time of harvest. Finally, several of the restored meadows have been actively expanding in area coverage at a rate similar to natural growing manatee grass meadows...|$|R

The samples were oven-dried at 80 °C for 48 h before grinding using a Willey mill {{before they were}} subjected to a routine chemical analysis.|$|R
