5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path <b>problem,</b> <b>or</b> vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E

5|$|In graph algorithms, {{the widest}} path {{problem is the}} problem of finding a path between two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the path. The widest path problem is also known as the bottleneck shortest path <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> the maximum capacity path problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any <b>problem,</b> <b>or</b> even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E
5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a <b>problem,</b> <b>or</b> in electric field seekers.|$|E

5|$|In about 701 Bede {{wrote his}} first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were {{intended}} {{for use in the}} classroom. He continued to write {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts of the Apostles that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech <b>problem,</b> <b>or</b> merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.|$|E

30|$|In 2006, the CALD status {{variable}} {{and a number}} of other CALD related variables showed a significant association with reported gambling problems. Being a member of the CALD population was significantly associated with reduced levels of reporting gambling <b>problems</b> (<b>OR</b> 0.38, CI 0.21 to 0.68). The variable combining country of birth and main language spoken at home was also significantly associated with reported gambling problems, with people not born in Australia and not speaking English at home (equivalent to the CALD population) being associated with reduced reporting of gambling problems, while people born in Australia and not speaking English at home had marginally non-significant association with increased reporting of gambling <b>problems</b> (<b>OR</b> 2.14, CI 0.95 to 4.85). People who spoke either a southern, south-eastern or eastern Asian language reported fewer gambling <b>problems</b> (<b>OR</b> 0.14, CI 0.04 to 0.54), though this was marginally non-significant (p[*]=[*] 0.067), while people not speaking English very well, also reported significantly (p[*]=[*] 0.015) fewer gambling <b>problems</b> (<b>OR</b> 0.30, CI 0.14 to 0.65). People whose region of birth was from New Zealand or Oceania reported significantly higher levels of gambling <b>problems</b> (<b>OR</b> 2.16, CI 1.04 to 4.49).|$|R
