25|$|A 1GB {{portion of}} Half-Life 2 became {{available}} for <b>pre-load</b> through Steam on August 26, 2004. This meant that customers {{could begin to}} download encrypted game files to their computer before the game was released. When the game's release date arrived, customers were {{able to pay for}} the game through Steam, unlock the files on their hard drives and play the game immediately, without having to wait for the entire game to download. The <b>pre-load</b> period lasted for several weeks, with several subsequent portions of the game being made available, to ensure all customers had a chance to download the content before the game was released.|$|E
25|$|In {{the acute}} setting, the stroke {{volume of the}} left {{ventricle}} is increased (increased ejection fraction); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV {{and a decrease in}} ejection fraction. The increase in stroke volume is explained by the Frank–Starling mechanism, in which increased ventricular <b>pre-load</b> stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forceful.|$|E

It was available for <b>pre-load</b> and pre-purchase through Steam on May 1, 2006, with [...] and [...] immediately available for play as part of the package. Episode One is available as part of a bundle package known as The Orange Box, which also includes Half-Life 2, , Team Fortress 2, and Portal; and is available for Mac, PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. [...] About 1.4 million retail copies of Episode One were sold by 2008.|$|E
30|$|A typical wheel/rail {{rolling contact}} solving process {{includes}} two parts. Part 1 : calculate the initial <b>pre-loading</b> (the static deformation and stress of equilibrium state) of wheel/rail rolling contact under gravity. Part 2 : initialize the initial <b>pre-loading</b> including the deformation and stress (calculated in Part 1) and then explicitly solve the transient wheel/rail rolling contact process. Note {{that the initial}} <b>pre-loading</b> calculated in Part 1 is to ensure the wheelset achieves a steady-state rolling.|$|R
40|$|Of {{the limited}} past {{investigations}} of how thin shell roofs respond to earthquakes, {{attention has been}} largely restricted to linear analysis, with contributions from <b>pre-loading</b> usually neglected. The present paper first analyses the effects of <b>pre-loading</b> on the natural vibration spectra using a newly developed analytical method. Results of this investigation indicate that inclusion of self weight and additional superimposed loading can significantly reduce the predicted natural frequencies. Parameter studies illustrate {{the importance of the}} inclusion of <b>pre-loading</b> on the maximum isplacement and stress responses, of a set of cylindrical roof shells having different geometries, when subject to the vertical motions of a typical earthquake. Inclusion of <b>pre-loading</b> is shown to have possibly major influences on the levels of deformations and the associated membrane and bending stresses. It is concluded that performing a modal analysis in which the effects of <b>pre-loading</b> are ignored could lead to serious underestimation of responses for large roof shells subject to earthquake loading...|$|R

40|$|Aims: <b>Pre-loading,</b> the {{consumption}} of off-sale alcohol within private settings before socialising in licenced premises, is common among young people. The research explored young people’s accounts of <b>pre-loading</b> within their experience of wider peer group drinking occasions in the UK. Methods: Fourteen semi-structured focus group {{interviews were conducted with}} peer groups of young people (N[*]=[*] 70, 16 – 21 [*]years) and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: <b>Pre-loading</b> with friends prior to a ‘night out’ drinking in public spaces was a common sequential practice within their collective drinking experiences. Although traditionally conceptualised within policy, academic and media discourse as drinking in the domestic sphere before entering licenced premises, young people also considered drinking within the home prior to attending private parties (e. g. house parties) as <b>pre-loading.</b> Price was represented as a key, yet not sole, motivating factor and pre-drinking alcohol held importance in reaching a desired state of intoxication that enhanced shared fun and pleasure among both young men and women. However, the social (e. g. chatting with friends, taking photographs) and preparatory activities (e. g. ‘getting ready’) at play during <b>pre-loading</b> appeared to hold more importance to young women, in promoting group bonding and in the creation and management of heterosexual feminine identities both on- and off-line. Conclusions: Although price is important, there is a wider social and cultural significance of <b>pre-loading</b> as a gendered phenomenon. Young people apply a wider definition of <b>pre-loading</b> that incorporated {{the consumption}} of off-sale alcohol prior to parties within private settings...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fracture load and failure mode of all-ceramic crowns with different ceria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia/alumina nanocomposite (Ce-TZP/A) framework designs. Four frameworks (anatomical shape: AS, with a buccal or lingual supporting structure: BS and LS, or buccal and lingual supporting structures: BLS) were fabricated. All frameworks were veneered with porcelain to fabricate all-ceramic crowns followed by cementation to tooth analogs. The fracture load of each crown either without or with <b>pre-loading</b> (1. 2 million cycles, 49 N) was measured. The failure mode was classified into partial or complete fracture. Differences were tested for significance (p < 0. 05) by a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s test and by Fisher’s exact test, respectively. Without <b>pre-loading,</b> supporting structures did not influence the fracture load or failure mode. Partial fractures were the most common failure mode. <b>Pre-loading</b> promoted the severity of the failure mode, although the fracture load among the framework designs was not influenced. In the AS group, prefailures were observed during <b>pre-loading,</b> and complete fractures were significantly increased after <b>pre-loading.</b> In contrast, the failure mode of the BLS group remained unchanged, showing only partial fracture even after <b>pre-loading.</b> This Ce-TZP/A framework design, comprised of an anatomical shape with additional buccal and lingual structures, has the potential to reduce the chipping of the veneering porcelain...|$|R

5000|$|The {{mechanic}} installs {{the solid}} lifter and rotates the engine crank until the cam {{is on the}} [...] "base circle" [...] (not on any intake or exhaust cam lobe). An adjustable-length push-rod checking tool is then installed on the valve location being checked. The pushrod length checking tool is extended until there is no slop (zero lash). Then, the checking tool is removed and measured. The mechanic then adds [...]030-.090" [...] of additional length, depending on the specifications of the lifter being installed. [...] A more typical <b>pre-load</b> range used and recommended by most mechanics is {{in the neighborhood of}} [...]030-.060" [...] The length of the adjustable length push-rod plus the desired <b>pre-load</b> chosen then becomes the desired push-rod length that should be installed, which will keep the hydraulic lifter in the middle of its total piston-travel range.

30|$|The {{solution}} {{methods for}} wheel/rail rolling contact {{that are based}} on ANSYS/LS-DYNA mainly include the explicit solution method and the implicit–explicit order solution method. The independent explicit solution method without considering the <b>pre-loading</b> does not tally with the actual situation, so it is not applicable for the wheel/rail rolling contact problem. The implicit–explicit order solution method is widely used to solve the rolling contact problem of railway system which needs to consider the <b>pre-loading.</b> However, the implicit–explicit order solution method applies implicit algorithm to define the initial <b>pre-loading,</b> which requires much solution time. Moreover, the solution efficiency and convergence decrease as the model nonlinearity and DOFs (degrees of freedom) increase.|$|R
