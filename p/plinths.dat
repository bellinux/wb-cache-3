5|$|Barry's scheme {{provided}} two <b>plinths</b> for sculptures on {{the north}} side of the square. A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey, originally intended to be placed on top of the Marble Arch, was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until the late-20th century. There are two other statues on <b>plinths,</b> both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Mole {{sides are}} sloped whilst the {{south-east}} face is vertically walled. Originally three {{sides of the}} Mole served coal hoists and their related rail sidings linking them and there were cranes on the south-east face, also rail-served. The former hoist brick-faced <b>plinths</b> are still present (2017) around the north-west and east faces as are those {{on the rest of}} the two docks. In the twilight years of tanker unloading for the William Cory (Powell Duffryn) oilworks, short footbridges were provided from the Mole for works staff to access the brick <b>plinths</b> for the purpose of handling the flexible tanker oil discharge piping and supports and it was not unknown for rail tank wagons to be in use on the siding serving the north-west Mole face.|$|E
5|$|Boston honored Russell by {{erecting}} {{a statue}} of him on City Hall Plaza in 2013: he is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 <b>plinths</b> representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win. Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments. The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project. The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, {{plans were}} {{unveiled}} for a memorial garden to Robson {{to be built}} in Newcastle. It was to be created by the city council in partnership with the regeneration company NE1Ltd, and located on Gallowgate street close to the Newcastle United stadium St James' Park. Work began on the site in November 2010, which was completed by Spring 2011. The garden covers 400 square meters, and features a tiered seating area and sculpted stone <b>plinths</b> reflecting aspects of his life and work. The area also hosts 400 square metre memorial garden to Sir Bobby Robson.|$|E
5|$|Medstead {{contains}} {{a total of}} six Grade II listed buildings. Southdown Old Farmhouse is a small manor which dates from the 18th century and has undergone 20th century restorations and extensions; the manor was designated as a listed building on 31 May 1985. Another Grade II listed building is a Victorian wheelhouse with a donkey wheel which lies immediately southwest of Southdown Old Farmhouse. The wheelhouse was built in the early 19th century and consists of weatherboarded timber frames on brick <b>plinths.</b> The donkey wheel is in working order and is made of a large timber axle with a rope hanging over a well.|$|E

The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest on stone <b>plinths,</b> each bearing carved shields, that on the north buttress with an inaccurate rendering of {{the arms of the}} see, and the other with a cross and a dolphin. The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the belfry and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E

5|$|Immediately to {{the north}} of Charing Cross lies Trafalgar Square, one of London's most famous public spaces. Conceived as part of John Nash's urban improvements, the square was {{initially}} developed from the 1820s onwards. Its centrepiece, Nelson's Column, was constructed in 1839–1842. Charles Barry's 1840 redesign of the square provided <b>plinths</b> for equestrian monuments to George IV and William IV, but sufficient funds were never raised for the latter statue. Most of the memorials since added have had a military or naval flavour, an exception being the statue of the physician Edward Jenner, erected in 1858 but moved to Kensington Gardens only four years later. Another work which originally stood on the square is Hamo Thornycroft's statue of General Gordon; this was removed during World War II and reinstalled on the Victoria Embankment in 1953. Since 1999 the formerly empty fourth plinth has become London's most prominent showcase for temporary new sculpture.|$|E

5000|$|The Fourth <b>plinth</b> is the {{northwest}} <b>plinth</b> in Trafalgar Square in central London. It was {{originally intended to}} hold an equestrian statue of William IV, but remained bare due to insufficient funds. For over 150 years {{the fate of the}} <b>plinth</b> was debated; in 1998, the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) commissioned three contemporary sculptures to be displayed temporarily on the <b>plinth.</b> Shortly afterwards, Chris Smith, the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport commissioned Sir John Mortimer to conduct a public enquiry that sought opinions from public art commissioners, critics and members of the public as {{to the future of the}} <b>plinth.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{expectation}} at {{the time}} of commissioning the sculptures was that they would be situated at an angle {{on either side of the}} portico at the top of the entrance steps. Purpose-built <b>plinths</b> had been included in the construction of the facade for the statues' eventual installation. However, once the statues had been delivered, the gallery trustees decided instead to install the works on free-standing <b>plinths</b> halfway down either side the length of the facade. In May 1926 a separate tender was called for the plinth construction and the installation of the sculptures, with the eventual installation taking place in October.|$|E

25|$|The side {{towards the}} Seine is known from a drawing {{made by the}} British neoclassicist Sir William Chambers: in Chambers' drawing, unlike Ledoux's {{commemorative}} engraving (illustration, right), its three central bays project in the accustomed Gabriel manner, with attached Ionic columns and bas-relief panels above the severely plain window openings; in the flanking single bays the windows have plain entablatures surmounted by low <b>plinths</b> of concave profile.|$|E

50|$|In architecture, a <b>plinth</b> (from French plinthe, from Latin plinthus, from Greek πλίνθος plinthos, “brick”) is {{the base}} or {{platform}} upon which a column, pedestal, statue, monument or structure rests. Gottfried Semper's The Four Elements of Architecture (1851) posited that the <b>plinth,</b> the hearth, the roof, {{and the wall}} make up all of architectural theory. The <b>plinth</b> usually rests directly {{on the ground or}} stylobate. According to Semper, the <b>plinth</b> exists to negotiate between a structure and the ground. Semper's theory has been influential in the development of architecture.|$|R
