40|$|<b>Pressurised</b> <b>combustion</b> {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} to achieve higher overall thermal efficiency by means of combined gas and steam cycles. The new generation of pressurized combustion technologies, e. g. the advanced, staged pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC), is focused on further increase of temperature at the gas turbine inlet by two stage gasification/combustion and on resulting increase of the efficiency  1, 2 . In the first stage of the process (sub-stoichiometric combustion) the synthetic gas is produced at temperatures in the range 800 - 950 oC. The gas is cleaned at elevated temperatures (over 600 oC) and burned in the second stage with preheated air to attain temperatures around 1200 oC, commonly the limit of present generation gas turbines. The suitable temperature range in the first stage is limited by sufficiently fast gasification, by efficient desulfurization of the synthetic gas by limestone (to avoid secondary measures for SO 2 emission treatment) and by the onset of particle agglomeration in sub-stoichiometric PFBC.

40|$|Pressurised high {{temperature}} fuel cells and gas turbine integrated power systems are receiving a growing attention {{as capable of}} reaching very high electrical conversion efficiency even in small size power plants. In this system the fuel and the oxidant (air) enter the cell after being compressed. The fuel oxidation reaction occurs predominantly within the fuel cell. The reaction is completed in a combustion chamber and the <b>pressurised</b> <b>combustion</b> products are exhausted through a turbine. The dynamic interdependences related to {{the integration of the}} fuel cell and the gas turbine are not completely understood and unexpected complications and dangers might arise. In fact as a consequence of both the relatively large volume of the pressurized portion of the plant and the shape of the stalled characteristic of available compressors, the plant could be affected by the inception of fluid-dynamic instabilities. In particular surge could be detected in the transient off-design operational conditions occurring during plant regulation, start up and shut down. The paper presents a new experimental fuel cell gas turbine simulation facility that has been constructed at the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Trieste, Italy. The facility was designed {{to examine the effects of}} transient events on the dynamics of these systems. The theoretical analysis of the plant is completed using a dynamic model of the system purposely developed...|$|E

The bulk of the alkalis are predicted to form sulphate, condensed onto entrained fly ash or present as an aerosol. Filtration of the condensed sulphates may suffice to reduce alkalis to levels acceptable to a gas turbine.

40|$|This paper, as {{literature}} retrieval, evaluates progressive {{trends in}} {{development of technologies}} for energetic use of fossil fuels. The introduction is focused on reasons for increase of energetic efficiency of combustion processes, especially reasons for using of fossil fuels and their consumption {{over the world and}} in Czech Republic. Next chapter focuses on mainly used fossil fuels, which means coal, crude oil and its derivatives and natural gas. Those are evaluated in term of quality and historical progress, too. Fundamental chapter analyses particular improvements but also complex technologies used in energetic, for example using of gas turbines, assets of Kalina cycle, complex technology of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), combined heat and power production (CHP), combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) or <b>pressurised</b> fluid bed <b>combustion</b> (PFBC) ...|$|R
40|$|Alumina hydrate {{produced}} by the Bayer-Hall-Heroult process is calcined at ~ 1100 oC in either a rotary kiln, or a stationary vertical flash or fluid bed calciner. The latter calcination process is more thermally efficient than the rotary kiln, but the difficult nature of the process environment (<b>pressurised,</b> high temperature <b>combustion</b> in an abrasive dust laden atmosphere) makes any investigation of the furnace operation very difficult. This paper describes how physical and mathematical models {{have been developed to}} enable operators and designers to understand the process dynamics. A number of modelling techniques are used to fully simulate the system, including physical modelling of the aerodynamics and mixing, zero and one dimensional heat transfer models, and CFD models of the two-phase material flows. These models have been validated against unique plant measurements using special probe techniques. The resulting models have been used to improve existing designs, and to develop a new generation of larger, more efficient flash calcination units...|$|R
40|$|Clean coal {{technologies}} {{employing a}} combined cycle, such as <b>pressurised</b> fluidised bed <b>combustion</b> and integral gasification combined cycle, offer {{the potential to}} generate power from coal at higher thermal efficiencies. However, many of these technologies require a barrier filtration system capable of removing particulate material from the coal-derived fuel- or flue-gas to protect the gas turbine from damage. Ceramic candle filters are generally accepted as the most suitable technology. Continued satisfactory operation of ceramic candle filter units is dependent on satisfactory removal, through periodic back pulsing, of the filter cake that builds up during operation. This study examines, through experimental and computational modelling, the deposition process and the factors that affect the build up of the filter cake of a single filter element in cross-flow and parallel flow. For both flow regimes the validation of the computational study was adequate and a method has been developed for predicting filter cake growth using CFD data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. - Worldwide, {{advanced}} {{coal-fired power}} generation systems are being introduced that offer significant {{economic and environmental}} advantages over pulverised fuel (pf) firing. Many of these systems are combined cycles based on fluidised bed combustion and/or gasifica-tion. In such combined cycles, materials selection and performance are key factors in determin-ing plant availability. Consequently material evaluation studies for the various components form {{an integral part of}} any development programme. This paper provides a review of materials is-sues for two advanced technologies, namely <b>pressurised</b> fluidised bed <b>combustion</b> (PFBC) and the British Coal Topping Cycle. Particular attention is paid to the approach adopted to overcome these issues and their influence on plant design. PFBC development in the United Kingdom is outlined. Erosion/corrosion issues within the in-bed heat exchanger and the solutions that will allow a commercially acceptable tube bank lifetime to be realised are discussed. The British Coal Topping Cycle system, which is under development, is described. Some of the materials issues are identified and the programme being undertaken to ensure acceptable component lifetimes is reviewed. 1. Introduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this work is {{the design of a}} {{measuring}} system for determining particle temperatures in a <b>pressurised</b> pulverised coal <b>combustion</b> chamber. Method of measurement is the two colour pyrometrie. Particles heat radiation is collected with a glass fibre and detected in an optical unit. Data are sampled and processed with a PC. An existing pyrometer has been optimised for the application to pulverised coal combustion and a new software for data processing has been developed. The pyrometer was first tested in a particle feeded gas flame. The measurements are compared to the results of a numerical analysis done with a commercial CFD code. For the application of the pyrometer to a pulverised coal flame a cooled probe has been designed. The probe has a thermal protection shield for minimising the influence of the probe on the temperatures in the coal flame. The use of the measuring system under pressure was realised with a special designed locking and positioning system for the probe. First measurements under various pressures have been made...|$|R
40|$|Independent power {{producers}} {{will build a}} substantial fraction of expected new coal-fired power generation in developing countries over the coming decades. To reduce perceived risk and obtain financing for their projects, they are currently building and plan to continue to build subcritical coal-fired plants with generating efficiency below 40 %. Up-to-date engineering assessment leads {{to the conclusion that}} supercritical generating technology, capable of efficiencies of up to 45 %, can produce electricity at a lower total cost than conventional plants. If such plants were built in Asia over the coming decades, the savings in carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetime would be measured in billions of tons. IPPs perceive supercritical technology as riskier and higher cost than conventional technology. The truth needs to be confirmed by discussions with additional experienced power engineering companies. Better communication among the interested parties could help to overcome the IPP perception issue. Governments working together with industry might be able to identify creative financing arrangements which can encourage the use of more efficient pulverised clean coal technologies, while awaiting the commercialisation of advanced clean-coal technologies like gasification combined cycle and <b>pressurised</b> fluidised bed <b>combustion...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in the framework of}} the Socio-Economic Research on Fusion (SERF 3), which is jointly conducted by Euratom and the fusion associations. Assessments of monetarized external impacts of the fusion fuel-cycle were previously performed (SERF 1 and SERF 2). Three different power plant designs were studied, with the main difference being the structural materials and cooling system used. In this third phase of the SERF project the external costs of three additional fusion power plant models using silicon carbide as structural material have been analysed. A comparison with other advanced generation technologies expected to be in use around 2050, when the first fusion power plant would be operative, has also been performed. These technologies include advanced fossil technologies, such as Natural Gas Combined Cycle, <b>Pressurised</b> Fluidised Bed <b>Combustion</b> and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle with carbon sequestration technologies; fuel cells and renewable technologies including geothermal energy, wind energy and photovoltaic systems with energy storage devices. Fusion power plants using silicon carbide as structural material have higher efficiencies than plants using steel and this fact has a very positive effect on the external costs per kW h. These external costs are in the lowest range of the external costs of advanced generation technologies indicating the outstanding environmental performance of fusion power...|$|R
40|$|In the {{discussion}} on innovations for sustainable development, radical innovations are frequently {{called for in}} order that the transformation of society to a system perceived as sustainable can succeed. The reason given {{for this is the}} greater environmental efficiency of these innovations. This hypothesis is, however, not supported by empirical evidence. Against the background of a globally increasing use of coal-burning power plants and the environmental impacts to be expected, the hypothesis that radical innovations are superior to incremental innovations is reviewed on the basis of fossil fuel power plants. This paper examines the diffusion of incremental and radical innovations in the field of power plants and the basic obstacles with which these innovations were confronted. To give an example, <b>Pressurised</b> Pulverised Coal <b>Combustion</b> (PPCC) as a radical innovation and supercritical coal-fired power plants as an incremental innovation are compared. An ex-post analysis of the German R&D portfolio in the past three decades in the field of power plants environmentally shows that technologies which were radical innovations had great difficulties in becoming accepted by possible investors. The future potential of radical innovations in the field of power plant technology is to be regarded as relatively low, especially due to comparatively high cost-pressure, the reluctance of utilities to take risks and the temporal dynamics of technological progress facilitating incremental innovations on the basis of conventional reference technology. The conclusion for future R&D work in the sector of large-scale power plants is that an innovation is more likely to succeed the more it follows established technological trajectories. In the context of energy market liberalisation, hardly any radical innovations are expected in this field of technology. The findings of this paper may also be helpful in evaluating risks or probabilities of success of technologies being developed. As an example technological trajectories currently favoured in CO 2 capture are discussed. [...] Radical innovations,incremental innovations,carbon capture storage,coal power plants...|$|R
40|$|The goal {{of power}} plants with higher {{efficiency}} and lower environmental risk than conventional power plants has produced {{three types of}} combined cycle power plants. These are: 1) the conventional combined cycle (CCC) power plant, 2) the <b>pressurised</b> fluidised bed <b>combustion</b> (PFBC) power plants, and 3) the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants. The efficiency of the CCC power plant has been sufficiently improved {{so that it is}} higher than the conventional power plant. Due to high combustion temperature in the gas turbine, the problem of NOx arose. Different NOx reduction techniques were adopted, such as steam or water injection, and dry low-NOx combustors. Strict environmental regulations in various countries were still violated. Therefore, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) was installed in the waste heat boiler. Due to design of the CCC power plant, there is still risk of high NOx emission with a simple-cycle operation of the gas turbine. If the simple-cycle operation is not permitted then the effectiveness (energy availability) of the plant deteriorates. The PFBC and IGCC are new rival technologies. Both have a potential for higher efficiency and lower environmental risk than pulverized coal fired (PCF) power plants. These benefits will be lost if the effectiveness of these plants does not compete with the effectiveness of PCF power plants. Backup fuel can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of an IGCC power plant. Improving the effectiveness by using backup fuel involves increased cost for the fuel. If the gas turbine is operated as a simple-cycle with a backup fuel, then the problem of high NOx emission arises, as for the CCC power plant. Differently designed combined cycle power plants have been analysed to investigate the effects of reserve capacity (active redundancy) and repair policy. The Markov process has been used for the analysis and the following results were obtained. 1. The CCC power plant with an appropriate reserve capacity and a suitable repair policy can be chosen to obtain greater effectiveness of the plant with less NOx emission. 2. The effectiveness of PFBC power plants can potentially compete with the effectiveness of PCF plants. With an appropriate reserve capacity or double repair crew policy, the effectiveness of PFBC power plants can be even higher than that of the PCF power plants. 3. With an appropriate reserve capacity and with double repair crepolicy, the effectiveness of IGCC power plants can be improved to equal the effectiveness of PCF power plants. 4. The PFBC power plants have more potential for higher effectiventhan IGCC power plants without backup fuel. 5. The use of appropriate reserve capacity and a suitable repair minimize the use of backup fuel and NOx emissions and, at the same time, improve the effectiveness of integrated gasification combined cycle power plants...|$|R
40|$|High {{temperature}} erosion - corrosion is {{the major}} source for degradation of components such as heat exchangers, tubes, cyclones and water walls used in Fluidised Bed Combustion (FBC) plants. By coating the exposed components with a protective material, the degradation rate can be decreased. The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} erosion - corrosion resistance of coatings deposited with the arc-spray, High Velocity Oxy Fuel (HVOF) and laser techniques. The erosion - corrosion tests have been performed in three different power plants; one Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB) plant fired with biomass, one Multi Bed Combustion (MBC) plant fired with a mixture of coal and biomass and one <b>Pressurised</b> Fluidised Bed <b>Combustion</b> (PFBC) plant fired with coal. The erosion - corrosion resistance of coatings has also been examined in one laboratory jet nozzle test rig and one fluidised bed test rig. Further, the adhesion strength of coatings deposited on substrates of a low-alloyed steel (1 Cr 0. 5 Mo) has been tested. A number of commercially available coating qualities have been used in this study. The reference material is the Fe-based Metcoloy 2 coating, which was deposited with all the three methods available. The other coatings can be divided into Ni-based, Co-based, carbide - containing and Fe-based. Under active - service conditions Co-based coatings show the best overall performance. It is suggested that the erosion resistance is partly due to the presence of carbide rich phases dispersed in the coating. The softer Ni based coatings are generally more subjected to erosion. The corrosion resistance of Fe-based coatings is poor at higher temperatures in more corrosive environments. Chromium carbide - containing coatings are excellent in the coal fired erosive environment but degrade severely in the biomass fired plants showing that stable hard phases, such as carbide, at the exposure temperature decrease the degradation rate. Tungsten and Ti-carbide containing coatings suffer from severe degradation in all environments. The coated samples were subjected to erosion- corrosion in a jet nozzle rig in air at 520 ºC or 550 ºC. Compared to a solid 304 L steel (Fe 19 Cr 10 Ni), the erosion - corrosion resistance of the coatings tested (Fe-based, Ni-based and carbide - containing) is higher. The oxides formed on the eroded area of the Metcoloy 2 coating are 10 - 60 times thicker than those formed on the non - eroded area. Consequently, erosion has increased the oxide growth rate. The increased oxide thickness on the eroded areas is due to the formation of cracks and pores in the oxide scale. These will enhance the inward transport of molecular oxygen through the oxide layer to the oxide/metal interface where the metal phase is oxidised. Erosion - corrosion tests performed in the fluidised bed test rig at 550 °C in air shows that the erosion resistance of thermally sprayed coatings is higher in comparison to laser deposited coatings. The use of acoustic emission for determining the adhesion strength of the coatings proved to be successful and more reliable than the traditional four point bending test with a subsequent metallographic examination. HVOF sprayed coatings start to delaminate at a strain of about 1 %, arc sprayed at a strain of about 1. 4  2 % while laser deposited coatings did not delaminate for strains up to 15 %. However, by increasing the splat size in the arc sprayed coatings the strain at which delamination occurred was increased to a bout 10 %...|$|R
