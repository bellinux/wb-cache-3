Meanwhile, the IMF urged cash-strapped countries to further privatize—in effect selling their assets at a fraction of their value to raise cash.

It creates the spectre of Fortis Bank being in trouble, and this may affect the image of the bank, just now when Fortis Bank is doing well (with liquidity problems a thing of the past). What is actually at stake is the creditability of the Belgian government, especially financially; it may need to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab,</b> and the more it scares financiers, the higher the interests they will demand. Nevertheless, the government appears committed to a policy of punishing the shareholders (for not supervising the board of Fortis or for speculating by buying Fortis shares) and protecting the customers.|$|E
50|$|Bloodless {{medicine}} {{appeals to}} many doctors because it carries low risk of post-operative infection {{when compared with}} procedures requiring blood transfusion. Additionally, it may be economically beneficial in some countries. For example, the cost {{of blood in the}} US hovers around $500 a unit, including testing. These costs are further increased as, according to Jan Hoffman (an administrator for the blood conservation program at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania), hospitals must <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> for the first three units of blood infused per patient per calendar year. By contrast, hospitals may be reimbursed for drugs that boost a patient's red blood cell count, a treatment approach often used before and after surgery to reduce the need for a blood transfusion. However, such payments are highly contingent upon negotiations with insurance companies. Geisinger Medical Center began a blood conservation program in 2005 and reported a recorded savings of $273,000 in its first six months of operation. The Cleveland Clinic lowered their direct costs from US$35.5 million in 2009 to $26.4 million in 2012—a savings of nearly $10 million over 3 years.|$|E

5000|$|The late 1890s {{reconstruction}} of the ship canal resulted in the replacement of this tower and the fog signal house with a single brick lighthouse containing both signals. This house, constructed of Cream City brick, was completed in 1901, and the new tower was first lit on September 1 of that year. This tower stood on {{the southeast corner of}} the rectangular building, and housed the lens retained from the old light; the fog whistles and their reflector were also moved from the old structure to the new. The latter were replaced in 1915 with locomotive whistles, and in 1921 with Type F diaphones, setting off another round of noise complaints, which led to the installation of a new sound reflector. The diaphones were replaced in 1968 with an electronic horn, but in 1976 a group styling itself TOOT (for [...] "reTurn Our Old Tone") began a campaign to restore the fog signal. Horns from the Kewaunee Pierhead Light were obtained, and in 1995 the diaphones were put back in service, eliciting, of course, a new round of noise complaints, which led to restriction of the signal to daytime operation. The signal required a three-phase current supply for operation, and when this failed in 2005, the Coast Guard refused to pay for repairs; legal concerns led the city to refuse to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab,</b> and the signal was dismantled the following year.

5000|$|The {{international}} {{swine flu}} pandemic of 2009-10 did not occasion {{the need for}} air-transport under isolation of any CDC personnel. Consequently, the ABCS—which comprised three isolation units (but only one aircraft) by late-2011—was to some extent mothballed. That changed abruptly in late-July 2014 when Phoenix Air was {{asked if they could}} support a patient with a “bloodborne pathogen” (namely Ebola virus) as well as it could an “airborne pathogen” (such as TB or flu, for which it had been designed). Physicians from Phoenix, along with CDC experts, spent {{a day and a half}} reviewing the system, after which they all agreed it was suitable for Ebola patients. [...] "In fact, it's probably over-engineered for Ebola, because it's designed for airborne pathogens," [...] the Phoenix director stated. On 2 August 2014, the ABCS carried the first Ebola patient (Dr. Kent Brantly, an employee of Samaritan's Purse) ever to be evacuated to the United States; three days later, it transported another, Nancy Writebol. To date, Phoenix Air and the ABCS have flown five Ebola patients out of West Africa (four Americans—Brantly, Writebol, Dr Rick Sacra, and an unidentified American on September 9 -- and a German doctor from Sierra Leone to Hamburg, Germany).After the first two missions, Phoenix Air—which says it considered them successful [...] "proof-of-concept flights"—decided that it would only undertake future missions under the aegis of the U.S. government. Challenges such as dealing with U.S. customs officials, obtaining permission to transit foreign airspace, and the selection of specific destination medical centers had become too onerous. Since then, the U.S. Department of State has coordinated all such flights, including those for foreigners returning to their own countries. U.S. taxpayers <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> for official government patients, but reimbursement is required for all others.
