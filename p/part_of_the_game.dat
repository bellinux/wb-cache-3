5|$|A Beetlejuice themed fun {{pack for}} the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions was {{released}} on September 12, 2017. The pack includes a Beetlejuice minifigure and constructable Saturn's Sandworm, and adds a Beetlejuice-themed open-world area and battle arena to the game. Beetlejuice also features prominently in an episode of Teen Titans Go! included as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another World is a {{platform}} game, featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad {{to make the}} protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and {{challenging}} gameplay. However, {{they noted that}} at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The reviewer considered the best <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} edition of Ninja Gaiden 3 (2012), Ayane only appears in one cutscene, {{in which she}} loans Hayate's sword to Ryu. , an expanded version of the game, features Ayane as a playable character with her own new missions: a campaign involving the returning Black Spider Clan, {{as well as being}} available to fight alongside Ryu—like in Σ 2—in an online cooperative multiplayer mode. A new Chapter Challenge mode also allows the player to attempt any <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> using Ayane.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2011, Blizzard {{replaced}} the previously available StarCraft II demo {{with the new}} StarCraft II: Starter Edition. It allows anyone to play <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for free and it comes as a 7 GB package downloaded using the Blizzard Downloader client. The Starter Edition is available for Mac and Windows, and requires a Battle.net account and an Internet connection to play.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen placed a partial-game {{suspension}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew, including leading rusher, Da'Rel Scott, and senior wide receiver Danny Oquendo. Consequently, {{a much younger}} line-up initially started for Maryland during the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> including, according to Friedgen, some who {{probably would not have}} seen playing time otherwise.|$|E

5|$|A high {{definition}} remaster of the PlayStation 2 version was released for PlayStation Network on 2 October 2012 and for Xbox Live Arcade on 5 October 2012. A Microsoft Windows version was released via Steam on 17 December 2012. This {{version of the}} game introduces online high score leaderboards and includes the option to play either with enhanced graphics or with the original Saturn version's graphics. The HD version also includes Christmas Nights as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> but the Sonic the Hedgehog level of Christmas Nights was removed along with the original game's two player versus mode.|$|E
5|$|During its TGS 2014 presentation, the {{real-time}} demonstration footage {{was dubbed}} Final Fantasy XV: The Overture, which demonstrated the graphic capabilities in Luminous Studio {{and the effect}} of environmental changes on gameplay. While it was intended as a one-off presentation, the team said they were considering creating a second demo for release in Japan based on The Overture. A demo featuring the battle against the Astral Titan was featured at E3 2016: while drawing on a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> the fight was tailored for the demo so it could be completed within a ten-minute window, with the full version having different victory requirements. A Japan-exclusive commercial demo dubbed Judgement Disc was released on November 11. Spanning the game's events up {{to the middle of the}} first chapter, it was designed to allow players to judge the game's merits.|$|E
5|$|In {{a losing}} Queensland team, Hunt played neither well nor badly, being {{outstanding}} in defence but subdued in attack. As a result, Hunt's position at five-eighth was in {{question for the}} second game, but coach Mal Meninga stated that Hunt would remain in the team. Hunt was named on the interchange bench for the second game, making way for Queensland custodian and captain Lockyer in the five-eighth role. However, Meninga made a late change before the game, starting Hunt at fullback and moving Slater to the interchange bench. Hunt played in the match, which Queensland won 30–0, for only 51 minutes, being put on the interchange bench for 29 minutes in the middle <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> He retained his starting position for game three, which Queensland won to take the series.|$|E

5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start and end of each <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, {{of which there are}} three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} {{were added to}} the series, such as the monsters being animated when they attack. The Slime Arena and Best Dresser Contest were new mini-games introduced; the casinos return from previous Dragon Quest games. Like previous games, mini medals can be found hidden throughout the worlds and can be traded for items. There are bonus dungeons and a few extra characters after beating the main storyline. There is a day and night system, as in some previous installments; with certain storyline events happening at night. While the Monster Master class can catch monsters in the original Super Famicom version it is not a major <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Another returning feature from the past two games is the use of the wagon, which allows characters to be swapped out for other ones on the world map.|$|E
5|$|Sports such as polo do {{not judge}} the horse itself, but rather use the horse {{as a partner}} for human {{competitors}} as a necessary <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only {{the result of the}} rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.|$|E

5|$|The {{first season}} of the {{international}} fantasy series , part of the Highlander franchise, consisted of 22 episodes produced between 1992 and 1993, and began airing on October 3, 1992 in broadcast syndication. Highlander: The Series follows the adventures of Duncan MacLeod, a 400-year-old Immortal who can only die if he is beheaded; conflict inevitably finds him because he is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game,</b> an ongoing battle in which all Immortals have to fight and behead each other until only one is left. The season was released on DVD as a nine-disc boxed set on November 12, 2002 by Anchor Bay Entertainment. It is also available at the online video on demand service Hulu, {{a joint venture between}} NBC and Fox Broadcasting Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} multiplayer-only game, where players could meet and solve new puzzles that would be added monthly. At the request of publisher Ubisoft, Cyan eventually developed a single-player portion as well. Cyan announced players would be {{invited to participate in}} a multiplayer beta test, which drew 10,000 to 40,000 participants. Uru was released in November 2003, while the multiplayer portion was delayed. Small groups of players were allowed to come online to test the multiplayer <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and journalists were told they would be invited to play soon after, but Uru Live was canceled before being released. Cyan stated that there were not enough projected subscribers to support the service.|$|E
5|$|The middlegame is the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{which starts}} after the opening. There {{is no clear}} line between the opening and the middlegame, but {{typically}} the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, {{there is no clear}} transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the endgame.) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, {{and at the same time}} take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, {{one of the goals}} during development was to reproduce the feel of a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully in the first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in the last <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> BGM {{was added}} in some <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Camera, {{such as the}} [...] "Hot Spot" [...] section.|$|R
