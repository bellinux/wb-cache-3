50|$|If {{images are}} to be {{displayed}} in real time a typical approach is the application of some form of regularized inverse of a linearization of the forward problem or a fast version of a direct reconstruction method such as the D-bar method. Most practical systems used in the medical environment generate a 'difference image', i.e. differences in voltage between two time points are left-multiplied by the regularized inverse to calculate an approximate difference between permittivity and conductivity images.

50|$|All {{biomedical}} {{applications of}} cell electropermeabilization use direct currents (all unipolar) with short and intense pulses (even though in vitro, time-decayed pulses can be used).

The duration of pulses is usually one hundred microseconds. In early experiments, pulses were delivered with period of 1 second (i.e. at a repetition frequency of 1 Hz); today, pulses are delivered in a much shorter time period, at a repetition frequency of 5000 Hz, resulting in a much less discomfort for the patient and in the shorter duration of treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Classically, studies {{adopting}} non-invasive transcranial {{electrical stimulation}} have placed greater importance on <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary "stimulating" <b>electrode</b> than <b>the</b> secondary "reference" <b>electrode.</b> However, recent current density modeling suggests that ascribing a neutral role to <b>the</b> reference <b>electrode</b> may prove an inappropriate oversimplification. HYPOTHESIS: We {{set out to}} test the hypothesis that <b>the</b> behavioral effects <b>of</b> transcranial electrical stimulation are critically dependent on <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> return ("reference") <b>electrode.</b> METHODS: We examined <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> transcranial alternating current stimulation (sinusoidal waveform with no direct current offset at a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2000  μA and a frequency matched to each participant's peak tremor frequency) on physiological tremor in a group of healthy volunteers (N =  12). We implemented a sham-controlled experimental protocol where <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stimulating <b>electrode</b> remained fixed, overlying primary motor cortex, whilst <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> return <b>electrode</b> varied between two cephalic (fronto-orbital and contralateral primary motor cortex) and two extracephalic (ipsilateral and contralateral shoulder) locations. We additionally controlled for <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> phosphenes in influencing motor output by assessing <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> tremor to photic stimulation, through self-reported phosphene ratings. RESULTS: Altering only <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> return <b>electrode</b> had a profound behavioral effect: only the montage with extracephalic return contralateral to <b>the</b> primary stimulating <b>electrode</b> significantly entrained physiological tremor (15. 9 % ±  6. 1 % increase in phase stability, 1  S.

40|$|ABSTRACT: When {{choosing}} a reconstruction algorithm {{for clinical use}} accuracy, speed and robustness, with respect to errors in the measured data, must be considered. Until recently the UCL brain EIT group have used a 3 D, Truncated Singular Value Decomposition algorithm (TSVD), and published time-difference images of evoked responses using this. However, the group is extending its interests to stroke, where time difference imaging cannot be used and additional reconstruction algorithms must be implemented. This paper compares two approaches – TSVD with a computer model for the reference image, and Non-linear Conjugate Gradients. These are assessed using simulated and tank data with known sources of measurement error. The solutions {{are found to be}} very sensitive to discrepancies between the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> used to obtain the boundary voltages, and those used for reconstruction. Position errors of 1 % causing significant artefacts. The TSVD algorithm was also unable to return the true conductivity of a homogenous image if the reference voltage was out by more than 10 %. The non-linear algorithm could compensate for the reference voltage being out by 30 %, but is much more computationally expensive than TSVD, and would require speeding up before routine clinical use...|$|E
