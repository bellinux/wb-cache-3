40|$|AbstractBackground: Atypical serum {{neutralizing}} antibody {{responses to}} prototype strains of <b>Puumala</b> <b>viruses</b> {{in some patients}} with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have long suggested the existence of other hantaviruses in the Balkans. Objective: To determine the presence of arvicolid rodent-borne Puumala-like hantaviruses in Yugoslavia. Materials and Methods: Using reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction, Tula virus RNA was amplified from lung tissues of a European pine vole (Pitymys subterraneus) captured in 1987, following an outbreak of HFRS in the Cacak region of Serbia-Yugoslavia. Results: Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the S segment and a 948 -nucleotide region of the G 2 glycoprotein-encoding M segment revealed divergence of approximately 14 % from Tula virus strains harbored by European common voles (Microtus arvalis) captured in Central Russia and the Czech Republic. However, nearly complete identity {{was found in the}} corresponding deduced amino acid sequences. Moreover, phylogenetic trees constructed by the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods indicated that this Pitymys-borne hantavirus shared a common ancestry with other Tula virus strains. Conclusions: The data demonstrate that Pitymys subterraneus also serves as a rodent reservoir of Tula virus in Serbia-Yugoslavia.

40|$|A novel hantavirus, first {{detected}} in Siberian lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus) collected near the Topografov River in the Taymyr Peninsula, Siberia (A. Plyusnin et al., Lancet 347 : 1835 – 1836, 1996), was isolated in Vero E 6 cells and in laboratory-bred Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus). The virus, named Topografov virus (TOP), was most {{closely related to}} Khabarovsk <b>virus</b> (KBR) and <b>Puumala</b> <b>viruses</b> (PUU). In a cross focus reduction neutralization test, anti-TOP Lemmus antisera showed titers at least fourfold higher with TOP than with other hantaviruses; however, a rabbit anti-KBR antiserum neutralized TOP and KBR at the same titer. The TOP M segment showed 77 % nucleotide and 88 % amino acid identity with KBR and 76 % nucleotide and 82 % amino acid identity with PUU. However, the homology between TOP and the KBR S segment was disproportionately higher: 88 % at the nucleotide level and 96 % at the amino acid level. The 3 � noncoding regions of KBR and the TOP S and M segments were alignable except for 113 - and 58 -nucleotide deletions in KBR. The phylogenetic relationships of TOP, KBR, and PUU and their respective rodent carriers suggest that an exceptional host switch {{took place during the}} evolution of these viruses; while TOP and KBR are monophyletic, the respective rodent host species are only distantly related.

DOBV-infected patients were associated with more requirements for haemodialysis treatment, lower diuresis and higher serum creatinine and urea values compared to PUUV-infected patients. PUUV was significantly predominant in asymptomatic hantavirus antibody-positive subjects (69. 8 %) compared to HFRS patients.

40|$|<b>Puumala</b> (PUU) <b>virus</b> {{causes a}} form of hemorrhagic fever with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS), called nephropathia epidemica (NE), in Europe. HFRS is characterized by an increased capillary permeability, which we hypothesize is caused by hyperactivation of the host immune system, especially cellular immune responses. To identify cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for the PUU virus from NE patients, we have made recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing PUU virus proteins, the nucleocapsid (N) and two surface glycoproteins, G 1 and G 2. Recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying the N or {{the first half of}} the G 2 cDNA under the control of a strong synthetic promoter were made. To express G 1 and the second half of the G 2 proteins, however, we needed to use a T 7 expression system, where the T 7 RNA polymerase is produced from another recombinant vaccinia virus co-infecting the same cells. These recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to detect and clone PUU virus-specific CTLs from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of NE patients.

40|$|<b>Puumala</b> <b>virus,</b> {{belonging}} to the genus hantavirus, is the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a relatively mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> occurs endemically in Central and Northern Europe and Western Russia. In Sweden, NE is reported from the northern and central parts but virtually not at all from {{the southern part of}} the country. The bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is the main reservoir of <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> and humans are infected by inhalation of aerosolized animal secreta. In northern Sweden, the density of the bank vole population varies cyclically in intervals of 3 - 4 years and the incidence of NE shows a covariation. The prevalence of serum antibodies to hantaviruses in northern Sweden was studied in a stratified and randomly selected adult population sample comprising 1538 subjects. As expected, the prevalence increased with age. There was no difference between men and women, which was unexpected based on a male:female ratio of > 2 : 1 in clinical reports. By use of an immunofiuorescent assay, a seroprevalence of 5. 4 % and by a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> nucleocapsid protein as antigen, a prevalence of 8. 9 % was recorded. This is about or more than ten times higher than what would be calculated from clinical reports. By use of the ELISA, an occupational risk of acquisition of <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> infection was demonstrated. Serum samples from 910 farmers and 663 referent subjects living in various rural parts of Sweden were tested. Among farmers from the Puumala virus-endemic northern and central parts of the country, the seroprevalence (12. 9 %) was higher (p= 0. 01) than in referents (6. 8 %). In the southern part of Sweden, only 2 / 459 persons had antibodies. Only a limited number of children with NE had been previously reported. In a separate study, 32 children with <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> infection were identified and the clinical picture of NE in children was found to be similar to that of adult cases. Variations in the prevalence of <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> in the bank vole population within an endemic region are not well known. Here, a higher mean rodent density and a higher prevalence of Puumala virus-specific serum antibodies were recorded in the vicinity of households afflicted with NE than in rural control areas. The data indicated that the risk of exposure locally within an endemic region may vary widely and tentatively suggested that a threshold density of bank voles might be necessary to achieve before effective spread of <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> within the rodent population may occur. There is no firm evidence of the occurrence of <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> among wild living animals other than rodents. A study of Swedish moose, an animal which is ecologically well characterized, was performed. Convincing evidence of past <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> infection was found in 5 / 260 moose originating from Puumala virus-endemic areas but in none of 167 animals from nonendemic areas. Based on the low seroprevalence recorded, moose seemed to serve as endstage hosts rather than being active parts of the enzootic circle of transmission. In conclusion, the present investigations confirmed that the exposure to <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> is geographically well restricted in Sweden. Seroprevalence studies indicated that only a minor proportion of individuals infected with <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> are clinically reported, with a bias in favour of men. NE was confirmed to occur in children, with a clinical picture similar to that of adults. An occupational risk was defined for acquisition of <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> infection. Studies in rodents suggested that there may be wide local variations within a limited area in the risk of exposure to <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus.</b> The studies validated the usefulness of a newly developed ELISA based on recombinant nucleocapsid peptides of hantaviruses and finally, methodological progress was reached when <b>Puumala</b> <b>virus</b> was, for the first time, successfully isolated from a Scandinavian patient.

Six of seven epitopes, recognized by bank vole monoclonal antibodies, were localized within the amino-terminal region of the protein (aa 1 – 79). Polyclonal antibodies from wild-trapped or experimentally infected bank voles identified epitopes located over the entire protein. Antibody end-point titers to different N fragments indicated that the amino-terminal region is the major antigenic target in PUU virus-infected bank voles. To investigate the role of PUU virus N in protective immunity, we analyzed the immunogenicity of truncated recombinant N and developed an animal model based on colonized bank voles. No PUU virus N antigen, nor any glycoprotein-specific antibodies, could be detected after virus challenge in animals immunized with an amino-terminal fragment (aa 1 – 118), a fragment covering {{two thirds of the}} protein (aa 1 – 267), or total N, indicating that a complete protection was evoked by the recombinant proteins. Two of eight animals immunized with shorter N fragments displayed either N antigen, or glycoprotein-specific antibodies, suggestive of partial protection.
