Sweetest music from an unseen source ever and anon sounded, and Spiridion swung a censer full of perfumes round the chamber. At length the Duke requested Count Frill {{to give them}} a song. The Bird of Paradise would never sing for pleasure, only for fame and a slight cheque. The Count begged to decline, {{and at the same time}} asked for a guitar. The Signora sent for hers; and his Excellency, <b>preluding</b> <b>with</b> a beautiful simper, gave them some slight thing to this effect.|$|E

5000|$|In 1868 Monkhouse wrote a novel, A Question of Honour. Then, after <b>preluding</b> <b>with</b> a Life of Turner in the [...] "Great Artists Series" [...] (1879), {{he devoted}} himself almost {{exclusively}} to art criticism. Besides many contributions to the Academy, the Saturday Review, the Magazine of Art and other periodicals, he published volumes on The Italian Pre-Raphaelites (1887), The Earlier English Water-Colour Painters (1890 and 1897), In the National Gallery (1895) and British Contemporary Artists (1899). He wrote a monograph on the illustrator of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland entitled The Life and Work of Sir John Tenniel, R. I. (London: 1901). He was {{a contributor to the}} Dictionary of National Biography from the beginning. Monkhouse also wrote a life of Leigh Hunt in the [...] "Great Writers Series" [...] (1887). He wrote a monograph on Chinese ceramics entitled A history and description of Chinese Porcelain, (Chapman, London 1901).|$|E

50|$|Jefferis had {{a passion}} for ocean racing. In 1938, he built a 7-ton yacht at Aldershot called <b>Prelude</b> <b>with</b> another Royal Engineer officer and they sailed {{successfully}} {{both before and after}} the war.|$|R

50|$|Several {{collections}} of short keyboard preludes by Bach were published for didactic purposes from the 19th century. In the 20th century Ferruccio Busoni combined the Twelve Little <b>Preludes</b> <b>with</b> the Six Little Preludes, BWV 933-938 into {{a set of}} 18 little preludes.|$|R
50|$|The set of {{variations}} {{can be seen}} as being divided into two halves, clearly marked by this grand French overture, commencing with a particularly emphatic opening and closing chords. It consists of a slow <b>prelude</b> <b>with</b> dotted rhythms with a following fugue-like contrapuntal section.|$|R
25|$|With {{the delay}} between the {{cancelled}} performances in Naples and {{the premiere of}} Maria Stuarda in Milan almost {{a year and a}} half later, Donizetti was to replace the <b>prelude</b> <b>with</b> a full overture and added a new version of a duet between Elizabeth and Leicester using previously written music.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Noam Zur started foraying {{into the}} field of {{composition}} and orchestration, performing part of Debussy's first book of <b>preludes</b> <b>with</b> the Young Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in December. Further preludes have since been performed in North America and Europe, with the premiere of the entire set scheduled for 2016.|$|R

50|$|The 52 {{pieces are}} based on the {{following}} chorales which are mostly arranged alphabetically. The chorale preludes fall into five types: harmonized chorale (H); figural chorale <b>prelude</b> (F) <b>with</b> a motivic accompaniment often derived from the melody of the chorale; canonic chorale <b>prelude</b> (C) <b>with</b> the chorale in canon between two voices; ornamental chorale <b>prelude</b> (O) <b>with</b> a highly elaborate version of the chorale in the highest voice; and hybrid chorale prelude (Hy), a combination of the above. The list also specifies the number of voices in the piece and indicates which voices (SATB and P for pedal) share the cantus firmus (c.f.).|$|R
50|$|Initially, Debussy {{and other}} pianists who gave early {{performances}} of the works (including Ricardo Viñes) played them in groups {{of three or four}} preludes, which remains a popular approach today. This allows performers to choose <b>preludes</b> <b>with</b> which they have the strongest affinity, or those to which their individual interpretive gifts are most suited.|$|R

500|$|Andante moderato. Morrison {{writes that}} this <b>prélude,</b> <b>with</b> its [...] "stammering and halting progress" [...] conveys an inconsolable grief. After the opening andante moderato, it becomes {{gradually}} more assertive, and subsides to conclude in the subdued {{mood of the}} opening. The rhythm of one of Fauré's best-known songs, [...] "N'est-ce-pas?" [...] from La bonne chanson, runs through the piece.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} {{work was}} written between 10 October 1950 and 25 February 1951. Once finished, Shostakovich dedicated {{the work to}} Nikolayeva, who undertook the public premiere in Leningrad on 23 December 1952. Shostakovich wrote out all the pieces without many corrections except the B-flat minor <b>prelude,</b> <b>with</b> which he was dissatisfied and replaced what he had begun initially.|$|R

50|$|Von Einem {{revised the}} score {{slightly}} after the premier, replacing an orchestral <b>prelude</b> <b>with</b> the chords that now open the opera, cutting an orchestral passage after Danton's death, and revising {{the final scene}} with Lucile. These changes make for a more dramatic beginning and ending and add to a score that deserves more frequent revivals than it has seen to date.|$|R
5000|$|The chorale [...] "Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern", {{associated}} variously with Epiphany, Whit, Annunciation, and Sundays after Trinity, is set by Pachelbel as a three-voice <b>prelude</b> <b>with</b> the chorale in {{the bass}} voice. Pachelbel uses fore-imitation throughout the piece: whenever the next phrase of the chorale {{is about to}} begin, the upper voices anticipate its melodic contour in brief imitative passages.|$|R
60|$|Upon being urged, however, {{to speak}} out, he <b>preluded</b> <b>with</b> {{two or three}} large puffs of tobacco-smoke, {{and out of the}} cloudy {{sanctuary}} which these whiffs formed around him delivered the following legend, having cleared his voice with one or two hems, and imitating, as near as he could, the eloquence which weekly thundered over his head from the pulpit.|$|R

5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and <b>preludes</b> <b>with</b> a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{work has}} {{the form of}} an Organ Mass: between its opening and closing movements—the prelude and [...] "St Anne" [...] fugue in E major, BWV 552—are 21 chorale preludes, BWV 669-689, setting parts of the Lutheran mass and catechisms, {{followed}} by four duets, BWV 802-805. The chorale preludes range from compositions for single keyboard to a six-part fugal <b>prelude</b> <b>with</b> two parts in the pedal.|$|R
