40|$|We {{propose a}} {{mechanism}} for the cytoplasmic Ca++ oscillator which is thought to <b>power</b> <b>shuttle</b> streaming in strands of the slime-mold Physarum polycephalum. The mechanism uses a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of myosin light chain kinase. This kinase is bistable if the kinase phosphorylation chain, through adenylate cyclase and cAMP, is activated by calcium. Relaxation oscillations can then occur if calcium is exchanged between the cytoplasm and internal vacuoles known to exist in physarum. As contractile activity in physarum myosin is inhibited by calcium, this model can give calcium oscillations 180 degrees out of phase with actin filament tension as observed. Oscillations of ATP concentration are correctly predicted to be in phase with the tension, provided the actomyosin cycling rate is comparable with ATPase rates for phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and its kinase...|$|E

50|$|The United States’ NASA is {{developing}} a plan to land humans on Mars by the 2030s.

Orion’s crew will return to Earth with samples of the asteroid and their collected data.

50|$|As such, the Mission Control Center asked Atlantis crew to <b>power</b> up the <b>shuttles</b> {{robotic arm}} ready to reinspect the orbiter, and drew up {{plans for a}} series of tests which took place on flight day 12 to {{determine}} whether the shuttle was safe for re-entry. This extra inspection, added to poor weather forecasts predicted for the Shuttle Landing Facility for Wednesday, meant that the de-orbit burn and landing were delayed by a day.|$|R
50|$|During the {{experimental}} program, Rocketdyne also produced a small run of six pre-production models for testing, the J-2S. These were test fired many times between 1965 and 1972, {{for a total}} of 30,858 seconds burn time. In 1972 it became clear no follow-on orders for Saturn boosters were coming, and the program shut down. NASA did consider using the J-2S on a number of different missions, including <b>powering</b> the Space <b>Shuttle</b> in a number of early designs.|$|R
25|$|After {{opening the}} shuttle's payload bay doors at 17:03:20 GMT, the crew began {{configuring}} Atlantis for on-orbit operations. The Ku-band antenna was deployed and the self-test was completed with satisfactory results. CAPCOM astronaut Barry Wilmore radioed the crew from mission control in Houston, reporting that a preliminary analysis found {{no signs of}} any significant debris or impact damage during the ascent.
