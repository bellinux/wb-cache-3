Functional residual capacity and total lung capacity was measured with a body plethysmograph before, during, and immediately after <b>breathing</b> with expiratory <b>pressure</b> of 5 and 15 cm H 2 O, and after a coughing period. The <b>positive</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> was carried out five times for two minutes with a two minute interval between each period. Mucus transport was measured in a peripheral lung region and over the whole lung by a radioactive aerosol tracer technique. Clearance measurements were carried out continuously during <b>positive</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> and during a control period. Two minutes' breathing with an expiratory pressure of 5 and 15 cm H 2 O caused an increase in mean (SEM) functional residual capacity from 2. 6 (0. 1) to 3. 6 (0. 3) and 4. 4 (0. 5) 1 {{and an increase in}} total lung capacity from 5. 1 (0. 2) to 5. 9 (0. 3) and 6. 9 (0. 4) 1. Lung volumes were higher during breathing with an expiratory pressure of 15 cm H 2 O than with 5 cm H 2 O; both returned to baseline values immediately after <b>positive</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing.</b> Spontaneous mucus clearance and mucus clearance by coughing were not influenced by <b>positive</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> at either expiratory pressure.

40|$|Background and Purpose. This {{investigation}} identified ventilation dis-tribution, gas mixing, lung function, and {{arterial blood}} oxyhemoglo-bin saturation (Spo 2) physiologic responses to 2 independent airway clearance treatments, high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and low <b>positive</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> (PEP) <b>breathing,</b> for subjects who had cystic fibrosis (CF) {{and who were}} hospitalized during acute and subacute phases of a pulmonary exacerbation. Subjects. Fifteen sub-jects with moderate to severe CF were included in this study. Methods. Subjects performed single-breath inert gas tests and spirometry before and immediately after HFCWO and PEP breathing at admission and discharge. Arterial blood oxyhemoglobin saturation was monitored throughout each treatment. Results. At admission and discharge, PEP breathing increased Spo 2 during treatment, whereas HFCWO decreased Spo 2 during treatment. Ventilation distribution, gas mixing, and lung function improved after HFCWO or PEP breathing. Discus-sion and Conclusion. High-frequency chest wall oscillation and PEP breathing are similarly efficacious in improving ventilation distribu-tion, gas mixing, and pulmonary function in hospitalized people with CF. Because Spo 2 decreases during HFCWO, people who have mod-erate to severe CF and who use HFCWO should have Spo 2 monitored during an acute exacerbation. [Darbee JC, Kanga JF, Ohtake PJ.

40|$|Background. The prone {{position}} {{is applied to}} facilitate surgery of the back and to improve oxygenation in the respirator-treated patient. In particular, with positive pressure ventilation the {{prone position}} reduces venous return to the heart and in turn cardiac output (CO) with consequences for cerebral blood flow. We tested in healthy subjects the hypothesis that rotating the head in the prone position reduces cerebral blood flow. Methods. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV), and CO were determined, together with the middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity (MCA V(mean)) and jugular vein diameters bilaterally in 22 healthy subjects in the prone position with the head centered, respectively, rotated sideways, with and without <b>positive</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> (10 [*]cmH(2) O). Results. The prone position reduced SV (by 5. 4 Â± 1. 5 %; P < 0. 05) and CO (by 2. 3 Â± 1. 9 %), and slightly increased MAP (from 78 Â± 3 to 80 Â± 2 [*]mmHg) as well as bilateral jugular vein diameters, leaving MCA V(mean) unchanged. <b>Positive</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> in the prone position increased MAP (by 3. 6 Â± 0. 8 [*]mmHg) but further reduced SV and CO (by 9. 3 Â± 1. 3 % and 7. 2 Â± 2. 4 % below baseline) while MCA V(mean) was maintained. The head-rotated prone position with <b>positive</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> augmented MAP further (87 Â± 2 [*]mmHg) but not CO, narrowed both jugular vein diameters, and reduced MCA V(mean) (by 8. 6 Â± 3. 2 %).

40|$|SUMMARY We {{studied the}} effect of 10 cm H 2 O of {{continuous}} <b>positive</b> airway <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> (CPAPB) on steady state lung fluid balance. In 9 of 20 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized sheep, we measured lung lymph flow, pulmonary vascular pressure, cardiac output, pleura! pressure, and lymph and plasma protein concentration during a 2 -hour baseline period and 3 - 4 hours of CPAPB. In eight sheep, we measured the same variables after increasing average left atrial pressure by 18 cm H,O to cause mild interstitial edema. At {{the end of the}} final experiment, we anesthetized the sheep, removed the lungs, and measured their water content. During CPAPB, pleural and left atrial pressures increased by 5 cm H,O, whereas puhnonary artery pressure increased by 7 - 10 cm H 2 O. Lung lymph flow as well as lymph and plasma protein concentrations did not change significantly. In six sheep, postmortem lung water content was increased above that predicted but was within the predicted range for the group as a whole. We conclude that moderate CPAPB does not measurably affect the steady state lung fluid balance. More important, however, the rise in puhnonary vascular pressure must have been balanced by a rise in perimicrovascular interstitial fluid pressure since filtration did not change. It appears that the fraction of increased alveolar pressure transmitted to the microvessels was via the perimicrovascular fluid rather than through solid tissue contact.
