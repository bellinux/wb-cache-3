40|$|Objective: Objective: <b>Polyaxial</b> pedicle screws are a safe, useful {{adjunct to}} transpedicular fixation. However, the large screw head size can cause soft tissue irritation, high rod positioning, and facet joint injury. However, the {{mechanical}} resistance provided by small and low profile pedicle screws is very limited. We therefore developed a novel, low profile pedicle screw using grooving and blasting treatment that {{is able to}} resist a high compression bending load. Methods: We evaluated the compression bending force to displacement and yield loads for seven different screw head types that differed {{with regard to their}} groove intervals {{and whether or not they}} had been blasted. Results: The rank order of screw types that had the greatest compression bending force to displacement was as follows: (1) universal <b>polyaxial,</b> (2) low <b>polyaxial</b> with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting, (3) low <b>polyaxial</b> with blasting, (4) low <b>polyaxial</b> with 0. 15 mm grooves and blasting, (5) low <b>polyaxial</b> with 0. 05 mm grooves and blasting, (6) low <b>polyaxial</b> with 0. 05 mm grooves, (7) and low <b>polyaxial.</b> Low <b>polyaxial</b> screws with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting had the maximum yield load and highest compression bending force to displacement of all seven <b>polyaxial</b> screw head systems evaluated.

40|$|Abstract Background Lumbosacral fusion is a {{relatively}} common procedure that {{is used in the}} management of an unstable spine. The anterior interbody cage has been involved to enhance the stability of a pedicle screw construct used at the lumbosacral junction. Biomechanical differences between <b>polyaxial</b> and monoaxial pedicle screws linked with various rod contours were investigated to analyze the respective effects on overall construct stiffness, cage strain, rod strain, and contact ratios at the vertebra-cage junction. Methods A synthetic model composed of two ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene blocks was used with four titanium pedicle screws (two in each block) and two rods fixation to build the spinal construct along with an anterior interbody cage support. For each pair of the construct fixed with <b>polyaxial</b> or monoaxial screws, the linked rods were set at four configurations to simulate 0 °, 7 °, 14 °, and 21 ° lordosis on the sagittal plane, and a compressive load of 300 N was applied. Strain gauges were attached to the posterior surface of the cage and to the central area of the left connecting rod. Also, the contact area between the block and the cage was measured using prescale Fuji super low pressure film for compression, flexion, lateral bending and torsion tests. Results Our main findings in the experiments with an anterior interbody cage support are as follows: 1) large segmental lordosis can decrease the stiffness of monoaxial pedicle screws constructs; 2) <b>polyaxial</b> screws rather than monoaxial screws combined with the cage fixation provide higher compression and flexion stiffness in 21 ° segmental lordosis; 3) <b>polyaxial</b> screws enhance the contact surface of the cage in 21 ° segmental lordosis. Conclusion <b>Polyaxial</b> screws system used in conjunction with anterior cage support yields higher contact ratio, compression and flexion stiffness of spinal constructs than monoaxial screws system does in the same model when the spinal segment is set at large lordotic angles. <b>Polyaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation performs nearly equal percentages of vertebra-cage contact among all constructs with different sagittal alignments, therefore enhances the stabilization effect of interbody cages in the lumbosacral area. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Use of a {{pedicle screw}} {{at the level}} of fracture, also known as an {{intermediate}} screw, has been shown to improve clinical results in managing lumbar fracture, but there is a paucity of biomechanical studies to support the claim. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of adding intermediate pedicle screws {{at the level of}} a fracture on the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using monoaxial or <b>polyaxial</b> screws and to compare the strength of monoaxial and <b>polyaxial</b> screws in the calf spine fracture model. Materials and Methods: Flexibility of 12 fresh-frozen calf lumbar spine specimens was evaluated in all planes. An unstable burst fracture model was created at the level of L 3 by the pre-injury and dropped-mass technique. The specimens were randomly divided into monoaxial pedicle screw (MPS) and <b>polyaxial</b> pedicle screw (PPS) groups. Flexibility was retested without and with intermediate screws (MPSi and PPSi) placed at the level of fracture in addition to standard screws placed at L 2 and L 4. Results: The addition of intermediate screws significantly increased the stability of the constructs, as measured by a decreased range of motion (ROM) in flexion, extension, and lateral bending in both MPS and PPS groups (P 0. 05), but there was a significant difference between MPS and PPS in flexion and extension in the short-segment fixation group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stability of short-segment pedicle screw fixation in both the MPS and PPS groups.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveIn {{pedicle screw}} fixation, {{the heads of}} {{monoaxial}} screws need to be directed in the same straight line to accommodate the rod placement by backing out during operation, which decreases the insertional torque and internal fixation strength. While <b>polyaxial</b> screws facilitate the assembly of the connecting rod, but its ball-in-cup locking mechanism reduces the static compressive bending yield strength as compared with monoaxial screws. Our study aimed to assess the mechanical performance of a modified pedicle screw. MethodsIn this study, {{the tail of the}} screw body of the modified pedicle screw was designed to be a cylinder-shaped structure that well matched the inner wall of the screw head and the screw head only rotated around the cyclinder. Monoaxial screws, modified screws and <b>polyaxial</b> screws were respectively assembled into 3 groups of vertebrectomy models simulated by ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) blocks. This model was developed according to a standard for destructive mechanical testing published by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM F 1717 – 04). Each screw design had 6 subgroups, including 3 for static tension, load compression and torsion tests, and the rest for dynamic compression tests. In dynamic tests, the cyclic loads were 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the compressive bending ultimate loads respectively. Yield load, yield ultimate load, yield stiffness, torsional stiffness, cycles to failure and modes of failure for the 3 types of screws were recorded. The results of modified screws were compared with those of monoaxial and <b>polyaxial</b> screws. ResultsIn static tests, results of bending stiffness, yield load, yield torque and torsional stiffness indicated {{no significant differences between the}} modified and monoaxial screws (P> 0. 05), but both differed significantly from those of <b>polyaxial</b> screws (P< 0. 05). In dynamic compression tests, both modified and monoaxial screws showed failures that occurred at the insertion point of screw body into the UHMWPE block, while the <b>polyaxial</b> screw group showed screw body swung up and down the screw head because of loosening of the ball-in-cup mechanism. ConclusionsThe modified screw is well-designed and biomechanically improved. And it can provide sufficient stability for segment fixation as monoaxial screws...|$|E

Four different groups each having 5 constructs were tested in distraction within the elastic range.

The pedicle screw systems showed higher stiffness (4. 008 ± 0. 113 [*]Nmm monoaxial, 3. 638 ± 0. 108 [*]Nmm Click-x; 3. 634 ± 0. 147 [*]Nmm Pangea) than the exfix system (2. 882 ± 0. 054 [*]Nmm) in distraction.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} is the {{presentation}} of the <b>polyaxial</b> locking NCB-plate in the treatment of femoral fractures, especially in elderly patients and in proximity of a prosthetic implant. The reduction and fixation of these fractures is a challenging surgical procedure with high complication rates reported up to 40 %. Patients and methodsA total of 72 patients with femoral fractures had <b>polyaxial</b> locking plate osteosynthesis. Indications included fractures of the shaft and around an implant. Concerning surgical procedures, three different standardized techniques were performed: (1) minimally invasive with percutaneous distal insertion using a targeting device; (2) mini-open with additional cerclage wire via the same approach and (3) a conventional open reduction and internal fixation. Data collection included intraoperative data and early complications at 6, 24 and 52 weeks. Fifty-two patients had an implant or prosthesis in situ. Thirty-three patients were treated by technique (1), 32 patients had mini-open surgery and seven patients conventional open surgery. ResultsThirty-nine patients attended clinical follow-up after 52 weeks. Twenty-two patients were interviewed by telephone, two were untraceable and nine patients had died. Bony consolidation without secondary loss of reduction was confirmed after 52 weeks in all patients but two. Plate breakage occurred in these two at 25 and 31 weeks after surgery due to non-union. Implant related complications (17 % in total) lead to surgical revision in five other cases: two deep wound infections as well as three minor revisions. When itemizing complications according to surgical technique used, most major complications occurred following open surgery. ConclusionThe availability of <b>polyaxial</b> locking implants widened the range of indications for plate fixation in femoral fractures.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: No {{studies have}} {{compared}} monoaxial and <b>polyaxial</b> pedicle screws {{with regard to}} the von Mises stress of the instrumentation, intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment and adjacent segment degeneration. METHODS: Short-segment monoaxial/polyaxial pedicle screw fixation techniques were compared using finite element methods, and the redistributed T 11 -L 1 segment range of motion, largest maximal von Mises stress of the instrumentation, and intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment under displacement loading were evaluated. Radiographic results of 230 patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures treated with these fixations were reviewed, and the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle, anterior vertebral body height of the fractured vertebrae and adjacent segment degeneration were calculated and evaluated. RESULTS: The largest maximal values of the von Mises stress were 376. 8 MPa for the pedicle screws in the short-segment monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model and 439. 9 MPa for the rods in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the upper adjacent segments were all greater than those of the lower adjacent segments. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model were larger than those in the corresponding segments of the normal model. The radiographic results at the final follow-up evaluation showed that the mean loss of correction of the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle and anterior vertebral body height were smallest in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle screw fixation group. Adjacent segment degeneration was less likely to be observed in the intermediate <b>polyaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation group but more likely to be observed in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle screw fixation group.

In failure testing, monoaxial pedicle screw system was stronger (360 N) than exfixes (160 N) and <b>polyaxial</b> devices which failed if distracted greater than 4 cm (157 N Click-x or 138 N Pangea). The exfix had higher peak torque and torsional stiffness than all pedicle systems. In torsion, the yield strengths were the same for all constructs. Conclusion. The infix device constructed with <b>polyaxial</b> or monoaxial pedicle screws is stiffer than the 2 pin external fixator in distraction testing. In extreme cases, the use of reinforcement or monoaxial systems which do not fail even at 360 N is a better option. In torsional testing, the 2 pin external fixator is stiffer than the pedicle screw systems. 1...|$|E
