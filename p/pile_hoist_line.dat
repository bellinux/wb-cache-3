40|$|This paper {{presents}} an advanced simulation model for short-term scheduling of complex <b>hoist</b> <b>lines.</b> This problem, generally found in aerospace and electroplating industries, includes several hard constraints {{that should be}} considered: single shared hoist, heterogeneous recipes, eventual recycle flows, and no buffers between workstations. Different heuristic-based strategies are incorporated into the computer model {{in order to improve}} the solutions generated over time. The aim is {{to reduce the number of}} products that must be discarded while minimizing the makespan. In addition, a graphical user interface was developed for quickly evaluating simulated schedules...|$|R

40|$|Gantry cranes have {{attracted}} {{a great deal}} of interest in transportation and industrial applications. To increase the effectiveness of gantry cranes, the control of such systems is considered vital. This paper is concerned with tracking the control of an underactuated gantry crane using an optimal feedback controller. The optimal control strategy takes into account a performance index, including integrated time and absolute error criterion. To do this, nonlinear dynamic equations of the system are derived using Lagrange’s Principle. The minimum tracking error of the trolley and the minimum oscillation of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>line</b> are assumed as design parameters, and the best gains of the feedback controller are achieved. Finally, some tracking simulations are performed which demonstrate the capability of the simple proposed method in the optimal tracking control of a gantry crane...|$|R
5000|$|... 11 April 1966, an HH-43 of Detachment 6 {{based at}} Bien Hoa Air Base {{was called to}} medevac wounded of the 1st Infantry Division which were {{surrounded}} by enemy forces near Cam My, east of Saigon. Pararescueman A1C William H. Pitsenbarger was lowered by winch and spent {{an hour and a}} half treating the wounded and evacuating nine wounded soldiers on 5 Huskie flights. On the sixth approach, Pitsenbarger's Huskie was hit, forcing it to cut the <b>hoist</b> <b>line</b> and pull out for an emergency landing at the nearest strip. Pitsenbarger continued to treat the wounded, collected rifles and ammunition from the dead and distributed them to the men still able to fight and returned enemy fire before being fatally hit. Pitsenbarger was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross. On 8 December 2000 Pitsenbarger was also awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|R

50|$|Electrical hoists (also {{referred}} to as winches) can facilitate coordination with cues, move extremely heavy line-sets, and significantly limit the required population of the fly crew.

50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, <b>hoist</b> motors, drag <b>lines,</b> pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|R

40|$|Rig Check was {{developed}} by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in partnership with safety experts from the oil and gas extraction industry. It is made up of 35 inspection forms. The forms are designed to be used by rig workers to document the inspection of tools and equipment commonly found on rotary and workover rigs. Each inspection form includes instructions for assessing and recording the condition of the equipment. When applicable, relevant federal regulations and industry recommended practices are included. The Rig Check inspection forms are an excellent training tool for short service employees, who may not be familiar with the tools and equipment found on oil and gas rigs. Small companies whose safety and health resources are limited may find Rig Check useful for enhancing their HSE programs. The forms can also be downloaded from the NIOSH website at: www. cdc. gov/niosh/programs/oilgas/products. html. Rig Check Monthly Inspection Forms: [...] Emergency Response: [...] 1.

500|$|The Pile Gates are a well-fortified complex with {{multiple}} doors, defended by Fort Bokar and the moat that {{ran around the}} outside {{section of the city}} walls. At the entrance gate to the Old Town, on the western side of the land walls, there is a stone bridge between two Gothic arches, which were designed by the esteemed architect Paskoje Miličević in 1471. That bridge connects to another bridge, a wooden drawbridge which can be pulled up. During the republican era, the wooden drawbridge to the <b>Pile</b> Gate was <b>hoisted</b> each night with considerable pomp in a ceremony which delivered the city's keys to the Ragusan rector. Today, it spans a dry moat whose garden offers respite from crowds. Above the bridges, over the arch of town's principal gateway, there is a statue of city patron Saint Blaise (...) , with a model of the Renaissance city. After passing the Pile Gate's original Gothic inner gateway, it is possible to reach one of a three access points to the city walls.|$|R

The captain orders Billy to let the harbor police catch the thief, but Billy refuses and speeds off.

5000|$|On 22 April, Weazle {{was four}} miles ENE {{of the island}} of Zirona when she {{encountered}} a convoy close to the shore, making for the ports of Tran and Spalatro. Weazle gave chase, but the convoy split up, most of the vessels, including ten gunboats, heading for Boscaline Bay, between Tran and Marina. Weazle chased the gunboats, which around 6am formed a <b>line,</b> <b>hoisted</b> the French flag, and proceeded to fire on her. An all-day action ensued in which the French lost one gunboat sunk, two driven on shore, and three surrendered. However, four more enemy gunboats joined the action, as did shore batteries and troops on shore. Weazle further succeeded in burning and destroying eight vessels belonging to the convoy. The next morning the action resumed as Weazle, holed, taking on water, and with all her sails and rigging destroyed, slowly attempted to warp out of range. Weazle was unable to disengage until the late afternoon of 24 April. Weazle had lost five men killed and twenty-four wounded, with slightly over half the wounded being severely wounded, and {{with most of the}} casualties having occurred on the first day. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp [...] "Weasel 22 April 1813" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1973 {{we were asked to}} perform a {{theoretical}} investigation of the propagation of low frequency (LF) radio waves down deep (10, 000 feet) hoistshafts* for the case where the hoist cable ("rope") is the only metal conductor present. Propagation is by means of the TEM coaxial mode of transmission in which the hoist cable serves as the inner conductor and the surrounding rock acts as the outer conductor. Since the rock is a relatively poor electrical conductor the current in the outer conductor of the coaxial line is not confined to a very thin surface layer as in a metal coaxial cable, but spreads radially to a distance that is generally many times the shaft diameter. This feature of the wave propagation requires a more sophisticated theoretical treatment than the approximate skin-depth theory that is adequate for metal coaxial lines. In this Part we treat the hoist shaft wave propagation loss, characteristic impedance, and the field current distributions in the surrounding rock medium. We also show that the large penetration of the wave into the rock outer conductor does not present a difficult problem with regard to coupling the transmitter or receiver to the transmission line with a minimum of insertion loss, but that the large impedance mismatch caused by the capacitance termination between the cage and shaft wall may well be the most significant contribution to overall system loss. Inductive coupling and impedance matching to the <b>hoist</b> rope/shaft transmission <b>line</b> are also treated briefly. Preliminary results indicate that a broad minimum in overall system loss should occur between 100 kHz and 1 MHz, possibly centered around 300 kHz. Further work is needed to better quantify this signal loss behavior, compare it with hoist shaft electromagnetic noise spectral data recently acquired by NBS, and identify the most favorable operating frequencies...|$|R
