A research was conducted in Rantau Panjang, Kelantan along the time interval from September 2013 until December 2013 to study the serious infestations of <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> and to identify the species varieties of <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> present. The research was done to determine the growth stage of paddy heavily infested by <b>stem</b> <b>borers.</b> There were three growth stage of the paddy which the research had been carried out which were the vegetative stage, the reproductive stage and the ripening stage. The trial was arranged in a 3 split plot design with 6 replications. The population of the paddy and the damage was recorded. Damage paddies were then collected from each plot and then the infestation was determined. The most heavily infested stage was recorded. Results showed that the dominant species of <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> was yellow <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> (Scirpophaga incertulas). <b>Stem</b> <b>borer</b> infestation at the second growth stage, the reproductive stage was higher compared to those found at the first and third growth stage.

A field trial was conducted in Karawang, West Java in dry season of 2003 to study the effect of planting time on the <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> infestation on seven rice cultivars. The rice cultivars tested were Fatmawati (new plant type cultivar), Gilirang (semi-new plant type cultivar), Maro and Intani 3 (hybrid rice cultivars), and IR 72, Cilosari and IR 62 (inbreed rice cultivars). The three planting times (PT) were: (1) the early PT, 14 days before farmer 2 ̆ 7 s PT, (2) the common PT, simultaneously with farmer 2 ̆ 7 s PT, and (3) the late PT, 14 days after farmer 2 ̆ 7 s PT.

(Cyperales: Poaceae) and Sorghum bicolor (L.) (Cyperales: Poaceae), in cultivated habitats. The four major host plants (Cyperus spp., Panicum spp., Pennisetum spp., and Sorghum spp.) found in natural habitats were also assessed, and both the cultivated and natural habitat species occurred in four agroecological zones in Kenya. Across habitats, plant infestation (23. 2 %), <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> density (2. 2 per plant), and larval parasitism (15. 0 %) were highest in maize in cultivated habitats. Pupal parasitism was not higher than 4. 7 % in both habitats, and did not vary with locality during each season or with host plant between each season. Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) and C. flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were the key parasitoids in cultivated habitats (both species accounted for 76. 4 % of parasitized <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in cereal crops), but not in natural habitats (the two Cotesia species accounted for 14. 5 % of parasitized <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in wild host plants). No single parasitoid species exerted high parasitism rates on <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> populations in wild host plants. Low <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> densities across seasons in natural habitats indicate that cereal <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pests do not necessarily survive the non-cropping season feeding actively in wild host plants. Although natural habitats provided refuges for some parasitoid species, <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> parasitism was generally low in wild host plants. Overall, because parasitoids contribute little in reducing cereal <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pest populations in cultivated habitats, there is need to further enhance their effectiveness {{in the field to}} regulate these pests...|$|R

In Kenya the damage caused by <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> leads to 13. 5 % yield loss estimated to be 400, 000 MT of maize annually. The spotted <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> Chilo partellus, Swinhoe {{is one of the major}} species of <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in Kenya. Bt-maize has been proved to reduce losses due to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> damage. Development of insect resistance among <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> is one of the concerns of using Bt-maize. A study was conducted at the KARI Biosafety Greenhouse level 11, to determine the development of stemborer resistance to two Bt cry proteins for over four generation cycles of selection. The cry proteins were cry 1 Ab and cry 1 Ba expressed from Bt-maize event 223 carrying Bt cry 1 Ab gene and event 10 carrying Bt cry 1 Ba gene. Three hundred neonates of C. partellus were infested into maize leaves and allowed to feed for 24 hours. The surviving larvae were reared in artificial diet up to adult stage. The performance of each protein was assessed over time by estimation of the number of surviving larvae over each generation. The results showed significantly fewer surviving larvae from the Bt-maize events compared to the non-transgenic CML 216 control. The means were 70. 4 for CML 216, 13. 3 and 7. 4 for Event 10 and 223 respectively. There were highly significant differences between the control and the two Bt-maize events. The two Bt-maize events were statistically not different in controlling the pest over the studied generations, indicating that there was no development of resistance to cry proteins in the tested C. partellus colony.

The results suggest, that aqueous and acetone extracts of neem seed kernel and physic nut seed kernel can be used by upland rice farmers to control <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> and obtain higher crop yields.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted during 1990 and 1991 in Kenya, {{to study the}} reaction of 27 sorghum genotypes to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> Chilo partellus damage under irrigated and drought conditions. Crop growth was maintained at irrigated and water-stressed (non-irrigated) conditions. Data were recorded on deadheart formation due to <b>stem</b> <b>borer,</b> leaf area damaged, number of larvae per 5 plants, peduncle damage, and recovery resistance under natural infestation. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences due to genotype, irrigation treatments and genotype x irrigation treatment interaction in plants with deadhearts, number of larvae, leaf feeding, peduncle damage and recovery resistance for genotypes, except in case of leaf area damage. Deadheart incidence was slightly lower (70. 4 %) in irrigated than non-irrigated plots. Leaf feeding was greater (94. 7 %) under irrigated than non-irrigated plots (91. 5 %), except {{in the case of}} genotypes (ICSV 88013, IS 8193, KAT 83368, IS 23509 and ICSV 112). Peduncle damage was lower (5. 8) under irrigated than non-irrigated conditions. Plant recovery in response to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> damage was greater under irrigated (5. 4) than non-irrigated (6. 3) conditions, except for ICSH 89020, IS 23509 and ICSV-CM 865132. The number of <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> larvae were greater (41. 8 larvae per 5 plants) in irrigated than non-irrigated (27. 3 larvae per 5 plants) plots. Irrigation reduced deadheart incidence, peduncle damage, and recovery resistance in sorghum due to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> infestation...|$|R
40|$|The rice water weevil (RWW) Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an {{invasive}} {{insect pest}} of rice Oryza sativa L. in China. Little {{is known about}} the interactions of this weevil with indigenous herbivores. In the present study, adult feeding and population density of the weevil, injury level of striped <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> Sesamia inferens (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to rice, as well as growth status of their host plants were surveyed in a rice field located in Southeastern Zhejiang, China, in 2004 with the objective to discover interspecific interactions on the rice. At tillering stage, both adult feeding of the weevil and injury of the <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> tended to occur on larger tillers (bearing 5 leaves) compared with small tillers (bearing 2 ~ 4 leaves), but the insects showed no evident competition with each other. At booting stage, the <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> caused more withering/dead hearts and the weevil reached a higher density on the plants which had more productive tillers and larger root system; the number of weevils per tiller correlated negatively with the percentage of withering/dead hearts of plants in a hill. These observations indicate that interspecific interactions exist between the rice water weevil and the rice <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> with negative relations occurring at booting or earlier developmental stages of rice...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} surveys {{was carried out}} in farmers’ fields in two major sorghum-growing states of India (Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh) during the 1994 and 1995 {{cropping}} seasons to determine distribution, abundance, and economic importance of the spotted <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> Chilo partellus Swinhoe and associated parasitoids in sorghum. <b>Stem</b> <b>borer</b> incidence and distribution varied significantly between the two states.

40|$|Country-wide {{surveys of}} {{lepidopteran}} <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in wild host plants were undertaken between 2006 and 2009 in South Africa and 2005 and 2010 in Mozambique. A total of 4438 larvae {{were collected from}} 65 wild host plants in South Africa and 1920 larvae from 30 wild host plants in Mozambique. In South Africa and Mozambique, 50 and 39 <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> species were recovered, respectively, with four new species and two new genera among noctuids. Less than 5 % {{of the total number}} of species collected are considered to be economically important in Africa. These species were Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Noctuidae), Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Crambidae) and Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Noctuidae). Data from this study and others in East Africa on the very low abundance of <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in wild host plants question the putative role of wild host plants as reservoir for <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pests. One new host plant family (Prioniaceae), as well as 24 and 13 wild hosts from South Africa and Mozambique respectively, was added to the list of known hosts in Africa...|$|R
