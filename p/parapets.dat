5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and <b>parapets,</b> with the <b>parapets</b> of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls. The core building {{was linked to the}} external fortifications by corridors and chambers.|$|E
5|$|St. James Bastion – a large obtuse-angled bastion with an echaugette at its salient angle. Its thick <b>parapets</b> with embrasures {{have been}} dismantled. The bastion is {{occupied}} by the Central Bank of Malta and a car park.|$|E
5|$|In places, the {{seemingly}} at odds architectural styles {{can be viewed}} simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets. These coupled with the castellated <b>parapets</b> add {{what appears to be}} an almost Moorish element to the late English Renaissance air of the northern facade.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to {{its status}} as a {{first-class}} fortification, Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice. Work was even done to strengthen the defenses, as a stockade was added in the summer of 1865, and the <b>parapets</b> of the fort were re-sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve the look of the fortification.|$|E
5|$|The {{cruciform}} abbey {{is built}} of Bath stone, {{which gives the}} exterior its yellow colour. It is an atypical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture, with low aisles and nave arcades and a tall clerestory. The walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements, pinnacles and pierced <b>parapets,</b> {{many of which were}} added by George Manners during his 1830's restorations.|$|E
5|$|Various {{modifications}} {{were made}} to Valletta's fortifications during British rule. The most significant of these was the construction of Fort Lascaris between 1854 and 1856. Other alterations included the addition of batteries and concrete gun emplacements, changes to <b>parapets</b> and their embrasures, {{and the construction of}} gunpowder magazines. All three original Hospitaller gateways to Valletta were demolished, and two of them were replaced by larger gates.|$|E

5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's <b>parapets.</b> The rebellion failed, and the tower {{does not seem to have}} required extensive repairs.|$|E
5|$|Lathrop stands five stories {{tall with}} an {{additional}} basement level. The dormitory, Elizabethan in style, is a brick building with elements of brownstone trim. The roof is a Vermont slate and from it rise five chimneys, each built with two wythes of brick and capped with bluestone. There are also multiple cupolas that are framed with wood, include painted louvered slats, and have topped with a coat of terne. The building also has <b>parapets,</b> unlike neighboring Strong.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof <b>parapets.</b> Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
5000|$|The Anglo-Dutch <b>parapet</b> p114 is surmounted {{with three}} spherical finials {{and the central}} {{pediment}} displays in relief the year: [...] "1905". Two pilasters extend from below this central pediment and are each decorated with rectangular blue tile inserts and they flank a decorative geometrical motiff in {{the centre of the}} <b>parapet.</b> On either side of the pilasters a curved line emanating from the curved edge of the <b>parapet</b> culminates in a scroll at the middle of the pilasters. There are two shorter pilasters {{at either end of the}} <b>parapet</b> which also display blue tile inserts. The general decorative appearance of the <b>parapet</b> is of an art-nouveau style. The front wall of the verandah is also of face brick and has three double French doors with rectangular fanlights.|$|R
50|$|Painted {{corrugated}} iron hip roofs are concealed {{on the street}} elevations by an ornate masonry <b>parapet</b> wall. Supported on shallow twin brackets, the <b>parapet</b> consists of masonry balusters and pillars at the junction of each bay topped by urns. A projecting pediment in the Brunswick Street facade which breaks {{the line of the}} <b>parapet</b> is flanked by interlocking circles, instead of balusters.|$|R

5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design a new house and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton {{came up with an}} asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with castellated <b>parapets,</b> turrets and pinnacles to create the feel of a picturesque castle.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the medieval}} stonework, is made from {{limestone}} taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas. The two-bay Elder Lady Chapel, which includes some Purbeck Marble, lies {{to the north of}} the five-bay aisled chancel or presbytery. The Eastern Lady Chapel has two bays, the sacristy one-bay and the Berkeley Chapel two bays. The exterior has deep buttresses with finials to weathered tops and crenellated <b>parapets</b> with crocketed pinnacles below the Perpendicular crossing tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature castellated <b>parapets,</b> turrets and pinnacles, giving the building the feel of a castle in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The intent was to give a castle style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with the comfortable interior of a house.|$|E
5000|$|The hotel, {{which has}} a hipped {{corrugated}} iron roof concealed by a string coursed <b>parapet,</b> is built to the property boundary of an acute angled block, giving it a V-shaped plan, truncated at the corner. The corner is emphasised {{with the addition of}} a pedimental element, projecting above the <b>parapet.</b> A relief moulding of the date [...] "1870" [...] appears on the <b>parapet</b> on this corner.|$|R
5000|$|The central facade {{segment is}} surmounted by a {{decorated}} <b>parapet</b> projection that spans {{the width of}} its three constituent bays. The two centrally disposed engaged piers are topped with a curved pediment, while the two framing piers are each topped with a small triangular pediment moulding. In the <b>parapet,</b> a small, semicircular gable and projecting panel supported either side by curved brackets mirror the curve in the pediment below. The words 'Headrick's' and [...] "Established 1860" [...] are lettered on {{this part of the}} ornate <b>parapet.</b> Above each framing pier and their pediments the <b>parapet</b> is articulated with a pedestal-like moulding.|$|R
50|$|The Quay Street facade {{is divided}} {{vertically}} into six bays {{by a series}} of pilasters. Above the second bay in from each end, there is a tall <b>parapet</b> projection denoting where two entry doors open into the building. There are glass double doors in each bay, however those beneath the <b>parapet</b> projections have fanlights above them, rather than simple highlights. The <b>parapet</b> projections are accented with render consoles. Beneath the variegated <b>parapet</b> top, a render entablature runs between each end of the front facade. The depth of the blank frieze seems somewhat exaggerated when compared with those of the cornice and architrave. Above the end pilasters, the entablature is visually enclosed by two narrow projections of the <b>parapet</b> top. The modelling in line with the entablature is reminiscent of single triglyphs.|$|R
5|$|The primary {{material}} {{used to create}} the bricks for the castle was margosa limestone (a type of sedimentary rock composed of limestone and clay). The front of the castle is oriented to the east, {{and there was a}} ditch around the entire perimeter, including between the castle and the Plaza de Armas (Weapons Square). As of 2008 the building had lost its <b>parapets</b> and shelters, but the main defensive structures and walls have been preserved. The fort housed a garrison of 250 soldiers, and was the residence of the governor of the Province of Cumaná.|$|E
5|$|After an {{earthquake}} in 1853, the reliquary enclosing {{an image of}} Nuestra Señora del Carmen (Our Lady of Mount Carmel), originally situated at the Mount Carmel chapel, {{was moved to the}} Santa María de la Cabeza castle, where Santos Berrizbeitia built a new chapel in 1912 to protect the image; it was later moved to St. Agnes Church. The ditch was filled in for construction of the Mount Carmel chapel and the deteriorated <b>parapets</b> were demolished. The original slopes and terraces present on Diaz Fajardo's 1737 map were probably also buried in the process. The chapel in the castle was the final resting place for Berrizbeitia; his remains, originally interred at Holy Trinity Cemetery (which he had built), were exhumed and moved five years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including <b>parapets,</b> false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} is crowned with a decorative <b>parapet</b> {{which includes the}} name [...] "TRANSCONTINENTAL HOTEL" [...] in raised lettering and a curved central <b>parapet</b> section bearing the date 1884 in a circular recess.|$|R
50|$|The Victoria street facade {{consists}} of a <b>parapet</b> wall marking the western alignment, a wide skillion roofed awning which covers the footpath {{in front of the}} building and an attached entry porch on its northern side. The <b>parapet</b> wall is decorated by timber mouldings forming a simplified entablature. Behind the <b>parapet</b> is a simple pitched corrugated iron roof that terminates in a hip at rear of the building.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to {{the actual}} {{operating}} parameters of tundish in a steel mill, the flow pattern and temperature distribution of molten steel in tundish were studied by CFD and heat transfer calculation method. Changing the height of <b>parapet</b> hole, the effect of <b>parapet</b> hole on flow field and temperature field were simulated. The simulation results show that: the <b>parapet</b> hole height has large influence on flow recirculation position, which can impact surface temperature and outflow temperature of molten steel. When <b>parapet</b> hole height increases, the recirculation vortex moves towards the surface of molten steel in outflow zone, surface temperature rises, but outflow temperature decreases near the narrow wall. Comprehensive analysis show that, when the <b>parapet</b> hole height is 480 mm, surface temperature is high, molten steel will not solidify at corner; the reduction of molten steel temperature is small at outflow hole...|$|R
5|$|Damage was {{confined}} to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed <b>parapets,</b> and overturned tombstones. In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the Gateway Arch were reported to authorities.|$|E
5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad <b>parapets.</b> The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E
5|$|It was {{maintained}} throughout the 15th century, {{and played a}} role in Kett's Rebellion of 1549, when the rebels attacked Norwich, deploying artillery and damaging the tower's <b>parapets.</b> Repairs to the tower's walls in the late 19th century inadvertently caused long-term damage, and in 1953 it was taken into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works, who stabilised its condition in a five-year conservation project. In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof of the building have been lost.|$|E
40|$|The high mound is {{sometimes}} constructed behind a composite breakwater {{in order to}} increase the sliding resistance and utilize the mound for an aquacultural purpose. The high mound must be covered by armor units with adequate weight to prevent from scattering by overtopping waves. However, the shallower is the submerged depth of the mound, the heavier become the armor units. This study proposed a backward <b>parapet</b> as a countermeasure to reduce weight of armor units. A numerical simulation showed the difference in the velocity field behind the caisson between the backward and forward <b>parapet.</b> With the backward <b>parapet,</b> large-scale eddies were not observed and the velocity on the mound was slower than that of the forward <b>parapet.</b> Furthermore, hydraulic model tests showed that the stable weight was approximately 40 % less than that of the forward <b>parapet...</b>|$|R
50|$|Tal-Borg Battery {{consisted}} of a paved gun platform, with an upper and lower <b>parapet.</b> The upper <b>parapet</b> was seven courses high and had five embrasures. The {{west side of the}} upper <b>parapet</b> was flanked by a partially demolished farm building, which served as a protective shelter for the garrison and gun crews. A well was also located near the farm building. A large barrack building or magazine with its roof covered by a layer of soil was located {{at the rear of the}} platform. A small bastion was built next to the barracks, and this was connected to the lower <b>parapet</b> by a rubble wall entrenchment. The lower <b>parapet</b> had at least five embrasures. The battery also had two sentry rooms, which had flagpoles flying the Blue Ensign and the flag of the Kingdom of Sicily.|$|R
50|$|Many {{firewalls}} {{are required}} to have a <b>parapet,</b> {{a portion of the}} wall extending above the roof. The <b>parapet</b> is required to be as fire resistant as the lower wall, and extend a distance prescribed by building code.|$|R
