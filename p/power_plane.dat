This paper presents the modeling, simulation, and measurement of a PDN in a high-speed FR 4 {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) designed for chip-to-chip communication at a data rate of 3. 2 Gbps and above.

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the radiation depends on the height above the ground plane or <b>power</b> <b>plane</b> (at RF, one {{is as good as}} the other) and the length of the conductor in relation to the wavelength of the signal component (fundamental frequency, harmonic or transient such as overshoot, undershoot or ringing). At lower frequencies, such as 133 MHz, radiation is almost exclusively via I/O cables; RF noise gets onto the power planes and is coupled to the line drivers via the VCC and GND pins. The RF is then coupled to the cable through the line driver as common-mode noise. Since the noise is common-mode, shielding has very little effect, even with differential pairs. The RF energy is capacitively coupled from the signal pair to the shield and the shield itself does the radiating. One cure for this is to use a braid-breaker or choke to reduce the common-mode signal.|$|E
