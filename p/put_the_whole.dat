Giusto claimed that Arborea was a fief of the Holy See and that the canons of Oristano had no power to grant the judgeship to William, who had ousted Peter and imprisoned him.

25|$|The station's {{terminal}} layout has posed some unique problems {{ever since}} the late 20th century, since all trains have to change directions and reverse {{out of the station}} to continue on to their destination. This causes long turn-around times and places the passengers in the opposite direction of where they had been sitting. There have been several attempts to change this. The last project, called Frankfurt 21, was to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> station underground, connect it with tunnels also to the east, and so avoid the disadvantages of the terminal layout. This would be financed by selling the air rights over the area now used for tracks as building ground for skyscraper, but this soon proved unrealistic, and the project was abandoned.|$|E

Peter has a crush on his popular next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson, but they both have unhappy lives: Mary Jane has an abusive father and suffers at home while Peter suffers the torment of bullies at school ("No More"). Peter has lived with Uncle Ben and Aunt May ever since his parents Richard and Mary Parker {{died in a plane}} crash when he was a baby. A few days later, Peter and classmates go on a field trip to the genetics laboratory of scientist Norman Osborn and his wife Emily, who explain what they hope to accomplish with their genetic research ("D.I.Y. World"). While Peter takes pictures of the lab for the school newspaper, the Osborns <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> lab on lockdown as a dangerous genetically altered spider has escaped. While the students and scientists panic, the spider lowers itself onto Peter's shoulder and bites him ("Venom").|$|E
500|$|... "Circus" [...] {{was written}} by Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco and Claude Kelly, while {{produced}} by Luke and Blanco. Luke and Kelly were initially commissioned {{to work on a}} new track for Spears, and entered the studio with no concept prepared, as Kelly explained, [...] "just knowing her style and knowing what she does." [...] After Luke came up with the music, they based the song on the public's perception of her life at the time. Spears explained that after listening to [...] "Circus" [...] for the first time, she felt inspired and imagined a story behind it. She also stated, [...] " [...] <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> album together as far as what I wanted my show to be like. You can play with a circus in so many different ways". [...] "Circus" [...] was recorded at Conway Recording Studios and Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Glenwood Place Studio in Burbank, California. Background vocals were provided by Cathy Dennis, Kelly and Myah Marie. Main instrumentation was done by Luke and Blanco. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia. [...] "Circus" [...] was announced on October 31, 2008, as the second single from the album, and was officially serviced to American radio stations on December 2, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant mellowness. Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album [...] "a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences." [...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album {{was a little too}} saccharine at times, but that it is [...] "the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> party to sleep.

500|$|... "Since Germans are the {{perennial}} disturbers of the world's peace ... {{they must be}} dealt with like any homicidal criminals. But it is unnecessary to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them. [...] The army groups, as organized units, would be the easiest and quickest to deal with. ... The population of Germany, excluding conquered and annexed territories, is about 70,000,000, almost equally divided between male and female. To achieve the purpose of German extinction it would be necessary to only sterilize some 48,000,000 -- a figure which excludes, because of their limited power to procreate, males over 60 years of age, and females over 45. ... Taking 20,000 surgeons as an arbitrary number and on the assumption that each will perform a minimum of 25 operations daily, it would take no more than one month, at the maximum, to complete their sterilization. ... The balance of the male civilian population of Germany could be treated within three months. Inasmuch as sterilization of women needs somewhat more time, it may be computed that the entire female population of Germany could be sterilized within a period of three years or less. Complete sterilization of both sexes, and not only one, is to be considered necessary in view of the present German doctrine that so much as one drop of true German blood constitutes a German. Of course, after complete sterilization, there will cease to be a birth rate in Germany. At the normal death rate of 2 per cent per annum, German life will diminish at the rate of 1,500,000 yearly. Accordingly in the span of two generations that which cost millions of lives and centuries of useless effort, namely, the elimination of Germanism and its carriers, will have been an accomplished fact. By virtue of its loss of self-perpetuation German Will will have atrophied and German power reduced to negligible importance." ...|$|E

None of them had any knowledge of a warning having been sent in time to make evacuation of the hotel possible. They said that, like themselves, Shaw had not known about the bomb beforehand and that he bore no responsibility for putting colleagues' lives at risk immediately before the explosion. The only criticism made was that Shaw should have closed the Régence restaurant and put guards on the service entrance weeks before. Shaw agreed that not having done this was a mistake. The decision not to do it had been made because [...] "everyone was under orders to preserve the semblance of normality in Palestine", [...] "social life had to be allowed to continue" [...] and because nobody had believed that the Irgun would <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the Secretariat, which had many Jewish employees, in danger.|$|E
