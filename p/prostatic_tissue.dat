Previous studies have localized PCI {{in the male}} genital tract.

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and Western blotting were used to study <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues,</b> metastases, and PC- 3, DU- 145, and LNCaP cells. RESULTS: PCI was immunolocalized in tissue microarray spots with BPH epithelium (detection rate 100 %), PIN lesions (100 %), tumors (96 %), metastases (88 %), and in all cell lines. ISH and WB supported the findings. CONCLUSIONS: PCI is widely expressed in benign prostatic epithelium, and may act as a local regulator of enzymatic activity in seminal fluid, of importance for normal sperm function. Lack of PCI expression in a subpopulation of high-grade tumor cells in combination with maintained protease expression may facilitate invasive growth patterns...|$|R

40|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} common non-cutaneous cancer in men in the United States. Early {{detection}} of PCa is essential for improving treatment outcomes and survival rates. However, diagnosis of PCa at an early stage is challenged by the lack of an imaging method that can accurately visualize PCas. Because pathological processes change the mechanical properties of the tissue, elasticity imaging methods have the potential to differentiate PCas from other <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues.</b> Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is a relatively new elasticity imaging method that visualizes the local stiffness variations inside soft tissue. The work presented in this dissertation investigates the feasibility of prostate ARFI imaging. Volumetric ARFI data acquisition and display methods were developed to visualize anatomic structures and pathologies in ex vivo human prostates. The characteristic appearances of various <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues</b> in ARFI images were identified by correlating ARFI images with McNeal's zonal anatomy and the correlated histological slides, in which prostatic pathologies were delineated by a pathologist blinded to the ARFI images. The results suggest ARFI imaging is able to differentiate anatomic structures and identify suspicious PCa regions in the prostate. To investigate the correlation between ARFI displacement amplitudes and the underlying tissue stiffness in the prostate ARFI images, the mechanical properties of <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues</b> were characterized using a quantitative method, based upon shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI). Co-registered ARFI and SWEI datasets were acquired in excised prostate specimens to reconstruct the shear moduli of <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues.</b> The results demonstrated that variations in ARFI displacement amplitudes were inversely related to the underlying tissue stiffness; and the reconstructed shear moduli of <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues</b> had good agreements with those reported in literature. The study suggests the matched ARFI and SWEI datasets provide complementary information about tissue's elasticity. To increase the efficiency of the data acquisition, a novel imaging sequence was developed to acquired matched ARFI-SWEI datasets without increasing the number of excitations compared to a conventional ARFI imaging sequence. Imaging parameters were analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. An analytical model was derived to quantify the fundamental accuracy limit in the reconstructed shear modulus, and demonstrated good agreement with the experimental data. The novel sequence was demonstrated in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Finally, ARFI imaging sequences were developed in a transrectal probe, and ARFI images were presented from in vivo data acquired in patients under radical prostatectomy. The in vivo ARFI images demonstrated decreased contrast and resolution as compared to the matched ex vivo ARFI data. However, prostate anatomy and some PCa were successfully visualized in the in vivo ARFI images. Thus, we conclude that ARFI imaging has the potential to provide image guidance for locating cancerous regions during PCa diagnosis and treatment. Dissertatio...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the expression of RBM 5 in human prostate cancer and its mechanism of tumor suppression. Methods The expression of RBM 5 protein in cancerous <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues</b> and normal tissues was examined by IHC. PC- 3 cell line was used to determine the apoptotic function of RBM 5 in vitro. PC- 3 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA 3. 1 -RBM 5. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Rhodamine 123 staining and Annexin V analysis were performed to observe the apoptotic activity of PC- 3 cells overexpressing RBM 5. Expression of apoptosis-related genes was assessed by western blot. Results The expression of RBM 5 protein was significantly decreased in cancerous <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues</b> compared to the normal tissues. PC- 3 cells overexpressing RBM 5 showed not only significant growth inhibition compared with the vector controls, but also dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptotic activity. To further define RBM 5 function in apoptotic pathways, we investigated differential expression profiles of various BH 3 -only proteins including Bid, Bad, and Bim, and apoptosis regulatory proteins include P 53, cleaved caspase 9, and cleaved caspase 3. We found that the expression of both BH 3 -only proteins and apoptosis regulatory proteins was increased in RBM 5 transfected cells. Conclusion The expression of RBM 5 protein was significantly decreased in cancerous <b>prostatic</b> <b>tissues,</b> which suggests that RBM 5 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. RBM 5 may induce the apoptosis of prostate cancer PC- 3 cells by modulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and thus RBM 5 might be a promising target for gene therapy on prostate cancer. </p...|$|R

Immunohistochemical studies have reported the usefulness of anti-CD 24 for detecting prostate cancer over {{the full range of}} prostate specimens encountered in surgical pathology, e. g. needle biopsies, transurethral resection of prostate chips, or prostatectomies. It is a small mucin-like cell surface protein and thus promises to become at least a standard adjunctive stain for atypical prostate biopsies.
