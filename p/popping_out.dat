5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
25|$|His straitjacket escape was {{originally}} performed behind curtains, with him <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> free at the end. Houdini's brother, (who {{was also an}} escape artist, billing himself as Theodore Hardeen), discovered that audiences were more impressed when the curtains were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out. On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down {{from the roof of}} a building in the same city.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{elements}} of boogie, gospel and blues, the song introduced several of rock music's most characteristic musical features, including its loud volume and vocal style emphasizing power, and its distinctive beat and rhythm. The beat {{has its roots}} in boogie-woogie, but Richard departed from its shuffle rhythm and introduced a new distinctive rock beat. He reinforced the new rock rhythm with a two-handed approach, playing patterns with his right hand, with the rhythm typically <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> in the piano's high register. The song's new rhythm became the basis for the standard rock beat, which was later consolidated by Chuck Berry.|$|E

40|$|A single, unique target often <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> {{quickly and}} {{efficiently}} from a field of homogenous distractors in visual search. <b>Pop</b> <b>out</b> has helped shape theories of visual attention and feature integration {{as well as to}} identify basic features in human vision. The present experiments demonstrate a new phenomenon, false <b>pop</b> <b>out,</b> wherein one of the homogenous distractors competes with the singleton target to <b>pop</b> <b>out,</b> perhaps by breaking an overall grouping or pattern emerging from the display. Using a compilation of several studies, this research reports the effect in a number of display contexts using a number of different stimuli, and provides converging evidence toward the idea that low and high level features contribute equally to the primary perceptual experience, a counterintuitive finding for most current theories of visual search...|$|R

25|$|The Red Sox took a 2–0 lead on a Yastrzemski {{homer and}} a run scoring single by Rice. Although Bucky Dent's three-run {{home run in}} the 7th inning off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster — which gave the Yankees their first lead — is the most remembered moment from the game, it was Reggie Jackson's solo {{home run in the}} 8th that proved the {{difference}} in the Yankees' 5–4 win, which ended with Yastrzemski <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> to Graig Nettles with Rick Burleson representing the tying run at third. Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.|$|E
500|$|... "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] posed a {{challenge}} to the show's animation directors. The episode contains many long set pieces, especially during the third and final act, which includes the end of the Maggie subplot and the performance of the musical. Several scenes required the animators to draw dozens of background characters. Rich Moore, the head director, initially feared the episode would not be completed in time. David Silverman, the supervising director, also had doubts; according to Martin, Moore sent back a cartoon of himself reading the script with his eyes <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> and his jaw dropped. Producer Al Jean said that Moore [...] "worked himself to death" [...] to produce the episode's most elaborate sequences.|$|E
500|$|In November, Perry also {{performed}} [...] "Peacock" [...] at New York's Roseland Ballroom, where she introduced herself by <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> {{of a giant}} cake, dressed in a purple skin-tight cupcake print dress. Additionally, Perry included [...] "Peacock" [...] in her setlist for her worldwide concert tour, California Dreams Tour (February 2011 – January 2012). When singing the song, the performance would include an elaborated feathered fan dance number. She wore a turquoise/green one-piece swimsuit with a peacock tail attached accompanied by female dancers dressed in a similar way, two male dancers and mimes. Concert reviewer Jim Abbott for the Orlando Sentinel felt that detailed performances {{such as the ones}} done for [...] "Peacock" [...] were a highlight for the singer's tour.|$|E

500|$|Several of the {{allusions to}} Smithers' {{sexuality}} {{have turned into}} battles with the censors. For example, in Smithers' fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> of a birthday cake in [...] "Rosebud", the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is [...] "Marge Gets a Job", which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally {{it went on for}} a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed [...] "Mr. Burns land in a particular position on Smithers' anatomy". There were also issues with [...] "the lump in his bed", which the animators said had drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) drives {{all the way}} to Florida, {{without telling}} anyone, to try and woo back Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), where she has been living with the elderly Irene (Georgia Engel) and her middle-aged Grandson, Glenn (Brad Morris), as a live-in maid. He surprises Erin by <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> of a {{delivery}} box and singing [...] "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours", but she is not particularly excited to see him, and states she does not {{want to go back to}} Scranton with him. The situation is further complicated when Andy reveals to Erin that he has not yet broken up with his current girlfriend, Jessica. Andy tells Erin he loves her, but she rejects him; Andy subsequently leaves, his feelings crushed. Irene, who had been treating Andy with disdain over the way Erin spoke of him, sees that he is a nice person and encourages Erin to go back with him. She runs up to him as he is leaving in his car and they share a kiss before heading back to Scranton.|$|E

[...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go.

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the nature of}} face perception, several studies used the visual search paradigm, whereby subjects detect an odd target among distractors. When detection reaction time is set-size independent, the odd element is said to “pop out”, reflecting a basic mechanism or map for the relevant feature. A number of previous studies suggested that schematic faces do not <b>pop</b> <b>out.</b> We show that natural face stimuli do <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> among assorted non-face objects. Animal faces, on the other hand, do not <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> from among the same assorted non-face objects. In addition, search for a face among distractors of another object category is easier than the reverse search, and face search is mediated by holistic face characteristics, rather than by face parts. Our {{results indicate that the}} association of <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> with elementary features and lower cortical areas may be incorrect. Instead, face search, and indeed all feature search, may reflect high-level activity with generalization over spatial and other property details...|$|R

500|$|Brad Lidge {{came into}} the game for the ninth inning, <b>popping</b> <b>out</b> Matsui and {{striking}} out Jeter before surrendering a two-out single to Damon—after a nine-pitch at bat with two strikes and four foul balls. Then, with Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and, on the same play, also stole third as the base was uncovered due to a defensive shift against Teixeira. Several news outlets referred to this as a [...] "mad dash", which Mike Vaccaro of the New York Post compared to Enos Slaughter's [...] "Mad Dash" [...] in the 1946 World Series. Some believed that Damon's play caused Lidge to avoid throwing his best pitch—a slider with sharp downward movement—for {{the rest of the}} inning, as it risked a wild pitch that would have allowed Damon to score from third base. Teixeira was then hit by a pitch and Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double, scoring Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single that scored Teixeira and Rodriguez, but was thrown out at second to end the inning. Mariano Rivera entered {{in the bottom of the}} ninth and saved the game for the Yankees on eight pitches for his second save of the series.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood <b>popping</b> <b>out.</b> I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E
