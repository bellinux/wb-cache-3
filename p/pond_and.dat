5|$|Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania {{stated that}} Long <b>Pond</b> <b>and</b> Round Pond, two ponds in the watershed, {{had a large}} fish population. The creek was stocked with 700 fingerling, yearling, and adult brook trout in 1909.|$|E
50|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{for development}} has reduced available habitats through {{loss of a}} number of <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> formerly occupied sites (Loftus et al. 2002) <b>and</b> <b>ponded</b> <b>and</b> lagoonal habitats.|$|R
50|$|Leptodactylus podicipinus live in grasslands {{and open}} habitats, often near <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> flooded areas. They {{are common in}} {{suitable}} habitats. Eggs are laid in foam nests {{at the edges of}} permanent or temporary <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> flooded areas.|$|R
50|$|Fish {{have been}} {{recognized}} {{as a source of}} beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in cave art, being raised as ornamental fish in <b>ponds,</b> <b>and</b> displayed in aquariums in homes, offices, or public settings. Some smaller and more colourful species, and sometimes painted fish, serve as ornamental fish in <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> aquariums, and as pets.|$|R
5|$|The {{library is}} {{designed}} {{with an eye}} toward late 19th century and early 20th century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly characteristic of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of <b>Pond</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pond</b> <b>and</b> is constructed of buff colored brick. Red brick belt coursing and accents contrast the buff colored brick on the majority of the facade. The two-story Oregon Public Library has a full brick basement and approximately 5,500 foot² (511 m²) of floor space.|$|E
5|$|After Exit 2, Route 25 {{bends to}} the northeast, {{bypassing}} Buttermilk Bay and the densely populated village of Buzzards Bay {{to the south}}. The route passes Union <b>Pond</b> <b>and</b> Dicks Pond {{to the south and}} Spectacle <b>Pond</b> <b>and</b> Sandy Pond to the north before entering the town of Plymouth. In Plymouth, Route 25 passes to the north of several cranberry bogs and small ponds. While the freeway has no interchanges in Plymouth, a rest area is located off eastbound Route 25 in the town; the area is inaccessible from westbound Route 25. Due to state funding cutbacks, services at the rest area are limited to summer weekends (Friday to Sunday) as of 2010. After the rest area, Route 25 passes over Bourne Road and turns sharply to head in a southwestern direction. The route passes under Bournedale Road after entering the town of Bourne. In Bourne, Route 25 has its final interchange; Exit 3 (formerly Exit 2) serves the villages of Buzzards Bay and Sagamore, connecting to US 6 (Scenic Highway) and Route 28 north. From Exit 3, US 6 is used to access the Sagamore Bridge in northern Bourne and the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown on Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a <b>pond,</b> <b>and</b> both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Bowring Park, {{located in}} the Waterford Valley, {{is one of the}} most scenic parks in St. John's. Entrance to the park is via Waterford Bridge Road, passing a {{sculptured}} duck <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> a statue of Peter Pan. The park land was donated to the city in 1911 by Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring on behalf of Bowring Brothers Ltd. on their 100th anniversary of commerce in Newfoundland. The park was officially opened by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught on 15 July 1914.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a <b>pond,</b> <b>and</b> principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Friends {{successfully}} {{campaigned for}} {{the withdrawal of}} plans for open air screenings of films in the park. In 2012, the Friends contributed towards {{the cost of a}} new Jubilee <b>Pond,</b> <b>and</b> launched a public appeal for a Ponds and Streams Conservation Programme in which the Friends, the Richmond Park Wildlife Group and Healthy Planet have been working with staff from The Royal Parks to restore some of the streams and ponds in the park.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> {{wetlands}} {{surrounding the}} main body of the Salton Sea have deteriorated or evaporated over time, contributing to the decline of wildlife and native species. This project, proposed in the 2012/2013 fiscal year, will attempt to restore some of these evaporated <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> wetlands, located in the northern areas of the Sea, using GeoTube technology to implement new berms along the edges of these <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> wetlands. The project area consists of eleven existing ponds, nine of which are located in the Torres Martinez wetlands, and 20 acres of proposed new habitat.|$|R
5|$|In May, 1906, in Kokomo, {{a meeting}} {{was called to}} try to revive the defunct Indiana suffragist movement. An Indiana Auxiliary of the National American Woman Suffrage Association was formed and {{officers}} were elected. The officers included: Sarah Davis, President; Laura Schofield, first vice-president; Anna Dunn Noland, second vice-president; Mrs. E. M.

5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy <b>Pond</b> <b>and</b> her husband Rory find themselves trapped in {{what appears to be}} a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without any idea how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear of someone who has been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their fear.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, Isdud was {{described}} as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill, covered with gardens. A ruined khan stood southwest of the village. Its houses were one-storey high with walls and enclosures built of adobe brick. There were two main sources of water: a <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> a masonry well. Both were surrounded by groves of date-palm and fig-trees.|$|E

The route came to an end shortly afterward at a junction with US9 in the hamlet of Pottersville.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for the new}} Prospect Park Zoo, {{prepared}} by Aymar Embury II, were announced in March 1934. The area between the Wild Fowl <b>Pond</b> <b>and</b> former Deer Paddock {{on the east side}} of the park, situated across the East Drive from the Menagerie, was chosen as the site for the new zoo. Architect Embury designed a half circle of six brick buildings centered on a seal pool. Built of red brick with limestone trim, the buildings featured bas-relief scenes from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Woods {{provides}} habitats for a {{wide range}} of species. It also has a number of natural springs that feed a duck <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> a kingfisher pond. Recent housing developments between the reserve and the railway line have added complementary public open space with picnic areas and a children's play area. Since 1986 all maintenance and development of the reserve has been carried out by a volunteer group known as The Friends of Radyr Woods.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the modern}} (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces are roughly 1.5% {{heavier than the}} late Paris ounce, the exact {{historical}} relations between the original marc de Troyes, the French poids de marc, the Flemish trooisch <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy ounces was exactly 64:63 in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Sir Henry Crichton {{bought the}} castle in 1881, {{along with the}} {{surrounding}} gardens, orchards, <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> a boat house. The architect John Sedding remodelled the castle between approximately 1885 and 1890, creating a Gothic styled house, adding another storey and a new wing. After Crichton's death in 1922 his wife remained in the house until her death in 1936, when the property and the surrounding grounds were sold at auction.|$|E
5|$|The Mao {{family lived}} in a clay-brick {{farmhouse}} which had been constructed in 1878, although Yichang oversaw its extension during Zedong's boyhood. They occupied the eastern wing of their house, with the neighboring Zou family living in the western half. The building was large enough for Zedong to be allocated his own bedroom; a rarity at the time. In {{front of the house}} was a <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> a rice paddy, while pine and bamboo groves grew behind the building.|$|E
