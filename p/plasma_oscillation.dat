These waves were first observed on 11 February 2004, at a heliocentric radial distance of 91. 0 astronomical units, and continued sporadically with a gradually increasing occurrence rate for nearly a year. The last event occurred on 15 December 2004, at 94. 1 astronomical units, just before the spacecraft crossed the termination shock. Since then, no further electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been observed, consistent with the spacecraft having crossed the termination shock into the heliosheath.

The type III emissions are compared with similar radiation coming from upstream of earth's bow shock at the harmonic of the local electron plasma frequency, and quantitative calculations of the rate of conversion from plasma oscillatory energy to electromagnetic radiation are performed. The results show that electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> are seldom observed in association with solar electron events and type III radio bursts at 1. 0 AU and that neither the type III emissions nor the radiation from upstream of the bow shock can be adequately explained by a current model for the coupling of electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> to electromagnetic radiation.

50|$|Plasmons can be {{described}} in the classical picture as an oscillation of free electron density with respect to the fixed positive ions in a metal.

If the electric field is removed, the electrons move to the right, repelled by each other and attracted to the positive ions left bare on the right side. They oscillate back and forth at the plasma frequency until the energy is lost in some kind of resistance or damping. Plasmons are a quantization of this kind of oscillation.|$|E
