5|$|During the <b>Paleocene</b> and Eocene, most mammals {{remained}} small (under 20 kg). Cooling {{climate in}} the Oligocene and Miocene, {{and the expansion}} of grasslands favored the evolution of larger mammalian species.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic studies {{initially}} {{suggested that}} most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 {{million years ago}} and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene. However, no placental fossils have been found from {{before the end of}} the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals comes from the early <b>Paleocene,</b> after the extinction of the dinosaurs. In particular, scientists have identified an early <b>Paleocene</b> animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals. however it has been reclassified as a non-placental eutherian. Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a Late Cretaceous origin for placentals, and a <b>Paleocene</b> origin for most modern clades.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} benthic foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, presumably because {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the ocean {{is thought to have}} decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton recovery in the early <b>Paleocene</b> provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early <b>Paleocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early <b>Paleocene.</b> Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper <b>Paleocene.</b> This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the <b>Paleocene.</b> Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg boundary, however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent <b>Paleocene</b> recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} cephalopod, echinoderm, and bivalve genera {{exhibited}} significant diminution after the K–Pg boundary. Most species of brachiopods, a small phylum of marine invertebrates, survived the K–Pg extinction event and diversified {{during the early}} <b>Paleocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of Carcharocles, proposed in 2001 by paleontologist Michael Benton, is that the three other species are actually a single species of shark that gradually changed over time between the <b>Paleocene</b> and the Pliocene, making it a chronospecies. Some authors suggest that C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, and C. chubutensis should be classified as a single species in the genus Otodus, leaving C. megalodon the sole member of Carcharocles.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{damage to}} the fossilized leaves of {{flowering}} plants from fourteen sites in North America were used {{as a proxy for}} insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early <b>Paleocene,</b> however, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7million years after the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Molecular clock {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the <b>Paleocene,</b> approximately 62mya. Between 47 and 54mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified {{and filled the}} niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, {{they have had to}} compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.|$|E
5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} <b>Paleocene</b> of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early Eocene) in age. That age has been revised, {{and now it is}} known that O. daouiensis comes from the same bone bed that is dated to the Selandian age of the <b>Paleocene</b> (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian bone bed of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest it is in the same evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the Eocene consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E
5|$|Ostracods, a {{class of}} small {{crustaceans}} that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits {{in a variety of}} locations. A review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in the <b>Paleocene</b> than any other time in the Cenozoic. Current research cannot ascertain, however, whether the extinctions occurred prior to, or during, the boundary interval.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral origins {{for this}} species stem from eastern North America, where species {{richness}} of ambystomatids are highest. The following biogeographic interpretation on {{the origins of}} A.macrodactylum into western North America is based on a descriptive account of fossils, genetics, and biogeography. The long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. Ambystomatidae was isolated to the southeast of the mid-Continental or Western Interior Seaway during the Cretaceous (~145.5–66 Ma). While three other species of the Ambystomatidae (A.tigrinum, A.californiense, and A.gracile) have overlapping ranges in western North America, the long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. It has been suggested that A.macrodactylum speciated from A.laterale after the <b>Paleocene</b> (~66–55.8 Ma) with the loss of the Western Interior Seaway opening an access route for a common ancestor into the Western Cordillera. Once situated in the montane regions of western North America, species had to contend with a dynamic spatial and compositional ecology responding to the changes in altitude, as mountains grew and the climate changed. For example, the Pacific Northwest became cooler in the <b>Paleocene,</b> paving the way for temperate forest to replace the warmer tropical forest of the Cretaceous. A scenario for the splitting of A.macrodacylum and other western temperate species from their eastern counterparts involves Rocky Mountain uplift in the late Oligocene into the Miocene. The orogeny created a climatic barrier by removing moisture from the westerly air stream and dried the midcontinental area, from southern Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} for extinction of amphibians at the K–Pg boundary. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K–Pg boundary in Montana concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct. Yet {{there are several}} species of Maastrichtian amphibian, not included {{as part of this}} study, which are unknown from the <b>Paleocene.</b> These include the frog Theatonius lancensis and the albanerpetontid Albanerpeton galaktion; therefore, some amphibians do seem to have become extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals.|$|E
5|$|Within the Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren there {{developed}} {{two main}} evolutionary subclades (see Cladogram II and Table 3). The first of these, characterised as the Lilieae s.s. (Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis), Cardiocrinum), Notholirion) diverged around 12mya. The second subclade was the Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa), (Gagea). Divergence within Calochortus is dated to 7mya. This places {{the emergence of}} the Liliaceae at approximately the last (Maastrichtian period) of the Late Cretaceous periods (72 to 66mya) to early (<b>Paleocene)</b> Paleogene periods (66 to 23mya), formerly the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, 65mya.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} still much debate about the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the <b>Paleocene</b> and Eocene epochs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the <b>Paleocene</b> and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Dentition is the {{key feature}} by which fossil rodents are {{recognized}} and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the <b>Paleocene,</b> shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic. Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are {{in agreement with the}} fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the <b>Paleocene</b> (66 to 55mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Paleogene period between 63 and 52 Ma, the last {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} British Isles were formed. As North America and Greenland separated from Europe, the Atlantic Ocean slowly formed. This led to a chain of volcanic sites west of mainland Scotland including on Skye, the Small Isles and St. Kilda, in the Firth of Clyde on Arran and Ailsa Craig and at Ardnamurchan. Sea levels began to fall, {{and for the first}} time the general outline of the modern British Isles was revealed. At the beginning of this period the climate was sub-tropical and erosion was caused by chemical weathering, creating characteristic features of the Scottish landscape such as the topographical basin of the Howe of Alford near Aberdeen. The vegetation of the period is known from <b>Paleocene</b> sedimentary deposits on Isle of Mull. The rich flora here included temperate-climate tree species such as plane, hazel, oak, Cercidiphyllum, Metasequoia and ginkgo.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{wrote that}} UA 8699 {{was the first}} {{marsupial}} to be identified from Madagascar and the first from the Mesozoic of any part of Gondwana. Marsupials {{date back to the}} Eocene in Australia and Africa and to the <b>Paleocene</b> in South America; although Cretaceous marsupials have been recorded there, none of the records are unambiguous. Marsupials were certainly present in the Northern Hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. He interpreted UA 8699 as evidence that marsupials must already have colonized the southern continents by the late Cretaceous, presumably having reached Madagascar through South America and Antarctica. By the late Cretaceous, boreosphenidans must already have been in the process of replacing archaic mammals like gondwanatheres on the southern continents, as suggested by the presence of Deccanolestes, a placental, in the Cretaceous of India.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriforms are {{currently}} {{thought to have}} evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the <b>Paleocene</b> (66 to 55mya). Stem lemuriforms, including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri, {{have been found in}} Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, Plesiopithecus, a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, Djebelemur, ‘Anchomomys’ milleri, and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the <b>Paleocene</b> and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E
5|$|Over 185 extinct {{members and}} three major {{evolutionary}} radiations {{of the order}} Proboscidea have been recorded. The earliest proboscids, the African Eritherium and Phosphatherium of the late <b>Paleocene,</b> heralded the first radiation. The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene. One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, {{which may have been}} an ancestor to several later species. The beginning of the Miocene saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids. The former were related to Barytherium and lived in Africa and Eurasia, while the latter may have descended from Eritreum and spread to North America.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{families}} of crocodilians or their close relatives {{are represented in}} the Maastrichtian fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K–Pg boundary. Five families have both Maastrichtian and <b>Paleocene</b> fossil representatives. All of the surviving {{families of}} crocodyliforms inhabited freshwater and terrestrial environments—except for the Dyrosauridae, which lived in freshwater and marine locations. Approximately 50% of crocodyliform representatives survived across the K–Pg boundary, the only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived. Crocodyliform survivability across the boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow, which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary. Jouve and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine crocodyliforms lived in freshwater environments as do modern marine crocodile juveniles, which would have helped them survive where other marine reptiles became extinct; freshwater environments were not so strongly affected by the K–Pg extinction event as marine environments were.|$|E
5|$|The Bryce Canyon area shows {{a record}} of {{deposition}} that spans from {{the last part of}} the Cretaceous period and the first half of the Cenozoic era. The ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now the park varied. The Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating Cretaceous Seaway (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders). The colorful Claron Formation, from which the park's delicate hoodoos are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40million years ago (from the <b>Paleocene</b> to the Eocene epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and river deltas migrated.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy suggested the Liliales formed {{some of the earliest}} monocots. Molecular analysis indicates that divergence amongst the Liliales probably occurred around 82 million years ago. The closest sister family to the Liliaceae are the Smilacaceae with the Liliaceae separating 52 million years ago. Liliaceae thus arose during the late (Maastrichtian) Cretaceous to early (<b>Paleocene)</b> Paleogene periods. Major evolutionary clades include the Lilieae (Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis, Cardiocrinum, Notholirion) from the Himalayas about 12mya and the Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa, Gagea) from East Asia at about the same time. The Medeoleae (Clintonia and Medeola) may have appeared in North America but were subsequently dispersed, as may have the Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae. Liliaceae fossils have been dated to the Paleogene and Cretaceous eras in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} {{primates}} (euprimates) {{do not appear}} in the fossil record until the early Eocene (~55mya), at which point they radiated across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. These first primates included Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius, and Teilhardina on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil Altiatlasius from <b>Paleocene</b> Africa. These earliest fossil primates are often divided into two groups, adapiforms (sometimes called adapids, or adapoids) and omomyiforms (or omomyids—suspected relatives of tarsiers). Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the Eocene. Although few fossils of extant primate groups—lemuriforms, tarsiers, or simians—are known from the Early to Middle Eocene, evidence from genetics and newer fossil finds suggest they may have been present during this early adaptive radiation. The divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities {{to suggest that they}} diverged during the <b>Paleocene</b> (66–55mya).|$|E
5|$|Then as now, Madagascar was an island, having {{separated}} from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude than it is today. The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Majungasaurus inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels {{at the beginning of}} the wet season, burying the carcasses of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils. Sea levels in the area were rising throughout the Maastrichtian, and would continue to do so into the <b>Paleocene</b> Epoch, so Majungasaurus may have roamed coastal environments like tidal flats as well. The neighboring Berivotra Formation represents the contemporaneous marine environment.|$|E
5|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both {{in studies of}} fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the <b>Paleocene</b> recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern spike in the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{caused by}} a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70mya to the early <b>Paleocene.</b> This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them {{gradually}} subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land {{in the area to}} form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed {{as a result of the}} Laramide.|$|E
5|$|Gondwanatheres are a {{small group}} of mammals of {{uncertain}} phylogenetic affinities known from the late Cretaceous to the Eocene (~56–34 mya) of the Gondwanan continents, known only from teeth and a few lower jaws. Upon their discovery in the 1980s, gondwanatheres were initially thought to be xenarthrans—part of the same group as living sloths, armadillos, and anteaters—but later workers have favored affinities with multituberculates (a diverse group of fossil mammals) or left the relationships of the gondwanatheres open. The group comprises two families. The family Ferugliotheriidae, whose members had low-crowned teeth, occurs in the Campanian (~84–71 mya) to Maastrichtian of Argentina. All other gondwanatheres, including Lavanify, are placed in the Sudamericidae, which have high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth. These include Gondwanatherium from the Campanian and Maastrichtian of Argentina; Sudamerica from the <b>Paleocene</b> (~66–56 mya) of Argentina; Lavanify; at least one species from the Maastrichtian of India; an unnamed species related to Sudamerica from the Eocene of Antarctica; and an unnamed possible gondwanathere, TNM 02067, from the Cretaceous of Tanzania. In 2007, teams led by G.P. Wilson and G.V.R. Prasad independently described this animal as Dakshina and Bharattherium respectively; as the latter name was published first, it is the correct name for this genus according to the Principle of Priority. Gondwanatheres have been interpreted as feeding on roots, bark, and abrasive vegetation or as the earliest grass-eating mammals.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar. All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene (56 to 34mya) or <b>Paleocene</b> (66 to 56mya). Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess. A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochromeb gene {{and the presence of}} the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups. Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65mya according to molecular studies, although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55mya for this divergence. However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The K-T {{boundary}} {{is associated}} with abnormally high amounts of iridium, an element which is rare in Earth's crust, but relatively common in asteroids and in Earth's core. This {{has been used as}} evidence that a meteorite impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (the Alvarez hypothesis). However, some paleontologists attribute the extinction event and the iridium anomaly to more gradual climatic change caused by the volcanic activity of the Deccan Traps. The Nanxiong Basin has special relevance to this discussion because it contains the K-T boundary. However, the position of boundary, as well as the duration of the extinction have been subject to debate. Zhao et al. (2002 and 2009) have postulated that there were at least two iridium-delivering events over a time period consistent with the Deccan Traps volcanism, correlated with a gradual decline in diversity and eventual disappearance of fossil eggs from the Nanxiong Basin. According to their interpretation, Macroolithus survived 250,000 years into the early <b>Paleocene.</b> However, Buck et al. (2004) disputed these claims, arguing that debris flows mixed and reworked the sediments near the boundary, causing a blurring of the iridium anomaly and the appearance of eggshell fragments on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral {{species of}} the genus Cucurbita {{were present in the}} Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the New World. The likely center of origin is {{southern}} Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating back only to the Holocene, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, in the shape of seeds similar to Bryonia, dates to the <b>Paleocene.</b> No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. C.moschata can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become polyploid. The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene nad1 show there were at least six independent domestication events of Cucurbita separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include C.digitata (calabazilla), and C.foetidissima (buffalo gourd), C.palmata (coyote melon), and C.pepo. Some species, such as C.digitata and C.ficifolia, are referred to as gourds. Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa. Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe.|$|E
