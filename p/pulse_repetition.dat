5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> frequency (Fig.16). The <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|A similar effect {{imposes a}} maximum range as well. In order to {{maximize}} range, longer times between pulses should be used, {{referred to as}} a <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> time, or its reciprocal, <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> frequency.|$|E
25|$|Since it is {{designed}} to turn on and off rapidly, amplifiers that use it often synthesize complex waveforms with pulse-width modulation and low-pass filters. In switching applications modern devices feature <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> rates well into the ultrasonic range—frequencies which are at least ten times the highest audio frequency handled by the device when used as an analog audio amplifier.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Two {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} using experiments that let participants try to detect target sounds in pink noise. If they reported to have detected a target signal then next time the energy of the target signal of that condition is decreased by 1 dB. If they reported not to have detected a target signal then next time the energy of the target signal of that condition is increased by 1 dB. This results in data points around 50 % probability of detecting a minimum of 1 target sound in the noise. One study examines the detection thresholds of <b>pulse</b> <b>repetitions</b> with irregular and regular intervals and the other the detection thresholds of target sounds between the pulse-domain and tone-domain. We expected that detection of thresholds in the first study is a statistical process in which the threshold detection value {{is a function of the}} number of repetitions and the standard deviation of noise in a Gaussian distribution. Hereby we aim to find the mean and especially the standard deviation. The difference of the mean and standard deviation between irregular and regular pulse intervals is small. The average mean therefore is - 3. 908 and the average standard deviation is 1. 934. Also what has been found is a significant difference of 6 regular <b>pulse</b> <b>repetitions</b> being 0. 78 dB lower than 6 irregular <b>pulse</b> <b>repetitions.</b> The second study gives us an indication of a transition point between the pulse-domain and the tone-domain. There has been found an indication of a transition point at a target sound with duration of 0. 03 seconds. ...|$|R

In this scenario, since the number of range-angle-Doppler bins, in which actual targets are detected, is {{much smaller than the}} total number of radar bins, most of reflection coefficients are zero, and thus, the radar signal model can be assumed sparse. We assume that complex reflection coefficients during <b>pulse</b> <b>repetitions</b> are constant.|$|R

25|$|While {{this work}} progressed, the teams {{continued}} {{development of the}} basic system. Burcham and Atkinson continued their development of the transmitter section, attempting to generate very short pulses of power to feed the magnetron. They finally settled on a solution using two tubes, a thyratron and a pentode, which produced 1µs pulses at 15kW. GEC preferred a design using a single thyratron, but this was eventually abandoned in favour of the AMRE design. Further work pushed this system to 50kW, producing 10kW of microwaves at a <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> frequency of 2500 cycles per second.|$|E

The Rajendra is a high power Passive electronically scanned array radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80km with 18km height coverage against small fighter sized targets {{and is able to}} track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high speed signal processing system with adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs and variable <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> frequency.

500|$|The male call can {{be heard}} {{at any time of}} day and {{consists}} of an unusual hissing-type sound, starting as a series of one-second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7–10s. Described as [...] "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the tymbal inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143Hz (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress– when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> frequency of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7.5–10.5kHz, that has a dominant frequency (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6kHz.|$|E
500|$|Singing can cease and restart suddenly, either rarely or frequently, {{and often}} ends abruptly. The song has been {{described}} as [...] "Tar-ran-tar-rar-tar-ran-tar-rar", [...] and consists of a series of pulses emitted at a rate of 240–250 a second. The tymbal covers are much larger than other species and also make the call louder and send it in a particular direction. There are two distinct phases of song, which the double drummer switches between at irregular intervals. One phase is a continuous call that can last for several minutes; during this period the frequency varies between 5.5–6.2kHz and 6.0–7.5kHz 4–6 times a second. In the other phase, the song is interrupted by breaks of increasing frequency resulting in a staccato sound. These breaks can be mistaken for silence as the difference in volume is so great, though the song actually continues at a much lower volume. During this staccato phase, which lasts for several seconds, the frequency remains around 5.75–6.5kHz. The frequency of the song is a high harmonic of the <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> frequency, which makes for a particularly ringing sound. Double drummers congregate in groups to amplify their calls, which likely drives off potential bird predators.|$|E

Both off-resonant and on-resonant RF pulses {{can be used to}} generate magnetization transfer based contrast.

40|$|Electrochemotherapy is a {{technique}} where electric pulses in combination with chemotherapeutic agents are applied to tumor cells. In general, patients find electrochemotherapy tolerable, in spite of unpleasant sensations associated with contraction of muscles located beneath or {{in the vicinity of}} the electrodes. These contractions are due to the intensity of the electric pulses required for effective electropermeabilization of tumor cell membranes. Since a train of eight electric <b>pulses</b> with <b>repetition</b> frequency of 1 Hz is usually applied to the tumors, each pulse in the train excites underlying nerves and provokes muscle contractions. Therefore, for patients involved in electrochemotherapy, the use of <b>pulses</b> with <b>repetition</b> frequency higher than the frequency of tetanic contraction would represent reduced number of muscle contractions and associated unpleasant sensations.
