5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these <b>pupae</b> emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. <b>Pupae</b> never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most <b>pupae,</b> the {{appendages}} are not {{attached to the}} body and {{are said to be}} exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as obtect <b>pupae).</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>pupae</b> of most Lepidoptera are obtect, with {{appendages}} fused or {{glued to}} the body, while the rest have exarate <b>pupae,</b> having the antennae, legs, and wings free and not {{glued to the}} body.|$|E
5|$|It eats {{primarily}} invertebrates {{and specifically}} insects, including termites. Larvae and <b>pupae,</b> especially of Coeloptera moths, are eaten {{as well as}} the adults.|$|E
50|$|Once the larva have {{received}} an adequate amount of nutrients, the larva then creates a pupal chamber {{in which the}} larva lies in a pre-pupal state with limited mobility, creating its <b>pupa</b> beneath its larval skin. On completing its <b>pupa,</b> the larva then sheds its skin and fills {{the entirety of the}} <b>pupa</b> with hemolymph. When the <b>pupa</b> is completely full and the mandibles fully harden, the soft white <b>pupa</b> gradually darkens to brown, and the <b>pupa</b> becomes harder.|$|R

50|$|In the 1920s <b>Pupa</b> {{was made}} to {{resemble}} its female Italian owner. It was often dressed to look like her. Its hair was crafted from locks of its owner's real hair. <b>Pupa’s</b> owner often claimed that the doll would speak to her. She insisted until {{the day she died}} that <b>pupa</b> was a living entity. Her family often noted that <b>Pupa</b> looked alive in the pictures they took of her. Sometimes it was even hard to distinguish <b>Pupa</b> from her owner in the pictures. When the owner died in early 2005, the family put <b>Pupa</b> in a glass case. However, <b>Pupa</b> doesn't always like being locked in the case. She periodically changes positions. There has been a few times where she has managed to get out. She moves items around in her display case when she feels restless. <b>Pupa's</b> facial expression often changes when observed for a period of time. One time <b>Pupa</b> knocks or bangs on the glass case because she is lonely.|$|R

5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect <b>pupae</b> are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate <b>pupae</b> have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate <b>pupae</b> develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|Insects used in food include {{honey bee}} larvae and <b>pupae,</b> mopani worms, silkworms, Maguey worms, Witchetty grubs, crickets, {{grasshoppers}} and locusts. In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, producing some 7,500 tons per year.|$|E

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. <b>Pupae</b> are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among <b>pupae,</b> if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pupae</b> {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of <b>pupae</b> diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{predator}}y {{ground beetle}} L. grandis is a predator {{of both the}} eggs and larvae of L. decemlineata, and its larvae are parasitoids of the <b>pupae.</b> An adult L. grandis may consume up to 23 eggs or 3.3 larvae in a single day.|$|E

5|$|The species migrates seasonally, at night, and can {{be carried}} {{downwind}} up to 400km. <b>Pupae</b> can make use of diapause to wait out adverse environmental conditions, especially at high latitudes and in drought.|$|E
5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly <b>pupae.</b> Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly <b>pupae,</b> fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Insect life-histories show {{adaptations to}} {{withstand}} cold and dry conditions. Some temperate region insects {{are capable of}} activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go {{into a state of}} torpor.

5|$|Nearly {{all adult}} caddisflies are terrestrial, but their larvae and <b>pupae</b> are aquatic. They share this {{characteristic}} with several distantly-related groups, namely the dragonflies, mayflies, stoneflies, alderflies and lacewings. The ancestors {{of all these}} groups were terrestrial, with open tracheal systems, convergently evolving different types of gills for their aquatic larvae as they took to the water to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or <b>pupae</b> resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and <b>pupae</b> are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and <b>pupae,</b> the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|P. rebeli <b>pupae</b> prey {{upon their}} broodmates, while {{producing}} sugar-rich secretions which worker ants imbibe. In one experiment, P. rebeli specimens which consumed ant larvae developed {{more quickly than}} those who did not. However, despite their nourishing offering to the community, they invariably imposed a net loss in the survival rates of workers and broodmates, demonstrating that the species is parasitic (rather than mutualistic) at all stages in its host colony.|$|E
