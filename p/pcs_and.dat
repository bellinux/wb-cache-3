40|$|The {{coagulation}} cascade {{consists of}} several factors that {{all contribute to}} the balance between bleeding and haemostasis. Protein C (<b>PC)</b> <b>and</b> protein S (PS) are two of these factors, which both {{are known for their}} anticoagulant function. Activated PC (APC) is able to cleave activated factor V (FVa) and VIII (FVIIIa), whereas PS acts as a cofactor for both anticoagulant factors <b>PC</b> <b>and</b> tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). In addition to these well-known anticoagulant functions both <b>PC</b> <b>and</b> PS have several other functions. APC is shown to be able to act anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic, via activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR 1). Via activation of Tyro 3, Axl and Mer (TAM) receptors, PS has anti-inflammatory functions and is involved in angiogenesis. As anticoagulant factors, both <b>PC</b> <b>and</b> PS are known {{to be involved in the}} coagulation-related diseases thrombosis, purpura fulminans and atherosclerosis. In addition <b>PC</b> <b>and</b> PS play also a role in inflammation-related diseases, such as sepsis, systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The beneficial role of PC in sepsis even led to the development of (A) PC based treatments. Via distinct signalling routes both <b>PC</b> <b>and</b> PS enhance the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and thereby decrease the risk on neurological diseases. Besides, by crossing the BBB, APC is shown to play a role in the two neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) and in stroke. At last, APC is found to play a role in cancer, but for PS the role in this disease is still unclear. Associations between <b>PC</b> <b>and</b> PS deficiencies and coagulation-related and inflammation-related diseases confirm the role of <b>PC</b> <b>and</b> PS in these type of diseases...|$|R
