30|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> {{increases}} to supply insufficient electric power: as speed increases, {{the performances of}} the motor drive system are insufficient to manage the corresponding power requirements, limiting the maximum braking effort to the associated iso-power curve.

5000|$|... the TTC plan {{to rebuild}} {{and extend the}} life of 30 CLRVs and 30 ALRVs. In 2016, 56 {{employees}} were working on this rebuild program. Refurbishing each ALRV takes about 55 days and costs $800,000. The cost for each CLRV is about $200,000. The total cost will be $33,1 million. Delays in delivery of the new Flexity streetcars made the refurbishment program necessary. The refurbishent of 30 ALRVs alone will cost $24 million, and there is an option to refurbish another 10. The remaining 12 ALRVs will be stripped of useful parts and scrapped. The renovations include new energy-efficient LED lights, upgraded floors and fresh seats, overhauled <b>pneumatic,</b> <b>brake</b> and traction systems. This is expected to {{extend the life of}} the cars to 2024 as more Flexities arrive and enter service. The first renovated ALRV (4217) entered service on October 15, 2015.|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} and systems used draw from both British and North American systems. Structure and rollingstock gauges are clearly {{influenced by the}} British railway practice, as are braking systems. Wagon couplings on freight trains are predominately auto couplers with friction wedge type draft gear packages showing the North American influence. Privately owned railways on iron ore mines in the Australia’s North West show even more North American influence with American style braking and larger structure and rollingstock gauges. Australia is also characterized by three track gauges a legacy of colonial and state governments before federation. The presence of narrow gauge of 1067 mm, results in a large fleet of rollingstock with design differing from standard gauge rollingstock in North America, Britain and the southern states of Australia. The chapter is arranged to firstly give an overview of longitudinal train dynamics. The second section goes into considerable detail on approaches to modelling longitudinal train dynamics. The most space {{is given to the}} modelling of the wagon connection model. Sub-sections are also devoted to modelling traction and dynamic braking systems, rolling resistance, air resistance, curving resistance, the effect ofgrades and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking.</b> The sub section on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> only provides an explanation of the effect of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> on train dynamics. Modelling <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems would require a chapter in itself. Further more brief chapter sections are included on the interaction of longitudinal train dynamics with lateral/vertical wagon dynamics, crashworthiness, comfort and train managementand driving practices...|$|R

5000|$|Enoch {{was born}} in Simris, Scania, {{in the south of}} Sweden. He studied {{aeronautics}} industry 1908-12 and succeeded his flying attempts in 1912.He wrote a thesis on aerodynamics and received a Ph.D. from Lund University in 1912.Thulin lived in the Landskrona Town. Where he amongst other things founded AB Thulinverken in 1914 to build aeroplanes; today the company is known as Haldex and manufactures <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> systems for trains and lorries (trucks). Thulin also started manufacturing automobiles, which continued until 1928. He started what later became Svenska Stridsflygskolan F5 ("The Swedish air-combat school", also known as [...] "Airforcebase 5") at Ljungbyhed in the far south of Sweden. [...] In 1918 he suggested to the Mayor of Stockholm that he should start investigating the idea of a local airport, and even though the reactions were positive, the idea was postponed until 1936 when Bromma Airport was finally built.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 September {{there was}} another {{incident}} of the same type as in 1925 when a driver overshot the buffers {{and ran into the}} station offices, killing the assistant station master. Once again the driver was not familiar with the new type of brakes that had been introduced with the new train stock - this time 1951 electro <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> electric multiple units. [...] The report notes that the 4EPB units had been gradually introduced from 1951 and that all trains on the line were at that point of this type. The train was the 3:12 pm from Waterloo which stopped at Wimbledon, Surbiton and then all stations down the branch line. It arrived at Guildford at 4:0 pm (sic, and standard terminology at the time for 4:00 pm or 16:00). (Note the scheduled arrival time would have been 4:04 pm which accords more with the statement in the report that fire engines arrived within 4 minutes and the first ambulance at 4:10, but in any case this is not relevant to the accident as excessive speed was not considered as a cause).|$|E
5000|$|Several {{wind turbine}} design and {{manufacturing}} companies experiment with alternative yaw breaking methods {{in order to}} eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems and {{to reduce the cost}} of the system. One of these alternatives involves the use of air pressure in order to achieve the necessary yaw braking moment. In this case, some of the gliding surface (usually the axial, due to higher available surface) is utilized in order to accommodate the yaw brake pads and the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> mechanism. The pneumatic actuator can be a conventional pneumatic cylinder or even a flexible air chamber which inflates when supplied with pressurized air. Such a device is able to exert very high braking forces due to the high active surface. This is achieved with a simple industrial air pressure compression system (...) which is a reliable and low cost solution. Furthermore, in the even of leakage, the environmental impact is practically zero compared to hydraulic oil leakages. Finally brake actuators can be produced with very low cost from lightweight plastic materials thus significantly reducing the overall cost of the system.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the construction of}} an ASR system that is to control the slip of driving wheels of a vehicle by making use of the construction, function and operation of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> system and the pneumatic suspension control equipment. The essence of the solution presented is the use of the piston-spring part of the spring brake chamber as an actuator in the anti-slip regulation system. In the modernised version of the prototype, the system is controlled by means of a pneumatic solenoid valve, which performs the functions of an ASR modulator. The above concept may be implemented in trucks, buses, or other vehicles provided with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems. The prototype ASR system proposed was verified by computer simulation tests. Dominika Trębac...|$|R
