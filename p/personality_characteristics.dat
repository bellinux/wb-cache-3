40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that borderline <b>personality</b> related <b>characteristics</b> can be observed in children, and that these characteristics are associated with increased risk for the development of borderline personality disorder. It is not clear whether borderline <b>personality</b> related <b>characteristics</b> in children share etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated the etiology of borderline <b>personality</b> related <b>characteristics</b> in a longitudinal cohort study of 1, 116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12 years. Borderline <b>personality</b> related <b>characteristics</b> measured at age 12 years were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment through age 10 years predicted borderline <b>personality</b> related <b>characteristics</b> at age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness, consistent with diathesis–stress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate that borderline <b>personality</b> related <b>characteristics</b> in children share etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive contributions to borderline etiology...|$|R

In the present study, {{we assumed that}} resilience had four aspects in regard with available resources: (1) understanding of own personal resources, (2) utilization of the same personal resources, (3) understanding of environmental resources, and (4) utilization of the same environmental resources. Therefore, we developed four scales measuring these aspects, with responses of 447 undergraduates. In addition, correlations of the four scales with Zung’s Self Depression Scale indicated validity of the scales. In conclusion, we argued that the four scales of resource understanding and utilization should clarify the concept of resilience and promote empirical research on the important <b>personality</b> <b>characteristic...</b>|$|R

25|$|Masculinization {{of women}} and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual {{orientation}} research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have {{a high degree of}} masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing <b>personality</b> <b>characteristics</b> for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding defined bisexuals as self-assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. This study did not explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.|$|E

25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, <b>personality</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E

Data from 4705 individuals with tinnitus indicate that tinnitus-related distress and to a lesser extent the experienced loudness of the tinnitus show an inverse correlation with resilience. A mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between resilience and tinnitus-related distress is mediated by emotional health. This indirect effect indicates that high resilience is associated with better emotional health or less depression, anxiety, and somatic symptom severity, which in turn is associated with a less distressing tinnitus. Validity of resilience as a predictor for tinnitus-related distress is supported but needs to be explored further in longitudinal studies including acute tinnitus patients...|$|R
