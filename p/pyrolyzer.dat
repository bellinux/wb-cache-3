The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, {{which in turn}} increases the mean quantity of oil yield and oil shale throughput. From the fluidized bed mixer oil shale moves downward to the packed-bed <b>pyrolyzer.</b> The heat is transferred from the heated spent oil shale to the raw oil shale causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil shale decomposes to shale oil vapors, oil shale gas and spent oil shale. Oil vapors are collected from the <b>pyrolyzer.</b> The spent oil shale, still including residual carbon (char), by the air pneumatic lift pipe to the delayed-fall combustor where it is combusted to heat the process. The delayed-fall combustor used in this process gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor. From the delayed-fall combustor the oil shale ash and spent shale falls into a fluidized bed classifier where the finest parts of solids are removed and hot spent shale is forwarded to the fluidized bed mixer.|$|E

Finally, a truck equipped with a <b>pyrolyzer</b> can move {{from place to place}} to pyrolyze biomass. Vehicle power comes from the syngas stream, while the biochar remains on the farm. The biofuel is sent to a refinery or storage site.

50|$|Biochar is a high-carbon, {{fine-grained}} residue {{that today}} is produced through modern pyrolysis processes; {{it is the}} direct thermal decomposition of biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen (preventing combustion), which produces a mixture of solids (the biochar proper), liquid (bio-oil), and gas (syngas) products. The specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process condition, such as temperature, and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar. Temperatures of 400 - 500 C produce more char, while temperatures above 700 C favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components. Pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures, typically requiring seconds instead of hours. High temperature pyrolysis is also known as gasification, and produces primarily syngas, which has been used as vehicle fuel in some times and places. Typical yields are 60% bio-oil, 20% biochar, and 20% syngas. By comparison, slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char (~50%); it is this which contributes to the observed soil fertility of terra preta. Once initialized, both processes produce net energy. For typical inputs, the energy required to run a “fast” <b>pyrolyzer</b> is approximately 15% of the energy that it outputs. Modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 3-9 times the amount of energy required to run.|$|E

This chapter explores the introducing long-lived carbon species (biochars) as stock feed additives to increase ruminant drought survival rates during low feed conditions in arid and semi-arid regions (i. e., where Acacia spp. occurs abundantly within their natural distribution range). This {{has the potential}} to ecologically deliver stable forms of carbon to the soil through the animal solid waste residue, and would require development of new small-scale artisanal <b>pyrolyzers</b> also useful for domestic cooking. This can enable the co-production of biochar from currently unused biomass resources that are at present unsuitable/undesirable for use in existing cooking technologies. The approach is contextualized within the existing sub-Saharan pastoral land use activities, and the associated limiting factors of ruminant production. The research shows in theory, biochar provides traditional livestock systems with an alternative for risk mitigation. Biochar produced from local 'waste' at any time of the year can be used during the feed gaps and provides a variation on local forestry for carbon sequestration activities compatible with traditional pastoral land tenure.

Conversion of Biomass to Biochar in larger custom-built kiln devices - Paul Taylor, PhD. Mt. Warning, NSW, AU [URL] Small property holders, small farmers and community gardeners seek small-scale biochar production devices that process their waste biomass into biochars or enhanced biochars suitable for their soils. They seek to accomplish this with modest budgets in the 100 ’s to 30, 000 range. In this talk we discuss the principals, fuel supply and quality, energy balance, heating methods, emissions levels and regulatory and safety issues relevant to small-scale kiln design. We exemplify with experience in Australia developing batch reactors ranging in size from recycled 55 gal (200 L) drums, through small in-field <b>pyrolyzers,</b> up to 1 and 2 cubic meter cart kilns, and shipping container sized. We also refer to small continuous feed <b>pyrolyzers</b> developed in farm based enterprises in Australia. We include the use of advanced computational fluid dynamics and combustion models to help optimize the designs. Emphasis has been placed on developing integrated systems that allow farmers to use biochar at low application rates. Two systems will be highlighted: one provides process heat for animal pens, and combines the biochar with compost into a granulated pellet; the other produces a synthetic terra preta granule that can be fully organic or a mixture of chemical, minerals and biochar. Jolly Roger Ovens - Biochar making devices for gardeners and small farmers in North America: Karl Frogner 2 ̆ 6 Doug Clayton [URL] “Jolly Roger Ovens” (J-RO’s), inspired John Rogers’ work with 200 liter TLUD’s, are a family of biochar making devices capable of producing 1 to 3 cu-ft per hour of high adsorbing biochar from thinly distributed but widely available feedstocks. Constructed from steel drums and commonly available components, they are easy to build and with minimal practice can perform in a clean, smoke free, manner.

40|$|The French Guiana {{coastline}} is {{a highly}} dynamic environment, mostly composed by fine-grained sediment. This muddy-coastline results both from {{the proximity of the}} Amazon estuary and from the influence of coastal current. Indeed, this current deflects the mudbanks toward the North-West at the rate of 1 km/year. As a result, erosion and accretion of mudbanks alternate on the coast. Between the zone of erosion and accretion, a tropical intertidal forest (mangrove) grows on the stable part of the mudbank. Avicenia germinans is the only species composing the studied mangrove, (managed to survive due to high capacity for adaptation to the anaerobic conditions of the sediment, notably radiating cable roots supporting vertical pneumatophores). The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand and to quantify the relationship between the organic composition of sediments, the evolution of the Avicenia-dominated mangrove forest, and therefore the dynamic feature of the coast. We also intend to determine the influence of environmental conditions on sedimentary record. For this, 12 two-meters deep cores were collected under different stages of mangrove evolution and one core in shoreface sediment as a reference. The forest age was determined thanks to Spot imageries (Vega, 2000). Moreover, we set apart 5 stages of evolution of mangrove forest: pioneer forest, mature forest, senescent forest, dead forest and "colonized" dead forest. This work includes geochemical datas from Rock-Eval and LECO CNS <b>pyrolyzers,</b> petrographic observations and physico-chemical parameters obtention (salinity, redox potential and pH). As expected, the content of organic matter in the sediment rises up with the mangrove age, the TOC content ranges from 1 to 18 %. This trend is also underlined by the petrographic composition; i. e, an increase in ligno-cellulosic debris. However for the youngest mangrove forest, sedimentary organic matter mainly derives from algal mats with low C/Nat. (5 - 8), the higher plant debris are exported by the tides. In the case of the oldest mangrove (50 years old), the C/Nat. ratio rises to 19. Whatever the stage of mangrove evolution, the influence of the forest on the sediment occurs between the surface and 30 cm deep. Below this depth, the characteristics of the sediment are those of the shoreface ones. The efficient decomposition by sulfate-reducing bacteria superimposed to the youth of the mangrove is responsible for this rapid decrease in organic matter content...|$|R

In the first part, Saeman's equation was employed to develop a model which can describe the behavior of solid granular flow in a rotary kiln without reaction. Residence-time distribution (RTD) is the main aim to study in this part, which was simulated by axial dispersion model (ADM). The model requires only one fitting parameter that is dispersion coefficient (Dax), which was studied in parallel by two cases: constant value of Dax, and Dax {{as a function of}} kiln's length. The result of both models show good predictable in comparison to experimental data from literature, and represent narrow distribution of residence times that behave similar to plug flow reactor. Unfortunately, the result still cannot claim which model of Dax is the best model to describe RTD in rotary drum. The second part of the thesis purpose to design the model of rotary kiln <b>pyrolyzer,</b> which contains specific behavior of granular flow, heat transport in a kiln, and primary pyrolysis of wood. The model of steady-state condition with constant wall temperature was simulated to generate temperature profile and conversion along a kiln.

This performance is achieved by combining a coal pyrolyzation process with a High Temperature Advanced Furnace (HITAF). The pyrolyzation process consists of a pressurized fluidized bed reactor which is operated at about 926 o C (1700 o F) at substoichiometric conditions. This process converts the coal into a low- Btu fuel gas and char. These products are then separated. The char is fired in the HITAF where heat is transferred to the gas turbine compressed air and to the steam cycle. The HITAF is fired at atmospheric pressure with pulverized fuel burners. The combustion air is from the gas turbine exhaust stream. The fuel gas from the pyrolyzation process is fired in a Multi- Annular Swirl Burner (MASB) where it further heats the gas turbine air leaving the HITAF. This type of system results in very high efficiency with coal as the only fuel. We are currently in Phase 2 of the project. In Phase 1, a conceptual plant design was developed and analyzed both technically and economically. The design was found to meet the project goals. The purpose of the Phase 2 work is to develop the information needed to design a prototype plant which would be built in Phase 3. In addition to engineering analysis and laboratory testing, the subsystems that are not commercial or being developed on other projects will be tested at pilot plant scale. The FWDC Second- Generation PFB pilot plant in Livingston, NJ, has been modified to test the <b>pyrolyzer</b> subsystem. The FWDC Combustion and Environmental Test Facility (CETF) in Dansville, NY, is being modified to test the char combustion system. When these tests are complete, a more integrated pilot plant will be tested. During this Quarter, some modifications to the Livingston <b>Pyrolyzer</b> Pilot Plant were made and two more test runs were completed. All planned modes of operation with a jetting type of bubbling bed <b>pyrolyzer</b> have been completed. Data reduction {{for the first two}} test points is complete, but laboratory analysis for the last two runs is still in progress. The results so far indicate that this type of <b>pyrolyzer</b> will give performance that is acceptable for a HIPPS plant. The bubbling bed <b>pyrolyzer</b> has been run with beds of limestone and alternatively with sand beds. The coal input to the <b>pyrolyzer</b> has been pulverized coal in all cases...|$|E

30|$|The {{procedure}} {{reported in}} our previous paper [9] was used by modifying the pyrolysis temperature and heating rate in the evaporator. A solution of GlcαOMe, GlcβOMe, or LG (5  mg) in methanol (0.1  mL) {{was applied to the}} area separated by the fringes in the evaporator tube, and the methanol was evaporated under a nitrogen flow. After the complete drying in a desiccator under vacuum, the evaporator tube was connected to the <b>pyrolyzer</b> tube and other components of the experimental setup, and a nitrogen flow (400  mL min− 1) was supplied for 30  min prior to conducting each pyrolysis trial to remove the air inside the reactor. The <b>pyrolyzer</b> was heated at the desired temperature in the range of 200 – 500 [*]°C, and then, the evaporator temperature was raised to 120 [*]°C over 12  min and subsequently to 190 [*]°C at a heating rate of 5.8 [*]°C min− 1. The GlcαOMe, GlcβOMe, and LG crystals were melt at this temperature and evaporated slowly to the volatile materials that were transported to the <b>pyrolyzer</b> with the flowing nitrogen. The evaporator temperature (190 [*]°C) was carefully chosen to inhibit the occurrence of the molten-phase reactions. After holding the evaporator at 190 [*]°C for 13  min to complete the evaporation, heating was stopped, and the tube reactor was cooled by opening the furnace covers and subsequently applying an air flow from the outside.|$|E
