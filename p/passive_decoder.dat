40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the term ‘visual literacy’ {{at the end of the}} 1960 s, the debate about its meaning and uses has paralleled that of the term ‘literacy’. These debates have resulted in a theoretical move from a consideration of literacy as a mechanical act in which the subject is a <b>passive</b> <b>decoder</b> of the most superficial meaning of a text, to the idea of literacies as meaning-making practices in which the social subject actively involves previous knowledge of self and of the world. In practice however, this move has usually not been taken into account in the world of education where literacy is usually seen as the functional basis of the curriculum and visual literacy skills are virtually neglected – despite the fact that never before have children been surrounded by so much visual information. This article describes part of a study of children’s responses to picturebooks which aimed to learn how visual literacy can expand children’s cognitive abilities and enhance their wonder and enjoyment of such complex texts. The work here focuses on responses to The Tunnel by Anthony Browne by children of different ages and from different schools. All of them showed deep intellectual and emotional engagement with the visual narrative...|$|E

The limited-view causal adversary is able to eavesdrop on a subset of links and also jam on a potentially overlapping subset of links based on the current and past information. To ensure that the communication takes place reliably and secretly, resilient network codes with necessary redundancy are needed. We study two adversarial models - additive and overwrite jamming and we optionally assume <b>passive</b> feedback from <b>decoder</b> to encoder, i. e., the encoder sees everything that the decoder sees. The problem assumes transmissions are in the large alphabet regime. For both jamming models, we find the capacity under four scenarios - reliability without feedback, reliability and secrecy without feedback, reliability with passive feedback, reliability and secrecy with passive feedback. We observe that, in comparison to the non-causal setting, the capacity with a causal adversary is strictly increased for a wide variety of parameter settings and present our intuition through several examples.
