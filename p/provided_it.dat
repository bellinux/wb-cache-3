5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first {{to address the problem of}} the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{a second}} {{expedition}} was organised, mainly through the German Foreign Office and the Indian {{leadership of the}} Berlin Committee.

Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio.

5|$|Plantinga argued that, {{although}} the first premise is not rationally established, {{it is not}} contrary to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first premise is contrary to reason.

5|$|A {{report in}} the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had {{resigned}} the world title in favor of Capablanca because {{the conditions of the}} match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.|$|E

5|$|Bullion prices {{continued}} to drop through the 1880s, increasing the loss by anyone {{forced to sell}} at melt value after accepting a trade dollar at face value. Despite the support of Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger, {{the question of the}} redemption of the trade dollar became caught up in controversy over the heavy coinage of the new Morgan dollar under the inflationary Bland–Allison Act. Silver interests objected to the silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards the Mint's monthly quota under the act, preferring to sell newly mined silver instead, and opposed acts which so <b>provided.</b> <b>It</b> was not until 1887 that Congress, ostensibly to relieve the poor (though most trade dollars were by then in the hands of speculators), provided for the redemption of unmutilated trade dollars. The act, which did not count the redeemed silver towards the Bland–Allison Act quota, passed into law on February 14, 1887, when the ten-day period which President Grover Cleveland had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by the President. Many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks or holes applied by Chinese businessmen, which was done to affirm the coin's silver content. The dollars were only redeemable for six months, and the recovered silver was struck into dimes, quarters, and half dollars.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia. While the 2/6thInfantry Battalion made a demonstration on the right, the 2/5thInfantry Battalion, reinforced by part of the 2/7thInfantry Battalion, attempted to follow up the 16thInfantry Brigade's attack, with {{the remainder of the}} 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade had become too tired and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some of the blame, for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian {{spent the}} spring of 293 {{traveling}} with Galerius from Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) to Byzantium (Istanbul, Turkey). Diocletian then returned to Sirmium, where he would remain for the following winter and spring. He campaigned against the Sarmatians again in 294, probably in the autumn, and won a victory against them. The Sarmatians' defeat kept them from the Danube provinces for a long time. Meanwhile, Diocletian built forts north of the Danube, at Aquincum (Budapest, Hungary), Bononia (Vidin, Bulgaria), Ulcisia Vetera, Castra Florentium, Intercisa (Dunaújváros, Hungary), and Onagrinum (Begeč, Serbia). The new forts became {{part of a new}} defensive line called the Ripa Sarmatica. In 295 and 296 Diocletian campaigned in the region again, and won a victory over the Carpi in the summer of 296. Later during both 299 and 302, as Diocletian was then residing in the East, it was Galerius' turn to campaign victoriously on the Danube. By the end of his reign, Diocletian had secured {{the entire length of the}} Danube, <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> with forts, bridgeheads, highways, and walled towns, and sent fifteen or more legions to patrol the region; an inscription at Sexaginta Prista on the Lower Danube extolled restored tranquilitas to the region. The defense came at a heavy cost, but was a significant achievement in an area difficult to defend.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the French National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories. In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA) won the elections in French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, an Act of Congress officially renamed Bedloe's Island as Liberty Island, {{a change}} {{advocated}} by Bartholdi generations earlier. The act also mentioned {{the efforts to}} found an American Museum of Immigration on the island, which backers took as federal approval of the project, though the government was slow to grant funds for it. Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by proclamation of President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. In 1972, the immigration museum, in the statue's base, was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon. The museum's backers never <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island.|$|E

The winner of the match between Leicester and Bath was drawn against them as the away team. Cardiff elected to stage the game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which is located adjacent to their usual Cardiff Arms Park ground and has a much larger capacity of 74,500, compared to the 12,500 capacity of the Arms Park. Cardiff had already moved their quarter-final game against Toulouse to the Millennium Stadium, despite being able to use their own ground at that stage of the competition, {{to take advantage of the}} increased capacity.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me in the Land of Grapico. Meet Me in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and <b>provided</b> <b>it</b> free on request.|$|E
