30|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{in this research}} refers {{to the introduction of}} contaminants into the natural environment that could cause adverse change. The ecological footprint used for this criterion parameter was ascertained by measuring the ballast water treatment system operation demand on the Earth’s ecosystems, i.e. the amount of natural resource capital used per annum. Efficacy was a testing score parameter, i.e. data collected from the test performance results of ballast water treatment systems recorded via the United States Marine Invasive Species Program (Dobroski et al. 2007). Whether a ballast water treatment system belongs to the G 8 or G 9 group depends on the test results. Tests were done during the certification process. The Ballast Water Management Convention (BWMC) and the Guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems—G 8 must be taken into consideration for the approval of a ballast water management system. If a certain ballast water technology uses an active substance, then, to comply with the Convention, it should be approved by the IMO in accordance with the <b>Procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> of ballast water management systems that make use of Active Substances—G 9, adopted by the MEPC (Marine Environment Protection Committee) in session 53 (MEPC 2005; Tsolaki and Diamadopulos 2010). The degree of environmental friendliness of a particular ballast system determines whether it belongs to the G 8 or G 9 group parameter weighting. The G 8 or G 9 classification treatment systems and efficacy parameters are the most significant for ports and port ecology. The system that uses peracetic acid will arouse the attention of port staff more as this substance belongs to the G 9 group. The number of treatment methods and whether treatment is done in the port or during the voyage is an important parameter from the ship crew members’ the point of view. Some systems employ multiple methods to increase effectiveness and some systems use just one method. If a certain ballast water technology uses one treatment method, then, it should be easier to maintain the system. If the system neutralizes the ballast water while the ship is in motion, crewmembers have more time to rest and to go ashore and visit the port during cargo operations. All these criteria parameters were weighted as per the research results collected in Table  1.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{occurrence}} {{of infectious diseases}} is monitored {{on the basis of}} surveillance data from morbidity and mortality registers and data from laboratories. Important additional information can be derived from serosurveillance: the study of the prevalence of specific antibodies in the population. Particularly for the control of the immunity for diseases against which people are vaccinated following the National Immunization Programme serosurveillance or immunosurveillance is necessary. Therefore, the RIVM has taken the initiative to establish a serum bank of a random sample of the Dutch population and the so-called PIENTER-project has been started. In 1994 a pilot study was carried out. Aim. The pilot study had a twofold aim: firstly, the assessment of the feasibility of the design and the development of an ascertained protocol for the final nation-wide data collection, secondly the judgement of the possibility to obtain a representative data set (by means of an comprehensive non-response investigation, which is described in part II of this report series). Design. A cross-sectional population-based study was done in the province of Utrecht. Methods. An age-stratified random sample of 510 inhabitants (0 - 80 years of age) was taken from the population registers of four municipalities. The intended participants who were approached by mail, were expected to fill in a questionnaire and to visit a clinic to allow blood to be taken. The evaluation of the logistics was based on the experience during the pilot, partly written down in registrations and personal logbooks of the study team, partly derived from a written questionnaire filled in by the concerned collaborators. Furthermore, the non-response study has offered leads for optimalization of the acquisition of participants. Findings and recommendations Data collection in the general population can be done in cooperation with Public Health Services with a central coordination. The cooperation between the many partners, both within the RIVM and outside, was good and justice was done to the contribution of every partner. However, more attention should be payed to the protocol and the <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> of the specific serological studies before the sera can be given out to the laboratories. In these protocols the assignment of tasks and responsibilities of the Department of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology and of the participating laboratories should be well described. From the results of the pilot it was concluded that the protocol met the conditions: no serious logistical bottlenecks were encountered. Nevertheless, some adaptations in the execution are proposed because of the expansion to a nation-wide data collection in 1995 and later. Particularly investments should be done in automating the processing of sera and the administration of the serum bank. Improvement of the efficiency and limitation of possible sources of errors are an important argument for this automation. Moreover, a more direct approach of the intended participants by way of reminding them by telephone, before the clinic takes place, is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Good {{education}} {{is the product of}} good administration and the administration is not simply a managerial occupation, it demands new dimensions of knowledge, techniques and skills. Today administrators are confronting a variety of problems in their respective organizations. In the past, administrators could control and manipulate more readily because organizations were less complicated and environments were more stable but now many complex forces have emerged like the market needs, continuous changes and leadership authenticity, so the administrators and organizations both are under security. To grasp these problems and to cope up with continuous changes, need assessment of administrators and designing of a training model for their professional development is a significant topic of research. The study was aimed at assessing the needs of educational administrators at college level and designing a training model. The study consisted of the following stages (a) assessment of training needs and problems of educational administrators; (b) designing a training model on the basis of findings and literature; and (c) validation of training model by Delphi Technique. The Delphi Technique was based on the Hegelian principle of achieving; Oneness of Mind through a three-step process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. In thesis and antithesis, all present their opinion or views on a given subject, establishing views and opposing views. In synthesis, opposites were brought together to form the new thesis. All participants were then to accept ownership of the new thesis and support it, changing their own views to align with the new thesis. Through a continual process of evolution, Oneness of Mind supposedly occurred. For this purpose, objectives of the study were: to assess the training needs of the educational administrators at degree college level; to investigate the problems faced by educational administrators at Degree College level; to examine the performance of educational administrators at Degree College level; to suggest measures to overcome the problems faced by educational administrators at Degree College level and to design a training model for professional development of educational administrators. The population of the study was all the principals and teachers of Degree Colleges, male and female, imparting general education in Punjab. A sample of 80 Principals (40 male and 40 female) of Government Degree Colleges was selected randomly from 26 districts and four hundred teachers were selected randomly. The sample size was thus 480. One Administrative Demographic Checklist (ADC) and two questionnaires; one for principals and other for colleges teachers were developed on the basis of related literature and tried out on ten respondents. The researcher Collected data from the respondents through the instruments personally, with help of assistants and also through mail. The data was tabulated and statistically analyzed. The main conclusions were that: (I) training needs were assessed in the skills such as use of computer, planning, decision-making, delegation of authority, stress management, conflict management, time management, motivation, team building, human relation and about the principal role as an instructional leader; (2) respondent principals were facing the problems like insufficient budget, influence of top management on the budget and performance targets, lack of training opportunities, political interference, lack of staff (teaching and menial), lack of authority in utilizing the funds due to complicated <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and insufficient building/classrooms; (3) Performance of respondent principals was low. The main recommendations of the study were follows: (I) training agencies may provide training program for the professional development of the principals in skills, which were assessed in this study; (2) the Handbook may be developed for principals, this may be useful for them in their smooth functioning and to be effective instructional leaders; (3) principals may be transferred or rotated after three years; (4) for regular and fair assessment of principals, a profarma for monthly evaluation of principals' performance may be developed. On the basis of literature and findings of the study, a training model for educational administrators was developed and was validated through Delphi Technique. This training model is for the professional development of educational administrators/principals at degree college level in Punjab...|$|E
