All six colours have then to be potted in ascending order of their points value (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, black). Each becomes the ball [...] "on" [...] in that order.

5000|$|The ball or balls {{that can}} be hit first by the white are called the ball(s) [...] "on" [...] for that {{particular}} stroke. The ball(s) [...] "on" [...] differ from shot to shot: a red ball, if potted, must {{be followed by a}} <b>colour,</b> a <b>potted</b> <b>colour</b> must be followed by a red, and so on until a break ends; if a red is not potted, any red ball remains the ball [...] "on". Only a ball or balls [...] "on" [...] may be potted legally by a player. If a ball not [...] "on" [...] is potted, this is a foul.|$|R
50|$|Interesting {{situations}} {{could occur}} if somehow both the free {{ball and the}} real ball on are <b>potted.</b> If a <b>colour</b> was the ball on (all reds were potted), and both the free ball and the actual ball on are potted, only the ball on is scored. The free ball is respotted while the actual ball on will stay off the table. This {{is the only time}} when attempting to <b>pot</b> a <b>colour</b> that two balls can be potted without a foul occurring, because technically speaking both of the potted balls are on.|$|R

At the beginning its relationships don’t amount to much - it’s a rectangle in a jumble of art history I relate to. There would not be much fun in leaving the room empty, a passive - one colour field - a blank canvas. And entirely abstract forms place too many restrictions on dialogue. So I have put in some other stuff, some characters, some actors - tables, <b>pots,</b> <b>colours,</b> easels, lamps, scribbles, figures and faces to interact with each other. I adjust the temperature, open the windows, shut the windows, throw things out, change the lighting." ...|$|R

After being awarded a free ball Burnett took the brown as an extra red, then a brown, then added 15 reds and 12 blacks, two pinks and a blue. He then <b>potted</b> the <b>colours</b> to complete a historic and remarkable 148 break. He afterwards commented [...] "I didn't {{really know how to}} react afterwards. At first I thought it was no big deal, but then I realised I'd made history." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{reached the}} semi-finals of the UK Championship in both 2004 and 2005. The 2004 defeat was {{especially}} notable as Perry led 8-7 and had <b>potted</b> a <b>colour</b> {{to leave his}} opponent, David Gray, requiring a snooker - however, Perry's pot had also left him snookered on the final red, which he failed to hit, allowing Gray to clear the table and ultimately win the deciding frame with a total clearance of 139. This run left Perry provisionally fifth in the world, but he failed to win a match in the remaining five tournaments and dropped to 14th {{at the end of}} the season as a result. In 2005, he lost to eventual champion Ding Junhui.|$|R

His semi-final against Joe Perry was particularly memorable as Perry appeared to have won the match 9-7 by <b>potting</b> a <b>colour</b> leaving Gray requiring a snooker, but Perry himself was snookered on the next red, failed to hit it, and didn't score another point as Gray cleared the table then hit a 139 total clearance in the deciding frame.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{ceramics}} that were found during the field season excavation of May 2012 at the pre-Columbian site Aguas Buenas, Nicaragua, AD 400 - 1400. Aguas Buenas is situated in the Chontales province, Central Nicaragua, where {{there is not much}} archaeological research done. Linguistic and ethno historical research shows that the province was a cultural complex area in pre-Columbian times. Aguas Buenas is the largest known site in this province and so far only studies in surveys. The aim of the thesis is trying to say something about the identity of the people who build the site and regional interaction. During the field season of 2012 pottery was the most found material. The ceramics were studied using a modal analysis. The following modes were analysed: pot shape, lip shape, diameter of the <b>pot,</b> firing <b>colour,</b> colour, slip, decoration, and surface finishing. These results are compared with previous studies from Chontales and the Pacific region of Nicaragua...|$|R
2500|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to score more [...] than one's opponent by potting [...] in the correct order. At the start of a frame, the balls are positioned as shown, and the players then take turns to hit shots by striking the cue ball with the [...] of the cue, their aim being to pot one of the red balls into a pocket and thereby score a point, or, if this is not possible, to at least hit a red ball so as to avoid making a foul shot. If the striker pots a red ball, he or she must then pot one of the six [...] "colours" [...] (in snooker, the term colour is understood to exclude the red balls). If the player successfully <b>pots</b> a <b>colour,</b> the value of that ball is added to the player's score, and the ball is returned to its starting position on the table. After that, the player must pot another red ball, then another colour, and so on. This process continues until the striker fails to pot the desired ball, at which point the opponent comes to the table to play the next shot.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Islamic and Hispano-Moresque glazes {{from the}} 10 th to 15 th centuries found in various archaeological sites, {{most of them}} workshops, are studied to show the {{technical}} evolution of the medieval glazing process. The technology seems to show a simplification: the early Islamic glazes were applied on prefired bodies and after fritting a lead-silica mixture, whereas for the later Islamic productions the raw materials for the lead glazes were not fritted and they were applied over unfired bodies. The same simplified technology {{was used in the}} Hispano-Moresque workshops. In the Islamic workshops lead glazes were coloured by adding elements (Fe, Cu, Mn), whereas the mfidejar technology simplified the process by using only one recipe to produce <b>pots</b> ofdifferent <b>colour.</b> This was achieved by applying the glaze in a different manner (on one side of the pot to obtain yellow or on both sides to btain green), or using different pastes (already used to produce pottery for different uses). Finally, there are differences between Islamic and Hispano-Moresque tin glazes related to the crystal size of the opacifier (tin oxide crystals), which should indicate some technological differences in temperature, glaze composition and the process to obtain the frits because of the high dependence b tween viscosity, temperature and crystal nucleatio...|$|R
2500|$|At the 1985 World Championship, Davis dropped only 23 frames {{en route}} to the final, where his {{opponent}} was Dennis Taylor. He looked set for a third consecutive world title after an opening session of near-faultless snooker gave him a 7–0 lead, which he extended to 8–0 in the evening session, but Taylor recovered to trail only 7–9. From 11–11 the pair traded frames before Davis forged ahead to lead 17–15. Taylor won the next two frames to level the match at 17–17 and force a deciding frame. With the scores close, Taylor <b>potted</b> the final <b>colours</b> to leave the black as the winner-takes-all ball. After a series of safety shots and attempts at potting it, Davis over-cut the black, leaving Taylor with a reasonably straightforward pot to secure the championship. The nailbiting finale drew 18.5million viewers, a record post-midnight audience on British television and a record audience for BBC Two. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|R
50|$|Lisowski {{played in}} nine minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events {{during the season}} and reached the final in the first one, by seeing off Trump in the quarter-finals and Mark Williams in the semis. The final against Stephen Maguire went to a {{deciding}} frame with Lisowski missing a yellow off the spot, when requiring two further pots to leave his opponent needing snookers, and after a brief safety exchange Maguire <b>potted</b> the remaining <b>colours</b> to win the title. In the other PTC events his best results were three last 16 defeats which helped cement {{his place in the}} Finals by finishing 13th on the Order of Merit. There, he beat world number two Mark Selby 4-3 in the first round, before losing to Tom Ford in another deciding frame in the second round. In World Championship Qualifying, he had comfortable 10-4 wins over James Wattana and Fergal O'Brien to reach the Crucible for the first time, where he played Barry Hawkins. The experience and composure of Hawkins told as he took the match 10-3, with Lisowski citing the intimate nature of playing at the Crucible, which affected his concentration, as a factor in the one-sided scoreline. He climbed five place in the rankings during the season to finish it world number 35 which is his highest position to date.|$|R
6000|$|Next, put 22 and 5 back to back. You {{see again}} the {{resemblance}} in the earnestness of both figures, in the unbroken arcs of their backs, in {{the breaking of}} the octagon moulding by the pointed angles; and here, even also in the general conception of the heads. But again, in the one of Painting, the hair is struck with more vulgar indenting and drilling, and the Gothic of the picture frame is less precise in touch and later in style. Observe, however,--and this may perhaps give us some definite hint for clearing the question,--a picture-frame would be less precise in making, and later in style, properly, than cusped arches to be put under the feet of the inventor of all musical sound by breath of man. And if you will now compare finally the eager tilting of the workman's seat in 22 and 6, and the working of the wood in the painter's low table for his <b>pots</b> of <b>colour,</b> and his three-legged stool, with that of Tubal Cain's anvil block; {{and the way in which}} the lines of the forge and upper triptych are in each composition used to set off the rounding of the head, I believe you will have little hesitation in accepting my own view of the matter--namely, that the three pieces of the Fathers of the Arts were wrought with Giotto's extremest care for the most precious stones of his tower; that also, being a sculptor and painter, he did the other two, but with quite definite and wilful resolve that they should be, as mere symbols of his own two trades, wholly inferior to the other subjects of the patriarchs; that he made the Sculpture picturesque and bold as you see it is, and showed all a sculptor's tricks in the work of it; and a sculptor's Greek subject, Bacchus, for the model of it; that he wrought the Painting, as the higher art, with more care, still keeping it subordinate to the primal subjects, but showed, for a lesson to all the generations of painters for evermore,--this one lesson, like his circle of pure line containing all others,--'Your soul and body must be all in every touch.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Kipps' furniture, {{except for}} certain chromo {{lithographs}} of Kipps' incidental choice that struck a quiet note amidst the wall paper, had been tactfully forced by an expert salesman, {{and it was}} in a style of mediocre elegance. There was a sideboard of carved oak that had only one fault, it reminded Kipps at times of wood-carving, and its panel of bevelled glass now reflected the back of his head. On its shelf were two books from Parsons' Library, each with a [...] "place" [...] marked by a slip of paper; neither of the Kippses could have told you the title of either book they read, much less the author's name.

And there was a Turkey carpet of great richness. In addition to these modern exploits of Messrs. Bunt and Bubble, there were two inactive tall clocks, whose extreme dilapidation appealed to the connoisseur; a terrestrial and a celestial globe, the latter deeply indented; a number of good old iron moulded and dusty books, and a stuffed owl wanting one (easily replaceable) glass eye, obtained by the exertions of Uncle Kipps. The table equipage was as much as possible like Mrs. Bindon Botting's, only more costly, and in addition there were green and crimson wine glasses--though the Kippses never drank wine.|$|R

However, he left his wife a certain property, which she appears to have muddled away, not having the safeguard of being herself a Hebrew. This is what she has lived on till to-day--this and another resource. Her husband, as she has often told me, had the artistic temperament: that's common, as you know, among ces messieurs. He {{made the most of}} his little opportunities and collected various pictures, tapestries, enamels, porcelains, and similar gewgaws. He parted with them also, I gather, at a profit; in short he carried on a neat little business as a brocanteur. It was nipped in the bud, but Mrs. Rooth was left with a certain number of these articles in her hands; indeed they must have formed her only capital. She was not a woman of business; she turned them, no doubt, to indifferent account; but she sold them piece by piece, and they kept her going while her daughter grew up. It was to this precarious traffic, conducted with extraordinary mystery and delicacy, that, five years ago, in Florence, I was indebted for my acquaintance with her. In those days I used to collect--heaven help me!--I used to pick up rubbish which I could ill afford. It was a little phase--we have our little phases, haven't we?" [...] Mr. Nash asked with childlike trust--"and I've come out on the other side. Mrs. Rooth had an old green pot and I heard of her old green pot.
