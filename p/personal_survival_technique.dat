40|$|The dissertation, “Architectures of Freedom: Literary Collaboration in Contemporary American Poetry” {{uses the}} praxis of the U.

Differential consciousness {{is the ability to}} form coalitions within and beyond different communities not just for <b>personal</b> <b>survival,</b> but through <b>personal</b> <b>survival</b> to transform social oppressions. This dissertation animates Sandoval’s apparatus, which she calls a methodology of the oppressed, to analyze how a current cohort of writers are using literary collaboration to decolonize globalization. The three collaborations the dissertation analyzes are the artblog Pënz (It’s Pronounced Pants), conceptual artists Mendi+Keith Obadike, and Encyclopedia Project, an editorial collaboration. Taken together these three collaborations offer a powerful blueprint for decolonizing globalization for Pënz decolonizes time, M+K decolonizes space (geographic and digital), and Encyclopedia decolonizes knowledge. ...|$|R
