5000|$|From {{a digital}} point of view, ribbon cable was an ideal way to connect two devices. However, from an analog point of view, these cables are problematic. Around 1980, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{discovered}} that ribbon cables were highly efficient antennas, broadcasting essentially random signals {{across a wide}} band of the electromagnetic spectrum. These unintended signals could interfere with domestic TV reception, putting [...] "snow" [...] on the screen. The FCC issued edicts and injunctions to the personal-computer industry, restricting the use of ribbon cables to connect devices together. [...] "Naked" [...] ribbon cable could be used inside {{the case of a}} computer or peripheral device, but any ribbon cable connecting two boxes together had to be grounded. This rule led to solutions such as ribbon cables covered by a copper-braid shield, which made it impossible to see or separate the individual connectors.
