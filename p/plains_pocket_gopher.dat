However, pregnancies lasting up to 51 days have been recorded, and this variation may indicate some form of delayed fertilization, delayed implantation, or delayed zygote development.|$|R
40|$|Student, EEB 4839, 2009 In {{this study}} we {{examined}} and quantified the effects <b>plains</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> had on vegetation.

About 30 to 50 m of tunnels were open at any one time. Factors affecting the size of the tunnel system appeared to be influenced more by the amount of energy needed to maintain and patrol it rather than the amount of vegetation present. Tunnels include nests, located about 50 cm under ground, and lined with grass and other plant material, as well as food caches containing grasses, roots, and tubers.|$|R

40|$|Low Input Sustainable Agriculture (LISA) {{strives to}} {{minimize}} input of agrichemicals for farmers while maintaining profits. Alfalfa fits into this scheme in 2 ways. First, the <b>plains</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Geomys bursarius) can reduce yield of alfalfa, thus an effective, economical {{means of control}} with minimal environmental impact would be desirable. Second, {{the increased use of}} alfalfa in rotation with row crops to increase soil nitrogen may increase <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> problems by increasing their habitat. Our objective was to evaluate a cultural method to control <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> damage, namely, by comparing 2 different varieties of alfalfa. One variety is tap-rooted (Wrangler) while the other has a more fibrous-rooted system (Spredor 2). We hypothesized that damage would be less in the fibrous-rooted alfalfa as it is capable of vegetative reproduction and could recolonize areas. We released live-trapped <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> on 4 treatment areas in each alfalfa variety. <b>Pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> were present on plots of each variety from the fall of 1988 through the fall of 1989. Damage caused by <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> was measured by clipping 80 samples/harvest during the 1989 growing season. Yields were 15 to 19 % less in treatment areas than in control areas for both varieties. Sampling continued through the 1990 growing season to determine the recovery rate of each variety after gophers had been removed. The tap-rooted variety showed no improvement in 1990 over 1989.

40|$|In 1989 we {{postulated}} that using different varieties of alfalfa might minimize damages caused by <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Geomys spp.). We tested a tap-rooted variety (Wrangler) and a fibrous-rooted variety (Spredor 2). From previous studies, Wrangler out performs Spredor 2 {{by as much}} as 27 % by the fourth year after planting. Spredor 2, however, has a creeping habit and it sends up new shoots on lateral roots. When a root breaks, it sends up new shoots. Therefore, we predicted that Spredor 2 would be damaged less by below-ground foraging by <b>plains</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (G. Bursarius). Additionally, Spredor 2 would send up new shoots when <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> damaged part of the root system and perhaps this would compensate for losses caused by gophers. During three difficult studies that were characterized by drought, floods, and predation on <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> by coyotes (Canis latrans), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensi), and badgers (Taxidea taxus), we finally had sufficient statistical power to make some conclusions. We planted the alfalfa varieties in 9 paired fields and further divided them in 2; with 1 field receiving <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> as a treatment and the other serving as a control. On the control fields, Wrangler out yielded Spredor 2 (P = 0. 01), but only by 9 %. Wrangler yields were reduced by 19 % (P = 0. 01) when <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> were present. We did not detect a difference in yields of Spredor 2 (P = 0. 30) due to <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers.</b> We think that these exciting data offer great promise to alfalfa growers that experience troubles with <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers.</b> We encourage others to duplicate these experiments in other regions...|$|R
40|$|For many herbivorous mammals, oils from {{conifers}} are feeding repellents.

Stations contained either a scent dispenser with pine needle oil or with mineral oil. Pine needle oil did not inhibit food retrieval under these conditions. Responses to pine needle oil {{and to a}} control odorant, d-pulegone, were also tested in mazes where subjects were offered choices between two goal boxes, each containing food associated with an odorant. To examine the possibility that <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> avoid any unfamiliar odor because of neophobia, freshly caught animals were tested in a maze offering a choice between goals scented with d-pulegone and goals containing mineral oil. The behavior of the animals {{in the side of}} the maze containing pulegone did not differ from their behavior in the side containing mineral oil, indicating indifference to this stimulus.

40|$|Thirty-four {{species of}} <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers,</b> {{represented}} by five genera, occupy the western hemisphere. In the United States there are 13 species and three genera. The major features differentiating these genera are {{the size of}} their forefeet, claws, and front surfaces of their chisel-like incisors. Thomomys have smooth-faced incisors and small forefeet with small claws. Northern <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Thomomys talpoides) are typically from 6 1 / 2 to 10 inches (17 to 25 cm) long. Their fur is variable in color but is often yellowish brown with pale underparts. Botta’s (or valley) <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Thomomys bottae) are extremely variable in size and color. Botta’s <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> are 5 inches to about 13 1 / 2 inches (13 to 34 cm) long. Their color varies from almost white to black. Geomys have two grooves on each upper incisor and large forefeet and claws. <b>Plains</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Geomys bursarius) vary in length from almost 7 1 / 2 to 14 inches (18 to 36 cm). Their fur is typically brown but may vary to black. Desert <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Geomys arenarius) are always brown and vary from nearly 8 3 / 4 to 11 inches (22 to 28 cm) long. Texas <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Geomys personatus) are also brown and are from slightly larger than 8 3 / 4 to nearly 13 inches (22 to 34 cm) long. Southeastern <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Geomys pinetis) are of various shades of brown, depending on soil color, and are from 9 to 13 1 / 4 inches (23 to 34 cm) long. Pappogeomys have a single groove on each upper incisor and, like Geomys, have large forefeet with large claws. Yellow-faced <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Pappogeomys castanops) vary in length from slightly more than 5 1 / 2 to just less than 7 1 / 2 inches (14 to 19 cm). Their fur color varies from pale yellow to dark reddish brown. The underparts vary from whitish to bright yellowish buff. Some hairs on the back and top of the head are dark-tipped. Range: <b>Pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> are found only in the Western Hemisphere. They range from Panama in the south to Alberta in the north. With the exception of the southeastern <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher,</b> they occur throughout the western two-thirds of the United States. Exclusion: Generally not practical. Small mesh wire fence may provide protection for ornamental trees and shrubs or flower beds. Plastic netting protects seedlings. Cultural Methods: Damage resistant varieties of alfalfa. Crop rotation. Grain buffer strips. Control of tap-rooted forbs. Flood irrigation. Plant naturally resistant varieties of seedlings. Repellents: Synthetic predator odors are all of questionable benefit. Toxicants: Baits: Strychnine alkaloid. Zinc phosphide. Chlorophacinone. Diphacinone. Fumigants: Carbon monoxide from engine exhaust. Others are not considered very effective, but some are used: Aluminum phosphide. Gas cartridges. Trapping: Various specialized gopher kill traps. Common spring or pan trap (sizes No. 0 and No. 1). Shooting: Not practical. Other: Buried irrigation pipe or electrical cables can be protected with cylindrical pipe having an outside diameter of at least 2. 9 inches (7. 4 cm). Surrounding a buried cable with 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of coarse gravel (1 inch [2. 5 cm] in diameter) may provide some protection...|$|R
