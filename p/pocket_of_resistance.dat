5|$|In 1070 Sweyn II of Denmark {{arrived to}} take {{personal}} command of his fleet and renounced the earlier agreement to withdraw, sending troops into the Fens {{to join forces}} with English rebels led by Hereward the Wake, at that time based on the Isle of Ely. Sweyn soon accepted a further payment of Danegeld from William, and returned home. After {{the departure of the}} Danes the Fenland rebels remained at large, protected by the marshes, and early in 1071 there was a final outbreak of rebel activity in the area. Edwin and Morcar again turned against William, and although Edwin was quickly betrayed and killed, Morcar reached Ely, where he and Hereward were joined by exiled rebels who had sailed from Scotland. William arrived with an army and a fleet to finish off this last <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b> After some costly failures the Normans managed to construct a pontoon to reach the Isle of Ely, defeated the rebels at the bridgehead and stormed the island, marking the effective end of English resistance. Morcar was imprisoned {{for the rest of his}} life; Hereward was pardoned and had his lands returned to him.|$|E
25|$|The new {{government}} {{that came to}} power during the revolution formally disbanded ÁVH, declared its intention {{to withdraw from the}} Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Politburo thereafter moved to crush the revolution. On 4 November, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The last <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> called for ceasefire on 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 722 Soviet troops were killed and thousands more were wounded.|$|E
25|$|In mid-May 1971, GM 31 finally {{cleared the}} last platoon of PAVN troops from Zebra Ridge, near Long Tieng. On 21 May, it marched to Long Tieng, to be flown back to MR 3 two days later. By {{the end of}} May, the PAVN units of the 316th began to slowly recede back upon their lines of {{communications}} into North Vietnam. The 148th PAVN Regiment hung on and formed a <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> near Phousai, one of several. Some of the retreating PAVN troops subjected nearby Bouamlong to an intense but unsuccessful assault. Three Pathet Lao battalions were left to maintain a Communist presence near Bouamlong {{by the end of}} May, and the PAVN retained launching points near Long Tieng for future offensives.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{attacked the}} target, knocking out several Anti-Aircraft gun positions. Two helicopter gunships continued to hit suspected strategic positions {{and managed to}} flash out several <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b> A third helicopter was directing the dropping of {{the first wave of}} paratroopers. When the paratroopers had entered the base, the infantry battalions, which were close by, were ordered to move in and occupy strategic positions. The Fireforce then moved on to deal with the several <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> from the smaller RENAMO bases all along the Gorongosa Mountains. It took the whole day to silence all <b>of</b> these <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|R

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving with the Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on the Island of Peleliu in the Palau Group, September 18, 1944. Boldly taking the initiative when his platoon's left flank advance was held up by the fire of Japanese troops concealed in strongly fortified positions, Private First Class Jackson unhesitatingly proceeded forward of our lines and, courageously defying the heavy barrages, charged a large pillbox housing approximately thirty-five enemy soldiers. Pouring his automatic fire into the opening of the fixed installation to trap the occupying troops, he hurled white phosphorus grenades and explosive charges brought up by a fellow Marine, demolishing the pillbox and killing all of the enemy. Advancing alone under the continuous fire from other hostile emplacements, he employed a similar means to smash two smaller positions in the immediate vicinity. Determined to crush the entire <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> although harassed on all sides by the shattering blasts of Japanese weapons and covered only by small rifle parties, he stormed one gun position after another, dealing death and destruction to the savagely fighting enemy in his inexorable drive against the remaining defenses and succeeded in wiping out a total of twelve pillboxes and fifty Japanese soldiers. Stouthearted and indomitable despite the terrific odds, Private First Class Jackson resolutely maintained control of the platoon's left flank movement throughout his valiant one-man assault and, by his cool decision and relentless fighting spirit during a critical situation, contributed essentially to the complete annihilation of the enemy in the southern sector of the island. His gallant initiative and heroic conduct in the face of extreme peril reflect the highest credit upon Private First Class Jackson and the United States Naval Service.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the night, Japanese {{artillery}} {{was very}} active, firing {{down on the}} Australian positions around The Pimple, after which a [...] "banzai attack" [...] was launched early on 7 February. Although repulsed, it enabled the Japanese to maintain a small <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> on the western tip of the ridge. On the evening of 7 February, Captain Kawakami's 10th Company from the III Battalion, 81st Infantry Regiment, withdrew. Nevertheless, a small Japanese force remained until 9 February when the Australians called down an airstrike upon the position and the defenders withdrew from the feature. One of the Australians, Private Colin Jorgensen, was awarded the Military Medal for charging a Japanese weapon pit and knocking it out of action during the final assault.|$|E
500|$|A fifth Tiger halted on {{the main}} street short of the ambush site, {{apparently}} waiting for the British to emerge from cover. The Tiger was spotted by the Firefly crew {{through the windows of}} a corner building. They reversed to shoot through the windows. The Tiger was hit on the gun mantlet and raced past the side street. A Cromwell advanced onto the main street and fired into the rear of the Tiger, knocking it out and then reversed back into cover. The Firefly knocked out a Panzer IV and during a lull, the disabled tanks were set on fire with blankets and petrol. Outside the town, the 7th Armoured Division brigade group stretched back to Amayé-sur-Seulles and was attacked from the north and south. The attacks were repulsed and [...] at Tracey-Bocage, the 11th Hussars overwhelmed a <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{years of}} 1933 and 1934 were spent in hard {{mountain}} warfare {{in the last}} bastions of Moroccan resistance in the High Atlas and Anti-Atlas mountain ranges. [...] Huré himself took personal command of the siege of the [...] mountain fortress of Bu Gafer in February and March 1933, where he fought alongside General Henri Giraud, in a costly battle that caused the deaths of hundreds of French troops and up to 2,300 Moroccans. [...] In July Huré led another campaign in the Dadès Gorges, laying a new road as he went and utilising his engineering knowledge to procure dozens of truck-powered pneumatic drills for his sappers. [...] By {{the end of the}} month this region too was pacified leaving the last <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> at Mount Baddou, a [...] peak home to 2,000-3,000 Berber tribesmen. [...] Huré again led directly, commanding a two-week complete siege that successfully forced the tribesmen and their families to surrender, they were treated well and given food and supplies and allowed to return to their homes. [...] There were further minor skirmishes in the Anti-Atlas in the winter of 1933/4 but by March 1934 Huré had pacified the remainder of the country and brought to an end almost 30 years of continuous French military involvement in Morocco.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defense of}} Wizna against {{overwhelming}} odds lasted for three days.

At noon on the third day, the German commander, Heinz Guderian, threatened that all Polish POWs would be shot if {{the defense of the}} bunker did not cease.

2500|$|In March 1945 the British Fourteenth Army's Indian 19th Infantry Division {{under the}} command of Major-General Thomas Wynford 'Pete' Rees, dubbed the 'Pocket Napoleon' by his men on account of his size and {{successful}} military career, was closing in on the Japanese in Mandalay where resistance was based mainly at Mandalay Hill with its pagodas and temples honeycombed for machine-guns, well supplied and heavily garrisoned. Fort Dufferin or the walled city with the royal palace was another <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> by the remaining Japanese troops. A Gurkha battalion stormed up the hill engaging in fierce hand-to-hand fighting all day and night on the 9th of March, and they were joined the next day by two companies of a British battalion.|$|E
