40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>units</b> {{provide a}} method of {{automatically}} learning the higher-order input combinations required for the efficient synthesis of Boolean logic functions by neural networks. <b>Product</b> <b>units</b> also have a higher information capacity than sigmoidal networks. However, this activation function has not received much attention in the literature. A possible {{reason for this is}} that one encounters some problems when using standard backpropagation to train networks containing these units. This report examines these problems, and evaluates the performance of three training algorithms on networks of this type. Empirical results indicate that the error surface of networks containing <b>product</b> <b>units</b> have more local minima than corresponding networks with summation units. For this reason, a combination of local and global training algorithms were found to provide the most reliable convergence. We then investigate how `hints' can be added to the training algorithm. By extracting a common frequency from the input weights, and training this frequency separately, we show that convergence can be accelerated. A constructive algorithm is then introduced which adds <b>product</b> <b>units</b> to a network as required by the problem. Simulations show that for the same problems this method creates a network with significantly less neurons than those constructed by the tiling and upstart algorithms. In order to compare their performance with other transfer functions, <b>product</b> <b>units</b> were implemented as candidate units in the Cascade Correlation (CC) Fahlman 90 system. Using these candidate units resulted in smaller networks which trained faster than when the any of the standard (three sigmoidal types and one Gaussian) transfer functions were used. This superiority was confirmed when a pool of candidate units of four different nonlinear activation functions were used, which have to compete for addition to the network. Extensive simulations showed that for the problem of implementing random Boolean logic functions, <b>product</b> <b>units</b> are always chosen above any of the other transfer functions.

Typically a lead programmer will oversee a development team of between two and ten programmers, with three to five often considered the ideal size. Teams larger than ten programmers tend to become unmanageable without additional structure.

50|$|In business, the {{practice}} of setting {{the price of a}} product to equal the extra cost of producing an extra unit of output. By this policy, a producer charges, for each <b>product</b> <b>unit</b> sold, only the addition to total cost resulting from materials and direct labor. Businesses often set prices close to marginal cost during periods of poor sales. If, for example, an item has a marginal cost of $1.00 and a normal selling price is $2.00, the firm selling the item might wish to lower the price to $1.10 if demand has waned. The business would choose this approach because the incremental profit of 10 cents from the transaction is better than no sale at all.|$|E
