40|$|This study {{investigated}} visual search performance for <b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> symbols on a Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI). Of primary interest was {{the influence of}} target brightness (intensity) and highlighting validity (search directions) {{on the ability to}} detect a <b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> among distractor <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Target</b> <b>aircraft</b> were distinguished by an airspace course that conflicted with Ownship (that is, the participant's aircraft). The display could present all (homogeneous) bright aircraft, all (homogeneous) dim aircraft, or mixed bright and dim <b>aircraft,</b> with the <b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> being either bright or dim. In the mixed intensity condition, participants {{may or may not have}} been instructed whether the target was bright or dim. Results indicated that highlighting validity facilitated better detection times. However, instead of bright targets being detected faster, dim targets were found to be detected more slowly in the mixed intensity display than in the homogeneous display. This relative slowness may be due to a delay in confirming the dim aircraft to be a target when it it was among brighter distractor aircraft. This hypothesis will be tested in future research.

40|$|Prospective memory {{refers to}} remembering {{to perform an}} {{intended}} action in the future. Failures of prospective memory can occur in air traffic control. In two experiments, we examined the utility of external aids for facilitating air traffic management in a simulated air traffic control task with prospective memory requirements. Participants accepted and handed-off aircraft and detected aircraft conflicts. The prospective memory task involved remembering to deviate from a routine operating procedure when accepting <b>target</b> <b>aircraft.</b> External aids that contained details of the prospective memory task appeared and flashed when <b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> needed acceptance. In Experiment 1, external aids presented either adjacent or nonadjacent {{to each of the}} 20 <b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> presented over the 40 -min test phase reduced prospective memory error by 11 % compared with a condition without external aids. In Experiment 2, only a single <b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> was presented a significant time (39 - 42 min) after presentation of the prospective memory instruction, and the external aids reduced prospective memory error by 34 %. In both experiments, costs to the efficiency of nonprospective memory air traffic management (nontarget aircraft acceptance response time, conflict detection response time) were reduced by nonadjacent aids compared with no aids or adjacent aids. In contrast, in both experiments, the efficiency of the prospective memory air traffic management (<b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> acceptance response time) was facilitated by adjacent aids compared with nonadjacent aids. Together, these findings have potential implications for the design of automated alerting systems to maximize multitask performance in work settings where operators monitor and control demanding perceptual displays...|$|R

40|$|The active target defense {{differential}} game {{is addressed}} in this paper. In this differential game an Attacker missile pursues a <b>Target</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The aircraft is however aided by a Defender missile launched by, say, the wingman, to intercept the Attacker before it reaches the <b>Target</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Thus, a team is formed by the Target and the Defender which cooperate to maximize the separation between the <b>Target</b> <b>aircraft</b> and {{the point where the}} Attacker missile is intercepted by the Defender missile, while the Attacker simultaneously tries to minimize said distance. This paper focuses on characterizing the set of coordinates such that if the Target's initial position belong to this set then its survival is guaranteed if both the Target and the Defender follow their optimal strategies. Such optimal strategies are presented in this paper as well. Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1502. 0274...|$|R

5000|$|After World War I, three Standard E-1s were {{converted}} to drones. [...] The Larynx was an early cruise missile {{in the form of}} a small monoplane aircraft that could be launched from a warship and flown under autopilot; it was tested between 1927 and 1929 by the Royal Navy. The early successes of pilotless aircraft led to the development of radio controlled <b>pilotless</b> <b>target</b> <b>aircraft</b> in Britain and the US in the 1930s. In 1931, the British developed the Fairey Queen radio-controlled target from the Fairey IIIF floatplane, building a small batch of three, and in 1935 followed up this experiment by producing larger numbers of another RC target, the [...] "DH.82B Queen Bee", derived from the De Havilland Tiger Moth biplane trainer. The name of [...] "Queen Bee" [...] is said to have led to the use of the term [...] "drone" [...] for pilotless aircraft, particularly when they are radio-controlled. During this period, the U.S. Navy, continuing work that reached back to 1917, was also experimenting with radio-controlled aircraft.
