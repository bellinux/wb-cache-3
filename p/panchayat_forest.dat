40|$|Van Panchayats {{were formed}} under the <b>Panchayat</b> <b>Forest</b> Rules, 1931 and {{have since been}} {{incorporated}} under section 28 (2) of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The stated objectives of Van Panchayats were to protect and develop the forest and to distribute its produce among stakeholders in an equitable manner. The rules, on the one hand, make Van Panchayats responsible for proper management of the forests; on the other hand, they deny Van Panchayats the necessary authority and financial autonomy, which continues to be vested with revenue and forest officials. Over a period of 80 years (1931 - 2001), a gradual decline in the overall authority of Van Panchayat has taken place. The responsible factors in erosion of Van Panchayat include policy bottlenecks, over-representation and little accountability of the Forest Department, diversity of community institutions, impact of Joint Forest Management on village communities, shift in the locus of decision-making outside the village and increased conflicts. This paper discusses these factors in detail...|$|E

40|$|Nepal {{is one of}} the world’s richest {{biodiversity}} hotspots with varied climate, {{geography and}} ecosystems. The majority of people in Nepal’s hills and mountains still depend heavily on forest resources for their livelihood and wellbeing. However, since the breakdown of the traditional system of forest management and the nationalization of forests in the mid 1950 s, Nepal's forests had undergone severe degradation and deforestation. In addition, political instability, illegal clearing, expansion of agricultural land and resettlement policy were also responsible for degradation. The deforestation was so rapid that between the period of 1964 and 1975, 2. 3 million hectares of forests were lost and the livelihoods of people in the hills and mountains of Nepal {{were on the verge of}} collapse. Since the popularization of the theory of Himalayan Environmental Degradation and realization on the part of government of the urgency of restoring and improving the condition of Nepal's forests, a number of conservation projects were launched. In 1978, the government of Nepal initiated the community forestry program through the enactment of the <b>Panchayat</b> <b>Forest</b> and Panchayat Protected Forest Rules. These were further strengthened by the endorsement of the 1989 Master Plan for the Forestry Sector (MPFS) and enactment of the 1993 Forest Act and 1995 Forest Regulation. The community-based forest co-management initiatives in Nepal transferred forest management authority to local community user groups. However, since the onset of the Maoist insurgency in 1996 and subsequent armed conflicts over the next decade, the community forestry program in Nepal was under threat. It was not known what happened to the community-based forest co-management arrangements during the period of insurgency due to restricted access to the countryside. Through a comparative case studies of three Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) with three different conflict settings (the first controlled by neither of the contending parties, the second under the control of security forces and the third under the control of the Maoists) in Kavrepalanchok district in the Middle Hills region of Nepal, this research investigates the effectiveness of CBFCM in strengthening local forest governance processes and outcomes. It focuses particularly on equity in access and benefit sharing, the participation of different socio-economic strata in forest governance, and the provision of environmental services within these communities during pre/early and late conflict periods. This research shows that the community forestry program has provided a significant space to local communities for collective action that enabled them to reverse the trend of forest degradation, improving the environmental condition of the forests and the supply of forest products. Over time, the community forest program has been successful in gradually building the capacity of CFUG institutions and has increased the involvement of women and other marginalized sections of the community. Through the expanded networks among CFUGs and with the assistance of outside organizations, these communities have now attained considerable influence in national forest policy formulation. This study confirms that although the governing mechanisms of state agencies, including the Department of Forests (DoF), became dysfunctional during the period of armed insurgency, governance structures of the local CFUGs in the case study villages were largely stable and most forest management activities were carried out during the period of armed conflict. The CFUGs have survived as vibrant self-governing institutions and have maintained reasonable access to forest resources to satisfy the subsistence needs of local people within the community. These findings suggest that community-based forest governing institutions had the bargaining capacity and ability to overcome the pressures arising from the armed conflict because of the resilience and adaptive capacities of the CFUGs.

5000|$|An [...] "Important Common Forest" [...] in India is a {{specific}} term which refers to forests governed by local communities in a way compatible with sustainable development, and can be of various types. Such forests are typically called village <b>forests</b> or <b>panchayat</b> <b>forests,</b> reflecting {{the fact that the}} administration and resource utilization of the forest occurs at the village and panchayat (an elected rural body) levels. Hamlets, villages and communities of villages may actually administer such a forest. Such community forests are usually administered by a locally elected body, usually called the Forest Protection Committee, Village Forest Committee or the Village Forest Institution. Such committees are known as Van Panchayats in the Kumaon Division of Uttarakhand, Forest Co-operative Societies in Himachal Pradesh and Van Samrakshan Samitis in Andhra Pradesh. Legislation pertaining to communal forests vary from state to state, but typically the state government retains some administrative control over matters like staff appointment, and penalization of offenders. Such forests typically conform to the IUCN Category VI Protected Areas, but protection may be enforced by the local communities or the government depending on local legislation.Maharashtra is the state with the most forest land while Haryana has the least.|$|R

40|$|Many {{developing}} nations {{around the world}} have been promoting decentralization of natural resource management with the hope that by providing secure tenure to resource use, people dependent on the natural resources for livelihood will seek to conserve them. Forests managed by communities are not only contributed to overall improvement in forest conditions but has also resulted in positive impacts on biodiversity conservation. The environmental services provided by community forests are reducing soil erosion and increased water supply from forest springs. The present study indicates the significance of community forests and advocates that if the forests are managed properly with the involvement of the local community these forests can play a role model in conserving biodiversity. If payment for carbon credit is made to these Van Panchayats, added benefits may provide communities relying on the forests incentive to stop deforestation and opt for long term benefits that are more sustainable in mitigating climate change.

40|$|Summary. — Building and {{nurturing}} institutions are most challenging tasks in any development work. In this paper an attempt {{has been made}} to understand {{the rise and fall of}} institutions involved in the management of forest resources. This has been done through comparative case studies of Van (<b>Forest)</b> <b>Panchayats</b> of Uttaranchal and Forest Protection Committees of West Bengal in India. As has been documented, Van Panchayats have been created as a response to the peoples movement against forest reservation at the beginning of the 20 th century. The concept of Forest Protection Committees under Joint Forest Management in India has recently emerged in response to the severe degradation of forest resources and the persistent conflicts and movements against the State. The paper goes on to explain the evolution, management systems and effectiveness of these institutions along with the issues they are confronted with in the management and protection of forest resources...|$|R
40|$|Under what {{conditions}} can one {{expect to see}} a sustained system of community management of forests in operation? Considerable theoretical scepticism has been expressed by economists and others about the viability of any such institution. In this view, such institutions will inevitably result in a 2 ̆ 2 tragedy of the commons. 2 ̆ 2 However, evidence from around the world has accumulated in recent years which suggests that common property institutions do exist, and in some cases, have existed for a long time. ^ Using archival sources in India and the U. K., this thesis explores the fate of community management of forests in a region of the central Himalayas known as Kumaun. Kumaun was under British administration over the period 1815 - 1949. The forests of the region were not under formal state management till the 1860 s. In fact, there is evidence of customary cooperative arrangements [...] informal local institutions [...] before the arbitrary takeover of forests by the new administrators. The new property regime had a disruptive effect on local institutions and precipitated much deforestation, especially since the state did not have the logistical wherewithal to enforce the new forest rules at a time when local arrangements had lost credibility. ^ Two schools of thought emerged within the state bureaucracy to address the emerging crisis of rapidly diminishing forests. The 2 ̆ 2 centralizers 2 ̆ 2 argued for more effective supervision and an increase in state power {{in order to protect the}} forests. The 2 ̆ 2 devolutionists, 2 ̆ 2 by contrast, canvassed for decentralized management by user communities. Several decades of experimentation with centralized methods failed to protect forests effectively and caused much political protest. The government ultimately had to resurrect local institutions in the 1920 s. In the beginning this was a failure, since community management had lost all credibility in the eyes of local users. However, persistent efforts by government officers finally paid off and the new system of van <b>panchayats</b> (village <b>forest</b> councils) finally solved a problem which the state, on its own, could not. ...|$|R
