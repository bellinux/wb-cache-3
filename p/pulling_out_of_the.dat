5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country; this ultimately lead {{to the rise of}} Al-Qaeda.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting both the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he was <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E
5|$|Transport Scotland {{announced}} in June 2010 that three consortiums that had submitted expressions {{of interest in}} the project were to be invited to participate in a competitive dialogue; these were BAM UK, IMCD (Sir Robert McAlpine, Iridium Concesiones de Infraestructuras and Carillion) and New Borders Railway (Fluor, Miller and Uberior Infrastructure Investments). In mid-November 2010, the withdrawal of Fluor resulted in the third consortium <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bidding process. The second consortium withdrew in June 2011 following the decision by Carillion not to continue. This led to the cancellation of the tender procedure by Scottish transport minister Keith Brown. Network Rail was chosen by Transport Scotland to undertake the project and, following months of negotiations, a Transfer of Responsibility was signed at a ceremony held on 6 November 2012 at the Scottish Mining Museum in Newtongrange. Network Rail agreed to build the line by mid-2015 for £294 million, an increase on the estimated £230 million that the line was expected to cost and the £100 million that it was originally costed at in 2000. This figure is also substantially more than the £189 million which Network Rail Chief Executive Iain Coucher agreed to build the line in late 2007 or early 2008.|$|E
