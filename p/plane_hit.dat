5|$|Mississippi {{remained}} off Leyte, providing gunfire support until 16 November, {{when she}} withdrew to the Admiralty Islands to make {{preparations for the}} next operation. On 28 December, she returned to Leyte, anchoring in San Pedro Bay. The ship began shelling Japanese positions {{on the island of}} Luzon on 6 January 1945. During the bombardment, a Japanese kamikaze struck the ship, but she remained on station, bombarding the Japanese defenses, until 10 February, when she withdrew to Pearl Harbor for repairs. She returned to service in time to join the invasion fleet that attacked Okinawa, arriving off Nakagusuku Wan on 6 May. She shelled Shuri Castle, inflicting heavy damage on a major strongpoint in the Japanese defensive line. Another kamikaze (initially identified as a friendly <b>plane)</b> <b>hit</b> the ship on 5 June, but she remained in action off Okinawa until 16 June. After the Japanese government announced it would surrender, Mississippi steamed to Sagami Wan, Honshū, as part of the occupation force, arriving there on 27 August. She was present during the signing of the surrender documents on 2 September in Tokyo Bay. Four days later, she left Japanese waters, bound for the United States. She reached Norfolk on 27 November.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 2015, a USMC F/A-18 Hornet {{crashed in}} Cambridgeshire, UK. The crash {{occurred}} just before 10:30 BST (5:30 EDT); {{the cause is}} an unknown.

25|$|On {{approach}} to the Banda Aceh airport, a heavy cargo <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> a water buffalo which had strayed onto the runway on 4 January 2005. The {{left side of the}} plane's undercarriage collapsed, making the plane un-movable blocking the runway for a big part of that day, except for helicopters, until some specialists came from Singapore to put a temporary support under that part of the plane, and men moved the plane off the runway.|$|E
25|$|As {{investigators}} {{arrived at}} the crash site, they suspected that the plane bounced twice before exploded and burned. According to reports, the <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> a tree {{on the other side}} of the mountain, as there were broken tree branches found in the area. The plane caught fire and slammed into the top of the mountain, killing all on board. Investigators also created the chronology of the discovery of the wreckage and explained how the plane crashed with drone footage.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a lengthy}} {{recording}} hiatus, An Evening with Harry Belafonte and Friends, a soundtrack and {{video of a}} televised concert, were released in 1997 by Island Records. , a huge multi-artist project recorded by RCA during the 1960s and 1970s, was finally released by the label in 2001. Belafonte went on the Today Show to promote the album on September 11, 2001, and was interviewed by Katie Couric just minutes before the first <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> the World Trade Center. The album was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Boxed Recording Package, for Best Album Notes, and for Best Historical Album.|$|E

25|$|The {{airplane}} {{landed at}} 8:42a.m. in Port Stanley, {{behind the house}} occupied by Governor Sir Cosmo Dugal Patrick Thomas Haskard, who was away from the island. The pilot attempted to land at the racecourse but the <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> telegraph poles, and the undercarriage sank into the mud. Islanders, assuming that the plane was in trouble, rushed to assist but found themselves taken hostage by the hijackers (included {{in the group of}} four was a young police sergeant, Terry Peck, who became a local hero in the Falklands War). The Argentines exited the airplane by rope and formed themselves in front of the craft {{in the form of a}} fan: They hoisted seven Argentine flags. They then sang the Argentine national anthem, attempting at first to turn authority over the island to Guzmán, who refused the offer.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2001, {{the station}} was shut down by the Port Authority after the first {{airplane}} hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. In the minutes after the first <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> at 8:46am, three PATH trains were pulling into the station. One was arriving from Newark and two others from Hoboken. The first Hoboken train turned around without stopping, not letting off passengers or opening any doors. The second Hoboken train arrived on track 3 at 8:52 a.m., was ordered to be evacuated, employees included. This train never left the World Trade Center complex and was found later in 2001 during the long recovery process. The train from Newark that came into the terminal at 8:55 a.m. stopped only to pick up passengers. An empty train {{was sent to the}} station at 9:10 a.m. to pick up a dozen PATH employees and a homeless individual, leaving the station empty.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the Ground Proximity Warning System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the approach end of runway 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|E

500|$|The Pentagon was {{severely}} {{damaged by the}} impact of American Airlines Flight 77 and ensuing fires, causing {{one section of the}} building to collapse. As the airplane approached the Pentagon, its wings knocked down light poles and its right engine hit a power generator before crashing into the western side of the building. The <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> the Pentagon at the first-floor level. The front part of the fuselage disintegrated on impact, while the mid and tail sections kept moving for another fraction of a second.

Hani Hanjour advanced the throttles to maximum power and dived toward the Pentagon. While level above the ground and seconds from the crash, the wings knocked over five street lampposts and the right wing struck a portable generator, creating a smoke trail seconds before smashing into the Pentagon. Flight77, flying at 530mph (853km/h, 237m/s, or 460 knots) over the Navy Annex Building adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, crashed into the western side of the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just south of Washington, D.C., at 09:37:46. The <b>plane</b> <b>hit</b> the Pentagon at the first-floor level, and at the moment of impact, the airplane was rolled slightly to the left, with the right wing elevated. The front part of the fuselage disintegrated on impact, while the mid and tail sections moved for another fraction of a second, with tail section debris penetrating furthest into the building. In all, the airplane took eight-tenths of a second to fully penetrate [...] into the three outermost of the building's five rings and unleashed a fireball that rose [...] above the building.|$|E

That night they camped in the bush waiting for a response to their distress call. The crash site was seen by a passing airliner that reported no survivors, and the news of Hemingway's death was telegraphed around the world. [...] The next day they were found and picked up by a bush pilot, but his de Havilland caught fire during take-off, crashed and exploded, which left Hemingway with a concussion, scalp wound, double-vision, intermittent hearing in his left ear, a crushed vertebra, ruptured liver, spleen and kidney, and burns.
