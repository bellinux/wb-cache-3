In the article, the necessity of management system formation to control the development of power sector has been proved. The deficiencies of the modern investment procedure in power companies are described. The absence of continuity between the regional and local strategic planning documents and investment planning of a power company has been found out. The possibility to develop a new mechanism for attracting investment has been proposed. The regulation of joint activities to implement the development program for the regional <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>industry</b> has been proposed. The management system to develop the Russian power industry has been proposed. The comparative analysis of generating capacity development mechanisms has been carried out, such as capacity supply agreement (CSA), investment support mechanism (ISM), and long-term power market (LPM). The interaction procedure of the planning of the power supply infrastructure development has been described. The mechanism connecting the state sectoral and regional planning and corporate planning of power supply infrastructure development has been proposed.

40|$|This paper studies energy {{conversion}} technology adoption in the electricity supply sector {{from the perspective}} of irreversible investments under uncertainty, and with a particular interest in environmental sustainability. We develop a dynamic technology adoption model that is firmly rooted in economic theory and that takes important determinants of optimal investment in available technologies (e. g. life-cycle capital and operation cost) explicitly into account. Uncertainty is introduced for the demand for peak-load capacity, unit generation costs, and for the average electricity price. We test the model empirically by applying it to data for the Turkish <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>industry.</b> The model-guided optimal investment results based on net present value considerations exhibit significant deviations from the actual investment outcome. We find that the increased adoption of natural-gas-fired power generation technologies in Turkey in recent years, while contributing to environmental sustainability, has had doubtful merits from an investor’s perspective.

30|$|At the {{distribution}} level, {{it is clear}} that users, from households to hospitals, have very different requirements with respect to the quality, stability and reliability of their electricity supply. This probably means that in addition to the pumped-hydro or compressed air plants capable of delivering significant power levels over long enough time periods to ensure continuity of supply, {{the distribution}} grid will also have to incorporate low energy, high discharge rate systems, such as BES, FBES, FES and SMES (see Fig.  3) to guarantee quality. Unfortunately, all of these technologies are intrinsically generators of DC power on discharge. While this may have represented a problem in the past for the AC grid system, recent technology advances in the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>industries,</b> based on modern power electronics converters, can provide an answer to this mismatch. Developments in flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) aim to provide robust grid control at times of complex operational demand, usually associated with random external disturbances or fluctuations [22]. FACTS are multi-megawatt proven power electronic devices which are being introduced at the present time into the electricity supply networks. Rather than following conventional practice and switching to stand-by, or base load, fossil fuel powered generators in this power interruption scenario, FACTS enable the maintenance of stability on the grid by permitting storage techniques based on DC devices, such as SMES, FES, BES and CES to be incorporated into grid control systems. Thus by employing storage in conjunction with voltage source converters, it is possible to effectively negate or damp oscillations caused by sudden changes in load conditions [22].|$|R

This is why the Federal Government has accelerated efforts to resolve the Niger Delta crisis. The gas industry is relatively new in Nigeria but a network of gas pipelines is being developed to transport gas both to power plants, local domestic consumption and for export. All these gas lines require mapping at various stages of their development. For instance in order to plan, design and construct the pipelines, it require Right of Way surveys, alignment sheets, Population Density, maps of crossing and other types of maps. All these maps have to be produced to meet the requirements and demand of both the EPC Contractor and the Client. They are also needed to secure Pipeline License from Government.

30|$|In general {{electrical}} engineering practice {{outside of the}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>industry,</b> this deliberate need for predictive balancing {{of supply and demand}} is actually not an issue. For example, any standalone complex electronic device, such a mobile phone, laptop computer or electric car, is a small but self-contained power system. It exhibits varying power demand from a multiplicity of electrical circuits and components which are influenced by changing operational modes, while the electrical supply comes from an energy storage device (usually a battery). Obviously, but significantly, this energy source delivers power only when it is needed. Thus supply and demand are automatically balanced. If the battery is rechargeable, which it usually is, then balanced demand/supply is maintained as long as the battery contains sufficient charge. Importantly, it does not matter how erratic or intermittent the charging process is as long as on average over a defined time period, the charging power supplied to the battery is equal to or greater than the power demanded over the same interval, by the electrical circuits of the device in question.|$|E

The <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>industry</b> of South Africa is {{currently}} {{engaged in the}} process of restructuring, in a move from traditional vertically integrated and regulated structures to the unbundled, deregulated marketing of electric energy and power. Since this is a new process for South Africa, the investigation was commissioned with the aim of introducing this new area of research, to get an international perspective on the topic, and to build up a theoretical background for further studies. In this new deregulated environment, the transmission segment of the supply industry is seen as an independent business, which can provide services at the appropriate terms and conditions. A transmission utility offers services at costs that can be evaluated by various methods. In this context, the thesis has three objectives. The first objective of the thesis is to consider different types of transmission services and costs associated with these services.

Partial discharge (PD) measurement {{has been used for}} insulation assessment for many years. It has been arguably {{recognized as one of the}} most effective diagnosis tool for insulation condition monitoring. However, on site partial discharge measurement is often affected by excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI). This makes it very difficult to interpret data for insulation assessment purpose. The differential circuit was adopted by <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>industry</b> to reject common mode interference a long time ago. However for on site partial discharge measurement, the differential circuit is still very hard to implement for reliable operation. In practice, it would be difficult to find two sensors with matching electrical characteristics so that they can be used to cancel the common mode interference. To solve this problem, a software-based approach for implementing the differential detection has been developed by authors. Interference and true partial discharge signal could be distinguished by analyzing their polarities and the correlation coefficients. The viability of this new approach will be verified by laboratory experiments.
