On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was <b>private</b> <b>information</b> on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E

However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the communicative experiences of surrogates {{who served as}} decision makers for patients who were unable to convey health information and choices about treatment options. Drawing on assumptions from communication privacy management theory (Petronio, 2002), 35 surrogates were interviewed to explore how they navigated the role of guardian of patients’ <b>private</b> health <b>information</b> while the patient was hospitalized. This research determined that not only are surrogates guardians and thereby co-owners of the patients’ <b>private</b> health <b>information,</b> they actually served in a “proxy ownership” role. Surrogates described obstacles to both obtaining and sharing <b>private</b> health <b>information</b> about the patient, suggesting that their rights as legitimate co-owners of the patients’ information were not fully acknowledged by the medical teams. Surrogates also described challenges in performing the proxy ownership role {{when they were not}} fully aware of the patient’s wishes. Theoretical and practical implications of these challenges are discussed...|$|R

25|$|IT security: Sometimes {{referred}} to as computer security, information technology security (IT security) is information security applied to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that a computer {{does not necessarily mean}} a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach into critical <b>private</b> <b>information</b> or gain control of the internal systems.|$|E

One such investigation, led by James Randi, concerned faith healer Peter Popoff, who used a hearing transmitter {{to give the impression that}} he was psychic and hearing <b>private</b> <b>information</b> from God.

Despite this high volume of traffic, very {{little has been}} done to protect the millions of users who log on to Facebook and other social media platforms each month. President Barack Obama tried to work with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to attempt to regulate data mining. He proposed the Privacy Bill of Rights, which would protect the average user from having their <b>private</b> <b>information</b> downloaded and shared with third party companies.

25|$|Cases {{like these}} have created some privacy {{implications}} {{as to whether}} or not companies should have the right to look at employees' social network profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share <b>private</b> <b>information</b> and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{however, the}} {{potential}} for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online “e-tailer” or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive <b>private</b> <b>information</b> from online “e-tailers” actually comes from an attack placed upon the site’s servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these “e-tailers” are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers’ havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only apply to the actual transfer of a customer’s data. However, with this being said, most “e-tailers” have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information’s abuse can be tracked back to the site’s servers.|$|E
