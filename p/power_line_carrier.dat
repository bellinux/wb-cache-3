50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>line</b> <b>carrier</b> {{communication}} (PLCC) {{technology has}} been frequently used since 1950 by the grid stations to transmit information at high speed. Transmitting information along high-voltage lines, at high frequency, {{has been one of}} the main means of communication in electric power for over fifty years. This technology is finding wide use in building and home automation, as it avoids the need for extra wiring. The data collected from different sensors is transmitted on power lines thereby reducing the maintenance cost of the additional wiring. In some countries, this technology is also used to provide Internet connection. In order to communicate, high-frequency line traps are used as they allow substations to communicate with each other through the power lines at the same time as they transmit electrical power. In order to separate power from messages being sent, different frequencies are used. Electrical power has a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz in most places, and the communication waves use frequencies such as 150 kHz and 200 kHz. Line traps consist of filter circuits that allow only power frequency waves to travel to that of electrical equipment. They also stop communication waves from traveling to equipment.|$|E

40|$|A seamless, {{sustainable}} {{and reliable}} communication infrastructure {{is crucial to}} realise smart grid operations and functionalities. The communications infrastructure in smart grid is not only required to be pervasive, scalable, and secure but also expected to be resilient and guarantee a required Quality of Service (QoS) to an end node. Narrow band <b>power</b> <b>line</b> communications (NBPLC) {{is believed to be}} a natural and cost effective choice for smart grid communication because it uses the existing infrastructures of the power grid that is much more extensive and pervasive than any other wired or wireless alternatives. This also eliminates the need for additional wire installation and external subscription for data transfer. However, because most smart grid applications have critical timing requirements, the frequency and time varying characteristics of the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> channel together with its background noise, limited band width and harmonic interference results in unacceptable packet loss during service transmission. Communication solution with Reliable, timely delivery which supports a given QoS for smart grid applications with critical timing requirements will although challenging is highly desirable.

Ungulates that range over large areas are likely to encounter <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> but a synthesis of <b>power</b> <b>line</b> effects on ungulates is lacking. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) are suspected to avoid <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> up to distances of 4 km. In contrast, some forest ungulates preferentially forage in <b>power</b> <b>line</b> rights-of-way, cleared areas under <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> We reviewed the factors that possibly influence avoidance and attraction effects of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> on ungulates, construct a conceptual framework, and make {{suggestions on how to}} mitigate avoidance effects through <b>power</b> <b>line</b> routing and rights-of-way management. <b>Power</b> <b>line</b> construction, noise and electromagnetic fields are possible sources of disturbance, while rights-of-way management influences habitat use under <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Disturbance and altered habitat use can induce barrier and corridor effects, thereby influencing connectivity. Species-specific effects influence behavioural disturbance and habitat use. We found little evidence for behavioural disturbance of reindeer or forest ungulates under <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Forest ungulates could benefit from browsing in <b>power</b> <b>line</b> rights-of-way if they are managed to provide abundant and preferred forage as well as sufficient cover. However, <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> may facilitate access for hunters and predators. As a precaution, construction of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> should be avoided in calving areas.
