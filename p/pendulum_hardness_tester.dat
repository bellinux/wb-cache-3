40|$|Abstract A new {{approach}} to portable <b>hardness</b> <b>testers</b> has been developed and introduced. It {{makes it possible to}} inspect hardness by one and the same <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> applying both, the ultrasonic contact impedance method and rebound method. <b>Hardness</b> <b>tester</b> wide possibilities which allow to inspect hardness of metal and alloy products with all standardized scales (Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers and Shore) have been demonstrated. The possibility to improve the precision of portable <b>hardness</b> <b>testers</b> of this type by calibrating them for each of the above listed scales with hardness reference blocks only without any conversion tables has been shown. Experiments and real measurements conducted on cold rolls showed that change in hardness of a hardened layer in depth and surface stresses influence can be disclosed in the process of hardness measurement by portable combined <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> by two different methods...|$|R

50|$|Tablets need to {{be strong}} enough to resist the {{stresses}} of packaging, shipping and handling by the pharmacist and patient. The mechanical strength of tablets is assessed using a combination of (i) simple failure and erosion tests, and (ii) more sophisticated engineering tests. The simpler tests are often used for quality control purposes, whereas the more complex tests are used during the design of the formulation and manufacturing process in the research and development phase. Standards for tablet properties are published in the various international pharmacopeias (USP/NF, EP, JP, etc.). The hardness of tablets is the principle measure of mechanical strength. Hardness is tested using a tablet <b>hardness</b> <b>tester.</b> The units for hardness have evolved since the 1930s, but are commonly measured in kilograms per square centimeter. Models of tester include the Monsanto (or Stokes) <b>Hardness</b> <b>Tester</b> from 1930, the Pfizer <b>Hardness</b> <b>Tester</b> from 1950, the Strong Cob <b>Hardness</b> <b>Tester</b> and the Heberlain (or Schleeniger) <b>Hardness</b> <b>Tester.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} the tribological properties of magnet-structural materials at cryogenic temperatures, the authors require the hardness {{value of the materials}} at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, a low-temperature Vickers-type <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> has been developed. The <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> consists of the driving device of the indenter, load control system, specimen transfer device and cooling system. The measured hardiness for eight materials were equivalent to those obtained by a conventional Vickers micro-hardness tester at room temperature which means that the developed <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> has sufficient performance as <b>hardness</b> <b>tester.</b> The temperature dependence of the hardness was obtained between 77 K and 293 K for stainless steels of JN 1, JN 2 and SUS 316 L, Ti-alloy and Copper. It was found that the hardness increased with decreasing temperature, where the hardness at 77 K is three times the hardness at 293 K for stainless steels, and is twice for copper. The relationships between the increase of hardness and the reciprocal of temperature were expressed in Arrhenius equations. The relationships between hardness and yield stress or tensile strength were examined. The hardness is more than three times greater than yield stress or tensile strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} {{and characteristics of}} the surface layer of forging dies are critical for understanding and controlling wear. However, the surface layer is very thin, and appropriate property measurements are difficult. The objective {{of the present study}} is to determine if nano hardness testing provides a reliable means of measuring the surface hardness in forging die steels. Two hot die steels (FX and H 13) were used in the investigation. These steels were heat treated for various times to produce specimens with different values of hardness. The heat-treated specimens were tested using three different hardness instruments [...] a Rockwell <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> for macro <b>hardness,</b> a Vickers <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> for micro <b>hardness</b> and a nano <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> for nano scale evaluation of hardness. The results {{of this study indicate that}} nano hardness values obtained using a Nano Indenter XP Machine with a Berkovich indenter reliably correlate with Rockwell C macro hardness values and with Vickers HV micro hardness values. Consequently, nano hardness testing can provide reliable results for analyzing the surface layer of hot forging dies. 1...|$|R
