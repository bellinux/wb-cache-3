40|$|International audiencePlasticized {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC) is widely present in contemporary Art collections but its conservation condition is often considered as poor. The project aims to deepen {{the understanding of}} thermal degradation mechanisms of plasticized PVC objects and to recommend preservation conditions and restoration treatments. Our research was carried out on plasticized PVC films naturally aged (around 30 years old) and exhibiting surface exudates. Plasticizers such as 13 % di-iso-octylphthalte (DOP) and 15 % di-octyl azelate (DOZ) were identified by Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, both within the material and the exudates. Plasticizer migration and PVC degradation were studied during a cyclic thermal artificial aging (2 days 80 °C/ 1 day 25 °C at 65 % RH). PVC films were placed either in an open or a closed vessel, {{and whether or not}} submitted to a <b>preliminary</b> <b>cleaning</b> with a microfiber cloth. This study shows that all samples undergo a similar degradation process, which is significantly slowed in a closed packaging with respect to an open one, in agreement with previous studies[1]. Regardless of any packaging condition, no effect of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>cleaning</b> is evidenced. In an open packaging, a significant plasticizer loss is thus observed, since almost no plasticizer is detected in the samples after 15 weeks of thermal aging. This migration is accompanied by a α-relaxation temperature increase up to a value close to the one measured for unplasticized PVC, which is consistent with the absence of plasticizer at this stage. Dehydrochlorination is evidenced from with Infrared and UV-visible spectroscopies, in agreement with the PVC yellowing. No exudation phenomenon related to plasticizer migration is observed with the naked eye however dendritic structures attributed to the migration of hindered amine light stabilizers are detected by Atomic Force Microscopy. Future work is devoted to study the effect of the wrapping materials. Reference[1]Y. R. Shashoua, Polym. Degrad. Stab. 81 (2003) 29 - 3...|$|E

Approximately 6 tons of 239 Pu have been released into the environment as a result of 541 atmospheric weapon tests Nuclear Pu fallout has been studied in various environmental archives, such as sediments, soil and herbarium grass. Mid-latitude ice cores have been studied as well, on Mont Blanc, the Western Alps and on Belukha Glacier, Siberian Altai. We present a Pu record obtained by analyzing 52 discrete samples of an alpine firn/ice core from Colle Gnifetti (M. Rosa, 4450 m a. s. l.), dating from 1945 to 1991. The 239 Pu signal was recorded directly, without <b>preliminary</b> <b>cleaning</b> or preconcentration steps, using an high resolution inductively plasma mass spectrometer equipped with a desolvation system. The 239 Pu profile reflects the three main periods of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing: the earliest peak lasted from 1954 / 55 to 1958 and was caused by the first testing period reaching a maximum in 1958. Despite a temporary halt of testing in 1959 / 60, the Pu concentration decreased only by half with respect to the 1958 peak due to long atmospheric residence times. In 1961 / 62 Pu concentrations rapidly increased reaching a maximum in 1963. After the signing of the “Limited Test Ban Treaty” between USA and USSR in 1964, Pu deposition decreased very sharply reaching a minimum in 1967.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for rolling element bearings fault diagnosis which gives {{a complete and}} highly accurate identification of the faults present. It has two main stages: signals pretreatment, {{which is based on}} several signal analysis procedures, and diagnosis, which uses a pattern-recognition process. The first stage is principally based on linear time invariant autoregressive modelling. One of the main contributions of this investigation is the development of a pretreatment signal analysis procedure which subjects the signal to noise cleaning by singular spectrum analysis and then stationarisation by differencing. So the signal is transformed to bring it close to a stationary one, rather than complicating the model to bring it closer to the signal. This type of pre-treatment allows the use of a linear time invariant auto-regressive model and improves its performance when the original signals are non-stationary. This contribution {{is at the heart of}} the proposed method, and the high accuracy of the diagnosis is a result of this procedure. The methodology emphasizes the importance of <b>preliminary</b> noise <b>cleaning</b> and stationarisation. And it demonstrates that the information needed for fault identification is contained in the stationary part of the measured signal. The methodology is further validated using three different experimental setups, demonstrating very high accuracy for all of the applications. It is able to correctly classify nearly 100 percent of the faults with regard to their type and size. This high accuracy is the other important contribution of this methodology. Thus, this research suggests a highly accurate methodology for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis which is based on relatively simple procedures. This is also an advantage, as the simplicity of the individual processes ensures easy application and the possibility for automation of the entire process...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the study of {{specific}} solvent stream in baro membrane separation processes in the biochemical industry. The main indicators, which characterize baromembranes technology, are productivity and quality division. Performance of baromembrane separation is estimated by the specific output or specific solvent stream, which is equal to the permeate flow per unit working area of the membrane per unit of time, and also determines the speed of the process of baromembrane division. This parameter depends on the material of the membrane, the nature of the solutes and their concentrations in the solution, the operating pressure, temperature and hydrodynamic processes. The article analyzed the specific solvent flow, which mathematically described by the equation based on Darcy's Law. This law establishes proportional dependence on the driving force of the process, the concentration and type of membrane. For the research was used following technique. The initial stage was to <b>preliminary</b> <b>cleaning</b> of membranes from impurities, checking the integrity of individual units, launching in work mode for a time period of 18 hours.

Specific solvent stream decreases with increasing concentration. In ultrafiltration membranes the specific solvent stream is higher than in reverse osmosis membranes. This phenomenon depends on the type of membrane. When the pressure increases the flow of the solvent and performance of baromembrane separation of solutions increases too. Specific solvent stream are influenced by concentrating polarization, gelation and sedimentation, which are formed as a result of increasing pressure and adsorption on the membrane surface...|$|E

Laboratory scale studies to determine the effect of reflux time, HNO/sub 3 / concentration, and air sparge on chloride removal from APPR-type Darex dissolver product showed that an air sparge is definitely beneficial in chloride removal. <b>Preliminary</b> cyclic <b>cleaning</b> tests showed that boiling 25 % caustic solution was adequate for cleaning type F (20 micron) porous metal filter elements fouled in the absence of filter aid with siliceous sludge from Darex solvent extraction feed solutions. Sections of unirradiated stainless steel-clad UO/sub 2 /, sheared into lengths of 1 / 2 in., 1 in., 2 in., and 2 3 / 4 in., were leached free of UO/sub 2 / with 10 M HNO/sub 3 / in 30, 45, 60, and 75 min, respectively. The abrasive blade cost for the removal of inert end adapters from selected reactor assemblies ranges from 12 for the Gas-Cooled Reactor to 19 for Consolidated Edison. A zirconium dissolution was carried to completion at 600 ction prod- C in a NaF-LiF salt mixture containing initially 23 mol per cent ZrF/sub 4 / at an average rate of 1. 3 mg/(cm/sup 2 /) (min) with an HF feed rate of 2 lb/hr. The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity at the center of an 8 -in. diameter cake of Darex waste calcined at about 900 ction prod- C were determined as a function of temperature.

40|$|Dental handpieces (HP’s) {{are used}} during semi-{{critical}} and critical dental procedures that imply the HP must be sterile {{at the point}} of use. The aim {{of this study was to}} undertake a quantitative and qualitative analysis of dental HP contamination to inform the development of HP <b>cleaning.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> validation work on protein desorbtion methods and protein detection assays resulted in boiling in 1 % sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) and the o-phthaldialedhyde (OPA) assay (sensitivity 5 μg/ml) selected for further use in this study. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of HP microbial and protein contamination was then undertaken. Before decontamination, bacteria were isolated from high speed HP’s (n= 40) (median 200 cfu, range 0 - 1. 9 x 104 CFU/instrument), low speed HP’s(n- 40) (median 400 cfu, range 0 - 1 x 104 CFU/instrument) and surgical HP’s (n= 20) (median 1 x 103, range 0 - 3. 7 x 104 CFU/instrument). A range of oral bacteria were identified in addition to Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. Protein was detected from high speed HP’s (median 1. 3, range 0 - 210 g), low speed HP’s (median 15. 41 μg, range 0 - 448 μg) and surgical HP’s (median 350 μg, range 127. 5 – 1, 936 μg) before decontamination. Serum albumin and salivary mucin were identified on surgical HP’s before decontamination. Calcium based deposits and contaminants trapped in lubricating oil were also detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). The efficacy of detergents and a HP cleaning solution at cleaning HP contaminants was assessed in vitro with a standard test soil and disruption of biofilms with a range of cleaning efficacies noted from each cleaning solution tested. Alkaline detergents caused a significant biomass disruption of P. acnes biofilms compared to ROH 2 O alone. HP cleaning solution resulted in fixation of the biofilm and blood to the surface. The efficacy of novel HP cleaning machines was also assessed using a test soil based on the data generated in this study. Efficacy varied between devices tested with one demonstrating efficient protein removal in all but 1 HP location. The data presented describes a quantitative and qualitative assessment of common contaminants of HP’s, mainly bacteria, salivary mucin and serum albumin. In-vivo biofouling levels of HP’s are several fold lower than standard test soil formulations and consideration should be given to use of HP test soil based on in-vivo data to validate HP cleaning processes. The data generated in this thesis should aid in designing dental HP test soils and cleaning regimens. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
