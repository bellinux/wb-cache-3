This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. <b>Poor</b> <b>road</b> <b>conditions</b> following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E

On July 29, 1870, after two years of debating, the state of Texas granted the request for the new county. Shortly afterwards, the first settlements were built in Cooper and the town was established. The community was named after Leroy Cooper, the chairman of the Texas House Committee on Counties and Boundaries who helped establish the new county. Cooper was selected as the seat for the county, which would be named Delta County due to its triangular shape.|$|E

This research examines how road damages effects of the vehicle speed subsequently to the motor vehicle emission. This research stages begins with assessment of pavement condition uses PCI methods, six locations with different pavement conditions (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor, very poor) are selected and calculated the average of vehicles speed on those locations. In the next stage, calculated emissions in six locations use mobilev software. The outcomes of this research indicate that in excellent <b>roads</b> <b>condition,</b> vehicle's average speed is 65, 38 km/h, CO emissions by 20818. 63 g/h/km, CO 2 emissions by 1632864. 82 g/km/h, NO 2 emissions by 476. 39 g/h/km, Particulate Mass by 168. 078 g/h/km, SO 2 emissions by 4. 262 g/h/km. In really <b>poor</b> <b>road</b> <b>condition,</b> vehicle’ average speed is 29. 09 km/h, CO emissions by 21393. 74 g/h/km, CO 2 emissions by 1671812. 447 g/h/km, NO 2 emissions by 488. 74 g/h/km, Particulate Mass emissions by 172. 238 g/h/km, SO 2 emissions by 4. 359 g/h/km.

Aurangabad city a rapidly growing city with population of 1. 5 million is home to five major industrial areas, the city is also known for its historical monuments which might also be adversely affected from air pollution. Therefore, this research aims at estimating PM 10 concentrations at several locations across Aurangabad. The concentration of PM 10 was highest at the Railway Station followed by Waluj (an industrial zone) and City chowk is the centre of the city which has high population, tall buildings, few open spaces which causes high congestion and does not allow the particulates to disperse. Other locations with high concentrations of PM are Mill corner, Harsul T-point, Kranti Chowk, Seven Hill, TV centre and Beed Bye pass. All these locations have narrow roads, high traffic density, <b>poor</b> <b>road</b> <b>condition</b> with pot holes and few crossing points which cause congestion and vehicle idling which are responsible for high pollution.
