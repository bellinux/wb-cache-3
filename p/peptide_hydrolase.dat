40|$|A novel Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 gene {{encoding}} an endoglucanase (Cel 5 A) was cloned {{and expressed}} in Escherichia coli, and its enzymatic properties were characterized. The cel 5 A gene {{consists of a}} 3, 444 -bp open reading frame and encodes a 1, 148 -amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 127, 047 Da. Cel 5 A is a modular enzyme consisting of an N-terminal signal <b>peptide,</b> two glycosyl <b>hydrolase</b> family 5 catalytic modules, two novel carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), two linker sequences, and a C-terminal sequence with an unknown function. The amino acid sequences of the two catalytic modules and the two CBMs are 94 % and 73 % identical to each other, respectively. Two regions that consisted of one CBM and one catalytic module were tandemly connected via a linker sequence. The CBMs did not exhibit significant sequence similarity with any other CBMs. Analyses of the hydrolytic activity of the recombinant Cel 5 A (rCel 5 A) comprising the CBMs and the catalytic modules showed that the enzyme is an endoglucanase with activities with carboxymethyl cellulose, lichenan, acid-swollen cellulose, and oat spelt xylan. To investigate {{the functions of the}} CBMs and the catalytic modules, truncated derivatives of rCel 5 A were constructed and characterized. There were no differences in the hydrolytic activities with various polysaccharides or in the hydrolytic products obtained from cellooligosaccharides between the two catalytic modules. Both CBMs had the same substrate affinity with intact rCel 5 A. Removal of the CBMs from rCel 5 A reduced the catalytic activities with various polysaccharides remarkably.

Here, {{we used the}} proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG 132 to induce neurodegeneration of PC 12 cells. Afterwards, conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor was administrated as a therapeutic factor, both pretreatment and posttreatment. Our results showed that (1) conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor enhanced lactacystin/MG 132 -induced cell viability and morphology, and attenuated alpha-synuclein accumulation in differentiated PC 12 cells. (2) Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay showed up-regulated 26 S proteasomal activity in MG 132 -induced PC 12 cells after pre- and posttreatment with conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor. Similarly, 26 S proteasome activity was upregulated in lactacystin-induced PC 12 cells pretreated with conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor. (3) With regard proteolytic enzymes (specifically, glutamyl <b>peptide</b> <b>hydrolase,</b> chymotrypsin, and trypsin), glutamyl <b>peptide</b> <b>hydrolase</b> activity was up-regulated in lactacystin/MG 132 -administered PC 12 cells after pre- and posttreatment with conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor.

40|$|The {{free radical}} theory of ageing postulates that age-associated neurodegeneration {{is caused by}} an {{imbalance}} between pro-oxidants and antioxidants resulting in oxidative stress. The current study showed regional variation in brain susceptibility to age-associated oxidative stress as shown by increased lipofuscin deposition and protein carbonyl levels in male rats of age 15 - 16 months compared to control ones (3 - 5 months). The hippocampus is the area most vulnerable to change compared to the cortex and cerebellum. However, proteasomal enzyme activity was not affected by age {{in any of the}} brain regions studied.

40|$|Ivy growing under natural {{conditions}} {{is an interesting}} plant to study the influence of external (e. g. temperature, light) and internal (e. g. source/sink relations) factors on leaf metabolism. Leaves of this evergreen plant are subject several times to seasonal changes.

Total proteins and carbohydrates increased considerably between February and May before the emergence of the new leaf generation.

From May onwards, the assimilates were retranslocated to the emerging young plant parts. Marked seasonal changes in the <b>peptide</b> <b>hydrolase</b> pattern were observed. All exo- and endopeptidases investigated were minimal during summer suggesting that the net protein remobilization from older leaves was not based on an increase in the level of these major peptide hydrolases. Source/sink interactions on a whole plant level seem to be decisive in the regulation of seasonal changes in the pattern of assimilatory enzymes and of proteolytic activities. Since ivy leaves remain active for several years, the changes must be reversible and occur repeatedly during the life-span of a particular leaf...|$|E
40|$|Three enzymes with L- and one enzyme with D-aminopeptidase (EC 3. 4. 11; alpha-aminoacyl <b>peptide</b> <b>hydrolase)</b> {{activity}} {{have been}} separated {{from each other and}} partially purified from Bacillus subtilis 168 W. T., distinguished with respect to their molecular weights and catalytic properties, and studied in relation to the physiology of this bacterium. One L-aminopeptidase, designated aminopeptidase I, has a molecular weight of 210, 000 +/- 20, 000, is produced early in growth, and hydrolyzes L-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide most rapidly. Another, designated aminopeptidase II, molecular weight 67, 000 +/- 10, 000, is also produced early in growth and hydrolyzes L-lysyl-beta-naphthylamide most rapidly. A third, aminopeptidase III, molecular weight 228, 000 +/- 20, 000, is produced predominantly in early stationary phase and most efficiently utilizes L-alpha-aspartyl-beta-naphthylamide as substrate. The synthesis of aminopeptidase III in early stationary phase suggests that selective catabolism of peptides occurs at this time, perhaps related to the cessation of growth or the onset of early sporulation-associated events. A D-aminopeptidase which hydrolyzes the carboxyl-blocked dipeptide D-alanyl-D-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide (as well as D-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide and D-alanyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine) has also been identified, separated from aminopeptidase II, and purified 170 -fold. D-Aminopeptidase, molecular weight 220, 000 +/- 20, 000, is localized predominantly in the cell wall and periplasm of the organism. This evidence and the variation of the activity during the growth cycle suggest an important function in cell wall or peptide antibiotic metabolism...|$|E
40|$|A {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies was produced against purified microvillus membranes of human small intestinal enterocytes. By means of these probes three disaccharidases (sucrase-isomaltase, lactase- phlorizin hydrolase, and maltase-glucoamylase) and four peptidases (aminopeptidase N, dipeptidylpeptidase IV, angiotension I-converting enzyme, and p-aminobenzoic acid <b>peptide</b> <b>hydrolase)</b> were successfully identified as individual entities by SDS PAGE and localized in the microvillus {{border of the}} enterocytes by immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies were used to study the expression of small intestinal hydrolases in the colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco 2. This cell line was found to express sucrase-isomaltase, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, aminopeptidase N, and dipeptidylpeptidase IV, but not the other three enzymes. Pulse-chase studies with [35 S]methionine and analysis by subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that sucrase-isomaltase was synthesized and persisted as a single-chain protein comprising both subunits. Similarly, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase was synthesized as a large precursor about {{twice the size of}} the lactase subunits found in the human intestine. Aminopeptidase N and dipeptidylpeptidase IV, known to be dimeric enzymes in most mammals, were synthesized as monomers. Transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi apparatus was considerably faster for the peptidases than for the disaccharidases, as probed by endoglycosidase H sensitivity. These results suggest that the major disaccharidases share a common biosynthetic mechanism that differs from that for peptidases. Furthermore, the data indicate that the transport of microvillus membrane proteins to and through the Golgi apparatus is a selective process that may be mediated by transport receptors...|$|E
40|$|Peptide hydrolases were solubilized from rat small {{intestinal}} brush border by papain {{and separated}} by Sephadex G- 200 chromatography, velocity gradient ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis and designated according to approximate molecular size from sedimentation studies. Peptidases I (apparent Mr 230 000) and II (apparent Mr 160 000) are oligopeptidases with maximum specificity for tripeptides with identical pH optima (7. 5) and similar apparent Km with L-Leu-Gly (I, 0. 60 MM; II, 0. 76 mM). L-Leucyl-beta-naphthylamide is a competitive inhibitor of both enzymes. Concentration of peptidase II produced partial conversion to peptidase I on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. The third <b>peptide</b> <b>hydrolase</b> (III, Mr 120 000) is a dipeptidase with pH optimum 8. 5 and apparent Km for L-Leu-Gly of 0. 65 mM. These peptide hydrolases were inhibited appreciably (37 - 59 %) by 0. 2 M glycine/NaOH, Tris - HCl or Tris - glycine buffers. EDTA (5 mM) completely inhibited these enzymes but all activity was restored by dialysis against buffer without divalent ions. Subsequent addition of Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, Co 2 + or Zn 2 + (1 - 2 mM) inhibited peptidases I and II variably (4 - 81 %) {{depending upon the}} substrate and buffer used. In contrast peptidase III was activated slightly by metal ions (5 - 20 %). These peptide hydrolases are strategically located at the intestinal lumen-cell interface and possess biochemical characteristics making them ideally suited to play {{a pivotal role in}} the final stage of protein digestion...|$|E
40|$|The {{inactivation}} «in vitro» {{was investigated}} for four enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism. Nitrate reductase (EC 1. 6. 6. 1) was very unstable in extracts of bean leaves. Glutamine synthetase (EC 6. 3. 1. 2) and glutamate synthase (EC 1. 4. 7. 1) showed intermediate stabilities, and glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 4. 1. 2) {{proved to be}} very stable. Inactivation of both nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase was accelerated in extracts from young leaves after addition of trypsin, chymotrypsin, extract from senescing leaves, or extract from cotyledons of germinating seeds. Glutamate synthase inactivation remained unchanged in presence of peptide hydrolases, while glutamate dehydrogenase was slowly inactivated by trypsin and chymotrypsin, but not by cotyledon or leaf extract. The inactivating factor from cotyledons and from leaves was precipitable with ammonium sulfate, heat labile and excluded by Sephadex G- 25. The relative resistance to proteolysis was similar for nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase, regardless of the <b>peptide</b> <b>hydrolase</b> source. Nitrate reductase was always the least stable and glutamate dehydrogenase the most stable of the three enzymes mentioned. It remains open by which factor(s) glutamate synthase was inactivated. Stability of glutamine synthetase decreased with age of the extracted leaves, and no increase in total endopeptidase activity was observed. Enzyme inactivation was delayed after addition of caScin or of heat inactivated extract. It appears likely that {{quality and quantity of}} other proteins present in the extract influence the inactivation of a particular enzyme...|$|E
