2500|$|There is {{some recent}} {{research}} which tries {{to assess the}} impact of the Internet on profitability. It remains unclear what the total effect of computerization is on the relationship between investments and profits. Some argue that, in reality, computerization by itself does not alter the cost structure of products very much. Others argue, that computerization both enables a much faster turnover of capital, with great productivity gains and fewer employees, and permits entrepreneurs to set up business with computers at a much lower start-up cost than before. Perhaps the main effect of the internet relevant to business is that it has gigantically enlarged the possibilities for market access on a global scale: businesses set up for internet sales can reach vastly more customers in much less time. [...] The <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is, that purchases via the internet have constantly increased, often at the expense of ordinary street shops. One of the analytical problems is that the relative importance of computers, and their potential financial impact, differs considerably between different kinds of business.|$|E

Frank Easterbrook observed in 1992's Gooden v. Neal, where a correctional officer alleged he had been demoted in retaliation for exposing corruption, that [...] "any defendants do not want Mt.

2500|$|The main {{conceptual}} objection is, {{that the}} distinctions between productive and unproductive labor offered by various Marxists are essentially arbitrary, and without a genuine, scientifically sound foundation. In a complex division of labor, specialist productive work relies on a network of indispensable managerial, facilitary and technical support services, without which it could not take place at all. Marx himself never said that managerial functions were wholly [...] "unproductive", but rather that they combined productive and unproductive tasks. He {{pointed out that there}} were continually disputes about whether labour was productive or not, depending on who could make money from it – and that in turn depended on how the accounting was done as well as on property rights. Whether workers physically and directly produce something tangible or not, they are all necessary, or at least most of them are (as Marx acknowledges with his concept of the [...] "collective worker" [...] or, in German, Gesamtarbeiter). It is therefore impossible to attribute the creation of new value only to workers who directly produce a tangible product. Marxists often assume in their social accounts that the total payment of unproductive labor is made from a redistribution of part of the current surplus value produced by productive labor, but there is no <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> assumption whatsoever, and indeed some Marxists have argued that the [...] "overhead expense" [...] of unproductive labor represents an outlay of circulating constant capital. David Ramsay Steele has defended the productive economic role of financial markets.|$|E
