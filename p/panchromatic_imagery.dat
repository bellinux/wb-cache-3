40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{population}} growth over recent decades, changes of urban areas have significantly impacted the environment. Urban is a heterogeneous and highly fragmented environment which has made them a challenging area for remote sensing imagery. The reliability of the information delivered by remote sensing applications in urban area highly depends {{on the quality of}} spatial and spectral data. Accordingly, the objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the impact of incorporation of Hyperion imagery and textural characteristics of high resolution <b>panchromatic</b> ALI <b>imagery</b> in classifying of urban region of south west of Tehran. To this end, we extracted textural information from <b>panchromatic</b> ALI <b>imagery</b> using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method. Classification was carried out by SVM method in five scenarios: Classification of spectral band of CNT method, classification of spectral bands plus texture with window size 3, size 5, size 7 and size 9. The classification results show that the urban areas of south west of Tehran are insufficiently characterized by the Hyperion satellite imagery. A quantitative assessment of the results demonstrated that the use of texture information improved urban land covers classification. As a result, combining of texture information with Hyperion imagery decreases class confusion specifically in heterogonous classes. The GLCM features show great potential for land use cover classification in heterogeneous areas with rich textural information...|$|R

In particular, the spatial extents of objects characterized by distinct spatial signatures at multiple scales are estimated by using statistical models to control a simple region growing process. Texture motifs are used to model the spatial signatures at the smallest, or pixel, scale. Markov random fields are used to model the spatial signatures at the larger, or motif, scale. These models are used to iteratively expand a bounding box to approximate the spatial extent of an object.

40|$|Scientific and {{professional}} interests of civil engineering mainly include structures, hydraulics, geotechnical engineering, environment, and transportation issues. Topics {{included in the}} context of the above may concern urban environment issues, urban planning, hydrological modelling, study of hazards and road construction. Land cover information contributes significantly on the study of the above subjects. Land cover information can be acquired effectively by visual image interpretation of satellite imagery or after applying enhancement routines and also by imagery classification. The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM – Landsat 8) is the latest satellite in Landsat series, launched in February 2013. Landsat 8 medium spatial resolution multispectral imagery presents particular interest in extracting land cover, because of the fine spectral resolution, the radiometric quantization of 12 bits, the capability of merging the high resolution panchromatic band of 15 meters with multispectral imagery of 30 meters as well as the policy of free data. In this paper, Landsat 8 multispectral and <b>panchromatic</b> <b>imageries</b> are being used, concerning surroundings of a lake in north-western Greece. Land cover information is extracted, using suitable digital image processing software. The rich spectral context of the multispectral image is combined with the high spatial resolution of the panchromatic image, applying image fusion – pansharpening, facilitating in this way visual image interpretation to delineate land cover. Further processing concerns supervised image classification. The classification of pansharpened image preceded multispectral image classification.

40|$|Nowadays, high {{resolution}} satellite imageries {{can be used}} in various fields. The imageries are expected to measure precise coordinates. Then accurate geometric model is required to calculate image coordinates (u, v) from ground coordinates (x, y, z). Generally, RPC model is applied as the accurate geometric model. However, the RPC model has a systematic error with several pixels. To correct the RPC model, information of GCP (Ground Control Points) should be used. GCP are consisted with precise ground coordinates and corresponded image coordinates. An accuracy of ground coordinates is required less than 1 / 5 of ground sampling distance of satellite imagery. GCP database in Shikoku Japan has been established by authors. Over 550 points were finished to survey within 4 cm accuracy by GPS VRS observation. However, point based GCP doesn't have enough accuracy for {{high resolution}} satellite imageries. Because, image coordinates are selected by visual interpretation. Poly-lines or polygon type GCP should be prepared to select accurate image coordinates by image processing. In this study, Poly-line type GCP were suggested. Target satellite imageries are ALOS PRISM which are <b>panchromatic</b> <b>imageries</b> with 2. 5 m ground sampling distance. In the test area, 5 intersections and 4 curves of road were surveyed, and Poly-line type GCP were prepared. Corresponding coordinates of Poly-line type GCP in PRISM imageries can be computed by image matching process. Least squares matching method was applied in this study. Then, precise image coordinates can be obtained. Poly-line type GCP were validated using bias corrected RPC model. The root mean square error showed 0. 5 pixel. On the other hand, point based GCP were also validated. In the case of point based GCP, corresponding coordinates were selected by visual interpretation.
