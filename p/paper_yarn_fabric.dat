It is urgent to find less environmentally damaging alternative yarns for the manufacture of clothing and other textile products. This study investigates and gives information about textile fabrics of paper yarn made from Manila hemp. Knitted structures made of paper yarn; cotton and viscose are tested and compared. Also, a tensile strength test of the yarns is performed. The paper yarn has low shrinkage and no tendencies to pilling, great characteristics for fabrics {{to be used in the}} textile- and clothing industry. The handleability / knittability: a problem that has to be solved if the paper yarn is going to be used in the textile industry to a high extent in the future.

For the weft yarn, chemical indigo and natural indigo dyestuffs were used. The study developed four kinds of Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> and eight kinds of Hanji denim fabrics. In addition, the study tested {{the properties of the}} developed Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarns,</b> Hanji denim <b>fabrics,</b> and existing denim fabrics. In regard to the physical properties of <b>yarns,</b> the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> showed a lower breaking stress but a relatively high breaking strain, and it remained a stable structure with no surface fluff. The Hanji combination yarn improved the weaving ability and had a stable structure form. In the resulting physical properties of the developed Hanji denim fabrics, they had a low apparent specific gravity, stability in dimensional change in washing and drying, a higher chance of commercialization in colorfastness to washing, medium stretchability, a similar drying velocity, and a fast absorption velocity compared to the existing denim fabrics. The study suggests that the Hanji denim fabrics are the good candidate materials for summer product development, since generally the Hanji denim fabrics have cool characteristics with the excellent absorption velocity, drying velocity, and low specific gravity.|$|R

Thermal comfort properties and utility properties determine the wearing comfort of textiles and the suitability of a new textile product for a particular application. Both, Thermal comfort properties such as thermal absorptiveness, thermal conductivity, air permeability and utility properties like percent stretch, spirality, bursting strength of core <b>yarn</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> and hollow <b>yarn</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> were assessed. A new method was proposed and discussed for producing hollow <b>yarns</b> at <b>fabric</b> stage (in this case knitted fabric) which involved the following steps: - a) Production of ring spun yarns, comprising nylon as a core and cotton as a sheath, using Ring Spinning System. b) Production of knitted fabrics of different knit structures viz., single jersey, rib and interlock using above mentioned yarn. c) Dissolution of core element i. e.

30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose <b>yarn</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier <b>yarn</b> knitted <b>fabrics.</b> Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of <b>fabrics</b> woven from <b>yarns</b> having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun <b>yarn</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed high water vapour permeability while carded <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed <b>yarn</b> rib knitted <b>fabrics</b> and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun <b>yarns</b> and knitted <b>fabrics</b> in comparison with ring-spun <b>yarns</b> and <b>fabrics.</b> They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower <b>yarn</b> and <b>fabric</b> wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R

30|$|In the {{production}} of the <b>paper</b> <b>yarn,</b> a Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is produced in almost the same process system as Japanese <b>paper</b> <b>yarn,</b> so the properties of the two <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> are quiet similar (Kim et al. 2006; Kim and Park 2008; Itoi 2001; Ishikawa and Shinohara 2001). In Korea, the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is made of Hanji paper sheets, so it has a high bulkiness. The thickness of <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is greater than that of the same count of cotton yarn. As a result, the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is evaluated as a lightweight <b>yarn</b> because Hanji <b>paper</b> yarn’s diameter is larger meaning that the apparent specific gravity is lower (Kim et al. 2007; Park 2012). Therefore, it is possible to produce a lightweight denim fabric that actually feels lighter when worn by using the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> as the weft. This is because the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is a <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and is lightweight by its characteristic of yarn structure and is fast in absorption rate and drying speed rates. Therefore, Hanji denim fabric is a lightweight fabric material with a low specific gravity compared to existing denim fabric resulting in having excellent form stability and comfort.|$|R

40|$|Low-torque ring yarn {{spinning}} is a modified-ring spinning technology with the false-twisting devices attached on the conventional ring spinning machine. The {{introduction of the}} false-twisting operation gives low-torque yarn a new fiber and yarn configuration, and thus causes different characteristics of low-torque <b>yarn</b> <b>fabric</b> from that of conventional ring and rotor <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> a comparative study {{has been carried out}} to evaluate the performance of jeans and trousers produced by low-torque yarns to conventional ring and rotor yarns. The results from the objective measurements of fabric performance indicate that the tensile and tear strength of low-torque ring <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics</b> in the weft direction is similar to or only slightly lower than that of fabrics using conventional ring yarns with a normal twist level as the weft yarns, but they are much higher than that of the <b>fabrics</b> using rotor <b>yarns.</b> Compared to the fabrics produced from conventional ring and rotor yarns, the low-torque ring <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics</b> exhibit higher compression energy (WC) and lower mean deviation of friction (MMD) and achieve higher values in fabric Numeri and Fukurami. The subjective evaluation of jeans and trousers through wear trials further confirms that low-torque yarn jeans have significant advantages of a better appearance in jean smoothness, less 'small snake' patterns, a more prominent slub effect and better overall quality than the conventional ring and rotor yarn jeans. The low-torque yarn trousers also show better luster, smoothness appearance and overall quality than the conventional ring and rotor yarn trousers. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

Engineering fabrics with desirable thermo-physiological properties suited for specific applications such as active wear, intimate wear is a big challenge for textile manufacturers as gamut of fibre, <b>yarn</b> and <b>fabric</b> parameters are known to influence the thermo-physiological properties. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore suitable combination of fibre and yarn variables for engineering polyester–cotton plated fabrics with good thermo-physiological properties. Categorical variables i.e. outer layer yarn type and inner layer fibre linear density were found to affect the thermal, moisture vapour and liquid moisture transfer properties of developed test samples. Fabrics knitted with carded yarn and polyester fibre of high linear density showed high thermal resistance and would feel warmer on initial skin contact owing to low thermal absorptivity. However, the air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate increased with combination of combed cotton yarn in the outer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner layer. Combed <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics</b> were superior in trans planar wicking compared to carded <b>yarn</b> <b>fabrics</b> which showed higher water absorbency and would be slow drying fabrics.|$|R
