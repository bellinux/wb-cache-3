We show that unlike bulk porous Si, the <b>predesigned</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the wires results in a single distinct conduction mechanism such as tunneling in the former case and variable range hopping in the latter case. We demonstrate that the geometry of the systems with a large internal surface area and high density of the Si quantum dots have a significant conduction enhancement compared to bulk porous silicon.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} problem of {{programming}} the optimal operation of an aquifer system hydraulically linked to a river, using a set <b>of</b> <b>predesigned</b> hydraulic <b>structures,</b> {{in order to meet}} agricultural requirements. The focus is on two fundamental aspects: (1) the choice of a model that adequately reflects the physical, dynamic behavior of such a system and possesses characteristics allowing for the treatment of the problem through optimization techniques, and (2) the formulation of the problem as an optimization program. The model includes a physical component, based on the influence coefficient (impulsional response) concept and the principle of superposition, and an agricultural production function, elaborated {{in such a way as}} to reflect the dynamic process of plant development, that is, the seasonal life cycle of the crops and the effect of changing hydrological conditions on the latter.

40|$|Semiconducting {{nanowires}} (NW) {{have recently}} been extensively studied and developed for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, solar cells and sensors using carriers confinement. The Si and Ge NWs, in particular, can be promising candidates for one-dimensional superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems 3, 4. However, their electronic transport properties are strongly dependent on their surface and core structure. Hence, a detailed study on their possible effects on these properties are necessary prior to utilization of such hybrid systems. Here, we have studied electronic transport properties {{as a function of}} the temperature of Si NWs with two distinct structures. One with embedded Si quantum dots and the other with a percolative crystalline path. We show that the <b>predesigned</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the wires results in a prominent single distinct conduction mechanism such as tunneling in the former case and variable range hopping in the latter case 5. We demonstrate that measured transport properties are the result of the geometry of the systems, with a large internal surface having a significantly high density of states. These results improve the understanding of the basis of the different electronic transport mechanisms in silicon nanowires and can lead to advanced hybrid systems design with a high controllability and precision...|$|R

40|$|Computer games {{can involve}} {{narrative}} and story elements integrating {{different forms of}} interactivity and using different strategies for combining interaction with non-interactive story and narrative elements. While some forms of interactive narrative involve simple selection between fixed narrative sequences, computer games more typically involve the integration of narrative with game play based upon a simulation substrate. These three forms, simulation, game play and narrative, involve pre-authored time structures {{at different levels of}} time scale. Simulation involves the lowest levels <b>of</b> time <b>structure,</b> with authored principles specifying how time develops from frame to frame based upon physics, the representation of game objects and their behaviour, and discrete event simulation. Games involve pre-designed game moves, types of actions that may be realized as abstractions over patterns of low level changes at the frame level. Linear and interactive narratives form the highest level <b>of</b> <b>predesigned</b> time <b>structure,</b> framing low-level simulation processes and intermediate level game moves within a high level structure typically based upon classic models of narrative form. Computer games may emphasise {{one or more of these}} primary forms as the focus of meaning in the play experience. Story construction within computer games is a function of how these different levels <b>of</b> time <b>structure</b> interact in the play experience, being the result of pre-designed narrative content, story potential and the actual unfolding story created by the actions of the player. There are many strategies for integrating these forms. However, a crucial issue in the design of story content is the relationship between how the resulting game experience relates to user play preferences. In particular, categories of play style can be extended to include preferences for how story content is experienced, based upon audience, performance and immersionist orientations to story. Perceived tensions within computer game form, such as the tension between game play and narrative, are explained, not as fundamental formal issues, but issues of player preferences and how these are satisfied or not by different strategies for story content within a game system...|$|R

40|$|A design {{methodology}} allowing engineers to consider simultaneously {{and from the}} earliest phases of design {{some of the key}} factors of sustainable development (pollution, life cycle data) has been developed and successfully demonstrated on two examples of integrated energy systems. The principal idea is to take diverse factors related to thermodynamics, economics and the environment and integrate {{them in a way that}} the most optimal syntheses and designs (and operation) can be found. The solution space resulting from such a complete formulation, which can include tens of independant variables, is highly non linear and includes locally continuous but generally non contiguous subspaces. Solution procedures based on specially adapted genetic algorithms, have been implemented and shown to allow the user to tracks the most effective solution paths in a robust way. Pollution penalty factors accounting for both emissions and immission levels have been proposed and applied in dedicated sensitivity analyses. Using a simplified quasi-stationary formulation application examples include the <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> combined cycle power plant with or without cogeneration and with or without CO 2 separation as well as the <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> district heating systems considering the use of both centralized and/or decentralized heat pumps as well as cogeneration units. Both exergetic and economic optimum solutions are compared. As FN did not finance the entire proposal, additional contributions from FOGA and Alliance for Global Sustainability allowed the completion of this project. Although the present results open exciting prospects and are already being extended in the framework of four different international initiatives, further work is still required. It includes, among others, a further refinement of the link between entropy and/or exergy and pollution, an extension to a broader range of pollutants including those having synergistic effects, a better account for the time dependancy and uncertainties, the coupling with top down approaches including neural net based simplified submodels and parallelisation and an extension of the models of technologies considered to other integrated systems such as direct electrochemical conversion or renewables based devices (new proposal in preparation) ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{encompasses}} reconstruction <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> the {{motorway junction}} Ljubljana Rudnik into motorway interchange. In {{this area is}} intended to be the junction of main arterial road with highway network, while today serves only as a minor junction of Rudnik and Ig area on the motorway. The purpose of reconstruction is to enable free traffic flow on most congested directions of the interchange, but also preserve the present function, in which Ig and Rudnik area are connected with the motorway. But we also want to add another function of merging new arterial road with motorway network. In the first part we have introduced terminology regarding interchanges, ramps and intersections, including theorethical bases for planning and design. We have focused on the meaning of hearing area and determined the conditions for roadway spatial planning. Based on the traffic demand study, for the planning year 2035, we have chosen a collection of characteristic interchange forms. We estimared the level of service of chosen section of interchange for critical movements. We used Highway capacity software (HCS+) which is based on Highway capacity manual 2000. The four most appropriate variants were detailed analysed with software VISSIM 5. 30. With the help of the program we determined the number of lanes on ramps and other roads. We chose the most appropriate variant for this case by comparitive analysis, where we compared variants also in the meaning of traffic safety. We use SSAM 2. 1. 6 software for traffic safety impact assesment. For each variant we estimated the number of potential conflicts between the vehicles. After »traffic comparison« we checked the construction possibilities and necessities for four chosen variants. We designed longitudional profiles for each ramp of the interchange for every variant. Then we estimated the lengths <b>of</b> needed overcoming <b>structures</b> for each case and physical possibility to build them in limited urban space. We roughly estimated the length of new roads {{and the size of the}} area used for roadways and bridges. We used surveying data in digital form and AutoCAD Civil 3 D software for making a rough <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> the interchange. After all the comparisons we have made, we then decided which variant is the most appropriate and adequate for this case. The chosen form will be in the next phase thoroughly designed and optimized but that is no longer the part of this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract From the {{perspective}} of the human commander of a complex automated process, an important factor that influences the quality of the command dialog is the ability of the user interface to provide information that allows the commander to perform situation assessment. Another important factor is the ability of the user interface to provide accessible and usable mechanisms to support communication between the human and the contol system. We believe that much of the substrate for such human-machine dialog may be provided by a dynamic, model-based representation of the system components and processes, shared by all software and human agents participating in the control situation. In addition, we believe that the current method of providing user interactions to dynamic control systems, which involves static <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> all user interface components and interactions, is inadequate {{to meet the needs of}} multi-agent systems requiring varying levels of participant autonomy and varying levels of mixed-initiative control by human commanders, especially those in dynamically changing situations such as those present in a military battlefield. We have developed an approach that overcomes these limitations, using model-based productive reasoning about situations and interaction design, and are successfully applying this approach in the domain of military command and control of teams of semi-autonomous vehicles...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} for the aerodynamic <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> hypersonic configurations was developed {{within the framework}} of this study. The concept of this methodology couples numerical simulations with simple calculation methods, typical for predesign, and in this way achieves a higher accuracy with acceptable calculation time. The achievement of this calculation accuracy is especially necessary for hypersonics, since the complex flow phenomena and component interference cannot be taken into account by simpler methods but have enormous influence on the design process. In addition to the primarily interesting aerodynamic values, the global application of this method can be used to handle other important aerodynamic aspects for the predesign, such as the compressibility factor. The core of this methodology is the 'optimised' solution of the Euler equations for a specially interesting configuration flow case (e. g. cruising). The optimisation lies in the special algorithm which recognises subsonic and supersonic regions in the flow field and automatically controls the application of compatible time or 'pseudo space step' methods in the various areas. In this way, on the one hand there is a major saving in calculation time compared to conventional time step methods for slim configurations. On the other hand, the universal applicability of the Euler equations is retained for 'blunt body' flow calculations. (orig.)

40|$|Currently, {{onshore wind}} {{turbines}} are economical for 2. 5 mega-watt inland installation [1]. One {{of the alternatives}} to achieve the higher power capacity in onshore wind turbines {{is to go to}} higher altitude, which increases the wind speed and has more uniform wind pressure, leading to higher possible annual energy production and relatively lower maintenance costs due to wind shear induced vibrations. This paper deals with a <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> a new type of tower that should overcome known disadvantages of steel tubular towers for heights over 150 meters. This first part of the paper addresses the viability of a hybrid support <b>structure</b> in respect <b>of</b> ultimate limit states and structural dynamics as part of the requirements in exploring the feasibility of the hybrid tower concept. The hybrid wind turbine tower concept consists of a lattice (lower) structure and a tubular tower for the higher tower segment. The study cases found in literature were designed with maximum height of 160 m and the 2. 5 MW wind turbine.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION Claw-pole {{alternator}} {{is often}} used in automotive industry because of its easy process of fabrication and its low cost. Permanent magnets are currently integrated to increased its efficiency, however their higher price brings into question their usage. This tight context implies finding new technical solutions to keep the same efficiency without magnets. One of these solutions is to use unusual soft magnetic materials like CoFe [1]. Fig. b shows magnetizing curves of different CoFe tested in the solid rotor in order to evaluate their potential gain. OPTIMIZATION OR PREDESIGN Unlike conventional electrical machines, claw-pole machine is characterized by its unsymmetrical shape of poles along the rotor that induces a 3 D flux path (Fig. a). In this context, a model based on a magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is established to perform optimizations under constraints including short time simulation and high parameters number [2] [3]. In this case, the model accuracy is about 30 % but it's adequate to achieve <b>predesign</b> <b>of</b> the alternator.
