500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the film}} was generally very positive: The Times Literary Supplement named it [...] "Sir John's masterpiece to date" [...] and the Financial Times described it as [...] "extremely good". Television playwright Dennis Potter was also highly complimentary, writing his New Statesman review in verse as a tribute. Only the Eastern Daily <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> that the film was too short and lacking in detail.

Jaan Uhelszki of Alternative <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> that the album is made of [...] "sterner stuff", with the band's prog-metal foundation [...] "enhanced by an unexpectedly powerful sense of melody". Smiley Ben of BBC Collective noted in the album alternative rock tendencies. Ryan Rayhill from Blender found the album befitting prog-rock prototypes Rush and opined that Thirty Seconds to Mars [...] "emerged with an eponymous debut that sounds like Tool on The Dark Side of the Moon", referring to the 1973 album by Pink Floyd.|$|E

40|$|Dewatering of pulp in a {{paper machine}} is a well {{established}} process. Nevertheless, {{it is far from}} being fully understood. One of the major steps in this process is the mechanical dewatering within the press section. It is achieved by applying large mechanical loads on the wet paper web {{while at the same time}} providing an escape route for the excess water. The quality of this process is influenced by many parameters. Besides the press nip parameters like pressure, roll diameters and press type (roll or shoe press), also other factors contribute to the mechanical dewatering performance. Among these factors the <b>press</b> <b>felts,</b> that transport the paper web through the press nip, are a major influence. Besides dewatering pulp, <b>press</b> <b>felts</b> govern also the papers smoothness and printability...|$|R

500|$|Chris Maguire, {{writing for}} AltSounds, was {{impressed}} with the song, calling it a [...] "solid rock track", while Ian Winwood from Kerrang! found it [...] "rousing". Adam Silverstein of Digital Spy named it a stand-out track from the album and felt that songs like [...] "Conquistador" [...] "power up the vibe". James Montgomery from MTV praised its [...] "massive guitars, stabbing strings and thundering drums". Andy Baber of musicOMH noticed the song's [...] "big guitar riff" [...] and the [...] "combative lyrics". PureVolume's Tom Lanham called it a [...] "marching" [...] that [...] "keeps upping the sonic ante". In a mixed review, John Watt from Drowned in Sound described the track as a [...] "weird Brit-rock stomp" [...] which [...] "fails to resonate". Dan Slessor of Alternative <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> that the song sounded [...] "just too easy" [...] for the typical sound of the band.|$|E
500|$|Robert Abele of LA Weekly {{said that}} [...] "in this smart, {{engaging}} series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth {{in a way}} that stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." [...] Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making", [...] " [...] with promise". However, <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> that the series paled somewhat compared to the television series Wonderfalls. Filip Vukcevic of IGN gave the season a positive review, particularly praising the amount of audience participation. However, the reviewer felt that several of the main characters were undeveloped, and that Daggs III and Dunn, as well as their respective characters, were [...] "boring". Vukcevic wrote that while the ultimate resolution to the murder was satisfying, it was not [...] "world-shattering".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Fire" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson spoke favorably of the track, {{calling it the}} [...] "centerpiece of Fame, an infectious antidote to his famous mentor 's self-seriousness." [...] While recognizing musical similarities to Graduation and Watch the Throne, Gary Graff from The Oakland <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> that Big Sean drew inspiration from West and Jay-Z's records while maintaining [...] "his own stylized favor and flow". Khari of The Source felt that [...] "Fire" [...] was appropriately placed as the second song on Hall of Fame, where it matched the [...] "flawless effort" [...] seen in the opening track [...] "Nothing Is Stopping You". David Jeffries of AllMusic and Edna Gundersen from USA Today both considered the track to be a standout from the record, and both placed it on their lists of recommended purchases from the album.|$|E
50|$|The {{second section}} of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the {{remaining}} water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by <b>press</b> <b>felts</b> that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water.

500|$|In a {{positive}} review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that Aguilera [...] "feels comfortable in this familiar, slightly freshened territory". Simon Price of The Independent {{felt that the}} album's [...] "best moments are its electro-pop numbers". Kitty Empire of The Observer characterized its subject matter as [...] "wiffle of the highest order", but wrote that [...] "one of the pleasures of Aguilera is that she can use polysyllables, even when talking the rot that fills women's mags". Although she criticized the album's [...] "upbeat pop anthems", Melody Lau of Exclaim! found Aguilera to be [...] "reinvigorated" [...] and felt that she [...] "shines most when she's direct, honest and vulnerable". Celina Murphy of Hot <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> that Lotuss [...] "safer" [...] direction and Aguilera's [...] "default mode" [...] makes the album an improvement from Bionic. At the end of 2012, Lotus was ranked at number 17 on the list [...] "20 Best Pop Albums of 2012" [...] by Spin. In contrast, Entertainment Weekly named it the worst album of 2012.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviews for}} the debut album, Robert Yates of Q wrote {{that there was}} [...] "a nice self-deflating Morrissey touch to [...] ", while Jackie Hinden of Hot <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> that [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] was [...] "like a Pretenders for the nineties". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian {{described}} the song as [...] "perversely pretty", while Leo Finlay of Music Week compared the song to Mazzy Star, and that it [...] "employs the current hip status of country music to devastating effect". Spins Eric Weissard said the song {{was the only one}} he hated in Garbage's debut album, but reacted positively to the intro where [...] "backward guitars produce a chiming solo." [...] At the end of 1995, Melody Maker rated [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] the 49th best Song of the Year, writing up: [...] "In a year of sunny Britpop, reservoir supplies of ironic bubblegum pop-noir were dangerously low. This burst of mocking miserablism helped". The track has been described as Garbage's signature song, and in 2000 was ranked as 69th in a list of 100 Greatest Pop Songs Of All Time jointly compiled by Rolling Stone and MTV.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 63 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] based on seventeen reviews. AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung dubbed the record [...] "their best in 15 years," [...] considering it [...] "a return {{to form and}} an admirable maturation of the band's classic pop-punk sound... It's not a desperate grasp at youth and faded glory, but rather a reflective look back and an expert execution {{of what they do}} best." [...] Gav Lloyd from Rock Sound wrote that [...] "Blink-182 have delivered an album that recalls everything that makes this band great and gives it all a fresh twist, the end result is California being amongst the best albums they've ever produced." [...] NME Charlotte Gunn felt California [...] "has the humour, pace, emotion and huge choruses of a classic Blink record." [...] Evan Lucy at Alternative <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> it [...] "upbeat, hooky and, above anything else, a total blast." [...] Exclaim!s Josiah Hughes was more critical, calling it [...] "uneven and disjointed" [...] and [...] "hard to take in as one larger whole".|$|E

5000|$|In non-recirculating systems, the {{discharged}} hot liquid (usually water) {{is treated}} as a waste stream. In this case fresh cool water is used {{to make up the}} loss. Environmental considerations are making such [...] "once-through" [...] systems increasingly rare.These simple, but highly reliable pumps have a variety of industrial applications. They are used to maintain condenser vacuum on large steam-turbine generator sets by removing incondensable gasses, where vacuum levels are typically 30-50 mbar.

500|$|This factor {{also worked}} in reverse; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery, {{she was also}} aware of many obstacles, the {{foremost}} being that she was devoted to her faith, and to leave {{it would be a}} severe moral wrench. Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself: it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family. Ironically, Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin Annie de Rothschild to the Christian Eliot Yorke, the son of the Earl of Hardwicke, in 1866. In fact, she was to be the third daughter of the family's English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith, but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> an example needed to be made. The Jewish Chronicle announced its [...] "most poignant grief" [...] at the prospect, and cryptically added, [...] "If the flame seize on the cedars, how will fare the hyssop on the wall: if the leviathan is brought up with a hook, how will the minnows escape," [...] demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the Jewish faith the Jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage. The quotation, originally from the Babylonian Talmud, can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the Jewish faith should set a good example by strictly following the teachings of the Jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions.|$|E
500|$|Following the season, McGary, who {{had slipped}} from a {{projected}} 2013 first round selection to a projected 2014 second round selection, {{stated that he}} had to evaluate whether he was mentally and physically ready to pursue a professional career. McGary and teammates Robinson and Stauskas all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. Many in the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> he should return to [...] "rebuild his draft stock". Upon learning that he had tested positive for marijuana following the Sweet Sixteen victory over Tennessee and was facing a one-year suspension, McGary declared for the draft, following teammates Stauskas and Robinson who had declared ten days earlier. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. McGary was tested 18 days before the NCAA decided to reduce the automatic punishment for marijuana use to a half a season and his appeal for lenience was unsuccessful. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. McGary signed with sports agent Mark Bartelstein (along with teammate Stauskas). Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. Due to his continuing rehabilitation for his back, it was unclear whether McGary would attend the NBA Draft Combine. McGary and Bartlestein decided that McGary should not participate in combines at less than 100%.|$|E
500|$|... "This Is It" [...] is a pop ballad with {{a simple}} mid-tempo {{keyboard}} that lasts three minutes and thirty-six seconds. The song begins with Jackson singing, “This is it, here I stand / I’m {{the light of the}} world, I feel grand / Got this love I can feel / And I know yes for sure it is real” and then he tenderly hits his signature high notes about a new lover he feels he’s known [...] "since 1,000 years." [...] Jackson's brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon (credited as The Jacksons) are featured as background vocals throughout the song. Background music includes fingersnaps, a [...] "soaring chorus," [...] big-build strings and [...] "bubbly guitars." [...] The song is played in the key of Bb major. Throughout the song, Jackson's vocal range spans from F4 to C6. The song's tempo is moderate, and its metronome speed is 96 beats per minute. According to the music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing and the Winnipeg Sun, the song is written in common time. The lyrics [...] "toggle between grandiosity" [...] ("This is it, here I stand / I'm the light of the world, I feel grand") and [...] "shy, romantic yearning" [...] ("I never heard a single word about you / Falling in love wasn't my plan").

[...] On public reaction to the sexual performance, Lavanya Ramanathan of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "The Internet exploded, and it's not surprising. This is a couple who sat separately at awards ceremonies when they were dating several years ago." [...] On February 1, 2014, the couple performed the song again during Jay Z's performance at the DirecTv pre-Super Bowl party. Christopher R.
