50|$|This <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>system</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} by the United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in the Pentagon in the 1960s. McNamara allegedly wanted to control the many costly weapons development programmes that were plagued by ever-increasing costs and delays. He called this new system the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS). The system was taught at the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University but it evoked little interest except from critics.|$|E
50|$|This new {{approach}} introduced an unprecedented transparency into management operations {{together with a}} concomitant precise pinpointing of managers' responsibilities, and so was widely resisted throughout the entire public sector. However, in the eighties, the UN Inspectorate General picked up the idea and recommended that the United Nations use it to improve its performance. A few institutions tried half-heartedly but only the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) went about it seriously and introduced a complete <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>system</b> that is still in place today.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} opportunity for administrative reform {{in the government of}} Bahrain. In particular it offers an awareness and better understanding of how political elites construe and enact the principles of “NPM” in public sector organisations,explores the institutional capability of Bahrain’s public sector to initiate and sustain reform, and develops a conceptual model of reform applicable to Bahrain. In order to do so, it investigates the drivers of administrative change in Bahrain, examines how elements of NPM express themselves in management practice in Bahrain’s public sector organisations, and identifies facilitators and challenges to reform. Taking an interpretive approach, data was collected through a survey of ministries and semi-structured interviews with change leaders. Moreover, a case study was undertaken in the attempt to introduce a Performance and <b>Programme</b> <b>Budgeting</b> <b>System</b> (PPBS) in ministries, as a test case for an NPM-oriented initiative transferred outside its origin context. Drivers of reform were found to include, first and foremost, internal and external socio-economic forces, such as globalisation and demographic change, and, secondly, pressure from citizens for greater transparency and responsiveness. NPM elements expressed themselves to varying degrees in five key dimensions: organisational structure, the decision-making process, a movement to customer-driven, output-based funding,improvement of HRM performance and, finally, quality management in pursuit of efficiency in public services. However, certain constraints, including a lack of commitment from the political-administrative leadership and a lack of the prerequisite preparation, have impeded implementation. The research builds upon and extends existing theorising about NPM and draws practical implications for subsequent reform initiatives, in Bahrain and beyond.

5000|$|<b>Programme</b> <b>budgeting,</b> {{developed}} by U.S. president Lyndon Johnson, is the <b>budgeting</b> <b>system</b> that, contrary to conventional budgeting, describes {{and gives the}} detailed costs of every activity or programme {{that is to be}} carried out with a given budget. For example, Expected results in a proposed programme are described fully, along with its necessary resource, raw materials, equipment, and staff costs. The sum of all activities or programmes constitute the <b>Programme</b> <b>Budget.</b> Thus, when looking at a <b>Programme</b> <b>Budget,</b> one can easily find out what precisely will be carried out, at what cost and with what expected results in considerable detail.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{cost and}} management accounting {{reforms in the}} UK central government. It provides a historical context to the subsequent reform fervour associated with New Public Management (NPM) (Hood, 1995) and offers some explanations for the underdeveloped state of accounting up to the mid 1970 s. It suggests that the perceived ‘failure’ of the Army Costing Experiment restrained the development of cost accounting, both before, and after, the Second World War and it was, instead, the Treasury inspired Organisation and Method techniques that became dominant (Walkland and Hicks, NAUK, T 316 / 2; Agar, 2003). This continued into the early 1950 s with the influential Crick report on government accounting promoting the status quo rather than accounting change. The marked change in political, economic and social forces in the late 1950 s (Theakston, 1995 : p. 84), coupled with the introduction of <b>Programme</b> Planning <b>Budgeting</b> <b>Systems</b> (PPBS) in the United States fuelled a renewed interest in the measurement of outputs and management accounting information (Cook, 1986). This was followed by limited institutional change, with the introduction of a Management Accounting Unit at the Treasury. But the failure of PPBS in the USA, together with reservations within the civil service and the Fulton Report’s (1968) call for responsible management, all contributed to the rejection of government accounting along programme lines and led instead to the selective investigation of government expenditure (Gray and Jenkins, 1982; Heclo and Wildavsky, 1981). These investigations owed more to Organisation and Methods than accounting, but it would be the dormant accounting technologies, debated in the 1960 s, that would eventually reappear as NPM.

40|$|Objectives To {{explore the}} views of dental {{decision-makers}} in Primary Care Organisations {{with regard to the}} management of NHS dental services, and to gauge participants' awareness of economics-based approaches including <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis, with which to potentially structure commissioning decisions. Methods Recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 NHS dental decision-makers (mixed clinical and finance backgrounds) predominantly across Primary Care Trusts in England. Data were analysed using qualitative methods and the constant comparative approach. Results Participants were generally involved with contracting rather than commissioning new dental services at the time of interview. It was unclear how oral health needs assessments would guide future resource shifts and how commissioners would ensure the efficient use of finite resources. Whilst many participants thought that economic approaches would assist their commissioning decisions, few participants were aware of <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis as an alternative economics-based approach. Conclusions An assessment {{of the extent to which}} finite resources actually maximise the oral health of local populations is timely. Pragmatic economic approaches such as <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis may offer a framework to guide decision-makers through commissioning and the stages which lie beyond oral health needs assessments.
