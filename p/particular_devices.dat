50|$|Cleaning {{cards are}} {{disposable}} products designed {{to clean the}} interior contact points of a device that facilitates an electronic information transaction (point of sale terminal, automated teller machine, remote deposit check scanners, micr readers, magnetic stripe reader, bill acceptor, bill validator, access control locks, etc.). In order for the cleaning card to work properly in the device, the card resembles or mimics the material of the transaction media - such as a credit card, check, or currency. As the cleaning card is inserted and passed through the device, it will clean components that would normally {{come in contact with}} the transaction media such as readers, lenses, read/write chip and pins, belts, rollers, and paths.

5000|$|The Goldberg Variations {{have always}} enjoyed a special status, with pianists {{regarding}} {{them as a}} touchstone of their technical and interpretative powers. At stake are the ability to light up the work from within, a tightrope walk {{that at the same}} time describes a vast circle, starting out and returning to a state of apotheotic stillness, the ability to find one's bearings within a particular concentration of inner and outer complexity, an inner and outer coherence and homogeneity that are all-embracing, the ability, finally, to produce an explosion of inner cells by reduced means and, hence, a particular sensitivity, sinewy tension, and color. The performer must play a game with <b>particular</b> <b>devices,</b> finding solutions to the problems posed by the work not in octave doublings and other playful expedients but in a tightly structured inner rigor and order. What is demanded is a particular form of internalization, of inner and outer lyricism. It is this that makes the Goldberg Variations so unique - and so demanding.|$|E

Even if it did, [...] "it must necessarily be succeeded by lengthy judicial proceedings before {{the award is}} legally enforceable." [...] The majority was mistaken, he claimed, in assuming that if Congress had wanted to exempt 1933 Act claims from arbitration it would have included a provision to that effect: I submit that such a course would have been neither a usual nor a safe and proper method of draftsmanship. Here was intended a broad and general prohibition of limiting contracts. Had <b>particular</b> <b>devices</b> of restriction then been individually considered, it would nevertheless have been unwise to single them out for separate reference. For that would have suggested that other unrecalled devices were permissible. The language chosen is broad and general, as befits the intent. It seems to me wholly adequate and effective to safeguard the investor against loss of his right of suit under the Act and the important burden of proof which it grants in his favor.|$|E

5000|$|The {{typology}} of Lojban is basically subject-verb-object, with subject-object-verb also common.

The meaning of the sentence mi prami do is determined by prami realizing, with its own predefined place structure, a specific semantic relation between mi and do; when the positional relation between mi and do changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too.

5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and fan-out {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the driving device {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the <b>particular</b> <b>devices</b> being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|E
