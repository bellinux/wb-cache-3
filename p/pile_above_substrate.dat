40|$|Small (5 â€“ 10. 9 mm {{carapace}} length), medium (11 â€“ 15. 9 mm), {{and large}} (16 â€“ 20. 9 mm) juveniles of Metapenaeus anchistus, Metapenaeus sp., Penaeus monodon and P. merguiensis were stocked individually in glass tanks provided with sand substrate, sea water, artificial bamboo shelter, aeration and food. The seven activity types (recorded for each shrimp hourly for 24 h) {{were classified as}} below (burrowing) or <b>above</b> <b>substrate</b> (swimming, walking, stationary, in shelter, feeding and cleaning). Shrimp juveniles exhibited a strong diel periodicity â€” emergence and activity at night and burrowing in the day. The chi-square test showed that type of activity (above/below substrate) was associated with period (light/dark). Diurnal burrowing was greater among Metapenaeus than Penaeus; inversely, <b>above</b> <b>substrate</b> activities were more frequent for Penaeus species compared to Metapenaeus. Feeding was the major <b>above</b> <b>substrate</b> and nocturnal activity for M. anchistus, Metapenaeus sp. and P. monodon. Only P. Monodon used the shelter consistently. Frequency of the 7 activity types was dependent on juvenile size for Penaeus, e. g., the preference for shelters shifted to burrowing with increase in size in P. monodon. Results are discussed {{in relation to the}} importance of mangrove habitats in providing shelter to penaeids, in particular the mangrove-associated P. monodon and P. merguiensis...|$|R

50|$|Super Swap is an arcade puzzle {{game with}} {{elements}} of a match-3 genre. Blocks fall {{from the top of}} the upper screen to the bottom of the touch screen, one by one. A player has to use a stylus to click on blocks and to drag them in one of 4 directions. Dragging enables the player to swap blocks and as the result to remove pieces off the board by making 3-in-a row or more matches. Combos can be only achieved in a horizontal or vertical row. Objects can be swapped even while they're still falling. If blocks <b>pile</b> <b>above</b> the bottom of the upper screen, it is game over.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Many animals orient to odor {{sources in}} aquatic {{habitats}} where different flows and substrates affect the hydrodynamics of benthic boundary layers. Since the dispersal of chemicals {{is due to}} the fluid mechanics of a particular environment, wc quantified the changes in the fine structure of an odor plume under different hydrodynamic conditions in the benthic boundary layer of a laboratory flume. We sampled turbulent odor plumes at t 0 Hz using a microchcmical sensor (150 pm diameter) under two flow speeds: 3. 8 and 14. 4 cm/sec, and at 1, 8, 50 mm <b>above</b> the <b>substrate.</b> These distances <b>above</b> the <b>substrate</b> occur within different flow regions of the boundary layer and correlate with the location of crustacean chemosensory appendages within boundary layer flows. The high flow velocity exhibited a greater level of turbulence and had more discrete odor pulses than the low flow velocity. In general, odor signals howed a high level of temporal variation in fast flow at heights 1 and 8 mm <b>above</b> the <b>substrate.</b> In slow flow, temporal variation was maximal at 50 mm <b>above</b> the <b>substrate,</b> exhibiting mow variance than the same height at the fast flow.
