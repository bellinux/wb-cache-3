50|$|Pentathionate ion is {{obtained}} {{by the action of}} SCl2 on the thiosulfate ion and Wackenroder solution by adding to it potassium acetate. Initially prismatic crystals of potassium tetrathionate fall, then lamellar crystals of potassium pentathionate, from which the influence of tartaric acid makes an aqueous solution of <b>pentathionic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
30|$|Hydrogen sulfide emitted {{under the}} {{reaction}} (2) immediately reacts with the sulfurous gas {{that had been}} formed at the thiosulfuric acid decomposition. At this moment, sulfur is emitted again and the whole process repeats from the beginning until complete transformation of thiosulfuric acid to <b>pentathionic</b> <b>acid</b> according to the ultimate Equation (3). The reaction (2) was not described in literature till present.|$|E
30|$|At room temperature, the {{transformation}} of thiosulfuric acid to tetrathionic or <b>pentathionic</b> <b>acid</b> occurs with rather high yields {{in the presence of}} organic base ions, containing an alkyl chain with at least 7 - 6 carbon atoms. Further reduction of the alkyl chain length leads to a drastic decrease in tetrathionate (and pentathionate) yields and to a respective increase in sulfur yields according to the reaction (1).|$|E
30|$|Under {{the effect}} of N-alkylpyridinium and N-alkylquinolinium ions, the thiosulfuric <b>acid</b> forms both <b>pentathionic</b> and tetrathionic <b>acids,</b> the last being formed as the main {{compound}} in many cases.|$|R
30|$|During {{our study}} of the thiosulfuric acid transformations in the {{presence}} of organic bases, we synthesized N-alkylpyridinium, N-alkylquinolinium, and dimethylalkylphenylammonium chlorides containing from 5 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain (Volynskiy and Smolyaninov 1963). We studied the dependency between the polythionic acid formation and the structure of nitrogen bases in more details, and our investigations showed that {{in the presence of}} salts of dimethyldecyl-, dimethylnonyl- or dimethyloctylphenylammonium the thiosulfuric acid is transformed to <b>pentathionic</b> <b>acid</b> according to the Equation (3).|$|E

If one lets sulfurous acid {{in water}} and {{hydrogen}} sulfide work on the other, then Polythionic acid form and sulfur, what latter after DEBUS (Chem. News 57. 87) a new allotropic modification {{with the ability to}} form with water a colloidal solution is to be (sulfur δ). The alleged <b>Pentathionic</b> <b>acid</b> shows up with intensive illumination not as an homogeneous body, but as a colloidal solution, and the sulfur δ of DEBUS not a allotropic modification, but a hydrate is S 8 •H 2 O. One receives it, if one removes and up to the constant weight in the vacuum dries the acid from with above reaction the formed S by months-long dialyze with daily fresh water, as a yellowish, partially translucent mass from conchoidal break; there is 51. 6 % sulfur when washing with CS 2. The part unsolvable in CS 2 dismisses from about 80 ° at water, with the melting point of the S the formula S 8 •H 2 O appropriate quantity (S 8 = molecular size of the firm S!). The density of hydrate pressed in cylinder form amounts to with 19 °, related to water of 4 °, 1. 9385; meadow after 93. 6 / 2. 07 6. 4 / 1 = 51. 6; = 100 / 51. 6 = 1. 9380 on octahedral S, if were residual insoluble S not after removal water in CS 2. Powdered hydrate loses 2. 41 % H 2 O, the pressed 1. 33 % with 7 -monthly standing over H 2 SO 4; it thus has a vapor pressure. A part of hydrate is destroyed; simultaneous increased its density. If the drained body with water remains in contact, then the density decreases again; it exists thus a condition of the S, which connects itself directly with water, and which delivers the water in the dry medium again. In the desiccator partially S give in powder form 3. 1 %, in the pressed condition 5. 8 % at CS 2 in solution dehydrated. Pressure favors thus the transition of the matter to a condition of larger density. Reprinted with the permission of the American Chemical Society. Copyright © 2010. American Chemical Society (ACS).
