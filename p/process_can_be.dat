5|$|A {{stochastic}} <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> classified {{in different}} ways, for example, by its state space, its index set, or the dependence among the random variables. One common way of classification {{is by the}} cardinality of the index set and the state space.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{when two}} or more rats from the same litter are {{of the same sex}} they live {{together}} with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> easy or hard. Several measures have to be taken to provide security for both rats.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is {{most commonly used}} with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|The {{homogeneous}} Poisson <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{defined and}} generalized in different ways. It {{can be defined}} such that its index set is the real line, and this stochastic process is also called the stationary Poisson process. If the parameter constant of the Poisson process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of , the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the Poisson process is an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.|$|E

5|$|Venus {{is known}} {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> understood as the field lines wrapping around an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or random <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} sequence demonstrates mapping a band configuration to a counting symmetry equivalence class. Begin with a valid band configuration (1). Build column triplets {{by ordering}} the column values within each column. This {{is not a}} valid Sudoku band, but does place the same constraints on the lower bands as the example (2). Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column and box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column and box ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID {{will have the same}} number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to build the largest possible band counting symmetry equivalence classes (3).|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
5|$|This <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, {{not with the}} cells of the automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
