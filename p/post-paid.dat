5|$|A few early issued {{items were}} {{embossed}} but generally the <b>post-paid</b> impressed stamps were typographed. The Revenue Stamping Branch, Dublin Castle, applied the impressed indicia until 1984, when An Post employed the typographic printing method.|$|E
5|$|Postal {{stationery}} {{have been}} produced {{in the form of}} registered envelopes, postal cards, envelopes, letter cards, newspaper wrappers, airletters and telegram forms with different designs of impressed stamp applied to show that postage had been pre-paid. Except for limited early usage of previously issued British postal stationery, which were not overprinted like the postage stamps, all <b>post-paid</b> impressed stamps before 1984 were based on variations of a design showing the country's name in Irish, Éire, with appropriate values in text and numeral tablets centred around an Irish harp motif. This was initially superseded by a shamrock design that later became loosely based on the logo of wavy lines and the word POST used by An Post from 1984. An Post has also used some designs based on postage stamps as <b>post-paid</b> impressed stamps on Irish postal stationery.|$|E
5|$|At independence, a King George V 5 pence {{registered}} {{envelope and}} 1 shilling telegram form were printed in green {{for use in}} Ireland until domestic products became available. Irish telegram forms were only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered envelopes have appeared in many values and sizes. The printed (but non-stamped) registered envelopes were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so envelopes from former periods, showing out-dated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors. Other products have carried <b>post-paid</b> imprint, such as commemorative and special issue postcards, including a series of St. Patrick's Day cards issued annually since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Known as the {{stamping}} privilege, companies, {{associations and}} individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official <b>post-paid</b> indicia. Window envelopes were popular for printed matter rate mail. The most prolific user was the Electricity Supply Board which used meter reading and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered envelopes are known. Apparently An Post have withdrawn the stamping privilege without any public notice, because stamped-to-order postal stationery has seldom been seen since An Post {{took control of the}} Irish Post Office in 1984, with only five users recorded by Jung. Between 1963 and 2000 a few philatelically influenced items are known produced by six users.|$|E

25|$|Count 2: Modification of a {{revenue sharing}} {{agreement}} on pre-paid mobile services. Previously, telecom operators {{had to pay}} the TOT a percentage of their revenues for <b>post-paid</b> mobile services. To offer pre-paid services, which are generally cost less to the consumer, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a revenue sharing agreement for pre-paid services that offered less revenue to the TOT comprising an estimated loss of 14.2billion baht (revenue reduced from 25% to 20%) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56billion baht (revenue reduced from 30% to 20%) from 2006 to 2015. The judges ruled that {{the terms of the}} pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT's total revenue actually increased substantially {{as a result of the}} agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT's <b>post-paid</b> revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13% in 2001 to 80% in 2007, due almost completely to pre-paid services, and the reduction in AIS market share from 68% to 53% in the same period were not taken into account by the court.|$|E

The service was launched on 26 July 2005 as Ireland's fourth mobile network operator behind Vodafone, O2 and Meteor. 3's coverage {{is made up}} of a single 2,100MHz band UMTS network, with claims of 96% population coverage and 500,000 subscribers. A roaming agreement with Vodafone provides GSM coverage where no UMTS signal is available. Service was initially offered as <b>post-paid</b> only, but on 16 May 2006 the introduction of a pre-paid service, known as 3Pay, was announced. A pre-paid mobile broadband service was launched on 29 February 2008 under the name 3Pay Broadband, with vouchers available for durations of one day, one week, or one month. On 13 May 2010, 3 Ireland announced the launch of the world's first commercial voice and data I-HSPA network. In July 2012, 3 Ireland announced a strategic partnership with Vodafone Ireland to share network infrastructure. This facilitated rapid rollout of 3 Ireland's 4G network, while also making it less costly. When a 3 user is using 2G or Edge connection, they are using Vodafone's 2G network, as 3 are a 3G/HSDPA network only. In November 2012 it was awarded LTE spectrum by auction, along with the three other incumbent network operators. On 24 June 2013, it was announced that Hutchison would acquire Telefónica's Irish mobile operations, O2 for €780 million, to be merged into 3 Ireland upon completion of the deal. As of 2014, The European Commission has agreed to the go ahead of the merge. On 27 January 2014, Three launched their 4G network in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford and Waterford.
