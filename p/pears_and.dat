5|$|During the Middle Ages, farming was {{the most}} {{important}} activity in the area, and farming, both arable and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, <b>pears,</b> <b>and</b> plums. Evidence exists of lime kilns, used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.|$|E
5|$|Together with <b>Pears</b> <b>and</b> the {{librettist}} {{and producer}} Eric Crozier, Britten founded the annual Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, {{and he was}} responsible for the creation of Snape Maltings concert hall in 1967. In his last year, he was the first composer to be given a life peerage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the section}} on sweets, David {{comments}} that throughout the Mediterranean countries, the more complicated sweets are very often bought from pâtisseries; the few recipes she gives are for simple, traditional sweets made at home, such as torrijas (also called pain perdu) and cold orange soufflé. The jams, chutneys and preserves section includes preserved melon alongside more familiar fruits such as <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> plums.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{identification}} of phytopathogenic bacteria isolated from blasted <b>pear</b> blossoms <b>and</b> rotted radish leaves was tried by the direct colony TLC and whole cellular fatty acid analysis. All the 22 reference strains of fluorescent pscudomonads exhibited similar chromatograms {{with those of}} the <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> radish strains at the direct colony TLC. A dendrogram of strains based on fatty acid compositions showed that all pathovars of P. syringae, P. viridiflava <b>and</b> the <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> radish strains were closely related with lauric acid and palmitoieic acid as their major fatty acids. On the other hand, P. marginalis, P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa predominantly containing an unidentified fatty acid, were clustered separately. The results of the direct colony TLC and fatty acid analysis suggested that the <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> radish strains belonged to P. syringae or P. viridiflava. Physiological and biochemical tests of the <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> radish strains confirmed that <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> radish strains were P. syringae and P. viridiflava, respectively. The direct colony TLC and/or whole cellular fatty acid analysis in combination with some selected physiological and biochemical tests will be convenient and practical approach for rapid {{identification of}} phytopathogenic bacteria...|$|R

5|$|Qandil {{was born}} in Cairo in 1936 to a father from Menoufia. He was the eldest of five children. Qandil {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} and had his primary schooling in the Nile Delta city of Tanta. His father had moved the middle-income family to that city, where he owned a few feddans of land mostly planted with <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> grapes. Qandil's father primarily distributed them to neighbors and others close to him.|$|E
5|$|Awarded a {{scholarship}} to Oxford, Williams read Greats (pure Classics followed by Ancient History and philosophy) at Balliol. Among his influences at Oxford were WS Watt, R Meiggs, RM Hare, Elizabeth Anscombe, Eric Dodds, Eduard Fraenkel, David <b>Pears</b> <b>and</b> Gilbert Ryle. He shone {{in the first part}} of the course, the pure classics (being particularly fond of writing Latin verses in the style of Ovid) and graduated in 1951 with a congratulatory first in the second part of the course and a prize fellowship at All Souls.|$|E
5|$|The Aldeburgh Festival was {{launched}} in June 1948, with Britten, <b>Pears</b> <b>and</b> Crozier directing it. Albert Herring played at the Jubilee Hall, and Britten's new cantata for tenor, chorus and orchestra, Saint Nicolas, was presented in the parish church. The festival was an immediate success and became an annual event that has continued into the 21st century. New works by Britten featured in almost every festival {{until his death in}} 1976, including the premieres of his operas A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Jubilee Hall in 1960 and Death in Venice at Snape Maltings Concert Hall in 1973.|$|E

5|$|In November 1937, Baylis {{died of a}} heart attack. Her three {{companies}} continued under the direction of her appointed successors: Tyrone Guthrie at the Old Vic, in overall charge of both theatres, with de Valois running the ballet, and Carey and two colleagues running the opera. In the Second World War, the government requisitioned Sadler's Wells as a refuge for those made homeless by air-raids. Guthrie decided to keep the opera going as a small touring ensemble of 20 performers. Between 1942 and the war's end in 1945, the company toured continuously, visiting 87 venues. Joan Cross led and managed the company, and also sang leading soprano roles in its productions when needed. The size of the company was increased to 50, and then to 80. By 1945, its members included singers from a new generation such as Peter <b>Pears</b> <b>and</b> Owen Brannigan, and the conductor Reginald Goodall.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds are {{adversely}} {{impacted by}} land and undergrowth clearing, and have vanished from some habitats thus altered. Despite this, they {{are classified as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List as they occur over a wide range, have a large population, and the population decline is not rapid. Red wattlebirds are regularly killed by cats and dogs, {{as well as being}} hit by cars on roads. In 1924 in northern Victoria, the red wattlebird was described as very wary, on account of being highly regarded (and shot) for its meat. Indeed, it was shot widely for food or sport, or because it was held to be a pest of vineyards or orchards. On occasion, red wattlebirds have raided vineyards and orchards for grapes, stone fruit, figs, olives, loquats, apples, <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> berries, which they puncture and extract the juice or flesh from.|$|E
5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{around the}} village of Moreton, which has now been totally submerged, found evidence of a thriving community in medieval times and possibly {{the remains of the}} Nunnery of Santa Cruz. During the Middle Ages farming was the most important activity in the area covered by the lake, supported by four flour mills powered by the River Chew. Stratford Mill was demolished and re-erected in the grounds of Blaise Castle Museum, in north-west Bristol. The largest settlement was Moreton, which is listed in the Domesday Book and survived until the flooding of the lake, when the remains of the Moreton Cross were moved to Chew Stoke Parish Church. There is evidence of lime kilns, which were used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches. Farming, both arable and dairy, continued until the flooding of the lake, with most households also keeping pigs. There were orchards for fruit production, including apples, <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> plums. Moreton was also the site of gunpowder mill in the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|More than 26,000 square {{kilometres}} (10,000sqmi) of Victorian farmland are sown for grain, {{mostly in}} the state's west. More than 50% of this area is sown for wheat, 33% for barley and 7% for oats. A further 6,000 square kilometres (2,300sqmi) is sown for hay. In 2003–04, Victorian farmers produced more than 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2million tonnes of barley. Victorian farms produce nearly 90% of Australian <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> third of apples. It is also a leader in stone fruit production. The main vegetable crops include asparagus, broccoli, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes.

Fructose levels in grapes varies depending on ripeness and variety, where unripe grapes contain more glucose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pears</b> <b>and</b> Britten {{maintained}} an arduous international touring schedule, and made many broadcasts and gramophone recordings.
