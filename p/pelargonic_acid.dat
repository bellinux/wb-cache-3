40|$|Abstract. Catalytic {{oxidation}} of {{oleic acid}} with ozone gas by using ozone-generator and solvent free medium {{in the presence}} of WO 3 -Polypyrrole (ppy) nanocomposite was studied. Azelaic <b>acid</b> (AA) and <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acids</b> (PA) are the major reaction products, however the percentage of AA production is significantly higher than PA. Experimental results concluded that tungsten oxide and tungten oxide on polypyrrole are suitable catalysts in terms of their selectivity and activity. Reaction is done in two steps within 90 minute, showing the reasonable promotion in selectivity to AA by using WO 3 -ppy catalyst system compared to reaction with WO 3 as catalyst. WO 3 -ppy nanocomposite is prepared by sonication method and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, and FESEM analysis.

50|$|After {{completing}} the addition a reagent is then added {{to convert the}} intermediate ozonide to a carbonyl derivative. Reductive work-up conditions are far more commonly used than oxidative conditions. The use of triphenylphosphine, thiourea, zinc dust, or dimethyl sulfide produces aldehydes or ketones while the use of sodium borohydride produces alcohols. The use of hydrogen peroxide produces carboxylic acids. Recently, the use of amine N-oxides {{has been reported to}} produce aldehydes directly. Other functional groups, such as benzyl ethers, can also be oxidized by ozone. It has been proposed that small amounts of acid may be generated during the reaction from oxidation of the solvent, so pyridine is sometimes used to buffer the reaction. Dichloromethane is often used as a 1:1 cosolvent to facilitate timely cleavage of the ozonide. Azelaic <b>acid</b> and <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acids</b> are produced from ozonolysis of oleic acid on an industrial scale.|$|R
40|$|Liquid-phase {{catalytic}} oxidation of oleic acid with hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence}} of various transition metal/metal oxide catalysts was studied in a batch autoclave reactor. Azelaic and <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acids</b> are the major reaction products. Tungsten and tantalum and their oxides in supported and unsupported forms were used as catalysts. Alumina pellets and Kieselguhr powder were used as supports for the catalysts. Tungsten, tantalum, molybdenum, zirconium, and niobium were also examined as catalysts. Tertiary butanol was used as solvent. Experimental results concluded that tungsten and tungstic oxide are more suitable catalysts in terms of their activity and selectivity. The rate of reaction observed in the case of supported catalysts appears to be comparable or superior to that of unsupported catalysts. In pure form, tungsten, tantalum, and molybdenum showed strong catalytic activity in the oxidation reaction; however, except for tantalum the other two were determined to be economically unfeasible. Zirconium and niobium showed very little catalytic activity. Based on the experimental observations, tungstic oxide supported on silica is the most suitable catalyst for the oxidation of oleic acid with 85 % of the starting oleic acid converted to the oxidation products in 60 min of reaction with high selectivity for azelaic acid...|$|R

50|$|The active {{ingredient}} in pepper-spray is capsaicin, {{which is a}} chemical derived from the fruit of plants in the Capsicum genus, including chilies. A synthetic analogue of capsaicin, <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> vanillylamide (desmethyldihydrocapsaicin), is used in another version of pepper spray known as PAVA spray which {{is used in the}} United Kingdom. Another synthetic counterpart of pepper spray, <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> morpholide, was developed and is widely used in Russia. Its effectiveness compared to natural pepper spray is uncertain and it reportedly has caused some injuries. When undesirables threaten an area, such as a riot after a soccer game, riot police are called in to subdue them. In these situations, the police may use pepper spray, or water cannons to neutralize the threat.Pepper spray typically comes in canisters, which are often small enough to be carried or concealed in a pocket or purse. Pepper spray can also be bought concealed in items such as rings. There are also pepper spray projectiles available, which can be fired from a paintball gun. Having been used for years against demonstrators, it is increasingly being used by police in routine interventions.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidative}} cleavage of unsaturated {{fatty acids}} into aldehydes or carboxylic acids gives access to valuable products. The products {{can be used}} as chemical building blocks, as emulsifiers or in the paint or polymer industry. Ozonolysis is applied industrially to cleave the fatty acid oleic acid into the aldehydes nonanal and 9 -oxo-nonanoic <b>acid</b> or into <b>pelargonic</b> and azelaic <b>acid.</b> Considerable hazards, including explosion risks, are {{associated with the use of}} ozone, and alternative processes are desired. Catalytic alternatives typically comprise systems based on second- and third-row transition metals. Alternatively, Fe-catalysts would be attractive, as this first-row metal is non-toxic, cheap and abundant. In this thesis, the first examples of iron-based catalysts for the oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids were developed. Chapter 1 gives a comprehensive review of the reported transition metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavage methods. Many examples involve methods using second- and third-row transition metals; first-row transition metal systems have almost exclusively been used for the oxidative cleavage of styrene derivatives. No examples had been reported of the oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids with first row transition metal complexes. The main strategy for the development of such an oxidative cleavage process in the subsequent chapters aims at a sequence of reactions consisting of alkene epoxidation, followed by hydrolysis into trans-diols, and further oxidation into either the aldehydes or carboxylic acids. Chapter 2 introduces a metal-free method for the oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids into their corresponding carboxylic acids. The combination of oxone and periodate is shown to mediate this reaction in a clean and selective manner. The method involves a straightforward procedure and allows for the facile isolation of the product. In Chapter 3 an Fe-(BPBP) -based (N,N’-bis(2 -picolyl) - 2, 2 ’-bipyrrolidine) system is presented that is capable of catalytic oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids to the corresponding aldehydes using hydrogen peroxide and sodium periodate. No over-oxidation to the carboxylic acids is observed. The system operates at low catalyst loadings, under mild reaction conditions and at low temperatures. Chapter 4 explores the regioselectivity of the system developed in Chapter 3. The system is shown to be capable of regioselective oxidative cleavage of the electron-rich double bond in substrates containing multiple double bonds towards aldehydes. Trace amounts of acetic acid are added to improve selectivity and the rate of alkene epoxidation. The protocol outperforms those based on Ru, Os or W-salts, which are generally strongly oxidizing and lack regioselectivity as they oxidize multiple bonds in polyenes. Chapter 5 reports the Fe-(6 -Me-PyTACN) -based (1 -[(6 -methyl- 2 -pyridyl) methyl]- 4, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane) oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids and esters to the carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide and sodium periodate. Indeed, the Fe-catalyst is capable to oxidize the aldehyde intermediates to the carboxylic acids. Chapter 6 finally presents a study of new non-heme Fe-based complexes of the bapbpy (N 6,N 6 ’-bis(pyridine- 2 -yl) -[2, 2 ’-bipyridine]- 6, 6 ’-diamine) ligand family including structural, spectroscopic, electrochemical and spin-crossover features of two Fe(II) complexes. The reaction with peroxides is studied by computational means and through mechanistic studies at low temperature. Such complexes are able to epoxidize alkenes with hydrogen peroxide under oxidant-limiting conditions...|$|R

Mature fish were exposed to gallic or <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> at the concentrations of 0, 0. 05, 0. 5 and 5 mg/L during one month under semi-static conditions. Fecundity, hatching rate and median hatching time were regularly evaluated. Circulating sex hormone levels (11 ketotestosterone 211 KT, 17 bestradiol -E 2 -), plasma vitellogenin (Vtg), and gonad histology were monitored in males and females after exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total glutathione peroxydase (GPx) and glutathione-S transferase (GST) activities were assessed as enzymatic biomarkers of exposure in fish liver.

40|$|Sarmentine, 1 -(1 -pyrrolidinyl) -(2 E, 4 E) - 2, 4 -decadien- 1 -one, is {{a natural}} amide {{isolated}} from the fruits of Piper species. The compound {{has a number of}} interesting biological properties, including its broad-spectrum activity on weeds as a contact herbicide. Initial studies highlighted a similarity in response between plants treated with sarmentine and herbicidal soaps such as <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> (nonanoic acid). However, little was known about the mechanism of action leading to the rapid desiccation of foliage treated by sarmentine. In cucumber cotyledon disc-assays, sarmentine induced rapid light-independent loss of membrane integrity at 100 µM or higher concentration, whereas 3 mM <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> was required for a similar effect. Sarmentine was between 10 and 30 times more active than <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> on wild mustard, velvetleaf, redroot pigweed and crabgrass. Additionally, the potency of 30 µM sarmentine was greatly stimulated by light, suggesting that this natural product may also interfere with photosynthetic processes. This was confirmed by observing a complete inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport at that concentration. Sarmentine also acted as an inhibitor of photosystem II on isolated thylakoid membranes by competing for the binding site of plastoquinone. This can be attributed in part to structural similarities between herbicides like sarmentine and diuron. While this mechanism of action accounts for the light stimulation of the activity of sarmentine, it does not account for its ability to destabilize membranes in darkness. In this respect, sarmentine has some structural similarity to crotonoyl-CoA, the substrate of enoyl-ACP reductase, a key enzyme in the early steps of fatty acid synthesis. Inhibitors of this enzyme, such as triclosan, cause rapid loss of membrane integrity in the dark. Sarmentine inhibited the activity of enoyl-ACP reductase, with an I 50 app of 18. 3 µM. Therefore, the herbicidal activity of sarmentine appears to be a complex proces...|$|E

Unsaturated fatty acids from vegetable oils constitute a highly promising renewable resource {{that can be used}} to diversify productions, decreasing reliance on petroleum. A starting material rich in oleic acid has been obtained through the selection of high-oleic sunflower varieties and enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil they produce. The double bonds of this unsaturated raw material have been cleaved in green oxidizing conditions involving a biphasic lipophilic-aqueous system including hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant and a peroxo-tungsten complex Q 3 {PO 2 [WO(O 2) 2] 4 } as a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC) and co-oxidant.

Several formulations of alternative herbicides applied singly or repeatedly during the growing season were evaluated and compared with conventional herbicides (glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium) or with flaming or mulching.

Despite their extensive use in man-made applications, little is known regarding their potential risks to aquatic vertebrates. The aim of this work was to assess the acute toxicity of these polyphenolic and fatty acid compounds to the zebrafish. In order to get insights into sublethal effects, the enzyme activity of usual biomarkers related to oxidative stress and biotransformation were also assessed in fish. These latter included total superoxide dismutase, catalase as well as total glutathione peroxidase for antioxidant defence mechanisms and glutathione S-transferase for biotransformation related enzyme. Gallic acid was practically non-toxic (96 -h lethal concentration (LC 50) > 100 mg/L) whereas <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> was slightly toxic (96 -h LC 50 of 81. 2 mg/L). Moreover, biomarker analyses indicated enhanced superoxide dismutase activity in fish exposed to 20, 40 and 100 mg/L of gallic acid compared to control. A dose-dependent induction of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase was reported following gallic acid exposure at the tested concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 mg/L, with the exception of 100 mg/L of substance where basal activity levels were reported.

Other treatments included <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> (7 % v/v), glyphosate (1. 06 kg ai/ha), and no-herbicide (control).

Weed biomass and percent weed cover were collected at the end of the 2010 season. Mulches each provided significant weed suppression in the first year, but each mulch presented unique challenges over time.

D.), School of the Environment, Washington State UniversityThe {{effects of}} {{herbicides}} used on arid {{lands in the}} Columbia Basin, Washington State on components of biological soil crusts (BSCs) were investigated. Active ingredients in the herbicides investigated were two synthetic auxins, picloram and aminopyralid, and two enzyme inhibitors, glyphosate and imazapic. Moss and lichens of the BSC were {{the focus of the}} study; soil algae and cyanobacteria were also examined. In a retrospective field study, evidence indicated statistically significant association between glyphosate and low levels of BSC. The same study found no evidence for association between either picloram or imazapic and diminished BSC. In a controlled experiment, collected lichen and moss specimens were sprayed with herbicide (aminopyralid, glyphosate, or imazapic) in the lab and monitored for 31 to 37 days. Periodically sections were examined at 100 X with a fluorescent microscope and levels of red fluorescence were measured for lichen green algae photobionts or moss chloroplasts. After weeks of observation, the chloroplasts of the herbicide exposed organisms were intact. Experiments involving herbicides diquat or <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> indicated that these herbicides are very toxic to BSC organisms. School of the Environment, Washington State Universit...|$|E
40|$|Within {{restoration}} practices, the biodeterioration is {{a common}} and hard problem, in particular on historic stonework conservation, where, together with weathering actions, enlarge porosity and increase the decay. The chemical action with biocides is the more used method to remove biological patina on monumental stone but, during the time, that approach reveal hazardous environmental and health impacts. In recent time, innovative biotechnology methods have been developed but used only to a minor extent; that {{is due to the}} less information about the interaction of the new products with stone material. The aim of the research is to propose innovative and safe bio cleaning products for historic stonework conservation and define the level of security in the interaction with stone material. The two biological biocides, that has not been investigated previously, are Natria, a Bayer products based on <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid,</b> and New FloorCleaner, based on Bacillus species. The specimens for our research are made up from an historical stone material (earlier twenty century handmade bricks) and we used the Normal UNI 11551 - 1 : 2014, the European protocol for the evaluation of a cleaning method in the Cultural Heritage. Our results show that biocleaning products are harmless: overall, the research demonstrates the opportunity to use these products in the conservation field, for the treatment of biological patina of historical brick, because do not highlight problems and damages and are environmentally sustainabl...|$|E
40|$|In {{agricultural}} systems, weeds can dramatically reduce {{crop yields}} (by the constant competition {{for water and}} nutrients) and interfere with plant functions to suppress their growth causing huge economic losses. Yield losses can reach up to 34 % in crops. Plant extracts are known since {{a long time to}} have phytotoxicity potentialities and could be used as new natural compounds with bioherbicide activities. The study began with the selection of ten plant species suspected to be phytotoxic due to their wealth of phenolic, terpene and alcaloid compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids coumarins. Then, three weeds were selected from Maghreb and European weeds as models (Phalaris minor, Sylibum marianum and Trifolium incanatum). Aerial plant materials were grounded and macerated with methanol for 24 H. Methanol was then eliminated along rotavapor. The yield of plant extract varied between 5. 29 % and 29. 71 % following the species. The essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger type apparatus (with a yield of 1. 2 %). Methanol extracts and the essential oil were then tested for their herbicidal activity in post-emergence assays against the three weeds species. The most active extracts were selected and formulated to increase their efficiency. Post-emergence bioassays consisted in spraying each extract at 3 concentrations (7500, 20000 and 340000 ppm) at 2 leaves stage. <b>Pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> was used as commercial positive control at 34000 ppm. After 7 days on incubation in greenhouses, results showed that E 6, presented poor phytotoxicity against three weeds at 7500 and 20000 ppm. However, E 6 caused total wilting and several leaf blight against Phalaris minor and Trifolium incanatum and sever necrosis against Sylibum marianum. At that higher concentration of 34000 ppm., the extracts E 3 and E 8 and the essential oil appeared also phytotoxic. The three extracts and the essential oil were selected for the formulation. After formulation to enhance the distribution, the coverage and the penetration of the active molecules at 34000 ppm, E 3, E 6, E 8 and essential oil presented a high herbicidal activity compared with the extracts without formulation. E 6 with the formulation has completely punctured Trifolium incanatum and suppressed growth of Phalaris minor and Sylibum marianum. The results of this study reveal that plant extracts, after formulation, are more effective in inhibiting weed growth. The strong weed suppressive ability of formulated E 6 therefore offers interesting possibilities as an effective natural environment-friendly approach for weed management. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The use of plant-derived {{products}} in postharvest disease management {{may be a}} valid alternative to conventional chemical treatments (Pane et al., 2016). Unfavorable environmental conditions (such as salt and drought) increase production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, Tunisian plants have developed adaptive responses including the synthesis of specific bioactive molecules used for medical and nutritional purposes (Ksouri et al., 2012). In that context, the main objective {{of the present study}} was the identification of essential oils from Tunisian plants against the important plant pathogens, particularly in Europe. The study began with the selection of endemic medicinal plant suspected to present antimicrobial properties. The essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger type apparatus (with a yield of 1. 2 %). The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained by hydro-distillation from the aerial parts was analyzed by GC/MS. Therefore, antifungal activity was evaluated against Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum, using ELISA microplates with a blocked randomized design, as described previously (Kouassi et al., 2012). In addition, the essential oil was then tested for their herbicidal activities in pre-emergence and post-emergence assays against three weeds species. The chromatographic analysis showed a complex mixture where twenty compounds were identified accounting for 98. 75 % of the total oil. Monoterpenes was represented by 71. 73 %. The dominant monoterpenes are α Pinene (7. 09 %), 1, 8 -Cineole (54. 6 %) and Camphor (12. 27 %). Essential oil reduced significantly spores germination in a dose-dependent manner. Their fungistatic activity reached 100 % at 0. 6 % against Fusarium oxysporum. In the dose response bioassay, the essential oil reduced seed germination rate of Phalaris minor, Sylibum marianum and Trifolium incanatum. Seedling growth was measured by shoot and root lengths at day 7. At 0. 5 %, essential oil reduced 100 % seed germination. Post-emergence bioassays consisted in spraying essential oil at 3 concentrations (0. 75, 2 and 3. 4 %) at 2 leaves stage of three weeds species. <b>Pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> was used as commercial positive control at 3. 4 %. At 0. 75 % and 2 %, the essential oil do not show any sign of injury. However, only at 3. 4 %, the spraying of essential oil showed visible injury ranging from wilting (after 1 day) and chlorosis (after 3 day) on Trifolium incanatum and Phalaris minor. After formulation, to enhance the distribution, the coverage and the penetration of the active molecules, the essential oil presented a high herbicidal activity. In conclusion, this work allowed to open new perspectives on the application of Tunisian essential oil as Novel biocontrol strategies against damageable plant pathogens and weeds.
