5|$|M-46 is one {{of three}} trans-peninsular {{highways}} in the Lower Peninsula, starting blocks away from Lake Michigan in Muskegon and running almost to Lake Huron in Port Sanilac. The other two highways that do this are M-55 (Manistee– Tawas City) and M-72 (Empire–Harrisville). The highway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highway highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 1,855vehicles used the highway daily near the eastern terminus. The <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> volumes were the 30,505vehicles AADT along the section of M-46 immediately east of the US31 freeway near Muskegon. The trunkline has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) between the western terminus and US31, and between Cedar Springs and the M-53 junction in Sanilac County. The NHS is a network of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{represents the}} application of the mitigation schemes in order to remove hazardous conditions on freeways during <b>peak</b> hour <b>traffic.</b> For this study, about 18 km long section of Eastern Freeway in Melbourne (Australia) is selected as a test bed. Two mitigation schemes i. e. Ramp Metering and Variable Speed Limit have been selected in this study for conducting scenario analysis to reduce the hazard risks on freeways. These mitigation schemes are tested under <b>peak</b> period <b>traffic</b> conditions in order to find out the best mitigation scheme. Percentage reduction in hazardous condition is used as the selection criterion for the best mitigation scheme under different traffic conditions.

25|$|Tolls {{are only}} {{collected}} from westbound traffic at the toll plaza {{on the east}} side of the bay. Since July 2010, the toll rate for passenger cars is $5. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $5 per axle. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the FasTrak electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only HOV lane, allowing carpool vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.|$|E
25|$|On April 7, 2014, {{the toll}} for users of FasTrak was {{increased}} from $5 to $6, while the toll for drivers using either {{the license plate}} tolling or the one time payment system was raised from $6 to $7. Bicycle, pedestrian, and northbound motor vehicle traffic remain toll free. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $7 per axle for those using license plate tolling or the one time payment system, and $6 per axle for FasTrak users. During <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> hours, carpool vehicles carrying two or more people and motorcycles pay a discounted toll of $4; drivers must have Fastrak {{to take advantage of}} this carpool rate.
