Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district. He faced a close general election race once—in the House elections of 1990—when he won by 978 votes in a race against Democrat David Worley. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, {{as well as most}} of the area's seats in the General Assembly, well into the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|There is {{preliminary}} evidence that enhanced <b>priming</b> <b>for</b> trauma-related cues {{plays a role}} in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A prospective study of 119 motor vehicle accident survivors investigated whether <b>priming</b> <b>for</b> trauma-related stimuli predicts PTSD. Participants completed a modified word-stem completion test comprising accident-related, traffic-related, general threat, and neutral words at 2 weeks post-trauma. <b>Priming</b> <b>for</b> accident-related words predicted PTSD at 6 months follow-up, even when initial symptom levels of PTSD and depression and <b>priming</b> <b>for</b> other words were controlled. The results are in line with the hypothesis that enhanced <b>priming</b> <b>for</b> traumatic material contributes to the development of chronic PTSD...|$|R

I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death.

25|$|Newton-John was <b>primed</b> <b>for</b> another {{comeback}} in 1992 when she compiled her third hits collection, Back to Basics – The Essential Collection 1971–1992, and planned her first tour since her Physical trek ten years earlier. Shortly after the album's release, Newton-John {{was diagnosed with}} breast cancer forcing her to cancel all publicity for the album including the tour.

25|$|All mammals, except {{humans and}} higher apes, have a carbohydrate, {{commonly}} known as alpha-gal (alpha-1, 3-galactose) in their tissue fluids. When a tick feeds on the blood of a mammal (bandicoot, possum, cat, dog etc.) it takes alpha-gal into the tick's digestive system. When the same tick attaches to the next host (e.g. a human) it transfers the alpha-gal to the tissues of that next host. The immune system of some humans recognises alpha-gal as foreign and so produces antibodies against it. In this case the antibody produced is IgE, which {{is the type of}} antibody responsible for most allergic reactions. Thus the human is <b>primed</b> <b>for</b> a delayed allergic reaction to subsequent ingestion of mammalian meats (not chicken or fish).|$|E

25|$|In {{semantic}} priming, {{the prime}} {{and the target}} are from the same semantic category and share features. For example, the word dog is a semantic <b>prime</b> <b>for</b> wolf, because the two are similar animals. Semantic priming is theorized to work because of spreading activation within associative networks. When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even {{if they are not}} words, morphemes can <b>prime</b> <b>for</b> complete words that include them. An example of this would be that the morpheme 'psych' can <b>prime</b> <b>for</b> the word 'psychology'.|$|R

500|$|Reviewers of {{the episode}} have also praised it for its {{character}} development. Todd Gilchrist of IGN said he thinks the key to The Simpsons longevity is its [...] "sentimental but not gooey" [...] approach to storytelling and character development. He cited [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] as an example and said: [...] "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the porker soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because we care about the characters, are invested in the story, and <b>primed</b> <b>for</b> a great gag." [...] The Niagara Gazettes Phil Dzikiy said that [...] "the character development and storytelling is perfect", noting that the episode was [...] "equally hilarious, touching and satirical".|$|E
40|$|A perceptual {{identification}} {{task was}} used to assess <b>priming</b> <b>for</b> words and pseudowords that in their upper- and lower-case formats either share few (high-shift items) or many (low-shift items) visual features. Equivalent <b>priming</b> was obtained <b>for</b> high-shift words repeated in the same- and different-case, and this priming was greatly reduced when there was a study/test modality shift. Accordingly, the cross-case priming was mediated, in large part, by modality specific perceptual codes. By contrast, <b>priming</b> <b>for</b> high-shift pseudowords was greatly reduced following the case manipulation, {{as was the case with}} high-shift words when they were randomly intermixed with pseudowords. Low-shift items were not affected by the case manipulation. Based on the overall pattern of results, I argue that different mechanisms mediate <b>priming</b> <b>for</b> words and pseudowords, and that J.

Smashing Pumpkins was preceded by smashing guitars, courtesy of Hole.

500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was <b>primed</b> <b>for</b> a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really {{be the way to}} break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.|$|E

He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self. He believed that many individuals had been [...] "culturally <b>primed</b> <b>for</b> what the New Age has to offer", with the New Age attracting [...] "expressive" [...] people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus. It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community. He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of religious conversion, others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion.|$|E
