The new Airbus A319s replaced the ageing Boeing 737-200 fleet, but the Boeing 737-800s continue in service, because SAA cancelled the A320 order before any aircraft were delivered.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, BIA's {{inability}} to become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger,</b> financially stronger organisation, the deep {{recession in the}} UK during the early 1990s, {{as well as the}} escalating jet fuel price and the collapse of the package tour market {{in the run-up to the}} first Gulf War during the summer of 1990 resulted in a 38% reduction in its passenger traffic (compared with the same period the year before) and were the main factors that forced the reconstituted BIA to cease all operations on 9 February 1991.|$|E
25|$|The {{heating plant}} and main {{controls}} cabin of Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station, like others support buildings, were planned between 1927 and 1929, before {{the construction of}} the new station (which began in 1933).

According to letters seized by US federal authorities from a Dundalk IRA member, Martin Quigley, who had travelled to the US to study computing at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, the organisation managed to smuggle an M82 to the Republic of Ireland just before his arrest in 1989.

25|$|On 16 April 1979, BBC2 {{adopted the}} world's first computer-generated ident, with the logo being drawn live {{every time it}} was played.

For {{the first few years of}} the ident, it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the ident where the ident scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D ident, was anything but. The old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours. However, in 1980, BBC2 got its own electronic clock including 3D legend and centre dot.|$|E
25|$|A code {{of conduct}} was {{launched}} in June 2013, to provide guidance for recruitment agencies on promoting and protecting the rights of migrant domestic workers in Lebanon. The code was developed {{in consultation with the}} International Organization for Migration, the Middle East Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and put together by the Lebanese Ministry of Labour, the Syndicate of Owners of Recruitment Agencies (SORA) in Lebanon and Caritas Lebanon. The Code of Conduct aims to uphold transparency in business operations; the disclosure of full information about the conditions of employment in Lebanon to the worker; no placements of underage workers; and verification of a worker’s qualifications. A workshop was organized by the International Labour Organization in 2013 in order to review the {{code of conduct}} and improve mechanisms to protect migrant domestic workers from forms of exploitation. A number of Syndicate of Recruitment Agencies in Lebanon (SORAL) were present to assess the code of conduct and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> project called “Promoting Rights for Women Domestic Workers in Lebanon” (PROWD).|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, {{both the}} railway and the canals were leased to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, with a 999-year lease {{starting}} in June 1864, but in 1874 the lease became a takeover, and the canals {{were just a}} small <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> undertaking. Users of the canals were unhappy with the high tolls {{and the lack of}} modernisation, and so in November 1888, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company was formed, with the intent of obtaining the canals from the railway company. They obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, which created the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, with an authorised capital of £1.5 million, and powers to buy the canals, by compulsory purchase if agreement could not be reached with the railway company. The transfer did not occur until 1895, when agreement was finally reached, and the Dearne and Dove Canal became part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation along with the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal.|$|E
25|$|The canal was {{originally}} conceived as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> scheme to link Aberdeen to Monymusk, via Inverurie, with a branch from Inverurie along {{the course of}} the Ury Glen to Insch. Captain George Taylor conducted a survey, which confirmed that the plan was feasible, in 1793, but by the time a subscription list was started, the plans had been truncated, with just the section from Aberdeen to Inverurie remaining. Advertisements appeared in the local press, listing the benefits of the enterprise, which included increasing the value of certain stone quarries and land. By 1795, some £11,000 had been pledged, and a general meeting was held, at which the subscribers decided that work would commence as soon at subscriptions reached £14,000. Notices were placed in the press, encouraging those wanted to see the canal completed to come forward and pledge their support. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 26 April 1796, which created The Company of Proprietors of the Aberdeenshire Canal Navigation, and authorised them to raise £20,000 in £50 shares. No person was permitted to have less than one share or more than 40. If required, they could raise an additional £10,000 either by issuing more shares, or by mortgaging the tolls which would be collected.|$|E
25|$|Sugihara had {{cooperated with}} Polish {{intelligence}} as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> Japanese–Polish cooperative plan. As the Soviet Union occupied sovereign Lithuania in 1940, many Jewish refugees from Poland (Polish Jews) {{as well as}} Lithuanian Jews tried to acquire exit visas. Without the visas, it was dangerous to travel, yet {{it was impossible to}} find countries willing to issue them. Hundreds of refugees came to the Japanese consulate in Kaunas, trying to get a visa to Japan. At the time, on the brink of the war, Lithuanian Jews made up one third of Lithuania's urban population and half of the residents of every town as well. The Dutch consul Jan Zwartendijk had provided some of them with an official third destination to Curaçao, a Caribbean island and Dutch colony that required no entry visa, or Surinam (which, upon independence in 1975, became Suriname). At the time, the Japanese government required that visas be issued only to those who had gone through appropriate immigration procedures and had enough funds. Most of the refugees did not fulfill these criteria. Sugihara dutifully contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry three times for instructions. Each time, the Ministry responded that anybody granted a visa should have a visa to a third destination to exit Japan, with no exceptions.|$|E

500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One should listen to them, but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere." [...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the [...] "smart and dangerous imperialists" [...] and the [...] "fools". Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger,</b> supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E
