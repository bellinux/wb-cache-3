25|$|In case of {{a sudden}} {{reduction}} of <b>pipe</b> <b>diameter,</b> without streamlining, the flow {{is not able to}} follow the sharp bend into the narrower pipe. As a result, there is flow separation, creating recirculating separation zones at the entrance of the narrower pipe. The main flow is contracted between the separated flow areas, and later on expands again to cover the full pipe area.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field. Studies of this whistle have shown that dynamic similarity based on the <b>pipe</b> <b>diameter</b> d as the characteristic length scale, and inlet mean flow speed U as the characteristic speed was not achieved, {{as shown in the}} lower figure on the right. A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of criteria and a generalized procedure {{for the design}} of an abrupt transition from a circular pipe to a rectangular open channel are presented. The rectangular channel must be 1. 0 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters</b> wide. Wider channels cause high waves which reflect from the channel sidewalls, may overtop the sidewalls, and produce severe disturbances in the channel. To permit the pipe to expand, the channel may be widened for a distance not exceeding 0. 5 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters</b> downstream from the pipe exit, and the floor of the channel may be lowered. The equations developed describe the locations of the water surface elements to within an average of 0. 11 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters</b> of their correct locations. The maximum anticipated location error is +/- 1. 4 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters.</b> The equations for the envelope curves covering the crests of the sidewall waves, which determine the channel sidewall height, provide an average freeboard of 0. 08 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters</b> and a maximum freeboard of 0. 31 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters.</b> When the envelope equations are used only 2 percent of the wall waves will overtop the sidewalls, the maximum overtopping being 0. 04 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters.</b> The average depth of flow-the depth at the wave nodes-is predicted by the equations to within a maximum deviation of + 0. 13 and - 0. 06 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters</b> of the observed depths. The average depth at the nodes is predicted by the equations within 0. 01 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters</b> of the observed average depth.

40|$|Measurements are {{presented}} {{of the initial}} rates of depressurization generated within ductile steel pipes in pneumatic rupture tests. The breach was initiated by failure of an axial, part-through, flat-bottomed defect machined in the outer surface of the pipe. The measured depressurization rates for supercritical defects are shown to be in agreement with values predicted by a theoretical model which assumes that the pipe hinges open. Where the initial defects are longer than two <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters,</b> {{the extent of the}} hinging section is defined by the initial defect length. For short initial defects, a significant breach does not develop until the defect has propagated axially to a length of the order of two <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters,</b> and hence the effective hinging length is two <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters</b> Initial depressurization rates for subcritical defects correlate with the Folias bulging parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|Detonations and deflagration-to-detonation {{transition}} (DDT) are experimentally {{studied in}} horizontal pipes which are partially filled with water. The gas layer {{above the water}} is stoichiometric hydrogen–oxygen at 1 bar. The detonation wave produces oblique shock waves in the water, which focus {{at the bottom of}} the pipe due to the curvature of the walls. This results in peak pressures {{at the bottom of the}} pipe that are 4 – 6 times greater than the peak detonation pressure. Such pressure amplification is measured for water depths of 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 0. 87, and 0. 92 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters.</b> Focusing of the oblique shock waves is studied further by measuring the circumferential variation of pressure when the water depth is 0. 5 <b>pipe</b> <b>diameters,</b> and reasonable agreement with theoretical modeling is found.
