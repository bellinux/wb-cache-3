5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library {{to ask him about}} his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry <b>preparation</b> <b>room.</b> Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel make their way into the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of preventive and organisational measures implemented in Italy {{to prevent the}} contamination of cytotoxic drug <b>preparation</b> <b>rooms</b> has been investigated, and oncologic wards of two Italian hospitals were examined. The sampling strategy was based not only on potential sources of contamination but also on responses to detailed questionnaires on workplace prac-tices and work organisation. Wipe samples were taken from different surfaces of <b>preparation</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{before and after the}} work shift, over a span of a month. Cyclophosphamide was taken as the marker drug that reflects exposure to cytotoxic drugs, being measurable by GC/MS. In one of the two hospitals (Hospital A), a large amount of cyclophosphamide was found, both before and after shift, on the workbench (median value, 2. 55 mg dm 2, before shift), on the floor between the operator working position and the waste bin (> 10 mg dm 2, after shift), as also on door handles and storage shelves. No quantifiable levels of cytotoxic drug were detected in the second hospital investigated (Hospital B). These results could be attributed to the {{efficacy of}} cleaning procedures and working practices. In fact, both hospitals were provided with vertical-laminar airflow hoods and the (male) nurses had attended special training courses; but in Hospital A, cleaning procedures were carried out without substances used specifically fo...|$|R
50|$|The bunker had a {{sophisticated}} array of communication facilities. Three underground cables of the fortress telephone network were terminated {{in a separate}} radio room, {{where there was a}} switchboard.
