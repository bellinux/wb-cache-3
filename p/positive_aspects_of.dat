5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012 Wolf testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss {{the effects of the}} two laws. Despite repeated jabs by Republican members on the committee that it laws would stifle business and hurt employees, Wolf defended the reforms waveringly. Wolf's further statements on the <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E
5|$|Hideo Sasaki's {{architectural}} firm Sasaki Associates, Inc. {{found in the}} February 2010 master plan that the campus's seismic risk, uneven terrain, lack of parking spaces, small classrooms, and pedestrian-unfriendly roads are major constraints for future campus development. It also indicated the lack of identity, an undefined sense of arrival, {{and a desire to}} build a stronger on-campus community, among others, as recurrent themes among campus's users. Nonetheless, the firm highlights campus ethnic diversity, its location-climate, and the natural beauty of campus, among others, as <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the physical campus as well as the campus life experience.|$|E
5|$|This {{traditional}} approach towards Byzantium has been partially or wholly disputed and revised by modern studies, which {{focus on the}} <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine culture and legacy. Averil Cameron regards as undeniable the Byzantine contribution {{to the formation of}} the medieval Europe, and both Cameron and Obolensky recognise the major role of Byzantium in shaping Orthodoxy, which in turn occupies a central position in the history and societies of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Serbia and other countries. The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of the classical knowledge, as important contributors to the modern European civilization, and as precursors of both the Renaissance humanism and the Slav Orthodox culture.|$|E

5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{works of}} {{the last years of}} the century include {{incidental}} music for the English premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck's Pelléas et Mélisande (1898) and Prométhée, a lyric tragedy composed for the amphitheatre at Béziers. Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at Béziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the Paris Opéra in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter. From 1903 to 1921, Fauré regularly wrote music criticism for Le Figaro, a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Fauré's natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise the <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> a work.|$|E
5|$|The Girl {{made its}} {{television}} {{debut in the}} United States on 20 October 2012 on HBO and aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 26 December. Jones and Miller were nominated for awards at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Television Awards for their roles in the film, which received mixed reviews from critics. The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren. Although she endorsed the film, Hedren said its length kept it from showing some of the <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> her relationship with Hitchcock. Others who knew (and worked with) Hitchcock criticised the film because of its portrayal {{of him as a}} sexual predator. Kim Novak (who starred in one of Hitchcock's films) and Nora Brown (widow of one of Hitchcock's close friends) disputed the film's version of events.|$|E

25|$|Leopold II {{remains a}} {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Democratic Republic of Congo. His statue in the capital Kinshasa was removed after independence.

He argued that people should recognize some <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the king as well as the negative; but hours after the six-metre (20ft) statue was installed near Kinshasa's central station, it was officially removed.

25|$|One of {{the most}} direct ways humans are {{interacting}} with monarchs is by rearing them in captivity, which has become increasingly popular, although there are risks to this activity, and {{this has become a}} controversial topic. On the one hand there are many <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> captive rearing. Monarchs are bred in schools and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events and weddings. Memorial services for the September 11 attacks include the release of captive-bred monarchs. Monarchs are used in schools and nature centers for educational purposes. Many homeowners raise monarchs in captivity as a hobby and for educational purposes.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{harshness}} (both mental and physical) {{of the environment}} in which operatives have to perform, the writing tends not to romanticize any potentially <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the organization or of most of the series' characters (excluding Nikita, Birkoff or Walter, and, at times, Michael at his most vulnerable). The series generally exudes a dark tone in keeping with the organizational philosophies, the counterterrorist (frequently dangerously violent) situations, and the requisite tactics used by operatives of Section One. Unlimited operational resources for missions coupled with human propensity to hide ulterior motives and individual personal moral relativism lead to widespread intra- and interdepartmental infighting and recurrent secret alliances, backstabbing, blackmail and abuses of power between and among the characters, especially among those in the highest levels of power: Operations, Madeline, and George.|$|E
25|$|In the miniseries Ultron Forever, the Vision and Black Widow of {{the present}} are drawn into the future by {{what appears to be}} Doctor Doom to join a team of Avengers from various points in the team's history, {{including}} an early Hulk, James Rhodes as Iron Man, Thor when he was afflicted by the curse of Hela, the female Thor {{of the present}}, and Danielle Cage from a future where she wields Captain America's shield. 'Doom' claims that he brought this team together to assist him in defeating Ultron's conquest of the world. Although Doom's true plan is revealed at the story's conclusion to be a desire to take Ultron's place, after the Avengers are able to free the Asgardians to assist them against Ultron's former drones, the Vision reveals that this Doom is actually the Doombot who worked with him in the Avengers A.I., convincing the Doombot to abandon his plan by noting that simply following Doom's example ignores the more <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Doom's history as the man who refused to let anyone else dictate his terms.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that individualistic systems have been recently employed in Japan, and Japanese people have become more individualistic. However, previous research suggested that such cultural changes have negative associations with interpersonal relationships and happiness for Japanese (Ogihara & Uchida, 2014). In the present research, to demonstrate a negative <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> individualism in Japan, we examined the meaning of individualism which Japanese people hold. Japanese participants aged 16 to 69 reported their evaluation to the word "individualism" and their perception of an "individualistic person. " We found that individualism was regarded as being neutral and ambivalent, including both the <b>positive</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> being "with independence and freedom" and the negative <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> being "without <b>positive</b> interpersonal relationships. " In contrast, participants predicted others' evaluation of individualism to be more negative than their own evaluation, since they presumed that others would not consider the <b>positive</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> independence and freedom...|$|R
25|$|Some {{researchers}} are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; {{they want to}} move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality. College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.|$|E
25|$|Among the Indian leaders, Mahatma Gandhi emphatically {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} a united India {{and for a}} while successfully rallied people to this goal. During his meeting with Mountbatten, Gandhi asked Mountbatten to invite Jinnah to form a new Central government, but Mountbatten never uttered a word of Gandhi's ideas to Jinnah. And when Mountbatten's timeline offered the prospect of attaining independence soon, sentiments took a different turn. Given Mountbatten's determination, Nehru and Patel's inability to deal with the Muslim League and lastly Jinnah's obstinacy, all Indian party leaders (except Gandhi) acquiesced to Jinnah's plan to divide India, which in turn eased Mountbatten's task. Mountbatten also developed a strong relationship with the Indian princes, who ruled those portions of India not directly under British rule. His intervention was decisive in persuading {{the vast majority of them}} to see advantages in opting to join the Indian Union. On one hand, the integration of the princely states can be viewed as one of the <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> his legacy. But on the other, the refusal of Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, and Junagadh to join one of the dominions led to future tension between Pakistan and India.|$|E
25|$|The Heinkel He 112, {{based on}} a {{scaled-down}} Blitz, was the favourite of the Luftwaffe leaders. Compared with the Bf 109, it was also cheaper. <b>Positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the He 112 included the wide track and robustness of the undercarriage (this opened outwards from mid wing, {{as opposed to the}} 109s which opened from the wing root), considerably better visibility from the cockpit, and a lower wing loading that made for easier landings. In addition, the V4 had a single-piece, clear-view, sliding cockpit canopy and a more powerful Jumo 210Da engine with a modified exhaust system. However, the He 112 was also structurally complicated, being 18% heavier than the Bf 109, and {{it soon became clear that}} the thick wing, which spanned 12.6m (41ft 4in) with an area of 23.2m2 (249.7ft2) on the first prototype (V1), was a disadvantage for a light fighter, decreasing the aircraft's rate of roll and manoeuvrability. As a result, the He 112 V4 which was used for the trials had new wings, spanning 11.5m (37ft 8.75in) with an area of 21.6m2 (232.5ft2). However, the improvements had not been fully tested and the He 112 V4 could not be demonstrated in accordance with the rules laid down by the Acceptance Commission, placing it at a distinct disadvantage.|$|E
