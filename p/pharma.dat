40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} extent of stress and coping mechanism, in pharmaceuticals based in Korangi and other industrial areas in Karachi.

The design of the research is based on the measurement of the Organizational Stress Index. The data collected and analyzed is both from national and multinational pharmaceutical companies. Major causes of job stress have been identified as task demand, role demand and organizational structure. In Korangi area there is no significant difference in overall stress and job satisfaction levels between national and multinational <b>pharmas.</b> In the non Korangi sample job satisfaction is higher and job stress level in the multinationals is lower than in national <b>pharmas...</b>|$|R

40|$|How {{a supply}} chain (SC) is {{configured}} can {{have a significant impact}} on the performance of global firms. More specifically, disturbance factors (i. e. those factors associated with uncertainty and risk) are increasingly important considerations. This paper focuses on endogenous, exogenous and environment-related SC disturbance factors and their relative importance when configuring global SCs. Three alternative scenarios of SC configurations for European-based pharmaceutical firms are identified - insource nearshore, outsource nearshore and outsource offshore. Through a multi-phase, mixed-method approach we find that the top five disturbance factors managers should be aware of while configuring their SCs are quality defects, unforeseen and random interruptions in manufacturing processes, order processing difficulties, untimely delivery of products, and a mismatch between market demand and supplier responsiveness. This study is able to provide insights into the impact of disturbance factors on the SC configuration strategy for Big <b>Pharmas.</b> We show that SC disturbances influenced the decision to bring production back home (reshoring) or to a closer location (near-shoring). To mitigate the effects of disturbances many Big <b>Pharmas</b> recalibrated their SC configurations by insourcing core products, outsourcing non-core products offshore and developing offshore insourcing capabilities through ‘captives’...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} heavyweights or big <b>pharmas</b> of {{the modern}} pharmaceutical industry are facing unprecedented challenges, primarily, {{in the form of}} drying product pipelines, expiry of patents of blockbuster drugs and swiftly declining margins on existing products. While service provision for revenue generation was the topic under investigation in the preceding project with the Established Business Unit division of Pfizer, the current report is an analysis of the industry itself, and dwells upon the environment, structure, products and fundamental motivations shaping this sector, and thereby, making it unique from other manufacturing sectors. In the final analysis, pharmaceutical companies must not move away from its “core” and should persevere to establish their competitive advantage by developing innovative, differentiated and patentable products. However, in order to do so companies must broaden their horizon, balance shareholder return against the huge unmet medical needs, and take advantage of the exciting opportunities that exist in the form of more educated consumers, advances in genomics and regulatory harmonization. In the face of growing threat from generics and biologics, the big <b>pharmas</b> should build effective collaborations with partners to accelerate innovation, reduce product and process costs,and mitigate non-compliance risks...|$|R
