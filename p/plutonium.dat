5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled <b>plutonium</b> does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled <b>plutonium</b> {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where <b>plutonium</b> accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. <b>Plutonium</b> is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of <b>plutonium</b> oxide is absorbed after ingestion. <b>Plutonium</b> absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. <b>Plutonium</b> passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E
5|$|A major {{crisis for}} the <b>plutonium</b> program {{occurred}} in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè's group confirmed that <b>plutonium</b> {{created in the}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium-240. Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of <b>plutonium</b> in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect <b>plutonium.</b> Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that <b>plutonium</b> was assumed to have a similar biological effect. When <b>plutonium</b> was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that <b>plutonium</b> could be anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts of <b>plutonium</b> which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235. A critical mass of <b>plutonium</b> emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. <b>Plutonium</b> in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major <b>plutonium</b> fires in 1957 and 1969 (<b>plutonium</b> is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown <b>plutonium</b> that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of <b>plutonium</b> particles {{too small to be}} filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E
5|$|If the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of uranium was poorly understood, that of <b>plutonium</b> was practically unknown, {{as it had}} only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from the reactors in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into <b>plutonium</b> chemistry was at the Metallurgical Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating <b>plutonium</b> metal from uranium and fission products.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{development}} efforts {{were directed to}} a gun-type fission weapon with <b>plutonium</b> called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties of <b>plutonium</b> was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of <b>plutonium</b> from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred <b>plutonium</b> had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron <b>plutonium.</b> Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 {{that some of the}} plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943 some <b>plutonium</b> trifluoride {{was reduced}} to create the first sample of <b>plutonium</b> metal: a few micrograms of {{metallic}} beads. Enough <b>plutonium</b> was produced {{to make it the}} first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called <b>plutonium),</b> but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify <b>plutonium</b> along with neptunium. The discovery of <b>plutonium</b> {{had to wait until}} the end of 1940, when Glenn T. Seaborg and his team identified the isotope plutonium-238.|$|E
5|$|MOX fuel {{has been}} in use since the 1980s, and is widely used in Europe. In September 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation signed a <b>Plutonium</b> Management and Disposition Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade <b>plutonium.</b> The U.S. Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade <b>plutonium</b> in the United States {{before the end of}} 2019 by {{converting}} the <b>plutonium</b> to a MOX fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the chemists {{considered}} {{the problem of}} how <b>plutonium</b> could be separated from uranium when its chemical properties were not known. Working with the minute quantities of <b>plutonium</b> available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a lanthanum fluoride process for separating uranium and <b>plutonium,</b> which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the bismuth phosphate process, was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson. This process worked by toggling <b>plutonium</b> between its +4 and +6 oxidation states in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the <b>plutonium</b> was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>plutonium</b> is a fire hazard, {{especially}} if the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, <b>plutonium</b> forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. <b>Plutonium</b> expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a <b>plutonium</b> fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle <b>plutonium</b> in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plutonium</b> alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to molten <b>plutonium.</b> If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, <b>plutonium</b> can be added {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive <b>plutonium</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plutonium</b> also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, {{and thus}} is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. <b>Plutonium</b> reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of <b>plutonium</b> ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plutonium</b> is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled <b>plutonium</b> exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 <b>plutonium</b> particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human being {{is known to have}} died because of inhaling or ingesting <b>plutonium,</b> and many people have measurable amounts of <b>plutonium</b> in their bodies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plutonium</b> shows enormous, and reversible, {{reaction}} rates {{with pure}} hydrogen, forming <b>plutonium</b> hydride. It also reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO2 {{as well as}} intermediate oxides; <b>plutonium</b> oxide fills 40% more volume than <b>plutonium</b> metal. The metal reacts with the halogens, giving rise to compounds with the general formula PuX3 where X can be F, Cl, Br or I and PuF4 is also seen. The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI. It will react with carbon to form PuC, nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plutonium</b> was {{delivered}} to Los Alamos {{in the form of}} what was found to be a mixture of <b>plutonium</b> trifluoride (PuF3) and <b>plutonium</b> tetrafluoride (PuF4). Work with <b>plutonium</b> was carried out in gloveboxes for safety reasons. The metallurgists figured out how to purify the <b>plutonium,</b> and found that heating it to 250° allowed them to work it in the malleable γ phase. It was also found that alloying it with 3 percent gallium would stabilize it in the δ phase. When <b>plutonium</b> at last began to arrive in quantity from the Hanford Site in February 1945, they were ready for production. In a race against the clock, the metallurgists produced <b>plutonium</b> spheres for the Trinity nuclear test by July 23, 1945.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plutonium,</b> when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of <b>plutonium</b> {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of <b>plutonium</b> emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of <b>plutonium</b> is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that <b>plutonium</b> is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of <b>plutonium</b> in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous <b>plutonium</b> exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the <b>plutonium</b> compounds, <b>plutonium</b> is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of <b>plutonium</b> absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to <b>plutonium</b> would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which <b>plutonium</b> enters the body, though <b>plutonium</b> can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, <b>plutonium</b> increases the risk of lung cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, and leukemia. Once absorbed into the body, the biological half life of <b>plutonium</b> is about 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Producing <b>plutonium</b> in useful {{quantities}} for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had <b>plutonium</b> cores. Human radiation experiments studying <b>plutonium</b> were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of <b>plutonium</b> waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of <b>plutonium</b> in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E
5|$|That the {{metallurgy}} of <b>plutonium</b> {{was completely}} unknown {{came as no}} surprise at all, for it had only recently been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of <b>plutonium</b> from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of <b>plutonium</b> were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate <b>plutonium</b> from uranium.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report {{made no mention}} of using <b>plutonium,</b> but after {{discussing}} the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a <b>plutonium</b> bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the <b>plutonium</b> project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to <b>plutonium,</b> to find ways to chemically separate the <b>plutonium</b> from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, 237Np, is negligible {{compared to}} the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes. Traces of <b>plutonium</b> in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on 239Pu are summarized in the table (no other <b>plutonium</b> isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of <b>plutonium,</b> 244Pu, is 3%. <b>Plutonium</b> could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most <b>plutonium</b> is produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract <b>plutonium</b> and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade <b>plutonium</b> can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of <b>plutonium</b> per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the <b>plutonium</b> is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} <b>plutonium</b> dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of <b>plutonium</b> could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of <b>plutonium</b> roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the <b>Plutonium</b> Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of <b>plutonium</b> shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes.|$|E
5|$|As <b>plutonium</b> was not available, it was {{substituted}} {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties. Depleted uranium was used {{but was not}} optimal because of its opacity for radiation; iron, copper, or cadmium were other choices. Cadmium was the choice {{for most of the}} tests. The first shot was performed with an iron mockup of the <b>plutonium</b> pit.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of <b>plutonium,</b> and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate <b>plutonium</b> from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that <b>plutonium,</b> like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January 1945, {{the highly}} {{purified}} <b>plutonium</b> underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building, where remaining impurities were removed successfully. Los Alamos received its first <b>plutonium</b> from Hanford on February 2. While it was still by no means clear that enough <b>plutonium</b> could be produced for use in bombs by the war's end, Hanford was by early 1945 in operation. Only two {{years had passed since}} Col. Franklin Matthias first set up his temporary headquarters {{on the banks of the}} Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating <b>plutonium</b> from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first <b>plutonium</b> to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of <b>plutonium</b> recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a <b>plutonium</b> production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E
5|$|DuPont {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the <b>plutonium</b> semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first <b>plutonium</b> in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of <b>plutonium,</b> and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who {{then moved on to}} the Hanford site. It operated as a <b>plutonium</b> production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. It was shut down in 1963, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the end of World War II, {{scientists}} working on the Manhattan Project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of <b>plutonium</b> on laboratory animals and human subjects. Animal studies found that a few milligrams of <b>plutonium</b> per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg of <b>plutonium</b> in the 60-inch cyclotron {{there in}} May 1941, {{and found that}} it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but {{it was not possible to}} produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how <b>plutonium</b> might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the <b>plutonium</b> produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with <b>plutonium</b> without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of <b>plutonium</b> in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with <b>plutonium.</b> Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of <b>Plutonium</b> on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The <b>Plutonium</b> Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
