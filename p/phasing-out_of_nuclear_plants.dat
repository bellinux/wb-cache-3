In the 1980 nuclear power referendums the party supported the [...] "no" [...] campaign, which meant opposing any further construction <b>of</b> new <b>nuclear</b> power-plants in Sweden and advocating the <b>phasing-out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plants</b> in Sweden within 10 years, together with increased investments in alternative energy.|$|R

2500|$|Sweden {{has also}} been an active {{participant}} at various international nonproliferation and disarmament meetings throughout the years. In 1998, Sweden was {{a founding member of}} the [...] "New Agenda Coalition" [...] (NAC). NAC called on the nuclear weapon states to commit to their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the NPT. At the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the NAC proposed the “13 steps” thereby breaking the meeting's deadlock. The “13 steps” provided a series of steps to meet the disarmament obligations contained in Article VI. Regarding the challenges <b>of</b> the <b>phasing-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy in Sweden, the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2004 review of Swedish energy policies called on Sweden to consider the costs <b>of</b> replacing <b>nuclear</b> power and the potential implications for energy security, greenhouse gas emissions, and economic growth.|$|R

40|$|Policy {{scenarios}} {{examined in}} this paper provide insights into the long-term role that nuclear power could play in abating CO 2 emissions. Impacts are quantified for a strict phase-out <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> generation capacities, and are contrasted with scenarios allowing for a nuclear technology breakthrough under a specific carbon-tax regime. The energy-related global CO 2 emissions are reduced by nearly 50 % relative to the baseline in 2050 in the carbon-tax scenario, allowing for policies in favour <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy. On the contrary, the emission reduction levels are less ambitious for the same carbon tax when a worldwide <b>phasing-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> power is adopted. The substantial increase in contibution <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy projected for the carbon mitigation does not represent an acute threat from the uranium resources scarcity point of view for the time horizon of analyses. Nevertheless, the cost <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> fuel supplies and waste disposal might increase significantly without adjustments in the technology used...|$|R
50|$|During {{the most}} active phase of the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in the Soviet Union and Russia—from 1988 to 1992 over 100 nuclear projects were prevented on {{the territory of the}} Soviet Union. These were not just reactors, but also infrastructure projects linked to the planned power stations and other nuclear enterprises. This social activism succeeded in stopping nearly all <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants</b> under construction in Russia, either temporarily or permanently.
