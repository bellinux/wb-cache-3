5|$|Explanations for the {{transient}} lunar <b>phenomena</b> fall in four classes: outgassing, impact events, electrostatic <b>phenomena,</b> and unfavorable observation conditions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient <b>phenomena</b> might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or <b>phenomena</b> associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient <b>phenomena</b> are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar <b>phenomena</b> (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E

40|$|Using {{computed}} thermography {{continuous temperature}} recordings were made {{before and after}} cold challenge of the fingers of control subjects and patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> and Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis. Basal skin temperature measurements (Tpre) were significantly lower in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> and Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in the controls. Temperatures immediately after cold challenge (T 0) were significantly lower in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> and Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in controls. The lag phase {{before the start of}} temperature recovery (Tlag) was significantly greater in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> and Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in control subjects. The maximum recovery index (R%) was significantly less in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> and Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in controls. The maximum rate of change of temperature during the rapid phase of rewarming (Gmax) was significantly greater in controls than in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> and Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis. Discriminant analysis showed that the dynamic parameters of rewarming (Tlag, Gmax, and R%) showed greater variation between the patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> and those with Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than did Tpre or T 0. This method of analysis of cold challenge will be used in studies of the effects of treatment of Raynaud's <b>phenomenon...</b>|$|R

The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E
5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental <b>phenomena</b> are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or mental <b>phenomena</b> are the effects, but not the causes, of physical <b>phenomena.</b> Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To assess laser Doppler-recorded postocclusive {{reactive}} hyperemic {{responses in}} vibration-induced Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> {{and compare it}} with primary and secondary to sclerodermy Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon.</b> Material and Methods: Thirty patients with vibration-induced Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> and 30 healthy controls and patients with primary and secondary to sclerodermy Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> were investigated. Fingerpulp skin blood flow was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry during postocclusive reactive hyperemia test. Results: Lower initial perfusion values were established in all the patients with Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> compared to the healthy controls (p < 0. 0001). The postocclusive reactive hyperemic peak was lower in all the Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> groups compared to the controls (p < 0. 0001). The postocclusive and basal perfusions were lower in the secondary Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> groups compared to the control and the primary Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> groups (p < 0. 0001). The velocities to postocclusive hyperemic peak were lower in all the Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> patients (p < 0. 0001), so were in the vibration-induced (p < 0. 002) and the sclerodermy Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> (p < 0. 004) groups {{in relation to the}} primary Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> group. The perfusion values and the velocities were significantly influenced by the initial superficial skin temperatures and perfusions, while the velocities were dependent also on gender, and the hyperemic peak on age. Conclusions: Postocclusive reactive hyperemia is abnormal in all Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> patients. Laser Doppler-recorded reactive hyperemia test contributes to diagnosing Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> and has proved to be valuable for group analysis. The applied method is not sensitive enough to discriminate adequately the type of Raynaud’s <b>phenomenon</b> among individual cases...|$|R

Most of these, such as hominid intelligence, instinct, emotion, photosynthesis, language, and altruism, have been well-explained by evolution, while others remain mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation {{has been able}} to adequately explain the biological origin of these <b>phenomena</b> either.|$|E

50|$|Goldstein {{developed}} an approach where a situation or <b>phenomenon</b> is analyzed holistically, {{rather than simply}} looking at an isolated event. First, when observing a situation, interpretations should be taken in as a whole without giving special preference towards {{one part of the}} <b>phenomenon.</b> When describing the <b>phenomenon,</b> attention should not be diverted to one aspect of the <b>phenomenon</b> that may be of interest. The holistic approach calls instead for the <b>phenomenon</b> to be described from all angles without bias towards one part. Lastly, Goldstein argues that one must consider each and every <b>phenomenon</b> in reference to the entire situation.|$|R
5|$|In this {{conception}} of mind no strict distinction is {{made between the}} conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various <b>phenomena.</b> Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the five senses and sixth for perception of mental <b>phenomena.</b> The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (manovijñāna) and attention (āvartana), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.|$|E
