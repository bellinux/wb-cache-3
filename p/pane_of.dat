50|$|With the {{development}} of sash windows, leadlighting became much less common in the domestic setting, giving way to larger <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> glass set into wooden frames. Doors were often surmounted by decorative fanlights in which the <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> glass might be supported by lead, but wood was also commonly used as the support for the glass in fanlights. Casement windows and fixed windows continued to employ leadlight, often with larger <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> rectangular rather than diamond shape. Large windows set in public buildings and churches of this period also employed rectangular <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> leadlight supported by armatures emphasizing the classical design of the windows. Heraldic motifs in stained glass were often set into the windows.|$|R
50|$|Changes to {{the studio}} over time include the loss of {{original}} timber desk joinery, the addition of timber sunscreens attached to the front glazed walls, and installation of security and fly screens to the windows. The loss <b>of</b> some original <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> yellow patterned glass has resulted in replacement <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> different hues and patterns.|$|R
25|$|On 11 September 2008, a <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> glass cracked, {{requiring}} {{the street below}} to be cordoned off. On 29 January 2009, a fire broke out on the 31st floor in Mario Balotelli's flat and partial evacuation of the tower took place; one apartment was left uninhabitable.|$|E
25|$|Using visual photometry, Lambert {{presented}} {{the results of}} many experimental determinations of specular and diffuse reflectance, {{as well as the}} transmittance of panes of glass and lenses.

25|$|The Inverted Jenny (also {{known as}} an Upside Down Jenny, Jenny Invert) is a United States postage stamp first issued on May 10, 1918 in which {{the image of the}} Curtiss JN-4 {{airplane}} {{in the center of the}} design is printed upside-down; it is probably the most famous error in American philately. Only one <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in all philately.|$|E

25|$|Winston {{describes}} {{something as}} simple as the repair of a broken <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include telescreens that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.|$|E

Stuka Jr. and Okumura only played a very smal part in the storyline as the two agreed to a one-on-one Lucha de Apuestas at the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show where both men would put their hair on the line.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016, a third stamp {{from the}} stolen McCoy block turned up for auction at the Spink USA auction house.

Examination revealed that the stamp came from position 76 in the <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> 100. The American Philatelic Research Library said it will work to take possession of the stamp once an FBI investigation is complete and other legal matters settled. The only stamp that remains missing is position 66.|$|E

25|$|Early model diving masks had {{a single}} {{elliptical}} <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> glass. These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom {{on either side of}} the nose, into which the diver can insert a thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.|$|E
25|$|On Riddell's {{death at}} the age of only 39, the Hermitage was allowed to quietly decay; by 1803 it was being used by stray stock and in 1810 it was {{reported}} by Cromek as being derelict and he expressed his shock that the site was not being maintained under Captain Smith's ownership of the estate, for the floor was covered in straw, cattle had broken down the trees and the <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> glass had gone. It measured 10.5 feet by eight and had a single window and fireplace. In around 1870 William Douglas recorded that {{the only part of the}} building still standing was part of the east gable. Over the lintel was cut the name 'BURNS' in bold letters.|$|E

25|$|Paxton set the {{dimensions}} of this prism by using the length of single <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> glass (49 inches) as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was 4 feet long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical faces {{at either end of}} the prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of 24'x 24', formed the basic structural module of the building.|$|E
25|$|When a {{practical}} effect cannot be accomplished, the crew turns to Entity FX to create digital imagery {{for a given}} scene. Sometimes this imagery is to substitute action sequences that they cannot do on-site, and other times {{it is used to}} create subtle foreground or background effects. For instance, a matte painting is used to establish the Metropolis background, which is composed of buildings from several modern-day cities in addition to Vancouver; they include Singapore and Hong Kong among others. For the scene where Clark rips his shirt open in the phone booth, revealing the tattoo, visual effects were added to the tattoo illuminating it. But in order to add the effects, the middle <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> glass was removed from the phone booth so that the special effects team had a clear line to Welling’s chest; they re-added the middle pane digitally, adding reflections so that it looked natural.|$|E
25|$|During the {{production}} of the 1916–17 series, it was observed that on one 2-cent plate, No. 7942, three of the 400 images had become noticeably worn. Two of these images were a vertical pair, appearing {{near the bottom of the}} top-left <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> 100; the remaining image appeared near the top of the bottom-right pane. When replacing these three images, the technician responsible (conceivably confused by the problems of working with mirror-image material, which can makes a 5 look like a 2) inadvertently transferred 5-cent images onto the three problem positions of the plate. This error was not noticed for several weeks, and eventually three different carmine-colored 5-cent stamps were distributed by the Post Office: the perforated 10 issue of 1916–17 (Scott #467), the imperforate issue of the same years (Scott #485), and the perforated 11 issue of 1917–20 (Scott #505). The imperforate version is by far the rarest of these, and few collectors have ever seen one.|$|E
