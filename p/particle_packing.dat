We start from a random sequence addition particle generation algorithm to generate a "layer" of non-overlapping spherical particles that are let to evolve dynamically in time under the action of "compacting" or "jamming" pseudo forces. A "layer-by-layer" approach is then followed to generate multiple layers {{on top of each}} other. In the end, very dense packs with pre-defined bulk shapes and sizes (e. g. rectangles in two dimensions and prisms in three dimensions) are achieved. The influence of rolling motion (with particle rotation and spin) along with inter-particle friction on the density and ordering of the generated packs is assessed. Both congruent and inhomogeneous packs (with respect to particle sizes) are created and their packing properties evaluated.

Computer simulation therefore provides a promising perspective for <b>particle</b> <b>packing</b> simulation.

40|$|The {{importance}} of studying the behaviour and properties of concrete can be highlighted {{by considering the}} fact that concrete is the most used man-made material in the world. The very first step in making concrete is its mix design and deciding the type and amount of constitutes used in the production of concrete which should fulfil the requirements of the final product. Mix design models are commonly used for the purpose of proportioning concrete ingredients while anticipating the properties of the final product.   The current document deals with the commonly used principals in mix design models namely <b>particle</b> <b>packing</b> theory and excess water/paste layer theories.
