40|$|Abstract — Microfinance {{started with}} a noble cause of helping the poor to obtain small loans to {{establish}} their own businesses. The scheme {{has been successful in}} helping the borrowers to establish their own businesses, educate their children, spend more on health and nutrition, and plan for the future. However micro-financing has failed on the very front {{it is supposed to be}} useful that is helping the poor. The interest rates charged by microfinance institutions (MFIs) are so high that a very large majority of very poor are automatically excluded and those who dare to borrow find themselves trapped as no business can produce profit of 100 % to 200 % to meet the very high interest charged by MFIs. To avoid this problem we suggest Islamic solution of no interest. Two schemes are suggested. One is <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> from government with zero interest. In this scheme return of original capital is guaranteed by 4 - 6 members of the community. Second suggestion is <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> on modified Mudarba basis again with the guarantee (provided by 4 - 6 members of the community) of return of original capital. In both cases if original capital is not returned, guarantors have to do that...|$|R

50|$|Chamberlain {{worried about}} the threat of {{socialism}}, even though the Independent Labour Party had only one MP, Keir Hardie. Chamberlain warned {{of the dangers of}} socialism in his unpublished 1995 play The Game of Politics, characterising its proponents as the instigators of class conflict. In response to the socialist challenge, he sought to divert the energy of collectivism for the good of Unionism, and continued to propose reforms to the Conservatives. In his 'Memorandum of a Programme for Social Reform' sent to Salisbury in 1893, Chamberlain made a number of suggestions, including old age pensions, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to the working class for the purchase of houses, an amendment to the Artisans' Dwellings Act to encourage street improvements, compensation for industrial accidents, cheaper train fares for workers, tighter border controls and shorter working hours. Salisbury was guardedly sympathetic to the proposals. On 21 June 1895, the Liberal Government was defeated on a motion that criticised the Secretary of State for War, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, for shortages of cordite, and Salisbury was invited to form a government.|$|E
5000|$|Rice and {{sugarcane}} {{are significant}} agricultural {{products that are}} produced in great volume. Cultivation practices for rice and sugarcane were already well established among the early Hiligaynon prior {{to the arrival of}} the Spanish, who were also able to produce wine from the juice of these crops. The Spanish became the catalysts for large-scale agricultural production, dividing Panay into encomienda and enlisting the natives of Panay, including the Hiligaynon, into labor for the haciendas.By the 19th century, the sugarcane industry became more expansive and modernized due to the confluence of increased port access and new technology and financial resources. A Spanish royal decree in 1855 ordered that the port be opened, with the expectation of increasing economic growth in areas beyond Manila. Given the safe location of the port, and a long-standing history of trade, Iloilo was an ideal international port, thus becoming integrated into the international trade of the 19th century. The British vice-consul in Iloilo, Nicholas Loney, was instrumental in introducing technological and financial resources to the existing sugar elites. Better sugarcane seeds were introduced from Sumatra, and Loney also undertook the purchasing of centrifugal iron mills, as well as the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to planters. These, accompanied by the demand for sugar, helped to encourage the movement of the sugarcane planters to Negros, expanding the hacienda system to there. Many of the workers (many native to Panay) who were part of the hacienda system, the [...] "dumaan", became the underclass beneath the [...] "sugar barons" [...] of the haciendas, with a middle class existing between who maintained urban stores and banks. This class structure was to persist into the Commonwealth era, and as the sugar industry shifted its focus from Panay to Negros following a labor strike in 1930-1931. The sugar industry in the 1970s through the 1980s experienced turmoil as financing decline and harvests went unpaid, leading the sugar elites to diversify their crop. Today, tenant farming continues to the norm in organizing labor for rice in Iloilo, a regional rice producer. As for sugar production, workers are paid minimum wage. Smaller-scale agriculture still exists along coastal plains and inland valleys, with crops such as corn and tobacco being produced. The slash-and-burn system known as kaingin was and continues to be used by farmers in the mountainous interior of central Panay, using bolo knives to cut trees and wooden dibbers to plant seeds. Hunting has also supplemented the farmers' livelihood but has decreased with the decline of the forests since the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|By {{studying}} the German universal banking {{system in the}} pre-World War I period, in comparison with its American and British counterparts, this paper investigates whether universality (the combination of commercial and investment banking services) influences banking industry concentration, levels of market power, or financial performance of banks. The short answer is "no. " First, given that the UK's specialized commercial banking sector was structured very similarly to the German universal industrial banking sector, and that neither system was extremely conc entrated in the pre-war era, the paper argues that universality does not necessarily or uniquely propagate concentration. Second, on average, German universal banks behaved no less competitively than their American counterparts in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> services. Structural price markup models, as well as reduced-form Rosse-Panzar tests, demonstrate little deviation from competitive pricing in either country. The findings therefore in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{assessing}} whether a significant within-year seasonality exists in the <b>loan</b> loss <b>provisioning</b> behavior <b>of</b> European listed banks observed in the period from 2004 to 2013. Since the accuracy of auditing processes {{and the level of}} disclosure requirements in financial reports differ among quarters, during the year, banks may have a leeway to underestimate and postpone the complete <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> losses in the less regulated and less audited quarters. We hypothesize that those differences are relevant factors which determine non-lower or significantly higher average levels <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> loss <b>provisions</b> in the half-yearly and especially in the annual financial reports than in the interim management statements disclosed in the first and the third quarters of the year. We also investigate the impact of the recent financial crisis and develop a special analysis for the Italian banks’ case. The empirical results support our hypotheses, suggesting that, in some cases, a convergence among quarterly levels of auditing processes and disclosure requirements may be needed. Our work contributes to the existing literature by providing additional evidences and considerations on the within-year seasonality in the <b>loan</b> loss <b>provisioning</b> behavior <b>of</b> European listed banks observed in the last decade...|$|R
