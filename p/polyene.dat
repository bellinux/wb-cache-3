25|$|The basic {{structure}} of the hydrophobic retinoid molecule consists of a cyclic end group, a <b>polyene</b> side chain and a polar end group. The conjugated system formed by alternating C=C double bonds in the <b>polyene</b> side chain {{are responsible for the}} color of retinoids (typically yellow, orange, or red). Hence, many retinoids are chromophores. Alternation of side chains and end groups creates the various classes of retinoids.|$|E
25|$|Saffron {{contains}} more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components, {{many of which are}} carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various α- and β-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of α-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl <b>polyene</b> esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated <b>polyene</b> dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant α-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make α-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.|$|E
25|$|The use of cation-pi {{interactions}} {{has also}} been successfully implemented in reactions with synthetic catalysts. A combination of anion-binding and cation-pi strategies {{can be used to}} effect enantioselective cationic polycyclizations. In the transition state, it is proposed that the thiourea group binds chloride, while the aromatic system stabilizes the associated <b>polyene</b> cation. In support of this, increasing the size of the aromatic ring leads to improvements both in yield and stereoselectivity. The enantioselectivity correlates well with both the polarizability and the quadrupole moment of the aryl group.|$|E

25|$|Nystatin is a <b>polyene</b> {{antifungal}} drug {{to which}} many molds and yeast infections are sensitive. It {{was also the}} first antifungal antibiotic to be safe and effective in treating human diseases. Not only did it cure many serious fungal infections of the skin, mouth, throat, and intestinal tract, but it could also be combined with antibacterial drugs to balance their side effects. Over the years, Nystatin proved effective not only in fighting human diseases, but was also used to stop fungal growth on flood-damaged works of art in Florence, Italy. It also showed effectiveness in slowing the spread of Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal disease of elm trees spread by the elm bark beetle.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the <b>polyene</b> chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. One of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency is night-blindness followed by decreased visual acuity.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} large <b>polyenes</b> (heptaenes and the "degenerate heptaene" nystatin) on human {{erythrocytes}} {{were found to}} occur in three separate stages. Stage I was a reversible increase in cell membrane permeability to monovalent cations and occurred at low antibiotic concentrations. At intermediate antibiotic concentrations, an irreversible increase in cell membrane permeability to cations (stage II) occurred, which then led to swelling of cells and hemolysis (stage III). Hemolysis could be prevented by sucrose, mannitol, or melezitose, but stages I and II still occurred under these conditions. The effects of the small <b>polyenes</b> (pentaenes and a tetraene) occurred in only one stage. Changes in cell membrane permeability (stages I and II) were not noted before hemolysis (stage III) even {{in the presence of}} carbohydrate. Carbohydrates gave only weak, transient protection from the hemolytic action of small <b>polyenes,</b> probably because the membrane damage induced by these antibiotics was more extensive than that induced by the large <b>polyenes.</b> In the presence of sucrose, large <b>polyenes</b> were able to inhibit the hemolytic action of small <b>polyenes,</b> implying that both antibiotics have the same binding sites...|$|R
500|$|In 2010, a pigment {{compound}} {{isolated and}} characterized from fruit bodies of Mycena aurantiomarginata was reported as new to science by Robert Jaeger and Peter Spiteller in the Journal of Natural Products. The chemical, mycenaaurinA, is a <b>polyene</b> compound {{that consists of}} a tridecaketide (i.e., 13 adjacent methylene bridge and carbonyl functional groups with two amino acid [...] on {{either end of the}} molecule). The authors posit that the flanking amino acid groups are probably derived biosynthetically from S-Adenosyl methionine. The tridecaketide itself contains an alpha-pyrone, a conjugated , and a single alkenyl moiety. Jaeger and Spiteller suggest that mycenaaurinA might function as a defense compound, since it exhibits antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus pumilus. The chemical is only present in the fruit bodies, and not in the colorless mycelia. An earlier screening for antimicrobial activity in the fruit bodies revealed a weak ability to inhibit the growth of the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{example of}} this {{phenomenon}} is in β-carotene. β-carotene (C40H56) is a conjugated <b>polyene</b> with an orange color and a molecular length of approximately 3.8nm (though its chain length is only approximately 2.4nm). Due to β-carotene's high level of conjugation, electrons are dispersed throughout {{the length of the}} molecule, allowing one to model it as a one-dimensional particle in a box. β-carotene has 11 carbon-carbon double bonds in conjugation; each of those double bonds contains two π-electrons, therefore β-carotene has 22 π-electrons.
