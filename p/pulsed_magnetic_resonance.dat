In particular, the fidelity of quantum logic operations performed on electron spin qubits falls well below the threshold for the application of quantum algorithms. Using three independent techniques, we demonstrate the use of composite pulses to improve this fidelity by several orders of magnitude.

We report that silicon vacancy defects in silicon carbide comprise the technological advantages of semiconductor quantum dots and the unique spin properties of the nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond. Similar to atoms, the silicon vacancy qubits can be controlled under the double radio-optical resonance conditions, allowing for their selective addressing and manipulation.

40|$|We {{report a}} method for nanometer-scale <b>pulsed</b> nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging and spectroscopy. Periodic {{radio-frequency}} pulses are used to create temporal correlations in the statistical polarization of a solid organic sample.

40|$|Optically {{detected}} {{magnetic resonance}} (ODMR) provides ultrasensitive means {{to detect and}} image {{a small number of}} electron and nuclear spins, down to the single spin level with nanoscale resolution. Despite the significant recent progress in this field, it has never been combined with the power of <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging (MRI) techniques. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how these two methodologies can be integrated using short pulsed magnetic field gradients to spatially-encode the sample. This results in what we denote as an "optically detected magnetic resonance imaging" (ODMRI) technique. It offers the advantage that the image is acquired in parallel {{from all parts of the}} sample, with well-defined three-dimensional point-spread function, and without any loss of spectroscopic information. In addition, this approach may be used in the future for parallel but yet spatially-selective efficient addressing and manipulation of the spins in the sample. Such capabilities are of fundamental importance in the field of quantum spin-based devices and sensors. Comment: 14 pages, 3 fig...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} assays {{that result in}} a surface with bound magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) whose number {{is proportional to the}} concentration of the analyte of interest. The techniques used to explore such assays are typically complex and costly. Since the presence of such MNP disrupts the <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> signal that would normally be detected from a fluid covering the surface, we present a measurement technique to quantify such assays. In this work we identify and characterise a suitable fluid for such measurements, namely 10 cSt viscosity PDMS oil of thickness 250 μm. We demonstrate that the Teff 2 relaxation time from the PDMS reduces as the proportion of the surface area covered with MNP increases. Most significant however, is a linear decrease in the signal amplitude from the PDMS as a function of MNP coverage. This is observed both for the integral over 4096 echoes and also in the first echo promising simplified console electronics for rapid measurements...|$|E

We focus here on the implications of its anomalously strong hyperfine coupling. In particular, we analyse in detail the regime where recent <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> experiments have demonstrated the potential for orders of magnitude speedup in quantum gates by exploiting transitions that are electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) forbidden at high fields. We also present calculations using a phenomenological Markovian master equation which models the decoherence of the electron spin due to Gaussian temporal magnetic field perturbations. The model quantifies the advantages of certain "optimal working points" identified as the $df/dB= 0 $ regions, where $f$ is the transition frequency, which come in the form of frequency minima and maxima. We show that at such regions, dephasing due to the interaction of the electron spin with a fluctuating magnetic field in the $z$ direction (usually adiabatic) is completely removed.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for exploiting spins for quantum data {{storage and processing}} is long spin coherence times. Phosphorus dopants in silicon (Si:P) have been favoured 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as hosts for such spins because of measured electron spin coherence times (T 2) longer than any other electron spin in the solid state: 14 [*]ms at 7 [*]K with isotopically purified silicon 11. Heavier impurities such as bismuth in silicon (Si:Bi) {{could be used in}} conjunction with Si:P for quantum information proposals that require two separately addressable spin species 12, 13, 14, 15. However, {{the question of whether the}} incorporation of the much less soluble Bi into Si leads to defect species that destroy coherence has not been addressed. Here we show that schemes involving Si:Bi are indeed feasible as the electron spin coherence time T 2 is at least as long as for Si:P with non-isotopically purified silicon. We polarized the Si:Bi electrons and hyperpolarized the I= 9 / 2 nuclear spin of 209 Bi, manipulating both with <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance.</b> The larger nuclear spin means that a Si:Bi dopant provides a 20 -dimensional Hilbert space rather than the four-dimensional Hilbert space of an I= 1 / 2 Si:P dopant...|$|E

Four ESE signals related to the paramagnetic centers labeled D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4 with g = 2. 0043, g = 2. 0029, g = 2. 0031, g = 2. 0037 were resolved in FS ESE spectrum due to their different spin relaxation times.

40|$|Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a 7 TM {{membrane}} protein expressed in Halobacterium salinarum. Due to its stability and high expression levels, bR {{serves as a}} model for other 7 TM {{membrane protein}}s. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS 1) is a member of pharmacologically relevant G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, and is the high affinity receptor for neurotensin, a 13 mer peptide that {{can be found in the}} brain, gut, and central nervous system. NTS 1 is a target for Parkinson’s, Schizophrenia, and drug addiction. This thesis aims to develop <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> techniques and sample preparation forms for high resolution structural studies on 7 TM proteins. In this thesis, pulsed dipolar distance electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods for the study of proteins in their native membrane are established. bR is spin-labeled, and a wellresolved distance distribution is measured in excellent agreement with other structural data. Preliminary distance data for a photoexcited state of bR suggests quaternary rearrangements in the native membrane that are agreement with published AFM results. A fitting method is developed to enable measurements of systems with rapid signal decay, a common feature in reconstituted systems studied by pulsed EPR methods. A physical chemical characterization of nanosized-bilayer discs termed Lipodisqs®, and the successful incorporation of bR is presented. Lipodisqs® are formed from DMPC and a polymer that is able to solubilize DMPC vesicles into discrete particles. Lipodisqs® possess a broad phase transition with increased lipid ordering compared to a DMPC dispersion. The SMA polymer interacts with the lipid tails, but does not perturb the headgroup. BR is incorporated in the monomeric form, and EPR dynamic and distance measurements confirm that Lipodisqs® preserve the native structure of bR, whilst detergent solubilisation increases the overall mobility compared to bR in its native membrane, suggesting that Lipodisqs® serve as an excellent medium for EPR studies on 7 TM membrane proteins. A cysteine-depleted mutant of active, ligand binding NTS 1 is constructed. Cysteines are reintroduced at positions that may be able to monitor agonist and inverse-agonist induced conformational and dynamic changes. A spin-labeling protocol is developed, and preliminary EPR measurements are discussed. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) results are presented with uniformly- 13 C-labelled bR in the PM, resulting in a DNP enhancement of 16 using the biradical nitroxide polarizing agent, TOTAPOL. DNP-enhanced solid state NMR (ssNMR) is typically carried out at cryogenic temperatures, resulting in poor spectral resolution compared to ambient temperatures. Two different forms of samples are prepared that could potentially lead to better-resolved DNP spectra. BR is reverse labelled by adding natural abundance amino acids to isotopically labelled growth medium, resulting in the partial depletion of resonance signals that may obscure and crowd the NMR spectra. A crystalline sample of bR is prepared using the LCP method for crystallization, which is to date the most successful method for the crystallization of GPCRs. In summary, the first pulsed dipolar measurements of a protein in its native membrane are shown, Lipodisqs® are characterized and found to be a suitable medium for structural and functional studies of 7 TM membrane proteins, the first preliminary EPR studies on a ligand binding GPCR are presented, and novel sample preparation techniques are developed for the nitroxide-based DNP enhancement of ssNMR data.
