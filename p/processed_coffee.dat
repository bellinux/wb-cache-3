40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: Coffee {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} beverages in the world and it has been demonstrated that it has important therapeutic activities not only because of its caffeine content but also owing to the presence of other biologically active small molecules such as chlorogenic acid, trigonelline and cyclopentadiones. However, chlorogenic acid is degraded into catechol, pyrogallol and hydroxyhydroquinone, which are thought to induce irritation of the gastric mucosa. To reduce the content of irritant compounds processing methods have been developed prior to roasting the coffee beans. Objectives: The aim of this study was to study the anti-inflammatory and gastro-protective effects of <b>processed</b> <b>coffee</b> (Idee-Kaffee) on in LPS-treated human primary monocytes and in a murine model of colon inflammation (IBD model).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of two coffee crop systems (monocrop and agroforestry system) on the productivity of different cultivars of conilon coffee (Coffea canephora). The research was conducted at Embrapa Acre, in Rio Branco-Acre, Brazil (10 º 1 ' 30 "S, 67 º 42 ' 18 "W, 160 m of altitude). A randomized complete block design was used in split plot, with six treatments and six replications. Plots were represented by coffee crop systems and subplots by conilon coffee cultivars (BRS-Ouro Preto, Robusta Tropical and Espirito Santo), with 14 coffee plants per subplot. The agroforestry system was composed of coffee, açaí (Euterpe oleraceae), andiroba (Carapa guianensis) and banana (Musa sp). Production coffee data was related to the first harvest. They were subjected to variance analysis in the SISVAR software and means were compared by Tukey test at 5 % probability. There was no interaction between the factors studied. The cropping systems had no influence on the <b>processed</b> <b>coffee</b> productivity. However, there were significant differences in productivity among the studied coffee cultivars.

The experiment was conducted in an area of the Department of Agriculture, Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a randomized complete block design with split-plots and four replications.

Irrigations based on tensions from 60 kPa to 100 kPa are sufficient to meet the water requirements of coffee in dense plantings, but the increase in the number of plants from 10, 000 to 20, 000 compromises the sustainability of the crop through the disproportionate increase in water consumption for irrigation, with small increases in yield.

50|$|In all decaffeination <b>processes,</b> <b>coffee</b> {{is always}} {{decaffeinated}} in its green, unroasted state. The greatest {{challenge to the}} decaffeination process {{is to try to}} separate only the caffeine from the coffee beans while leaving the other chemicals such as sucrose, cellulose, proteins, citric acid, tartaric acid, and formic acid at their original concentrations. This is not an easy task considering coffee contains somewhere around 1,000 chemicals that contribute to the taste and aroma. Since caffeine is a polar, water-soluble substance, water is used in all forms of decaffeination. However, water alone is not the best solution for decaffeination because it is not a selective solvent and therefore removes other soluble substances, including sugars and proteins, as well as caffeine. Therefore, most decaffeination processes use a decaffeinating agent such as methylene chloride, activated charcoal, , or ethyl acetate. These agents help speed up the process and minimize the “washed-out” effects that water alone might have on the taste of decaffeinated coffee.|$|R
