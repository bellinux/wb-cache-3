For increasing the overall performance of such heating system the condensation gas boilers was developed and are used. However even such type of boilers don't use all energy which is released from a fuel combustion. The main factors influencing the lowering of overall performance of condensation gas boilers in case of operation in real conditions are considered. The structure of the developed mathematical model allowing estimating the overall performance of condensation gas boilers (CGB) in the conditions of real operation is considered. Performace evaluation computer experiments of such CGB during a heating season for real weather conditions of two regions of Ukraine was made. Graphic dependences of temperature conditions and heating system effectiveness change throughout a heating season are given. It was proved that normal CGB does not completely use all calorific value of fuel, thus, it isn't effective. It was also proved that the efficiency of such boilers significantly changes during a heating season depending on weather conditions and doesn't reach the greatest possible value.

40|$|We set up {{a general}} density-operator {{approach}} to geometric steady-state pumping through slowly driven open quantum systems. This approach applies to strongly interacting systems that are weakly coupled to multiple reservoirs at high temperature, illustrated by an Anderson quantum dot. Pumping {{gives rise to a}} nonadiabatic geometric phase that can be described by a framework originally developed for classical dissipative systems by Landsberg. This geometric phase is accumulated by the transported observable (charge, spin, energy) and not by the quantum state. It thus differs radically from the adiabatic Berry-Simon phase, even when generalizing it to mixed states, following Sarandy and Lidar. As a key feature, our geometric formulation of pumping stays close to a direct physical intuition (i) by tying gauge transformations to calibration of the meter registering the transported observable and (ii) by deriving a geometric connection from a driving-frequency expansion of the current. Furthermore, our approach provides a systematic and efficient way to compute the geometric pumping of various observables, including charge, spin, energy, and heat. These insights seem to be generalizable beyond the present paper's working assumptions (e. g., Born-Markov limit) to more general open-system evolutions involving memory and strong-coupling effects due to low-temperature reservoirs as well. Our geometric curvature formula reveals a general experimental scheme for performing geometric transport spectroscopy that enhances standard nonlinear spectroscopies based on measurements for static parameters. We indicate measurement strategies for separating the useful geometric pumping contribution to transport from nongeometric effects. A large part of the paper is devoted to an explicit comparison with the Sinitsyn-Nemenmann full-counting-statistics (FCS) approach to geometric pumping, restricting attention to the first moments of the pumped observable. Covering all key aspects, gauge freedom, <b>pumping</b> <b>connection,</b> curvature, and gap condition, we argue that our approach is physically more transparent and, importantly, simpler for practical calculations. In particular, this comparison allows us to clarify how in the FCS approach an "adiabatic" approximation leads to a manifestly nonadiabatic result involving a finite retardation time of the response to parameter driving...|$|R

The short-term aim was to dilate pre-existing collateral channels, and the long-term aim was to stimulate remodeling and new collateral development by increasing endothelial shear stress and wall tension. Methods: This study evaluated 20 patients with critical limb ischemia who were treated with HELP. These patients had no other option but major amputation, as determined by at least two vascular surgeons. The arterial circulation to the ischemic limb was isolated from the systemic circulation by the use of an endoluminal balloon catheter in seven patients and by an implantable, inflatable, occlusive cuff in 13. The limbs were hyperperfused through the peripheral access system with an extracorporeal pump, producing a minimally pulsatile waveform at 200 % to 300 % of the mean arterial pressure. This was performed repeatedly in sessions of 24 to 36 hours, up to a maximum of 74 hours. The primary end point was avoidance of major amputation. The secondary end points were the clinical improvements in rest pain, ulcer healing, and claudication distance. Patients were analyzed and reviewed using infrared thermography and ultrasound imaging parameters of the limb. Results: Given adequate arterial access, 39 of 40 connections developed flows four to eight times those supplied to the limb by the normal cardiac output. A progressive decrease was noted in peripheral resistance. All patients developed a pain-free, warm foot or hand while on the pump in the short-term. In the longer term at a mean of 22 months (range, 12 - 54 months), eight of 20 patients (40 %) had avoided major amputation and four more had a delay in amputation of an average of 4 months. The ankle-brachial index changed from 0. 04 ± 0. 07 (range, 0. 00 - 0. 94) to 0. 63 ± 0. 39 (t-test, P <. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To test {{short-term}} and long-term elastomeric infusion pumps for applicability in hospital practice and for ambulant patients at home. DESIGN AND METHODS: Four short-term elastomeric infusion pumps (Accufuser C 1000 M, Easypump ST 100 - 1, Infusor Intermate SV- 100, Surefuser Plus 100 ml) and four long-term pumps (Accufuser C 0100 L, Easypump LT 270 - 24, Infusor Folfusor LV- 10, Surefuser Plus 18102 - 01) {{were included in}} the study. Each was exploratively tested for accuracy and uniformity of the flow rate and sensitivity to external factors (temperature, fluid viscosity, height difference between <b>pump</b> and patient <b>connection,</b> filling degree), residual volume, evaporation upon storage, warming-up time and sterility. RESULTS: Flow rate of short-term pumps was less constant than of long-term pumps and displayed more deviations. For most pumps tested, the flow rate decreased in time. Flow rate increased at temperatures higher than the calibration temperature and decreased at lower temperatures. Higher fluid viscosity reduced flow rate. Differences in height between <b>pump</b> and patient <b>connection</b> up to 10 cm slightly influenced flow rate. Filling degree less than the nominal value reduced flow rate. Evaporation upon storage in the refrigerator was limited. Warming up from refrigerator to room temperature maximally required six hours. Sterility was maintained upon four weeks storage at 35 °C. CONCLUSION: Flow rate of elastomeric infusion pumps was not constant and was significantly influenced by external factors. There was little difference in outcome between the pumps tested. Other factors (beyond the scope of this study), such as ease to prepare, patient-friendliness and price are also important determinants for making a choice. Principally because of the limited accuracy of the flow rate, we consider elastomeric infusion pumps less suitable for administration of cytostatic agents and pain treatment than for antibiotics...|$|R

The DB 606 engine had first been introduced on the Heinkel He 119 and later used on other aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 261 where they functioned as intended, but the extremely tight cowlings on the He 177A led to considerable problems, the most common being in-flight engine fires and engine overheating.

This central exhaust system routinely became excessively hot, causing the usual accumulation of oil and grease {{in the bottom of the}} engine cowling to catch fire. When the pilot throttled back there was a tendency for the mechanical fuel injection pump on each component DB 601 engine to [...] "lag" [...] in their response in such situations, and deliver more fuel than was required by the engine, in addition to which the fuel injection <b>pump</b> <b>connections</b> often leaked. To reduce the aircraft's weight no firewall had been provided, and the aft end of each DB 606 was fitted so close to the main spar — with the rear two-thirds of the component powerplants' engine blocks being placed behind the wing's leading edge — that there was insufficient space for the fuel/oil fluid lines and electrical harnesses. The engines' exterior surfaces within the cowlings were frequently saturated with fuel and oil from leaking connections. At high altitude the oil tended to foam due to a badly designed oil pump, reducing its lubricating qualities. Insufficient lubrication resulted in the disintegration of the connecting rod bearings, resulting in the conrods sometimes bursting through either one of the component engine crankcases and puncturing the oil tanks, the contents of which would pour on to the often-overheated central exhaust pipe collector. The tightly packed nature of the [...] "power system" [...] engine installations on the He 177A, with the extreme rearwards location of the component engines in their nacelles, also led to poor maintenance access as well as very poor ventilation.

While theoretically sound, the effort to create an adequately powerful engine for the He 177 by mechanically coupling two pairs of lower-power engines into two heavy [...] "power system" [...] powerplant setups proved to be difficult to perfect, and led to numerous engine complications, turning out to be most numerous with the service test He 177A-0 and initial production A-1 models.|$|R

The system’s basic principle was to combine the discrete flow supply control of parallel pumps with the discrete effective area control of a multi-chamber cylinder to produce a speed control resolution high enough for accurate velocity tracking and positioning. Some throttling was used in the return line to control the system with overrunning loads. The properties of the system were tested with a 1 -DOF boom mockup mimicking a medium-sized mobile machine boom. The test system revealed a feature that caused load acceleration to drop when the effective cylinder area was reduced during movement. Additionally, some delay was observed in accelerating the piston against the load force. These two system properties along with the discrete control method resulted in mediocre speed and position tracking in the system when movement was directed against the load force. The system was able to control restricting and overrunning loads as well as a large inertia mass with a low load force.

The performance of the machine was evaluated for the stirring, settling and heating time of the oil and the optimum operating conditions of rotational speed of the shaft and stirrer by degumming and neutralizing the crude groundnut oil with water and neutralizing reagents in the first tank after which is then transferred into the second tank via <b>pump</b> and pipe <b>connections</b> for heating so as to evaporate the available water to the required moisture content for safe storage. The test showed that the maximum efficiency of the clarifier was obtained using the sodium hydroxide reagent for neutralization and oil recovery which were 81. 4 % and 93. 41 % on the average respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{analyzed}} {{building in}} this project is located in Valbo, 9016 Stiftelsev 6. This house is a property of Gavlegårdarna, and it is {{being used as a}} house for disabled people. The building consists on five apartments, with one patient in each apartment. Some social workers help those patients in everything they need, making their living in the house as easy as possible. The aim of this project is to find out the best option of reducing the energy consumption in this house. There are some alternatives to reduce the energy or the energy costs as; efficiency measures, load management and energy conversion. This project is focused on the energy conversion for reducing the energy consumption. As it is the best option for obtaining a considerable reduction in the annual costs. First of all the energy balance of the house is analyzed. By studying the energy balance it is possible to find out how the energy consumption of the house is divided. On one hand there is the heat supplied {{and on the other hand}} the heat losses. As it was said before this project is focused in the reduction of the energy consumption by means of converting to another energy supplying method. Two alternatives have been studied: the installation of a heat <b>pump</b> and the <b>connection</b> to the district heating of Gävle...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 {{appeared}} on page 23 of the March/April issue. In {{a study of}} five egg breaking plants {{ranging in size from}} small to very large installations, in-plant waste conservation methods resulted in recovery of product with a value between. $ 250 and $ 500 per day for a medium sized facility. After completion of the effluent analysis, detailed in-plant sampling was conducted to determine the source of pollutants. This included collecting weighted composited sam-ples of the egg washer overflow and sump contents, continual overflow from the egg breaker and flushing of vats, tanks, strainers, piping and pasteurizer. Other sources of water included rejected inedible eggs from the washer and breaker operations that were not deposited in the proper receptacles, egg product dripping from the breaking machine, malfunc-tioning egg loading device on the egg washing machine, leaking <b>pumps</b> and piping <b>connections</b> and vat spillovers. All of the latter losses are examples of unmeasurable loss-es that were referred to as floor losses. Examples of the comparison of the total of various sources are shown in Figure 6. Although the egg washers contributed only five to ten percent of the plant’s total wastewa-ter, the BOD loss represented from one quarter to half the total plant loss. Since the total volume of egg washing water in a medium sized fa-cility (three breakers, for example) would-be about 500 gpd, it seemed appropriate to consider removing this entire stream from the sewer.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} tool to study the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on {{hemodynamics}} in conjunction with baroreflex and mechanical circulatory assistance. To this aim, a numerical model of the pharmacodynamic effect of SNP was developed and inserted into a cardiovascular circulatory model integrated with baroreflex and LVAD (continuous flow <b>pump</b> with atrio-aortic <b>connection)</b> sub-models. The experiments were carried out in two steps. In the first step the model was verified comparing simulations with experimental data acquired from mongrel dogs on mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), peripheral resistance, and left ventricular properties. In the second step, the combined action of SNP and mechanical circulatory assistance was studied. Data were measured at pump off and at pump on (20000 rpm and 24000 rpm). At pump off, with a 2. 5 ?g/kg per min SNP infusion in heart failure condition, the MAP was reduced by approximately 8 %, CO and HR increased by about 16 % and 18 %, respectively. In contrast, during assistance (24000 rpm) the changes in MAP, CO and HR were around - 9 %, + 12 %, and + 20 %, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of the drug on hemodynamic parameters at different heart conditions were significantly different. Thus, the model provides insight into the complex interactions between baroreflex, drug infusion, and LVAD and could be a support for clinical decision-making in cardiovascular pathologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHigh {{biological}} activity causes a distinct seasonality of surface water pH in the North Sea, {{which is a}} strong sink for atmospheric CO 2 via an effective shelf <b>pump.</b> The intimate <b>connection</b> between the North Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean suggests that the variability of the CO 2 system of the North Atlantic Ocean may, in part, {{be responsible for the}} observed variability of pH and CO 2 in the North Sea. In this work, we demonstrate the role of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the dominant climate mode for the North Atlantic, in governing this variability. Based on three extensive observational records covering the relevant levels of the NAO index, we provide evidence that the North Sea pH and CO 2 system strongly responds to external and internal expressions of the NAO. Under positive NAO, the higher rates of inflow of water from the North Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic outflow lead to a strengthened north-south biogeochemical divide. The limited mixing between the north and south leads to a steeper gradient in pH and partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO(2)) between the two regions in the productive period. This is exacerbated further when coinciding with higher sea surface temperature, which concentrates the net community production in the north through shallower stratification. These effects can be obscured by changing properties of the constituent North Sea water masses, which are also influenced by NAO. Our results highlight the importance of examining interannual trends in the North Sea CO 2 system with consideration of the NAO state...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this report {{discusses}} the energy use in non-residential buildings through a literature survey. The questions addressed are the division of energy use according to different purposes, correspondence between measured and calculated energy use and future trends in the energy use. The building categories discussed in more detail are office buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals and educational buildings. The energy use in these building types varies greatly, both considering the specific energy use, and energy use according to the purpose. When comparing measured and calculated energy uses, big deviations have been reported in all the discussed building categories such that the calculated energy is clearly lower than the measured use for new buildings, and vice versa for old buildings. To be able to understand this deviation and to better model the building energy use, better measurement data, as well as more accurate input data are needed. The second part of the report presents case examples of buildings and building complexes with integrated energy solutions and systems for waste heat utilization. From the case studies it could be concluded that such system solutions generally consist of and energy storage, heat <b>pumps,</b> and a <b>connection</b> to the district heating system to cover the peak load. Utilization of waste heat is seen as a good energy efficiency measure, enabling reductions in both heating and cooling demands, as well as reducing the overall energy costs. Interaction of the energy supply of different buildings for better utilization of waste heat is however so far little practiced...|$|R
