25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different <b>phage</b> <b>type,</b> the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E
50|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Cornell, George under- took graduate {{studies in the}} genetics of T-even coliphage with S. E. Luria in the Bacteriology Department of the University of Illinois. His studies revealed phenotypic mixing, in which a phage with a host-range genotype of one <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> {{was found in a}} particle who was phenotypically dissimilar. When published in 1956, these studies had profound impact on the study of viral biology. During his postdoc at Caltech, with Jean Weigle, he undertook further studies on T2 × T4 hybrids, which led to the discovery of DNA modification (by glucosylation). At the University of Oregon, Streisinger pioneered the study of zebrafish in his lab. Zebrafish can be genetically modified easily, and researchers can modify them to mimic the traits of certain diseases. In analyzing these created diseases, scientists seek solutions to diseases which affect humans. Over 5,000 researchers in 450 labs throughout 31 countries study zebrafish, and many of them received their initial training at the University of Oregon.|$|E
40|$|Eleven of the 33 {{strains of}} Salmonella enteritidis (S. E.) {{included}} in this study belonged to <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> 34.

Two of the remaining three <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> 34 strains grouped into two different clusters, well separated from the other <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> 34 strains. One strain of <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> 34 was genetically diverse and did not cluster with any of the strains {{included in this}} study.

However, unlike for serovar Typhimurium, a rapid and inexpensive subtyping method has not been available for large-scale surveillance efforts. We developed a <b>phage</b> <b>typing</b> scheme and subtyped 2, 523 strains of serovar Heidelberg from outbreaks, sporadic infections, and environmental sources in Canada between January 1991 and December 2000. All strains were sensitive {{to one or more}} phages and could be subdivided into 49 <b>phage</b> <b>types.</b> A total of 196 isolates from 13 major outbreaks could be subtyped into six <b>phage</b> <b>types,</b> while 86 strains from family outbreaks were assigned to seven <b>phage</b> <b>types.</b> All strains were typeable, and epidemiologically related strains isolated from patients and implicated foods had identical <b>phage</b> <b>types,</b> antibiograms, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns.

40|$|Summary. Sixty-two {{selected}} {{strains of}} Salmonella serotype Enteritidis of 33 <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> (PTs), and one strain classified as RDNC, were characterised by four different chromosomally based typing methods to elucidate genetic relationships among strains of different <b>phage</b> <b>types.</b> Based on IS 200 -hybridisation patterns, two major groups, containing {{strains of the}} most commonly encountered <b>phage</b> <b>types,</b> and six minor groups (seven with the RDNC strain included) were observed. IS 200 pattern was a stable epidemiological marker in strains of all <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> except PT 6 a and 14 b. Ribotyping separated strains of the <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> into one major and five minor groups; the pattern of the RDNC strain was not seen with other strains. More than one ribotype was observed among strains of Enteritidis PTs 6, 7, 14 b and 21. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, strains of 21 of the 33 <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> formed one large cluster when bands> 125 kb were used as the criterion for separation. Among strains belonging to PTs 1, 6, 7 and 14 b, more than one pattern was observed by this method. By probing with five random cloned fragments of the Enteritidis chromosome, strains from 27 of 31 <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> examined showed the same hybridisation pattern. With the combined use of four genotypic methods, two groups of strains, representing eight and seven of 33 Enteritidis <b>phage</b> <b>types,</b> were formed; these two groups may be considered as the main evolutionary lines of Enteritidis.

40|$|Isolates of the Salmonella enterica {{serotype}} Typhimurium definitive <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> (DT 104) {{were found}} to contain the same prophage (designated phage ST 104). The complete sequence of the DNA genome of prophage ST 104 was determined. The entire DNA sequence consisted of 41, 391 bp, including 64 open reading frames, and exhibited high similarity to P 22 and to <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> conversion phage ST 64 T...|$|E
40|$|In human impetigo, Group A beta {{hemolytic}} streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus are {{the organisms}} most frequently implicated as etiologic agents (1 - 8). The majority of S. aureus strains recovered in pure form from skin lesions belong to <b>phage</b> <b>Type</b> 71 (1, 2, 5 - 7, 9). Strains of this staphylococcal <b>phage</b> <b>Type</b> {{have a number}} of unusuM biological activities. Penicillin G resistance is common among <b>phage</b> <b>Type</b> 71 staphylococci (5, 9). These organisms produce opacity in horse serum agar but not in egg yolk broth medium (9). On solid media, Corynebacterium diphtheriae is inhibited by these staphylococci (1, 9). In previous work from our laboratory a bactericidal substance active in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive microorganisms has been isolated from culture supernates of <b>phage</b> <b>Type</b> 71 staphylococci (10, 11). This extracellular proteinaceous material has properties characteristic of some classes of bacteriocins (11). It inhibits protein and DNA synthesis and degrades RNA in susceptible cells (12), with concomitant changes in intracellular appearance (13). The present communication is an extension of these in vitro studies. It document...|$|E
40|$|In Salmonella typhimurium <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> 204 c {{isolated}} in Britain, gentamicin resistance is specified by plasmids of the I 1 compatibility group which also confer resistance to apramycin. These plasmids have been subdivided into three types within the I 1 {{group on the}} basis of their antibiotic resistance specificity, their ability to produce colicin Ib and their restriction enzyme digest fragmentation patterns. All three have been identified in strains from cattle, but as yet only two types have been found in strains from humans. It is suggested that the use of apramycin in animal husbandry is responsible for the appearance of gentamicin resistance in multiresistant strains of <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> 204 c, a <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> already epidemic in bovine animals and with an increasing incidence in humans...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophages were {{observed}} in forestomach contents from three species of Australian macropodoid marsupials possessing a foregut fermentative digestion: the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), the eastern wallaroo (Macropus robustus robustus), and the rufous bettong (Aepyprymnus rufescens). Forty-six morphologically distinct <b>phage</b> <b>types,</b> representing the families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae, were identified. The range of forms varied between host species. The greatest diversity of <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> was found in forestomach contents of the wallaroo, and few <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> were recorded from the rufous bettongs. It is concluded that macropodoid marsupials, in common with their eutherian counterparts, possess diverse populations of bacteriophages in their fermentative forestomachs...|$|R
40|$|The {{gastroenteritis}} incidence {{caused by}} Salmonella Hadar has {{increased over the}} last decades worldwide. The uncontrolled use of antimicrobials for treating human patients and veterinary field contributes to increase the multidrug resistance of this serovar. In the present investigation, a total of 179 S. Hadar isolates from different sources of foodchain in Brazil were <b>phage</b> <b>typed</b> and analyzed for their antimicrobial resistance profile. The main S. Hadar <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> isolated were PT 38, PT 39, PT 40, PT 11, PT 34, PT 1 and PT 22. Others <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> as PT 13, PT 19, PT 21, PT 23, PT 31, PT 33 and PT 37 were obtained in low percentages. A total of 35, 7 % S. Hadar strains were resistant to two or more antimicrobials drugs. Furthermore, no resistance to third generation cephalosporin or ciprofloxacin was identified in these strains. Those results appoint to S. Hadar <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> circulating among animals, food and humans, {{as well as the}} increasing of multidrug resistance. The surveillance and monitoring of S. Hadar strains based on <b>phage</b> <b>typing</b> and antimicrobial resistance profile are useful for detecting outbreaks, identifying sources of infection and implementing prevention and control measures of salmonellosis...|$|R
