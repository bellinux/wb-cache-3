40|$|The wheeled robots {{have been}} {{successfully}} applied in many aspects, such as industrial handling vehicles, and wheeled service robots. To improve the safety and reliability of wheeled robots, this paper presents a novel hybrid fault diagnosis framework based on Mittag-Leffler kernel (ML-kernel) support vector machine (SVM) and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) fusion. Using sensor data sampled under different running conditions, the proposed approach initially establishes multiple principal component analysis (PCA) models for fault feature extraction. The fault feature vectors are then applied to train the probabilistic SVM (PSVM) classifiers that arrive at a <b>preliminary</b> fault <b>diagnosis.</b> To improve the accuracy of preliminary results, a novel ML-kernel based PSVM classifier is proposed in this paper, and the positive definiteness of the ML-kernel is proved as well. The basic probability assignments (BPAs) are defined based on the <b>preliminary</b> fault <b>diagnosis</b> results and their confidence values. Eventually, the final fault diagnosis result is archived by the fusion of the BPAs. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed framework not only is capable of detecting and identifying the faults in the robot driving system, but also has better performance in stability and diagnosis accuracy compared with the traditional methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of {{automatically}} detecting anomalies in images, i. e., patterns that do not conform to those appearing in a reference training set. This is a very important feature for enabling an intelligent system to autonomously check the validity of acquired data, thus performing a <b>preliminary,</b> automatic, <b>diagnosis.</b> We approach this problem in a patch-wise manner, by learning a model to represent patches belonging to a training set of normal images. Here, we consider a model based on sparse representations, and we show that jointly monitoring the sparsity and the reconstruction error of such representation substantially improves the detection performance with respect to other ap-proaches leveraging sparse models. As an illustrative application, we consider the detection of anomalies in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, which is essential for supervising the production of nanofibrous materials.

40|$|Vesiculoviruses (VSV) are {{zoonotic}} {{viruses that}} cause vesicular stomatitis disease in cattle, horses and pigs, {{as well as}} sporadic human cases of acute febrile illness. Therefore, diagnosis of VSV infections by reliable laboratory techniques is important to allow a proper case management and implementation of strategies for the containment of virus spread. We show here a sensitive and reproducible real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection and quantification of VSV. The assay was evaluated with arthropods and serum samples obtained from horses, cattle and patients with acute febrile disease. The real-time RT-PCR amplified the Piry, Carajas, Alagoas and Indiana Vesiculovirus at a melting temperature 81. 02 ± 0. 8 ºC, and the sensitivity of assay was estimated in 10 RNA copies/mL to the Piry Vesiculovirus.
