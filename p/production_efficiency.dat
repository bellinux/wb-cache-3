25|$|In My Life and Work Ford speaks (briefly) {{of racing}} {{in a rather}} dismissive tone, as {{something}} that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing. Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, <b>production</b> <b>efficiency,</b> affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.|$|E
25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and <b>production</b> <b>efficiency</b> is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} energy generation, {{hydrogen}} production could be centralized, distributed or {{a mixture of}} both. While generating hydrogen at centralized primary energy plants promises higher hydrogen <b>production</b> <b>efficiency,</b> difficulties in high-volume, long range hydrogen transportation (due to factors such as [...] hydrogen damage and the ease of hydrogen diffusion through solid materials) makes electrical energy distribution attractive within a hydrogen economy. In such a scenario, small regional plants or even local filling stations could generate hydrogen using energy provided through the electrical distribution grid. While hydrogen generation efficiency {{is likely to be}} lower than for centralized hydrogen generation, losses in hydrogen transport could make such a scheme more efficient in terms of the primary energy used per kilogram of hydrogen delivered to the end user.|$|E

40|$|High {{temperature}} electrolysis (HTE) {{involves the}} splitting of stream into {{hydrogen and oxygen}} at high temperatures. The primary advantage of HTE over conventional low temperature electrolysis is that considerably higher hydrogen <b>production</b> <b>efficiencies</b> can be achieved. Performing the electrolysis process at high temperatures results in more favorable thermodynamics for electrolysis, more efficient production of electricity, and allows direct use of process heat to generate steam. This paper {{presents the results of}} process analyses performed to evaluate the hydrogen <b>production</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of an HTE plant coupled to a 600 MWt Modular Helium Reactor (MHR) that supplies both the electricity and process heat needed to drive the process. The MHR operates with a coolant outlet temperature of 950 C. Approximately 87 % of the high-temperature heat is used to generate electricity at high efficiency using a direct, Brayton-cycle power conversion system. The remaining high-temperature heat is used to generate a superheated steam / hydrogen mixture that is supplied to the electrolyzers. The analyses were performed using the HYSYS process modeling software. The model used to perform the analyses consisted of three loops; a primary high temperature helium loop, a secondary helium loop and the HTE process loop. The detailed model included realistic representations of all major components in the system, including pumps, compressors, heat exchange equipment, and the electrolysis stack. The design of the hydrogen production process loop also included a steam-sweep gas system to remove oxygen from the electrolysis stack {{so that it can be}} recovered and used for other applications. Results of the process analyses showed that hydrogen <b>production</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in the range of 45 % to 50 % are achievable with this system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 03 {{production}} in the Nashville urban plume during the 03 episode that occurred on July I l-July 13 1995, is examined to characterize the factors that control the ozone <b>production</b> rate and <b>efficiency,</b> and to examine {{the relative importance of}} natural and anthropogenic sources of hydrocarbons to ozone {{production in}} the urban center and outlying areas. The analysis focuses on data collected during aircraft flights on July 11 when the Nashville area was sampled more or less continuously from about 1000 to 1800 LT. The instantaneous ozone production rate P(O 3) in the downtom area from late morning through midafternoon on July 11 ranged between 10 and greater than 30 ppbv/h depending on location. After 1700 local time, production rates dropped to a few ppbv/h owing to the diminished solar intensity. Instantaneous <b>production</b> <b>efficiencies</b> with respect to NOx in the downtown area ranged between 2. 5 and 8, linearly depending on the ratio of the hydrocarbon to NOx, OH reactivity. Integral O 3 <b>production</b> <b>efficiencies</b> corrected for NOz losses ranged between 1. 5 and 4. The lowest efficiency was observed in the downtown area in the morning where NO • concentrations were high and hydrocarbon to NOx reactivity ratios were the lowest. Throughout he day, P(O 3) in the downtown area was limited by the availability of hydro-carbons. Anthropogenic hydrocarbons and CO contributed about 66 % of the total hydrocarbo...|$|R
