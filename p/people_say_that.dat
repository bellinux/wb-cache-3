5|$|The Nafana <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{they come}} from a village called Kakala in Ivory Coast. Their oral history says {{that some of their}} people are still there, and if they go back they {{will not be allowed to}} leave again. They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from Begho (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory is that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> one of the beams in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another theory is that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E

25|$|A small {{minority}} of <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they dream only in black and white. A 2008 study by {{a researcher at the}} University of Dundee found that people who were only exposed to black and white television and film in childhood reported dreaming in black and white about 25% of the time.|$|E
25|$|Other defences include sea walls, groynes, and gabions but {{business}} <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> if {{the erosion}} is not stopped {{then there will}} be millions of pounds of damage. However, one or more such groynes has had a detrimental effect further along the coast, in some areas resulting in erosion of up to twenty metres per year initially, though over the long term erosion rates have been seen to revert to their original yearly average of closer to two metres a year.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> voting is important, {{and a good}} {{practice}} for them to do, every year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not think a vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E

50|$|The Local Coordination Committees also {{initially}} {{claimed that}} the death toll was more than 200 <b>people,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> they were working to confirm the number of deaths.

25|$|Oral {{histories}} of the Garanganze <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the expedition kept Msiri's head – by some accounts in a can of kerosene – but it cursed and killed everyone who carried it and eventually, this included Stairs. He was ill with malaria throughout January 1892. After being relieved by another expedition, the Stairs Expedition {{set out on the}} long return journey to Zanzibar. Stairs was frequently sick but by May 1892 had recovered. On a steamer down the lower Zambezi he had another attack of malaria which killed him on 9 June 1892. He is buried in the European Cemetery in Chinde, Mozambique {{at the mouth of the}} Zambezi River.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. <b>People</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E

500|$|... "People in the {{industry}} treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of me for that. So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. I find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E

[...] "I talked to her about my character... she explained to me how it was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, a lot of <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I act like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, {{to the fact that}} she's new.

50|$|Early authors, such as Hector Boece (1465-1536), {{often use}} the term 'Garnoth' or 'Garnott' and may be {{referring}} to a single large loch incorporating Kilbirnie Loch and Loch Winnoch (Barr and Castle Semple Lochs).

500|$|A direct {{relationship}} between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in A Writer's Conception of Realism that he reacted with [...] "shock" [...] when he [...] "...heard <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{one of my own}} books Winesburg, Ohio, was an exact picture of Ohio village life." [...] The author went on to admit that, [...] "the hint for almost every character was taken from my fellow lodgers in a large rooming house..." [...] These lodgers were the [...] "...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors..." [...] and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as [...] "The Little Children of the Arts". The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde [...] "merging" [...] with Anderson's interactions at the boardinghouse.|$|E
500|$|Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{said that}} second season {{was the one}} on which {{the rest of the}} series was based, with {{characters}} taking long-term roles such as Geordi La Forge as Chief Engineer and Worf at the Tactical station. DeCandido said that the addition of Goldberg as Guinan was [...] "delightful", but that Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski [...] "didn't entirely work as a character". In his view, the episodes during season two were varied in quality. He gave [...] "Q Who" [...] ten out of ten, while he gave [...] "Shades of Grey" [...] a zero. It {{was the first time he}} awarded the top score to an episode; none of the first season had qualified. He gave the season an overall mark of seven out of ten and said that [...] "Far too many <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> TNG didn't come into its own until the third season, and frankly, I think that that estimation comes a year too late." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} been called [...] "feminist", and more {{specifically}} [...] "vintage Atwood-feminist", but Atwood disagrees, saying, [...] "I wouldn't even call it feminist. Every time you write something {{from the point of}} view of a woman, <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it's feminist." [...] The Penelopiads antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood's previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in Cat's Eye, and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin, and follows Atwood's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey, like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope's dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids' lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirizes Robert Graves' theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship: [...] "Consider us pure symbol. We're no more real than money." ...|$|E
