25|$|The {{number of}} pitta genera has varied considerably, ranging {{from one to}} as many as nine. In his 1863 work A Monograph of the <b>Pittidae</b> Daniel Elliot split the pittas into two genera, Pitta for the species with {{comparatively}} long tails and Brachyurus for the shorter tailed species. Barely two decades later, in 1880/81, John Gould split the family into nine genera, to which he also included the lesser melampitta (Melampitta), where it was kept until 1931 when Ernst Mayr demonstrated it had the syrinx was of an oscine bird. Soon afterwards Philip Sclater's Catalogue of the Birds of the British Museum brought the number back down to three.|$|E

2500|$|Pittas are a family, <b>Pittidae,</b> [...] of {{passerine}} birds mainly {{found in}} tropical Asia and Australasia, although {{a couple of}} species live in Africa. Pittas are all similar in general structure and habits, and have often been placed in a single genus, although as of 2009 they are now split into three genera, Pitta, Erythropitta and Hydrornis. The name {{is derived from the}} word pitta in the Telugu language of [...] South India and is a generic local name used for all small birds. Pittas are medium-sized by passerine standards, at [...] in length, and stocky, with strong, longish legs and long feet. They have very short tails and stout, slightly decurved bills. Many, but not all, have brightly coloured plumage.|$|E

It is curious, however, {{that this is}} only an apparent exception, for almost all the bright colours are on the under surface, the back being usually olive green or brown, and the head black, with brown or whitish stripes, all which colours would harmonize with the foliage, sticks, and roots which surround the nest, built {{on or near the}} ground, and thus serve as a protection to the female bird.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wallace {{admits that}} with the King-crows (Dicrurus), Orioles, and <b>Pittidæ,</b> the females are conspicuously coloured, yet they build open nests; but he urges that the birds of the first group are highly pugnacious and could defend themselves; that those of the second group take extreme care in concealing their open nests, {{but this does not}} {{invariably}} hold good;[208] and {{that with the}} birds of the third group the females are brightly coloured chiefly on the under surface. Besides these cases the whole great family of pigeons, which are sometimes brightly, and almost always conspicuously coloured, and which are notoriously liable to the attacks of birds of prey, offers a serious exception to the rule, for pigeons almost always build open and exposed nests. In another large family, that of the Humming-birds, all the species build open nests, yet {{with some of the most}} gorgeous species the sexes are alike; and in the majority, the females, though less brilliant than the males, are very brightly coloured. Nor can it be maintained that all female humming-birds, which are brightly coloured, escape detection by their tints being green, for some display on their upper surfaces red, blue, and other colours.[209] ...|$|E

(13. For instance, the female Eupetomena macroura has the head and tail dark blue with reddish loins; the female Lampornis porphyrurus is blackish-green on the upper surface, with the lores and sides of the throat crimson; the female Eulampis jugularis has the top of the head and back green, but the loins and the tail are crimson. Many other instances of highly conspicuous females could be given. See Mr. Gould's magnificent work on this family.) ...|$|E

It was originally considered to be the same species as the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), native to India and Pakistan. However, due to differences in plumage, morphology, and vocalization, the fairy pitta was recognized as a separate species in 1996. In contemporary taxonomy, the fairy pitta forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta, mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha) and blue-winged pitta (P. moluccensis). Among the 30 species of <b>Pittidae</b> worldwide, the fairy pitta is the most northerly and only species breeding in Northeast Asia.|$|E

Soon afterwards Philip Sclater's Catalogue of the Birds of the British Museum brought the number back down to three.|$|E
