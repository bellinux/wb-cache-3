5|$|Nowadays, large {{quantities}} of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or <b>perishable</b> <b>cargoes.</b> Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|R

5000|$|But, when {{negligence}} {{is followed}} by a natural event of such magnitude that it erases the physical effects of the original negligence, the defendant’s liability ceases at the moment in time when the supervening condition occurs. In Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government, the Carslogie collided with the Heimgar and admitted liability. Temporary repairs were effected with permanent repairs to be carried out later in the United States. After the collision but before crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar was given a certificate of seaworthiness, authorising her to be continued in her present class without fresh record of survey, subject to permanent repairs at the owner's convenience. She was held fit to carry dry and <b>perishable</b> <b>cargoes.</b> While crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar encountered heavy weather and sustained such serious damage as to become unseaworthy and to require immediate dry docking. Thus, prior to encountering the rough weather, the Heimgar was a seaworthy vessel, capable of earning profits for her owners. Repairs due to the collision and to the heavy weather, as well as the owner's repairs were all carried out at the same time. Ten of the fifty days in dry dock were allocated to the repair of the collision damage and the question for the House of Lords was whether the owners of the Carslogie were liable for that ten-day loss of earning capacity. The claim was for damages because a working ship is [...] "a profit-earning machine". If she ceases to earn a profit, it is essential to consider what caused the detention in dry dock at that time. In this case, the Heimgar was a profit-earning vessel before suffering the heavy weather damage. Thus, the loss of earnings at that time was not caused by the collision. Hence, The Oropesa demonstrates that where there are two successive causes of harm, the court may regard the first event as the cause of all the harm, or hold that the second supervening event reduces or eliminates the effect of the initial negligence as in Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government.|$|R
40|$|Revenue {{management}} is {{the practice of}} selecting those customers that generate the maximum revenue from a fixed and <b>perishable</b> capacity. <b>Cargo</b> revenue management differs from the well-known passenger revenue management problem {{by the fact that}} its capacity constraint is 2 -dimensional, i. e. weight and volume, and that the weight, volume and profit of each booking request are random and continuous variables. This leads to a multi-dimensional on-line knapsack problem. We show that a bid-price acceptance policy is asymptotically optimal if demand and capacity increase proportionally and the bid-prices are set correctly. We provide a heuristic to set the bid-prices based on a greedy algorithm for the multi-knapsack problem proposed by Rinnooy Kan et al. (1993). A test case shows that these bid-prices perform better than the traditional LP-based bid-prices that do not perform well at all for this problem. revenue management;cargo transportation;multi-dimensional knapsack;on-line knapsack...|$|R
