Grant's group crash-lands on the island, while a <b>parallel</b> <b>investigation</b> is being carried out on the mainland. The aviary sequence and laboratory set piece were initially much longer and more complex, including Velociraptor stealthily entering the hatchery as the team spends the night there.

25|$|Throughout the Black Committee {{process and}} a smaller, <b>parallel</b> <b>investigation</b> by the Justice Department {{directed}} by special prosecutor Carl. L. Ristine, {{the allegations of}} corruption by Lewis and Black were never investigated. The original air mail contracts were instead voided {{on the basis that}} they were illegally bid, without revealing what evidence was gathered on which that judgment was made and disregarding that most were obtained by the lowest bidder with the rest through statutory provisions of the Air Mail Act of 1930. The Air Mail Act of 1934 repealed those provisions, but with one exception, the carriers charged with illegally securing contracts under them were permitted to reacquire them despite provisions in the new act forbidding it.|$|E

2500|$|On July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 {{exploded}} {{and crashed}} into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 230 persons on board.

However, on November 18, 1997, the FBI closed its investigation by announcing that [...] "no evidence has been found which would indicate that a criminal act was the cause of the tragedy of TWA flight 800." [...] Almost three years later, in August 2000, the NTSB published its final report which stated that [...] "the probable cause of the TWA flight 800 accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank (CWT), resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing in 2004, Ion Simuț {{argued that}} Ornea's death {{had contributed to}} {{depleting}} Romania's literary scene of its specialists, a negative phenomenon which, he argued, was leading literary historiography into the [...] "most serious impasse in its evolution". A similar assessment was provided by literary chronicler Gabriel Dimisianu, who noted Ornea's role in influencing others to take up literary research, [...] "an activity that {{is more and more}} exposed to hardships." [...] Literary historian Ileana Ghemeș notes that the [...] "generic assessment and labels" [...] Ornea's Sămănătorismul generated in relation to the [...] "clichés" [...] of traditionalist literature were still shaping the analytical work of other Romanian researchers in later decades. Among Ornea's other scholarly works, Anii treizecii... inaugurated further investigations in the field, carried out by younger researchers: Sorin Alexandrescu, Marta Petreu and Florin Țurcanu among them. According to Cristea-Enache, such [...] "rigurously scientific research" [...] was equivalent to Ana Selejan's <b>parallel</b> <b>investigation</b> into the communization of Romania's literary scene during the late 1940s and early 1950s. In addition to Ornea's direct influences on his colleagues' approach, Manolescu credits his older friend's persistence and active encouragement with having led him to pursue work on his own synthesis of Romanian literary history, Istoria critică a literaturii române ("The Critical History of Romanian Literature").|$|E
