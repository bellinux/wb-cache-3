5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550MW {{power plant}} in Riverside County, California, that uses {{thin-film}} CdTe-modules made by First Solar. As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt Topaz Solar Farm was the largest photovoltaic {{power plant in}} the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex.

40|$|The {{study is}} {{focusing}} on comparison of efficiency and ecological impacts of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> depending on their locations in the Czech Republic. The report gives us an overview of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> efficiency and also their environmental value by minimising CO 2 emissions due to replacing conventional energy technologies. The research is based on data taken from energy audits of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> in Vidov (South Bohemia), in Hodonice (South Moravia) and Lahošť (North Bohemia). The measured data of efficiency and CO 2 savings are compared to forecast data from numerical weather prediction models PVSYST, PVGIS and Meteonorm. The project revealed, that <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> efficiency directly depends on their geographic location. Decisive factor was sunlight. Paired comparison showed, {{that there is a}} difference between <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> in Lahošť, Hodonice (P < 0, 01) and Vidov (P < 0, 05).

5|$|A <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> {{also known}} as a solar park, is a {{large-scale}} photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite, as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period. Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
