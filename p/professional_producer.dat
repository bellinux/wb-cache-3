2500|$|Recording {{took place}} in Pantego, Texas at the Pantego Sound Studio and the band were feeling {{confident}} about their material and themselves, finally feeling that they were making the kind of album they believed in.

Although they had already recorded four albums prior to Cowboys from Hell, Pantera felt that this was their true debut, working with a <b>professional</b> <b>producer</b> and a major label {{for the first time and}} creating music that was not simply stealing from other similar bands in an attempt to attract attention.|$|E

The majority of the album was recorded {{over the course of}} a three-month period in the studio. Initially thinking they were done, upon listening to the material, the band decided they wanted to restructure and re-record some songs, while additionally recording some new songs, that were ultimately not used in the final album. The band opted to almost entirely re-record the material from Papa's Dojo for their major label debut. The band hadn't initially planned on doing this, but went with it once they realized how well their old songs sounded when they were re-recorded in a high-tech studio with a <b>professional</b> <b>producer</b> and equipment like Pro-Tools. The process was further drawn out while they searched for an mixing engineer to provide the album's final mix they felt best complimented their sound, who ended up being Chris Lord-Alge.|$|E
