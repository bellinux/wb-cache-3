Sculptures of a Calusa family stand on the mound next to a palm-thatched house, suggesting that the visitor is looking outside and into the past. Inside, interpretive panels discuss mounds and Calusa town plans. Next to the window, an interactive model shows a cutaway view of a mound and explains archaeologists' methods of interpreting the past.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{railroads and}} carbuilders were debuting carbody and {{interior}} styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettes—that is, the car's interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman's roomettes, however, were designed with the single traveler in mind. The roomette featured a large <b>picture</b> <b>window,</b> a privacy door, a single fold-away bed, a sink and small toilet. The roomette's floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveler to ride in luxury compared to the multilevel semiprivate berths of old.|$|E

BOAC installed 36 reclining [...] "slumberseats" [...] with [...] centres on its first Comets, allowing for greater leg room in front and behind; Air France had 11 rows of seats with four seats to a row installed on its Comets. Large <b>picture</b> <b>window</b> views and table seating accommodations for a row of passengers afforded a [...] "feel of comfort and luxury" [...] atypical of transportation of the period. Amenities included a galley that could serve hot and cold food and drinks, a bar, and separate men's and women's toilets. Provisions for emergency situations included several life rafts stored in the wings near the engines, and individual life vests were stowed under each seat.|$|E

In particular, tools {{with a pair of}} [...] "hue" [...] and [...] "saturation" [...] sliders are commonplace, dating to at least the late-1980s, but various more complicated color tools have also been implemented. For instance, the Unix image viewer and color editor xv allowed six user-definable hue (H) ranges to be rotated and resized, included a dial-like control for saturation (S'HSV), and a curves-like interface for controlling value (V)—see fig. 17. The image editor <b>Picture</b> <b>Window</b> Pro includes a [...] "color correction" [...] tool which affords complex remapping of points in a hue/saturation plane relative to either HSL or HSV space.|$|E
