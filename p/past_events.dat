In a continuing story arc for the third series, Nicola Walker was cast {{in the role of}} Helen Bartlett, a character driven to emotional instability by <b>past</b> <b>events</b> unearthed by the Manchester Metropolitan Police. In preparation for the role Walker visited a psychologist in order to build upon her characterisation.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling <b>past</b> <b>events.</b> He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E

25|$|The {{inferential}} past or miş-past can {{be understood}} as asserting that a past participle is applicable now; hence it is used when the fact of a <b>past</b> <b>event,</b> as such, is not important; in particular, the inferential past is used when one did not actually witness the <b>past</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R

5|$|As they travel, a {{man named}} Baxter (Michael Smiley), who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where there are crucified and hanged bodies. As the woman {{is about to be}} tortured, Jem kills Baxter. They {{continue}} traveling to the transmitter, while the woman has visions of <b>past</b> <b>events.</b> When they reach the transmitter, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for <b>past</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful {{not to make the}} story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on <b>past</b> <b>events.</b> Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.|$|E
50|$|The {{definite}} past or di-past is used {{to assert}} that something did happen in the past.The inferential past or miş-past {{can be understood as}} asserting that a past participle is applicable now; hence it is used when the fact of a <b>past</b> <b>event,</b> as such, is not important; in particular, the inferential past is used when one did not actually witness the <b>past</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R

5|$|After Amaterasu and Susano defeat Orochi to save Kushi, recreating <b>past</b> <b>events,</b> Orochi's spirit floats northward. Amaterasu and Issun {{embark on}} a journey across Nippon, first {{arriving}} at Ryoshima Coast and Sei-An City, the capital of Nippon. There, they work with the beautiful priestess Rao, the legendary submarine Dragon Kingdom, and the reclusive Queen Himiko to rid the coastline and city of Orochi's influence, including destroying a demonic plague and retrieving a mystical weapon from a sunken trading ship. However, it is revealed that the real Rao was killed before Amaterasu arrived, and the Rao they had {{been working with the}} false fox god, Ninetails, who murders Himiko before returning to her fortress on the elusive Oni Island. Amaterasu and Issun eventually find and kill Ninetails, noticing that her spirit, like Orochi's, travels to the icy northern island of Kamui. The two decide to travel northward to find the source of the demons.|$|E
5|$|Support for Liddell's story {{came from}} Cecil Williamson, {{founder of the}} Museum of Witchcraft, {{who claimed to have}} known about Pickingill through his acquaintances with both Crowley and Gardner. However, Williamson was an {{unreliable}} source, and was known to repeatedly fabricate claims regarding <b>past</b> <b>events.</b> Another figure, known only as Colonel Lawrence, also supported Liddell's story, asserting that his own great-grandmother had studied under Pickingill and thus had been introduced to Crowley; as with Williamson's, however, Lawrence's claims are unreliable, particularly as he has made the unsupported claim that his great-grandmother studied witchcraft under the American folklorist Charles Leland. Also supporting Liddell's claims was the Wiccan Ralph Harvey, who, following the publication of Liddell's material, publicly declared that in the 1950s or 1960s he had been initiated into one of Pickingill's Nine Covens, located in Storrington, Sussex. Following the publication of Liddell's claims, a number of covens appeared in both the United States and Australia claiming to be practitioners of a tradition originating with Pickingill. Liddell himself has been critical of such groups, expressing his regret that the material he published led to their formation.|$|E
5|$|The Steam client, {{as part of}} {{a social}} network service, allows users to {{identify}} friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature. Users can use text chat and peer-to-peer VoIP with other users, identify which games their friends and other group members are playing, and join and invite friends to Steamworks-based multiplayer games that support this feature. Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games. Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends, game library including earned achievements, game wishlists, and other social features; users can choose to keep this information private. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10million of the 25million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community. In conjunction with the 2012 Steam Summer Sale, user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user's participation in the Steam community and <b>past</b> <b>events.</b> Steam Trading Cards were introduced in beta in May 2013 and were fully supported by June 2013. By playing specific games, players would earn virtual trading cards, which they could trade with friends and use towards gaining rewards on the service such as game discounts, downloadable content, or in-game items, and customize their user profile page. In 2010, the Steam client became an OpenID provider, allowing third-party websites to use a Steam user's identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials. In order to prevent abuse, access to most community features is restricted until a one-time payment of at least 5 is made to Valve. This requirement can be fulfilled by making any purchase of five dollars or more on Steam, or by adding at the same amount to their wallet.|$|E
50|$|Suddendorf and Busby {{have also}} {{specifically}} criticized the term episodic-like memory {{and believe it}} should be called www-memory (what-where-when memory) instead. They argued that an animal could know what happened, where it happened, and when it happened without actually being able to remember the specific event. Likewise, personal memories are not always accurate. Therefore, remembering a personal <b>past</b> <b>event</b> does not necessarily involve remembering the when and the where of the <b>past</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R

40|$|Episodic {{memory in}} humans is the {{conscious}} recollection of a <b>past</b> <b>event.</b> Animal models of episodic-like memory assess the memory for "what" happened, "where" it happened, and either "when" it happened, or in "which" context it happened, although recollection on such tasks {{is often difficult}} to measure.

25|$|Using {{satellite}} imagery {{in combination with}} GIS and on-the-ground studies, {{it is possible to}} generate maps of likely occurrences of future landslides. Such maps should show the locations of previous events as well as clearly indicate the probable locations of future events. In general, to predict landslides, one must assume that their occurrence is determined by certain geologic factors, and that future landslides will occur under the same conditions as <b>past</b> <b>events.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to establish a relationship between the geomorphologic conditions in which the <b>past</b> <b>events</b> took place and the expected future conditions.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the interdiscursive connections between Decameron, II 7 {{and one of}} the most debated quaestiones de potentia Dei, and it highlights the parodic dimension of Boccaccio’s discourse. In Boccaccio’s story, which, from the narrator’s point of view, should demonstrate the infallibility of divine action, Alatiel ‘re-establishes’ her lost virginity with a false account of her past adventures. In the first half of the fourteenth century, the topic of infallibility was implied in the consideration of God’s omnipotence and related to the quaestio as to whether God can undo the past and restore virginity. Boccaccio borrowed from the quaestio de corrupta the motifs of lost and restored chastity and of an erased <b>past</b> <b>event.</b> In his tale, parody does not issue from a reversal of the source but from abasement of the original theme. The power to annul a <b>past</b> <b>event</b> does not pertain to God, but is instead a human attribute which is effective among other men.
