2500|$|The Public Health Service {{started working}} on this study in 1932 in {{collaboration}} with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 399 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 201 {{did not have the}} disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> The men were told that the study was only going to last six months but in actuality it lasted 40 years. After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told they were being treated for [...] "bad blood", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. [...] "Bad blood"—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.|$|E
