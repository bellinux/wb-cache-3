40|$|Explosions of 0. 03 - 0. 25 mm {{diameter}} wires of Cd, Al, Cu, and W in {{high vacuum}} (p < 10 - 5 Torr) are investigated. The time {{development of the}} discharge column is shown {{to be determined by}} two main processes: a) In the time preceding the explosion, particles are emitted {{from the surface of the}} heated wire and initiate a <b>peripheral</b> <b>discharge.</b> The mechanism of particle emission is found to be evaporation of neutral atoms and/or thermionic emission of charged particles. The latter process is influenced by the strong radial electric field which is caused by the coaxial discharge geometry at the wire surface, b) The wire material vaporizes explosively forming an expanding cloud of nonconducting vapor which is subsequently converted to a plasma by the <b>peripheral</b> <b>discharge</b> penetrating into it from outside. The discharge column exhibits instabilities which are shown to be of MHD origin. They are significantly reduced by applying an axial magnetic field to the discharge column. A quantitative spectroscopic investigation is performed during the magnetic contraction phase of stabilized 0. 05 mm Al wire explosions. The plasma temperature is found to be about 50 000 °K in the axis of the column and higher than 80 000 °K at its periphery. The mean electron density is estimated to be of the order of some 1019 cm- 3. © 1969, Walter de Gruyter. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In mineral {{processing}} industries, grinding processes {{can be defined}} as the particles reduced in size by a combination of impact and abrasion. It is performed in tumbling mills that describe a class of mills delimited by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rock that rotate around its longitudinal axis. Tumbling mills, whether they are autogenous, semi-autogenous, ball or rod, are classed according {{to the nature of the}} discharge as centre <b>peripheral</b> <b>discharge</b> mills, end <b>peripheral</b> <b>discharge</b> mills, overflow mills, and grate discharge mills. These mills are used in at least three industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries to grind different materials (ore, clinker and metal powder) to desired quality specifications as principally described by a size distribution. These tumbling mills range in size from small 0. 3 m diameter lab mills to a 16 m diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are driven by chain and sprocket (lab mills), gear and pinion (pilot and industrial scale mills) and gearless drives in very large diameter mill (8 to 12 m dia.). All of these mill drives present advantages and limitations. In this thesis, we focus on the design and development of a cam-driven laboratory ball mill. An alternative drive system is presented that uses a newly patented speed-o-cam technology and applies it to a 5 ft diameter lab mill. We introduce polynomials to modify the cam profile around both the cusp and the blunt point of the profile to improve pressure angle and shock impact. We build models of mechanical systems, simulate the full-motion behavior of the models, and analyze multiple design variations. We integrate the theoretical, virtual and experimental analyses in order to design an optimal mechanical system. Moreover, the analysis of static and dynamic forces of cam mechanism is reported in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} initiation of persistent neuropathic pain after {{peripheral nerve injury}} are unclear. One hypothesis is that injury discharge and early ectopic discharges in injured nerves produce activity-dependent irreversible changes in the central nervous system. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether blockade of <b>peripheral</b> <b>discharge</b> by blocking nerve conduction before and 1 week after nerve injury could prevent the development and persistence of neuropathic pain-like behavior in the spared nerve injury model. METHODS: Bupivacaine-loaded biodegradable microspheres embedded in fibrin glue were placed in a silicone tube around the sciatic nerve to produce a conduction block. After sensory-motor testing of block efficacy, a spared nerve injury procedure was performed. Development of neuropathic pain behavior was assessed for 4 weeks by withdrawal responses to stimulation (i. e., von Frey filaments, acetone, pinprick, radiant heat) in bupivacaine microspheres-treated animals (n = 12) and in controls (n = 11). RESULTS: Bupivacaine microspheres treatment produced conduction blockade with a complete lack of sensory responsiveness in the sural territory for 6 to 10 days. Once the block wore off, the degree of hypersensitivity to stimuli was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral long-term nerve blockade has no detectable effect on the development of allodynia or hyperalgesia in the spared nerve injury model. It is unlikely that injury discharge at the time of nerve damage or the early onset of ectopic discharges arising from the injury site contributes significantly to the persistence of stimulus-evoked neuropathic pain in this model...|$|E

40|$|Peripheral {{chemoreceptor}} {{activity was}} studied in nine healthy, unsedated neonates (with a mean (SD) postconceptional age of 39 (2) weeks and birth weight of 3000 (400) g) {{by measuring the}} inhibition of ventilation elicited by five breaths of 100 % oxygen (Dejours technique). Changes in tidal volume, frequency, and minute ventilation were measured before and after administration of aminophylline (10 mg/kg by mouth). Before aminophylline hyperoxia induced a decrease in minute ventilation (from a mean (SE) of 825 (55) to 520 (30) ml/kg/min) as result of reduction of tidal volume (from 12 (0. 3) to 8 (0. 3) ml/kg). After aminophylline administration the hyperoxia induced decrease in tidal volume (from 14 (0. 7) to 6 (0. 3) ml/kg) and minute ventilation (from 847 (57) to 386 (21) ml/kg/min) was significantly greater than before. It is concluded that in neonates peripheral chemoreceptors are more active {{in the presence of}} aminophylline. It is speculated that aminophylline increases the activity of peripheral chemoreceptors, reducing the breakdown of cAMP, which is a crucial mediator for <b>peripheral</b> chemoreceptor <b>discharge...</b>|$|R

Up to 83 % of patients with PHN describe localized neuropathic pain, defined as “a type of neuropathic pain characterized by consistent and circumscribed area(s) of maximum pain”. Topical treatments have been suggested as a first-line treatment for localized neuropathic pain. Use of 5 % lidocaine medicated plaster could reduce abnormal nervous <b>peripheral</b> <b>discharge</b> and via the plaster could have a “protective” function in the affected area. It has been suggested that use of this plaster could reduce pain as well as the size of the painful area. To evaluate this possible outcome, we retrospectively reviewed eight patients with PHN, treated using 5 % lidocaine medicated plaster. During a follow-up period of 3 months, we observed good pain relief, which was associated with a 46 % reduction in size of the painful area after one month (from 236. 38 ± 140. 34 cm 2 to 128. 80 ± 95. 7 cm 2) and a 66 % reduction after 3 months (81. 38 ± 59. 19 cm 2). Our study cohort was composed mainly of elderly patients taking multiple drugs to treat comorbidities, who have a high risk of drug–drug interactions. Such patients benefit greatly from topical treatment of PHN. Our observations confirm the effectiveness of lidocaine plasters in the treatment of PHN, indicating that 5 % lidocaine medicated plaster could reduce the size of the painful area. This last observation has to be confirmed and the mechanisms clarified in appropriate larger randomized controlled trials.

40|$|The {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} (SNS) is known to play {{a pivotal role in}} short- and long-term regulation of different functions of the cardiovascular system. In the past decades increasing evidence demonstrated that sympathetic neural control is involved not only in the vasomotor control of small resistance arteries but also in modulation of large artery function. Sympathetic activity and vascular function, both of which are key factors in the development and prognosis of cardiovascular events and disease, are linked at several levels. Evidence from experimental studies indicates that the SNS is critically influenced, at the central and also at the peripheral level, by the most relevant factors regulating vascular function, such as nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), endothelin (ET), the renin-angiotensin system. Additionally, there is indirect evidence of a reciprocal relationship between endothelial function and activity of the SNS. A number of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases are characterized both by increased sympathetic outflow and decreased endothelial function. In healthy subjects, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) appears to be related to surrogate markers of endothelial function, and an acute increase in sympathetic activity has been associated with a decrease in endothelial function in healthy subjects. However, direct evidence of a cause-effect relationship from human studies is scanty. In humans large artery stiffness has been associated with increased sympathetic discharge, both in healthy subjects and in renal transplant recipients. <b>Peripheral</b> sympathetic <b>discharge</b> is also able to modulate wave reflection. On the other hand, large artery stiffness can interfere with autonomic regulation by impairing carotid baroreflex sensitivit...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous neural {{activity}} {{has been recorded}} in the auditory nerve of cats as early as 2 days postnatal (P 2), yet individual auditory neurons {{do not respond to}} ambient sound levels below 90 – 100 dB SPL until about P 10. Significant refinement of the central projections from the spiral ganglion to the cochlear nucleus occurs during this neonatal period. This refinement may be dependent on <b>peripheral</b> spontaneous <b>discharge</b> activity. We recorded from single spiral ganglion cells in kittens aged P 3 to P 9. The spiral ganglion was accessed via the round window through the spiral lamina. A total of 112 ganglion cells were isolated for study in 9 animals. Spike rates in neonates were very low, ranging from 0. 06 to 56 sp/s with a mean of 3. 09 +/ − 8. 24 sp/s. Ganglion cells in neonatal kittens exhibited remarkable repetitive spontaneous bursting discharge patterns. The unusual patterns were evident in the large mean interval coefficient of variation (CVi = 2. 9 +/− 1. 6) and burst index of 5. 2 +/ − 3. 5 across ganglion cells. Spontaneous bursting patterns in these neonatal mammals were similar to those reported for cochlear ganglion cells of the embryonic chicken suggesting this may be a general phenomenon that is common across animal classes. Rhythmic spontaneous discharge of retinal ganglion cells {{has been shown to be}} important in the development of central retinotopic projections and normal binocular vision (Shatz, 1996, Proc Natl Acad Sci 93). Bursting rhythms in cochlear ganglion cells may play a similar role in the auditory system during pre-hearing periods...|$|R
40|$|Context: Surgical {{instruments}} and materials {{continue to be}} retained in the peritoneal cavity despite precautionary measures. Even though uncommon it is also under-reported and carries serious medico-legal consequences. Gauzes and sponges (gossypiboma) are the most commonly retained materials and intra-abdominal retained artery forceps are much rarer but when they do occur lead to chronic abdominal pain and can be a rare cause of intestinal obstruction or strangulation with significant morbidity and mortality. Case Report: We present a case of intraabdominal retained artery forceps in a 70 -years-old lady who underwent laparotomy with splenectomy for a large spleen in a <b>peripheral</b> hospital. Upon <b>discharge</b> she continued to complain of intermittent abdominal pain of increasing severity. 12 months later she presented to us with an acute (surgical) abdomen requiring another laparotomy. At laparotomy she had strangulated/gangrenous lower jejunual and upper ileal bowel loops, the small bowel mesentery of this area being tightly trapped between the jaws of the retained artery forceps. She had gut resection and enteroanastomosis. Unfortunately she died from continuing sepsis on the second post-operative day. Conclusion: Retained instruments in intra-abdominal surgery can cause serious complication and should be treated surgically. High index of suspicion and appropriate investigations like plain abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound and CT and MRI scans should be instituted in patients who develop chronic abdominal symptoms following laparotomy. Preventive measures against retained instruments must follow strict laid down protocols for surgical instruments handling in theatre...|$|R

We aimed to: assess how transfers from primary to secondary hospitals affected estimates of case–fatality ratio (CFR); determine whether there was referral bias according to gender or poison; and estimate the annual incidence of all self-poisoning, and of fatal self-poisoning, in a rural developing-world setting. Methods Self-poisoning patients admitted to Anuradhapura General Hospital, Sri Lanka, were reviewed on admission from 1 July to 31 December 2002. We audited medical notes of self-poisoning patients admitted to 17 of the 34 surrounding peripheral hospitals for the same period. Findings A total of 742 patients were admitted with self-poisoning to the secondary hospital; 81 died (CFR 10. 9 %). 483 patients were admitted to 17 surrounding peripheral hospitals. Six patients (1. 2 %) died in peripheral hospitals, 249 were discharged home, and 228 were transferred to the secondary hospital. There was no effect of gender or age on likelihood of transfer; however, patients who had ingested oleander or paraquat {{were more likely to}} be transferred than were patients who had taken organophosphorus pesticides or other poisons. Estimated annual incidences of self-poisoning and fatal self-poisoning were 363 and 27 per 100 000 population, respectively, with an overall CFR of 7. 4 % (95 % confidence interval 6. 0 – 9. 0).

40|$|In humans, affective {{consequences}} of neuropathic pain, ranging from depression to anxiety and anhedonia, severely impair {{quality of life}} and are a major disease burden, often requiring specific medications. Depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors have also been observed in animal models of peripheral nerve injury. Dysfunctions in central nervous system monoamine transmission have been hypothesized to underlie depressive and anxiety disorders in neuropathic pain. To assess whether these neurons display early changes in their activity that in the long-term might lead to chronicization, maladaptive plasticity and affective consequences, we carried out in vivo extracellular single unit recordings from serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and from dopamine neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain in rats. Extracellular dopamine levels and the expression of dopamine D 1, D 2 receptors and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were measured in the nucleus accumbens. We report that, two weeks following <b>peripheral</b> nerve injury, <b>discharge</b> rate of serotonin DRN neurons and burst firing of VTA dopamine cells are enhanced, when compared with sham-operated animals. We also observed higher extracellular dopamine levels and reduced expression of D 2, but not D 1, receptors and TH in the nucleus accumbens. Our study confirms that peripheral neuropathy induces changes in the serotonin and dopamine systems that might be the early result of chronic maladaptation to persistent pain. The allostatic activation of these neural systems, which mirrors that already described as a consequence of stress, might lead to depression and anxiety previously observed in neuropathic animals but also an attempt to cope positively with the negative experience...|$|R
