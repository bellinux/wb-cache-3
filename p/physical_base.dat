She identified an NCMP's lack of any official capacity to represent the people or write letters on their behalf as a drawback of the scheme. Moreover, an NCMP has no <b>physical</b> <b>base</b> to organize activities or dialogues with the people. In her view, {{it would be better}} for politics in Singapore if the NCMP scheme was regarded merely as a [...] "stop-gap measure" [...] to deal with the lack of alternative voices in Parliament as a result of the ruling party's alleged abuse of the GRC system and gerrymandering.|$|E
2500|$|In philosophy, supervenience is a {{relation}} {{used to describe}} cases where (roughly speaking) a system's upper-level properties are determined by its lower-level properties. Some philosophers hold {{that the world is}} structured into a kind of hierarchy of properties, where the higher-level properties supervene on the lower-level properties. According to this view, social properties supervene on psychological properties, psychological properties on biological properties, and biological properties on chemical properties. That is, the chemical properties of the world determine a distribution of biological properties, those biological properties determine a distribution of psychological properties, and so forth. So, for example, mind–body supervenience holds that [...] "every mental phenomenon must be grounded in, or anchored to, some underlying <b>physical</b> <b>base</b> (presumably a neural state). This means that mental states can occur only in systems that can have physical properties; namely physical systems." [...] However, mental states cannot be reduced to physical properties.|$|E

40|$|In {{remotely}} sensed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, scattering from {{a target}} {{is often the}} result of a mixture of different mechanisms. For this reason, detection of targets and classification of SAR images may be very difficult and very different from other sensor imagery. Fully polarimetric data offer the possibility to separate the different mechanisms, interpret them and consequently identify the geometry of the targets. To achieve this task, several target decomposition techniques have been proposed in the literature to improve the interpretation of this kind of data. Among these, the <b>physical</b> <b>based</b> techniques are the most considered. This paper proposes a novel approach for target decomposition based on the use of Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis. Different from <b>physical</b> <b>based</b> target decomposition techniques, the proposed method is based on a nonlinear decorrelation of the received polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) signal into few elementary components that could be associated to the different scattering mechanisms present in the image. A comparison of the classification results obtained using different decomposition techniques demonstrates that the proposed approach can be an effective alternative to classical <b>physical</b> <b>based</b> methods...|$|R
