Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO.

Mössbauer, IR, and {{electrical}} conductivity were investigated in iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses,</b> 40 Fe 2 O 3 – 60 P 2 O 5 (in mol%), containing sulfur ranging from 0 to 2, 4, 6, and 8 mass%. Sulfur proved {{to act as}} a reducing agent for the redox reaction during the glass preparation. Mössbauer spectroscopy was used {{in order to determine the}} relative fraction of Fe 2 +, i. e. Fe 2 +/Fe(total), isomer shift (δ), and quadrupole splitting (). Mössbauer results revealed that the relative fraction of Fe 2 + increases with an increasing sulfur content. Electrical conductivity showed a similar composition dependency as the fraction of Fe 2 +. These results indicate that higher electrical conductivity of sulfur-containing iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> is due to small polaron hopping (SPH) between iron atoms of different valance states, i. e., a step-by-step electron hopping from Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +. IR spectra of these glasses are very similar to those of sulfur-free iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses,</b> proving that the structure of sulfur-containing iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> is essentially the same as that of sulfur-free <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses.</b> Key words: iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses,</b> sulfur, Mössbauer, IR, dc conductivity. 1...|$|R

In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a <b>phosphate</b> <b>glass.</b> The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass.

40|$|Rare-earth co-doping in {{inorganic}} materials has a long-held {{tradition of}} facilitating highly desirable optoelectronic properties for their {{application to the}} laser industry. This study concentrates specifically on rare-earth <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses,</b> (R 2 O 3) x(R' 2 O 3) y(P 2 O 5) 1 -(x+y), where (R, R') denotes (Ce, Er) or (La, Nd) co-doping and the total rare-earth composition corresponds to a range between metaphosphate, RP 3 O 9, and ultraphosphate, RP 5 O 14. Thereupon, the effects of rare-earth co-doping on the local structure are assessed at the atomic level. Pair-distribution function analysis of high-energy X-ray diffraction data (Qmax = 28 Å- 1) is employed to make this assessment. Results reveal a stark structural invariance to rare-earth co-doping which bears testament to the open-framework and rigid nature of these glasses. A range of desirable attributes of these glasses unfold from this finding; in particular, a structural simplicity that will enable facile molecular engineering of rare-earth <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> with 'dial-up' lasing properties. When considered together with other factors, this finding also demonstrates additional prospects for these co-doped rare-earth <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> in nuclear waste storage applications.

Among various classes of structurally disordered materials, a family of iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> attracts special attention due to their unique combination of structural, electrical and mechanical properties. Generally, iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> are electronically conducting glasses with polaronic conduction mechanism where conduction takes place by electrons hopping from Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +.

40|$|Certain {{high level}} wastes (HLW) in the US contain {{components}} such as phosphates, heavy metals, and halides which make them poorly suited for disposal in borosilicate <b>glasses.</b> Iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> {{appear to be}} a technically feasible alternative to borosilicate glasses for vitrifying these HLWs. The iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> mentioned above and their nuclear wasteforms are relatively new, so little is known about their atomic structure, redox equilibria, structure-property relationships, and crystallization products and characteristics. The objective of this research is to gain such information for the binary iron-phosphate glasses as well as iron phosphate wasteforms so that a comprehensive scientific assessment can be made of their usefulness in nuclear waste disposal.
