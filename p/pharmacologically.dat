5|$|Psilocybin (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a prodrug that is {{converted}} into the <b>pharmacologically</b> active compound psilocin {{in the body}} by a dephosphorylation reaction. This chemical reaction takes place under strongly acidic conditions, or under physiological conditions in the body, through the action of enzymes called alkaline phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|Tolerance to {{psilocybin}} builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin {{more than}} {{about once a week}} can lead to diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A cross-tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the <b>pharmacologically</b> similar LSD, and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM.|$|E
5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in {{medicinal plants}} is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where medicinal plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines. The major classes of <b>pharmacologically</b> active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pharmacologically</b> active plant {{extracts}} {{can interact}} with conventional drugs, both {{because they may}} provide an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals interfere with the body's systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer {{in the body and}} have a more powerful cumulative effect. Plant medicines can be dangerous during pregnancy. Since plants may contain many different substances, plant extracts may have complex effects on the human body.|$|E
5|$|Physician Valerius Cordus (1515–1544) {{authored}} a botanically and <b>pharmacologically</b> important herbal Historia Plantarum in 1544 and a pharmacopoeia of lasting importance, the Dispensatorium in 1546. Naturalist Conrad von Gesner (1516–1565) and herbalist John Gerard (1545–c. 1611) published herbals {{covering the}} medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605) {{was considered the}} father of natural history, which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, Polymath Robert Hooke discovered cells, a term he coined, in cork, and {{a short time later}} in living plant tissue.|$|E
5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT <b>pharmacologically.</b> It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for <b>pharmacologically</b> active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or <b>pharmacologically</b> active compounds.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are <b>pharmacologically</b> inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of <b>pharmacologically</b> active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its {{neighbours}} in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is {{not known}} to have a confirmed biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests {{that it may be}} a necessary catalyst to make collagen IV, making it essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not an essential element, it can be <b>pharmacologically</b> beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, formed by the eosinophil, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in filariasis) and some bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid), although the use of chloride is possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by <b>pharmacologically</b> modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} <b>pharmacologically</b> active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

25|$|Metabolism: Duloxetine {{undergoes}} predominately hepatic metabolism via two cytochrome P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Circulating metabolites are <b>pharmacologically</b> inactive.|$|E
25|$|Salvinorin A {{is capable}} of {{inhibiting}} excess intestinal motility (e.g. diarrhea), through its potent k-opioid-activating effects. The mechanism of action for salvinorinA on ileal tissue {{has been described as}} 'prejunctional', as it was able to modify electrically induced contractions, but not those of exogenous acetylcholine. A <b>pharmacologically</b> important aspect of the contraction-reducing properties of ingested salvinorinA on gut tissue is that it is only <b>pharmacologically</b> active on inflamed and not normal tissue, thus reducing possible side-effects.|$|E
25|$|Goal-directed {{catecholamine}} research {{began with}} the preparation by George Oliver and Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer of a <b>pharmacologically</b> active extract from the adrenal glands.|$|E
25|$|A newer drug {{palonosetron}} is a <b>pharmacologically</b> {{distinct and}} highly selective, second generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Palonosetron has two stereogenic centers and exists as four stereoisomers.|$|E

25|$|Metabolism and {{elimination}} {{takes place}} {{mainly in the}} liver {{and most of the}} SSRIs produce <b>pharmacologically</b> active metabolites, as demonstrated in table 3 among with other pharmacology properties of the SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|Bed bug {{secretions}} can {{inhibit the}} growth of some bacteria and fungi; antibacterial components from the bed bug could be used against human pathogens, and {{be a source of}} <b>pharmacologically</b> active molecules as a resource for the discovery of new drugs.|$|E
25|$|GHB is also {{produced}} {{as a result}} of fermentation and so is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, in particular fruit wines. The amount found in wine is <b>pharmacologically</b> insignificant and not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pharmacologically,</b> {{bath salts}} usually contain a cathinone, {{typically}} methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), methylone or mephedrone; however, the chemical composition varies widely and products labeled {{with the same}} name may also contain derivatives of pyrovalerone or pipradrol. In Europe the main synthetic cathinone is mephedrone, whereas in the US MDPV is more common.|$|E
25|$|Intravaginal {{administration}} is a {{route of administration}} where the substance {{is applied to the}} inside of the vagina. <b>Pharmacologically,</b> it has the potential advantage to result in effects primarily in the vagina or nearby structures (such as the vaginal portion of cervix) with limited systemic adverse effects compared to other routes of administration.|$|E
25|$|The major {{metabolite}} of doxepin, nordoxepin (desmethyldoxepin), is <b>pharmacologically</b> active similarly, but {{relative to}} doxepin, {{is much more}} selective as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. In general, the demethylated variants of tertiary amine TCAs like doxepin are much more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake, less potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, and less potent in their antiadrenergic, antihistamine, and anticholinergic activities.|$|E
25|$|Though the proving {{process has}} {{superficial}} similarities with clinical trials, it is fundamentally different {{in that the}} process is subjective, not blinded, and modern provings are unlikely to use <b>pharmacologically</b> active levels of the substance under proving. As early as 1842, Holmes noted the provings were impossibly vague, and the purported effect was not repeatable among different subjects.|$|E
25|$|Several genetic polymorphisms {{have been}} found to be {{associated}} with a higher incidence of undesirable side effects of atorvastatin. This phenomenon is suspected to be related to increased plasma levels of <b>pharmacologically</b> active metabolites, such as atorvastatin lactone and p-hydroxyatorvastatin. Atorvastatin and its active metabolites may be monitored in potentially susceptible patients using specific chromatographic techniques.|$|E
25|$|In newborns, fetal {{hemoglobin}} is nearly completely replaced by adult hemoglobin by approximately 6 months postnatally, {{except in a}} few thalassemia cases in which {{there may be a}} delay in cessation of HbF production until 3–5 years of age. In adults, {{fetal hemoglobin}} production can be reactivated <b>pharmacologically,</b> which is useful in the treatment of diseases such as sickle-cell disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientists}} or {{doctors who}} oppose water fluoridation {{argue that it}} has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and is <b>pharmacologically</b> obsolete. Arvid Carlsson has argued that fluoridation violates modern pharmacological principles and doesn't take into account individual variations in response, which can be considerable even when the dosage is fixed.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of venlafaxine is designated (R/S)-1- cyclohexanol hydrochloride or (±)-1- cyclohexanol hydrochloride, {{and it has}} the empirical formula of C17H27NO2. It is a white to off-white crystalline solid. Venlafaxine is structurally and <b>pharmacologically</b> related to the atypical opioid analgesic tramadol, and more distantly to the newly released opioid tapentadol, but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, MAOIs, or RIMAs.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the RAS is {{targeted}} <b>pharmacologically</b> by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The aldosterone system is directly targeted by spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist. The fluid retention may be targeted by diuretics; the antihypertensive effect of diuretics {{is due to}} its effect on blood volume. Generally, the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in hypertension because if blocked, individuals may suffer from orthostatic hypotension and fainting.|$|E
25|$|Salbutamol is {{sold as a}} racemic mixture. The (R)-(−)-enantiomer (CIP nomenclature) {{is shown}} in the image at right (top), and is {{responsible}} for the pharmacologic activity; the (S)-(+)-enantiomer (bottom) blocks metabolic pathways associated with elimination of itself and of the <b>pharmacologically</b> active enantiomer (R). The slower metabolism of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer also causes it to accumulate in the lungs, which can cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation.|$|E
25|$|The host reacts {{against the}} tick lesion by haemostasis, {{inflammation}} and cell mediated immunity (CMI). An array of <b>pharmacologically</b> active substances is injected with the saliva of the tick, including anticoagulants, PGE2, prostacyclin, apyrase and in certain tick species antihistamines. PGE2 and prostacyclin inhibit platelet aggregation and dilate blood vessels. Feeding is almost continuous with pulses of salivation alternating with periods of feeding to ensure continued suppression of host defences.|$|E
25|$|Genetically induced chronic {{low-level}} methemoglobinemia may {{be treated}} with oral methylene blue daily. Also, vitamin C can occasionally reduce cyanosis associated with chronic methemoglobinemia but has no role in treatment of acute acquired methemoglobinemia. Diaphorase normally contributes {{only a small percentage}} of the red blood cell's reducing capacity, but can be <b>pharmacologically</b> activated by exogenous cofactors (such as methylene blue) to 5 times its normal level of activity.|$|E
25|$|Saliva {{production}} may be <b>pharmacologically</b> {{stimulated by}} sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline. It {{can also be}} suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and polypharmacy. Cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may impair salivary flow. Radiation therapy may cause permanent hyposalivation due to injury to the oral mucosa containing the salivary glands, resulting in dry mouth or xerostomia, whereas chemotherapy may cause only temporary salivary impairment.|$|E
