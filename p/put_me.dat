5|$|I'm {{proud of}} Triton's around-the-world cruise, but I didn't really do that. That {{was done by}} my crew and the Navy - the ship the Navy built and <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in command of. That's not a {{personal}} achievement, although I was captain of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} we were to work {{together}} I was nervous as a school girl. We were shooting a Junkanoo Festival with noisy drums and hundreds of extras. But he never faltered in his concentration and he <b>put</b> <b>me</b> completely at ease. It was all so natural. He's an extraordinary actor– and just a nice human being.|$|E
5|$|The song {{is bigger}} than ever, {{along with many other}} {{recordings}} I produced/composed etc. For example the Spinners' 'Working My Way Back to You' and 'Cupid' along with 'Right Before My Eyes' by Patti Day. But 'Let's All Chant' really <b>put</b> <b>me</b> on the 'map' as a composer, producer and arranger.|$|E

5|$|If, after I am {{home in the}} West, {{you make}} me a normal {{contract}} offer, a business deal such as people sign every day all over the world, and I like your offer, then I will come back and work with you {{in accordance with the}} contract. But if you try to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> to work under coercion of any kind, then I will resist to my dying gasp.|$|E
5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He <b>put</b> <b>me</b> on {{there as well}} as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

25|$|I am {{honestly}} {{against the}} social intermingling of Negroes and Whites but I hold nothing personal against the Negroes as a race. They {{should be proud}} of their God-given heritage just as I am proud of mine. I believe Negroes should have the right , and in Mississippi too—when their main purpose is not to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> out of office and when they won't try to besmirch the reputation of my state.|$|E
25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E
25|$|FitzGerald's {{government}} {{lasted until}} January 1982 when it collapsed {{due to a}} controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having {{a majority in the}} Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't <b>put</b> <b>me</b> through immediately. Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.|$|E

25|$|Dragana Mirković {{remains the}} biggest turbo-folk {{star in the}} country, with her {{numerous}} hits (Sama, Plači zemljo, Pitaju me u mom kraju, Poslednje veče, Ne vraćam se starim ljubavima, Nisam ni metar od tebe). With her pink hair and very recognizable screen persona, Zorica Brunclik (Kada bi me pitali, Košava, Otkopčano jeleče, Ja znam, A tebe nema) could be considered Dragana's follow-up. Vesna Zmijanac, the previous wife of Zorica's husband, has preserved the fame she had in 80s with hit-songs like Jorgovani, Ja imam nekog a ti si sam, Malo po malo, Kunem ti se životom, Idem preko zemlje Srbije. Among the others, there are Halid Bešlić (Miljacka, Prvi poljubac, <b>Put</b> <b>me</b> zove), Ana Bekuta (Oluja, Imam jedan život, Kralj ponoći, Zlatiborske zore), Sinan Sakić (Ej, otkad sam se rodio, Delija momak, Prvi poljubac), Stojanka Novaković Stoja (Moje srce ostariti ne sme, Žena starija, Samo) and Nedeljko Bajić Baja (Ginem, ginem, Mini suknja, Zapisano u vremenu). The absolute record in sales {{of this kind of}} music is still held by Lepa Brena, who has sold around 40 million records and held concerts all over the Balkans. Next to that, due to her enormous popularity, Brena is considered the symbol of former Yugoslavia, of Yugoslav unity and power, and after the break of federation, of so-called Yugo-nostalgia.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Dooom 2, Thornton's 2008 {{follow-up}} to First Come, First Served, {{was produced in}} response to The Return of Dr. Octagon. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm one of those artists that people take my music without my consent. People love to snatch my music and do things on their own. You got people that <b>put</b> <b>me</b> on beats I never rapped on. I just feel that it's a bad thing." ...|$|E

Going to Mecca, making Hajj, was very good for me because {{it made me think}} of {{all the people in the}} world who loved me and were for me, who prayed that I would get my life back together. I stopped {{focusing}} on the people who were trying to tear me and my family apart.|$|E

500|$|By {{this time}} Conn and Stafford {{were not on}} {{speaking}} terms and it fell to Tom Smythe, Stafford's son, to mediate between the two. Stafford built a new office suite at the Gardens for Conn, and the feud was over. After Stafford was charged in 1971 with fraud and became ill with a stomach ulcer, Conn was with him in hospital when he died. According to Conn, Stafford's last words to him were [...] "see dad, I told you they wouldn't <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in jail." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Miller {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the Second World War. It changed him ... In the first post-war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... Bill Edrich came in. He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman {{came up to me}} and said, 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark <b>put</b> <b>me</b> off Test cricket. Never felt the same way about it after that.' ...|$|E
500|$|Trainor's song [...] "Title" [...] {{also became}} {{the subject of}} the same controversy, and was dubbed [...] "just as anti-feminist" [...] as [...] "All About That Bass". L.V. Anderson of Slate wrote that [...] "Title" [...] perpetuated a {{retrograde}} belief about relationships and deemed Trainor a poor role model, and opined, [...] "Once again she is sending the message that a woman's worth is defined by men". Sean Michaels of The Guardian highlighted the lyrics, [...] "You gotta treat me like a trophy / <b>Put</b> <b>me</b> on the shelf / You gotta show me off," [...] as controversial.|$|E

500|$|... "The {{whole time}} I {{definitely}} was thinking, 'Everyone knows, everyone can see.'...I {{just wanted to}} give everything I could... When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at the same time. I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in this DVD.' So I made sure I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas was {{inducted}} into the National Wildlife Federation Hall of Fame in 1999, and the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. John Rothchild declared her a feminist before the word existed, but not entirely. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, [...] "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?" [...] Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier-mâché bust of her with Georgia O'Keeffe and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Saban joined Army, he had {{developed}} a reputation as an itinerant coach, a [...] "notorious job-hopper" [...] who was nevertheless respected for rebuilding teams in poor condition. Saban {{said he wanted to}} stay at Army [...] "until they <b>put</b> <b>me</b> out to pasture". Saban stayed at Army for only one season. He said he was unhappy with the academy's unwillingness to invest more in its football program. [...] "This is a desperate situation", he said {{near the end of the}} 1979 season. [...] "To fight alone as a football staff is impossible." [...] He resigned in July 1980 after leading Army to a 2–8–1 record the previous season.|$|E
