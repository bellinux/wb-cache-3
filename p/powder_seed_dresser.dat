As <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> adjuvants, water (500 m mL/ 100 Kg) and a polymer (150 mL/ 100 Kg) were used. Treated seeds were stored in paper bags and kept in the refrigerator at 5 ºC.

40|$|Imidacloprid is a {{neonicotinoid}} insecticide {{that has}} been used for controlling sucking pests of cotton. This study showed the efficacy of the imidacloprid insecticide, Gaucho 70 WS as <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> against aphids, whiteflies and thrips incidences on CB 3 cotton cultivar. At the same time, inhabitants of the predators (ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphids and spiders) and yield of the crop were evaluated. Fuzzy and delinted cotton seeds treated with imidacloprid reduced pest population compared to untreated control or foliar spray of monocrotophos 40 WSC at 1120 ml ha- 1, and being the highest efficacy at 5. 5 g kg- 1 fuzzy seed. Cotton plants grown with imidacloprid treated seeds have abundances of ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphids and spiders. The cotton cultivar produced significantly higher yield when seeds were treated with imidacloprid at 5. 5 g kg- 1 fuzzy seed.

This study {{is a continuation of}} previous work on oil extraction from flaxseed to produce biodiesel; herein, the residue cake from flaxseed was studied. Three different types of samples (<b>powdered</b> <b>seeds,</b> de-oiled cake, and in situ transesterified cake of flaxseed) were torrefied (through slow pyrolysis), and the sample properties were characterized. The higher heating value (HHV= 36. 01 ± 0. 36  MJ[*]kg− 1) and bulk density (0. 33 ± 0. 01  g[*]cm− 3) of the <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> are higher compared to the other two samples (i. e. de-oiled cake and in situ transesterified cake). The torrefied biomass was light weight losing its mechanical strength on treatment, making it easier to grind. It was observed that the biomass torrefied at 300 [*]°C had a higher fraction of particles between sieve sizes (between 2. 0 and 0. 063  mm) compared to the biomass torrefied at 200 [*]°C. The sieve sizes between 0. 5 and 0. 063  mm showed that more particles of the torrefied biomass treated at 300 [*]°C were collected compared to that torrefied at 200 [*]°C. Due to the loss of hydrogen and oxygen content and the removal of water, the carbon content in the torrefied biomass increased by 25. 52, 24. 51, and 22. 69 [*]% for the <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds,</b> de-oiled cake, and in situ cake samples, respectively. The <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> had a higher carbon and hydrogen content compared to the de-oiled and in situ transesterified flaxseed cakes because the <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> contained fatty acids. The <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> had a higher concentration of CO 2 gas liberated during treatment compared to the de-oiled and in situ transesterified cakes.

40|$|Background. Contamination of {{drinking}} water with heavy metals poses a human health threat, particularly in low-income countries where point-of-use water purification systems are {{beyond the reach of}} a majority of households. Objectives. The study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of Acacia galpinii (monkey thorn tree) biomass in removing lead (Pb (ll)), cadmium (Cd (ll)), calcium (Ca (ll)), and magnesium (Mg (ll)) ions from drinking water. Methods. A. Galpinii biomass from seed and seed pods was processed by pulverizing, Soxhlet oil extraction and particle size grading. The material was analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry. Influence of the physiochemical parameters (contact time, initial concentration, adsorbent dosage, pH) on the effectiveness of the biomass in removing Pb (ll), Cd (ll), Ca (ll) and Mg (ll) ions was evaluated and the best fit adsorption isotherm model (Langmuir vs. Freundlich) was also determined. Results. Particle size, dose, contact time and pH all played significant roles in the effectiveness of metal removal for both seed and seed pod biomass. At biomass particle size < 90 microns, 98 % removal rates of Pb (II) ions were achieved for <b>powdered</b> <b>seed</b> pods compared with 65 % for <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds.</b> The same trend was observed for Cd, Ca and Mg. Contact time for effective removal of metal ions by pod <b>powder</b> and <b>seed</b> <b>powder</b> was 90 minutes and 120 minutes, respectively. Maximum adsorption was achieved at solution pH 6 - 8 for all metals. Lead adsorption followed a Langmuir isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacities of 10. 8932 for pod powder and 3. 4412 for <b>seed</b> <b>powder.</b> Adsorption of Ca and Mg followed a Freundlich model, with adsorption capacity of 1. 1789 for Ca and 1. 4521 for Mg. Conclusions. Acacia galpinii seeds and seed pods are inexpensive, readily available and may serve as a cost effective means for treatment {{of drinking}} water for domestic users in low and middle income countries.
