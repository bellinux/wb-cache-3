This study investigated the impacts caused by FMD on the exports of fresh beef from Brazil after the 2005 outbreak and the observance of the regionalization principle of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) by countries member of the WTO that were listed as the top 10 beef importing countries in 2004. The FMD outbreak that began in 2005 did not limit the increase in exports of fresh beef from Brazil, but impacted negatively on exports from Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraná States. The disease did not impact exports to the United States, Japan or Mexico, since these markets were closed to Brazil. Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran were not members of the WTO in October 2005 and therefore had no obligation to respect the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>regionalization,</b> though Russia respected it. Among the other major importers of 2004, the Netherlands, Egypt, Italy, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain respected the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> of the SPS Agreement.

40|$|Currently, {{the world}} meat trade is {{undergoing}} substantial changes {{as a consequence}} of the spread of transboundary animal diseases. These diseases have resulted in the implementation of trade embargoes applied nation-wide against infected countries, contrary to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>regionalization.</b> This principle allows a country to declare part of its territory free from a given disease even though there have been outbreaks in other regions thus averting the need to suspend all exports. Its application consists in the formal recognition that a zone is disease- or pest-free. This article presents some of the disputes caused by reluctance to apply the regionalization principle in the case of the three main transboundary diseases that have affected meat trade in recent years: "mad cow disease", foot and mouth disease, and avian flu.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to {{have a significant impact on}} the hydrologic cycle, creating changes in freshwater resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that, as a result, floods and prolonged droughts will take place at increasingly frequent periods. The Mediterranean has been described as one of the main climate change "hot-spots", with recent simulations showing a collective picture of substantial drying and warming. This effect appears more pronounced during warm periods, when the seasonal decrease of precipitation can exceed control climatology by 25 - 30 %. Despite the decreasing annual rainfall trend, an increase in the amount and intensity of wintertime rainfall is evident. However, the scientific question on the quantitative impact of these signals to small scale coastal watersheds and Mediterranean islands has not been answered. The state-of-the-art Ensembles dataset was employed to assess the impact of the changing climate on the water availability of the island of Crete at basin scale. Here, the Ensembles precipitation and temperature data is used as input for a rainfall-runoff model previous calibrated for the whole island with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>regionalization.</b> Data analysis for the period 1970 - 2100 reveals an overall decreasing precipitation trend which, combined with a temperature rise, leads to substantial reduction of water availability.

40|$|One of the {{starting}} methodological problems in demographic {{research is the}} definition of spatial extent, which mostly doesn’t correspond to spatial extent already defined by different levels of administrative-territorial unitsthat are used for distribution of usable statistical data. That’s why determining the spatial extent of a demographic research is closely tied with administrative-territorial division of the territory that is being researched, wherein the fact that differentiation of demographic phenomena and processes cannot be the only basis <b>of</b> setting the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> must be strictly acknowledged. This problem is particularly common in historical demographic analyses of geographically determined wholes, which are in administratively-territorial sense represented by one or more smaller territorial units, with their borders changing through the history, which directly affects comparability of the statistical data, and makes it considerably more difficult to track demographic change through longer time intervals. The result of these efforts is usually a solution based on a compromise which enables us to examine the dynamics of population change with little deviation from already defined borders of regional geographic wholes. For that reason in this paper the problem of defining spatial extent in demographic research is examined trough several different approaches in case of Eastern Serbia, as a geographically determined region, a historic area, a spatially functioning whole and as a statistical unit for demographic research, with no judgment calls in regard to any <b>of</b> the <b>regionalization</b> <b>principles.</b> [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|Regionalization is an {{exceptionally}} complex and contradictory matter, {{and at the}} same time becoming very challenging in the last few years in conditions of accelerated changes in the world. It is believed that regionalization today is an unavoidable strategic action of directing development processes on a territory. One of the aims <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> is to bring economic, demographic and social development processes into accord. Discordance of demographic transition courses with economic development caused prominent changes and complex development problems on the territory of Serbia, which indicate that appropriate attention should be devoted to demographic occurrences and processes in the approach to its regionalization. Proceeding from this fact, the goal of this paper was to identify the problems of regional differentiation of geoterritory and determine the place and role <b>of</b> demographic <b>regionalization</b> in the procedure of scientific knowledge, territory differentiation and organization of geoterritory; to set the general definition of regionalism from the demographic aspect, in the sense of theoretical concept based on empirical research, so as to obtain a scientific framework for research and functional approach to recognizing contemporary problems of development and organizing population; to decide on principles and elements, and point out to the content, purpose and goals of identifying demo geographic regions, in a way which would be adequate for planning regional development and organizing geoterritories. Such a set research goal required that the total problem <b>of</b> demo geographic <b>regionalization</b> is set on a wider theoretical, but analytical context, which is defined by mutual dependence of demo geographic with other regional systems, as well as with global questions of regionalism and integration ways. Demo geographic regionalization is carried out on the basis of numerous research findings and corresponding empirical results, with an idea that it serves as a basis for macro regionalization, general geographic or administrative-management regionalization, as a "foundation" for territory planning or development policy. Global and specific perception of numerous relevant components <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> had been carried out, with a favorable circumstance and significant basis being the following research up to now: "Outline of constant regions for demographic research" and the study of the Geographic Institute "Demographic bases for <b>regionalization</b> <b>of</b> Serbia". Unlike demographic regionalizations, this paper insisted on demo geographic as a more complex approach, and a concrete contribution of this paper refers to defining basic <b>principles</b> and elements <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> whereby in the process of delimiting regions, numerous geographic, natural geographic, anthrop geographic, territory-economical and territory functional relations and connections, occurrences and processes were articulated apart from demographic. Although not shown in the paper, <b>regionalization</b> <b>of</b> various demographic, territorial-demographic and demo economic traits were carried out for the purpose of research, which were to show to what extent, in what direction, according to which principles and in what way it is possible to carry out demographic regionalization in Serbia. It should be noted that most research on the topic <b>of</b> demographic <b>regionalization</b> indicate that the importance of certain elements <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> is variable and that is dependent on the regional level, and that the population change during demographic transition imposes a necessity for introducing new indicators and elements <b>of</b> <b>regionalization.</b> Having in mind all the stated elements, territorial-functional relations, realized territorial-demographic structure of Serbia and tendencies of demographic courses, as well as territorial plan of isolated macro regional centers, confirming the homogeneity of demographic development of various regions, but also researching migration flows under the influence of push and pull factors during the process of industrialization, urbanization and land reclamation, the only possible demo geographic <b>regionalization</b> <b>of</b> Serbia was presented. The isolated regions are homogeneous in the sense of functional interdependence, because each represents a region which is territorially-functionally connected to a regional center; and heterogeneous of structure, because each region represents a symbiosis of urban, rural and transitional type of structure, which are a result of differentiation of development and demographic processes, and which imply a corresponding demographic development, dynamics and composition of population. The goal of this paper was to give theoretical-methodological frameworks and a broader basis for integration of certain territorial units into unique demo geographic regions of Serbia, which would still be in the function of complex regional research and regional planning. Anything more than that (especially from the aspect of micro or macro regionalization) would require a team work of a larger number of experts, an extensive statistical-analytical and research project, as well as sound knowledge of various local conditions, historical-geographic and civilization events which often require deviation from consistent application of formulated criteria and measures for regionalization. This means that the given proposals should be understood as a principled scheme, a general framework of the demo geographic <b>regionalization</b> <b>of</b> Serbia on the basis of interdependence of natural and economic wholes, their geographic-transportation and economic-gravitational connection, development processes and demographic courses. Every concrete requirement in future practice of planning or organization of geo-territory would require defining goals and <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> as well...|$|R

40|$|Summary The aim of {{this article}} is to {{familiarize}} the reader with the status of regionalized perinatal health care in North America, and specifically in the United States of America, using the Iowa regionalization model. The evolution <b>of</b> the <b>regionalization</b> movement in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s is reviewed. It is noted that the movement was largely without federal government intervention. The role of the March of Dimes in developing the first set of so-called national guidelines is chronicled. The Iowa model, utilizing some non-tertiary referral centres, is discussed in depth. This model included extensive outreach education for the entire state, and worked well largely because of the lack of competition to the major university teaching hospital located at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. This was not true for many other states and regions because competition did exist between tertiary centres. The impact of managed care systems on the overall role <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> is discussed. Suggestions are offered for controlling the impact of third-party payers (managed care) on the quality of perinatal health care. An idealized system of monitoring the impact <b>of</b> <b>regionalization</b> and monitoring the effect of managed care is detailed.

Different concepts have been analyzed; the most significant characteristics <b>of</b> definitions: region, <b>regionalization</b> and regionalism have been underlined. Based on the multidisciplinary approach and method, four dominant models of regionalism in Europe have been defined: constitutional, strong, decentralized and administrative one. Regionalization concept has been considered in the dynamic way, within the historical context. Creation of European national states in the period between 17 th and 19 th century have been analyzed and centralistic state approach based on centralization and hierarchical vision of relations between central government and regions has been explained. Such approach has remained dominant in the territorial policy of national states until the last decades of the 20 th century.
