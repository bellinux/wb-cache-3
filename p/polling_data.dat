40|$|In February of 2008, SurveyUSA polled 600 {{people in}} each state and asked who {{they would vote for}} in either {{head-to-head}} match-up: Obama vs. McCain, and Clinton vs. McCain. Here we integrate these polls with prior information; how each state voted in comparison to the national outcome in the 2004 election. We use Bayesian methods to merge prior and <b>poll</b> <b>data,</b> weighting each by its respective information. The variance for our <b>poll</b> <b>data</b> incorporates both sampling variability and variability due to time before the election, estimated using pre-election <b>poll</b> <b>data</b> from the 2000 and 2004 elections. The variance for our prior data is estimated using the results of the past nine presidential elections. The union of prior and <b>poll</b> <b>data</b> results in a posterior distribution predicting how each state will vote, in turn giving us posterior intervals for both the popular and electoral vote outcomes of the 2008 presidential election. Lastly, these posterior distributions are updated with the most recent <b>poll</b> <b>data</b> as of August...|$|R

25|$|The early {{primaries}} and caucuses were {{considered the most}} critical of nomination processes.

25|$|In Argentina, an {{unstable}} military junta {{was in power}} and keen on reversing its huge economic unpopularity. On 2 April 1982, it invaded the Falkland Islands, the only invasion of a British territory since World War II. Argentina has claimed the islands since an 1830s dispute on their settlement. Thatcher sent a naval task force to recapture the Islands. The ensuing Falklands War saw the swift defeat of Argentina {{in only a few}} days of fighting, resulting in a wave of patriotic enthusiasm for Thatcher personally, at a time when her popularity had been at an all-time low for a serving Prime Minister. Opinion polls showed a huge surge in Conservative support which would be sufficient to win a general election. In the end, the war probably raised the Conservative vote by about six points, according to scholarly studies of the <b>polling</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

25|$|On July 9, {{only nine}} days after being sworn in, Turner asked Sauvé to {{dissolve}} parliament and advised {{her to call}} an election for early September. Turner was persuaded by internal polls that showed the Liberals were ahead of the Tories; after Turner won the leadership his party surged in the polls to take a lead, after trailing by more than 20 percentage points before he was selected. Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney and other experts had expected Turner to tour Canada {{during the summer and}} early autumn, accompanying Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II on their upcoming visits, and then call the election for later in the autumn. However, the Liberals' <b>polling</b> <b>data</b> was faulty; they had in fact not polled since May and the situation had since changed, not least because of the public uproar over the patronage appointments. As the campaign unfolded, the Tories and Mulroney, who was fighting his first general election in any capacity, soon took the lead.|$|E

As noted by Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell, Bridget Taylor, and Katarina Thomson from their analysis of <b>polling</b> <b>data,</b> [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were certainly not a cross-section of the electorate. They were predominantly people who had voted Conservative (and, to a lesser extent, Liberal Democrat) in 1992. Hardly anyone who had voted Labour in 1992 supported Goldsmith's party." [...] Their evidence indicated that just under two-thirds of those who voted for the Referendum Party in 1997 had voted for the Conservatives in 1992, although the analysis also suggested that many of these people were dissatisfied with the Conservative government and would not have voted for them even had the Referendum Party not existed. Heath et al. noted that [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were remarkably Eurosceptic but were unremarkable in most other respects. They show no sign of being right-wing on the economic issues of the left-right dimension and they were not consistently right-wing ideologues." [...] Those who voted for the party held a diversity of ideological positions, the only shared factor being their Euroscepticism.|$|E
