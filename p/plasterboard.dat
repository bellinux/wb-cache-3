This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of <b>plasterboard.</b> The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line).

40|$|Fire {{design is}} an {{essential}} part of the overall design procedure of structural steel members and systems.

40|$|Cold-formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall {{systems are}} {{commonly}} used in commercial, residential and industrial buildings. This is due to their cost effectiveness, sustainability, quality and resistance to external elements such as termites and pests and high fire resistance. Conventional LSF wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and lined with gypsum <b>plasterboards.</b> When LSF walls are exposed to fire, the thermo-mechanical properties of cold-formed steel studs deteriorate at elevated temperatures, which may cause premature wall failure. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} protect the thin-walled steel studs from direct fire exposure as well as to delay the temperature rise. LSF wall fire performance is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall board lining, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and prevent the steel studs from heating up. Recently, Calcium silicate board has been used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been fully investigated. Hence an experimental study was conducted using calcium silicate boards. Two full scale fire tests were conducted, one with single layer calcium silicate boards and another with a combination of calcium silicate boards and gypsum <b>plasterboards.</b> This paper presents the details of this experimental study on LSF walls and the results of failure times and temperatures across and along the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate boards are discussed by comparing the fire test results with those from previously conducted LSF wall fire tests for gypsum <b>plasterboards...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cold–formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} used in low-rise and multi-storey buildings and hence their fire safety has become {{important in the}} design of buildings. A composite LSF wall panel system was developed recently, where a thin insulation was sandwiched between two <b>plasterboards</b> to improve the fire performance of LSF walls. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of non-load bearing LSF wall under standard conditions. However, only limited research has been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of both the conventional load bearing LSF wall panels with cavity insulation and the innovative LSF composite wall panel were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for <b>plasterboards</b> and insulations based on laboratory tests and available literature.

This paper presents the details of the developed finite element models of load bearing LSF wall panels and the thermal analysis results. It shows that finite element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of load bearing LSF walls with varying configurations of insulations and <b>plasterboards.</b> Failure times of load bearing LSF walls were also predicted based on the results from finite element thermal analyses. Finite element analysis results show that the use of cavity insulation was detrimental to the fire rating of LSF walls while the use of external insulation offered superior thermal protection to them.
