These relays may work on either alternating or direct current, but for alternating current, a shading coil on the pole {{is used to}} maintain contact force throughout the alternating current cycle. Because the air gap between the fixed coil and the moving armature becomes much smaller when the relay has operated, the current required to maintain the relay closed is {{much smaller than the}} current to first operate it. The [...] "returning ratio" [...] or [...] "differential" [...] is the measure of how much the current must be reduced to reset the relay.|$|E
50|$|The {{tone arm}} (or tonearm) holds the pickup {{cartridge}} over the groove, the stylus tracking the groove with the desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and record groove. At its simplest, a tone arm is a <b>pivoted</b> <b>lever,</b> free to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{controlled}} the aircraft {{by means of}} a universally <b>pivoted</b> <b>lever</b> (later to be known as a joystick) to induce roll and/or pitch, and a pivoted footrest which operated the rudder (for yaw). The control lever, when moved forwards or backwards, operated the wires (via vertical cross-members attached to the tailplane spar) to rotate the whole tailplane; when the lever was moved to the left or right, the attached wires warped the wings to induce roll.|$|E
50|$|The Sumitomo NTK-62 is a gas {{operated}} machine gun chambered in the 7.62Ã—51mm NATO cartridge, belt fed {{with the use}} of M13 disintegrating links. It has an unusual feed tray as the <b>pivoting</b> <b>lever</b> is above the bolt in the receiver rather than in the feed tray cover found on most machine guns.|$|R
40|$|Mechanism makes rack {{hardware}} interchangeable, {{regardless of}} drawer height. Provides quick connection and disconnection of equipment drawer. <b>Pivoting</b> <b>lever</b> is heart of mechanism. At insertion, lever rotated slightly counterclockwise so bottom hook slips over pin; then rotated clockwise to engage pin and lever lock. Rotation of lever to full counterclockwise position disengages panel from rack...|$|R
5000|$|Almost all of Webley's {{subsequent}} revolvers {{were of a}} top-break design. A <b>pivoting</b> <b>lever</b> on {{the side}} of the gun's upper receiver was pressed to release the barrel and cylinder assembly, which then tilts up and forward on a bottom-front pivot. After loading, the assembly is tilted back into firing position and locked closed.|$|R
50|$|Another of {{his early}} {{transmitters}} was a rough model of the human ear, carved in oak, and provided with a drum which actuated a bent and <b>pivoted</b> <b>lever</b> of platinum, making it open and close a springy contact of platinum foil in the metallic circuit of the current. He devised some ten or twelve different forms, each an improvement on its predecessors, which transmitted music fairly well, and even {{a word or two}} of speech with more or less fidelity.|$|E
5000|$|Electromechanical relays can be {{classified}} into several different types as follows:"Armature"-type relays have a <b>pivoted</b> <b>lever</b> supported on a hinge or knife-edge pivot, which carries a moving contact. These relays may work on either alternating or direct current, but for alternating current, a shading coil on the pole is used to maintain contact force throughout the alternating current cycle.

50|$|The FNAB-43 uses a lever-delayed {{blowback}} system firing from the closed bolt position. The bolt is a two-piece unit with a <b>pivoted</b> <b>lever</b> interposed between bolt head and body. On firing the bolt head retracts {{and begins to}} rotate the lever, the base of which is against a lug in the body. This lever is pivoted to delay the opening movement to allow the bullet to leave the barrel. The breech pressure then drops before the lever has completed its rotation. The movement of the lever then presses the free end against the bolt body and accelerates the bolt's movement to the rear. The base of the lever then pulls clear of the lug and the whole bolt unit continues to recoil as one piece. On returning, the lever again engages the lug and pivots forward {{and in doing so}} removes a coupling which allows the firing pin to move only when the bolt is fully forward. This unusual and complicated system allows the rate of fire to be kept down to very practical 400 rpms without having to use a heavy bolt or strong spring.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{mechanism}} that usually {{consist of a}} rigid beam/rod fixed about a <b>pivot.</b> <b>Levers</b> are balanced {{when there is a}} balance of moment or torque about the pivot. Three major classifications exist, depending on the position of the pivot, input and output forces. The fundamental principle of lever mechanism is governed by the following ratio, dating back to Archimedes.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} opening, emptying, and loading the Webley-Fosbery is {{identical}} to all other contemporary Webley revolvers. A <b>pivoting</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the side of}} the upper receiver is pressed to release the cylinder-barrel section, which tilts up and forward ("breaks") on a bottom-front pivot, simultaneously ejecting the contents of the cylinder chambers. Once loaded the section is tilted back to lock closed.|$|R
50|$|When the action-cylinder-barrel {{assembly}} moves back, {{either by}} hand-cocking or recoil, a <b>pivoting</b> <b>lever</b> {{connected to the}} frame cocks the hammer while a stud on the frame rides in the zig-zag grooves on the outer cylinder, revolving the next chamber part-way to ready position. When the internal spring brings the assembly forward the stud revolves the cylinder completely, and the chamber lines up with the barrel. Neither pulling the trigger nor manually cocking the hammer alone rotates the gun's cylinder; the entire assembly must be cocked to ensure that a chamber is properly lined up with the barrel.|$|R
50|$|Trevithick's {{response}} was to incorporate two safety valves into future designs, only one {{of which could be}} adjusted by the operator. The adjustable valve comprised a disc covering a small hole {{at the top of the}} boiler above the water level in the steam chest. The force exerted by the steam pressure was equalised by an opposite force created by a weight attached to a <b>pivoted</b> <b>lever.</b> The position of the weight on the lever was adjustable thus allowing the operator to set the maximum steam pressure. Trevithick also added a fusible plug of lead, positioned in the boiler just below the minimum safe water level. Under normal operation the water temperature could not exceed that of boiling water and kept the lead below its melting point. If the water ran low, it exposed the lead plug, and the cooling effect of the water was lost. The temperature would then rise sufficiently to melt the lead, releasing steam into the fire, reducing the boiler pressure and providing an audible alarm in sufficient time for the operator to damp the fire, and let the boiler cool before damage could occur. He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} initiated in the High Speed Water Tunnel to measure force coefficients for hydrofoils under cavitating conditions. This program necessitated either a new force balance or a major {{modification of the}} existing one. Various balance configurations and pressure seal designs which were considered are described. A balance modification design was selected which consists of an appendage bolted between the existing balance and the water tunnel working section. This appendage alters the basic geometry of the force balance so that the model is now mounted on a parallelogram linkage instead of on a simple <b>pivoted</b> <b>lever.</b> The addition of the parallelogram force table suspension to the old balance renders the modified balance unresponsive to moments which in the old balance, interacted with forces and resulted in errors in the force readings. This modification which is described in detail was accomplished and resulted in a successful force balance capable of accurate measurement of forces on cavitating and noncavitating hydrofoils; and, in fact, {{it is expected to}} replace the old force balance for all force measurement work in the High Speed Water Tunnel. The cost and construction time for the balance modification were considerably less than would have been required for an entirely new force balance of comparable accuracy and sensitivity...|$|E

50|$|The Type 9 wooden {{anti-tank}} mine was an Italian bar type {{anti-tank mine}} used during World War II in North Africa. The box {{consisted of a}} lower section, containing the large warhead and fuzes and an upper, overlapping lid with two pivoting wooden covers that sat over the two fuzes. The fuzes were designed as a <b>pivoting</b> <b>lever,</b> and downward motion of the lid caused the lever to pull back a striker, compressing a striker spring until the pivoting action moved the lever enough to release the striker. The striker then impacted a blank cartridge, firing it, triggering a detonator charge, followed by the main charge.|$|R
5000|$|Intrinsic {{finality}} {{provides the}} basis for the teleological argument for the existence of God and its modern counterpart, intelligent design. Proponents of teleology argue that Darwinism does not resolve a fundamental defect in philosophical naturalism; that it focuses exclusively on the immediate causes and mechanisms of events and does not attend to the reason for their synthesis. For example, if we take a clock apart, we discover in it nothing but springs, wheels, <b>pivots,</b> <b>levers</b> and so on but does our having explained the mechanism which causes the revolutions of the hands on the dial make it reasonable to say that the clock was not made to keep time? ...|$|R
2500|$|However, two {{different}} basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds {{corresponding to the}} digit being added or subtracted; a [...] moves the accumulator the slowest, and a , the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted <b>lever,</b> <b>pivoted</b> at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the <b>lever's</b> <b>pivot.</b> Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot.

50|$|The oar {{acts as a}} <b>lever,</b> <b>pivoting</b> {{around the}} gate, which acts as a fulcrum. The oar's button sets the {{leverage}} ratio between the inboard and outboard portions of the oar and therefore sets the gearing.|$|R
5000|$|The lever is a movable {{bar that}} pivots on a [...] {{attached}} to or positioned on or across a fixed point. The lever operates by applying forces at different distances from the fulcrum, or <b>pivot.</b> As the <b>lever</b> <b>pivots</b> on the fulcrum, points farther from this pivot move faster than points {{closer to the}} pivot. The power {{into and out of}} the lever is the same, so must come out the same when calculations are being done. Power is the product of force and velocity, so forces applied to points farther from the pivot must be less than when applied to points closer in.|$|R

Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.|$|R
5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to pull more brake cable {{at the start of}} the lever stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the brake cable on a roller that moves towards the <b>lever</b> <b>pivot</b> in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design pulled the brake cable downwards towards a cam near to the brake <b>lever</b> <b>pivot</b> instead. Servo wave has appeared for the first time on a hydraulic disk brake lever on the 2008 Shimano XT groupset.|$|R
25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the <b>levers</b> could <b>pivot.</b> These <b>levers</b> extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine cylinder. A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the <b>lever</b> <b>pivot</b> to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|R
25|$|The {{grasshopper}} or 'half-lever' {{engine was}} {{a variant of}} the side-lever engine. The grasshopper engine differs from the conventional side-lever in that the location of the <b>lever</b> <b>pivot</b> and connecting rod are more or less reversed, with the pivot located {{at one end of the}} lever instead of the centre, while the connecting rod is attached to the lever between the cylinder at one end and the pivot at the other.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 336 is {{designed}} to be easily disassembled for cleaning. Removal of the <b>lever</b> <b>pivot</b> screw with a flathead screwdriver, allows field stripping of the lever arm, bolt, and ejector for maintenance. [...] Unlike many lever action designs, the Model 336 can be cleaned from the breech, much like a bolt-action rifle. [...] This in turn avoids damage to the muzzle caused by cleaning rods and tools.|$|R
5000|$|A few early watches had a Barrow {{regulator}}, {{which used}} a worm drive, {{but the first}} widely used regulator was invented by Thomas Tompion around 1680. [...] In the Tompion regulator the curb pins were mounted on a semicircular toothed rack, which was adjusted by fitting a key to a cog and turning it. The modern regulator, a <b>lever</b> <b>pivoted</b> concentrically with the balance wheel, was patented by Joseph Bosley in 1755, but it didn't replace the Tompion regulator until the early 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|Loading is a {{somewhat}} lengthy process, {{with each of}} the six chambers drilled into the revolving cylinder being loaded from the front, or [...] "muzzle" [...] end. A measured amount of black powder is poured into a chamber. Next a lead ball is placed {{at the opening of the}} chamber and seated by firmly pressing it in with the <b>pivoting</b> loading <b>lever</b> which is attached beneath the barrel of the revolver. For sealing each chamber, an over-size 0.454 in lead ball is trimmed slightly by the rim of the chamber as the rammer forces it inside. Cap and ball shooters also often place a lubricated wad between balls and powder, or, alternatively, pack lard or a commercially-sold bore lubricant at the mouth of each chamber in an attempt to prevent powder in an adjacent chamber from being ignited by when the gun is fired, which is known as a chainfire.|$|R
50|$|In the 1720s, the English clockmaker Henry Sully {{invented a}} marine clock that was {{designed}} to determine longitude: this was {{in the form of a}} clock with a large balance wheel that was vertically mounted on friction rollers and impulsed by a frictional rest Debaufre type escapement. Very unconventionally, the balance oscillations were controlled by a weight at the end of a <b>pivoted</b> horizontal <b>lever</b> attached to the balance by a cord. This solution avoided temperature error due to thermal expansion, a problem which affects steel balance springs. Sully's clock only kept accurate time in calm weather, because the balance oscillations were affected by the pitching and rolling of the ship. However his clocks were amongst the first serious attempts to find longitude in this way. Harrison's machines, though much larger, are of similar layout: H3 has a vertically mounted balance wheel and is linked to another wheel of the same size, an arrangement that eliminates problems arising from the ship's motion.|$|R
5000|$|The balance (also balance scale, {{beam balance}} and {{laboratory}} balance) {{was the first}} mass measuring instrument invented. In its traditional form, it consists of a <b>pivoted</b> horizontal <b>lever</b> with arms of equal lengththe beamand a weighing pan suspended from each arm (hence the plural name [...] "scales for a weighing instrument). The unknown mass is placed in one pan and standard masses of known weight {{are added to the}} other pan until the beam is as close to equilibrium as possible. In precision balances, a more accurate determination of the mass is given by the position of a sliding mass moved along a graduated scale. Technically, a balance compares weight rather than mass, but, in a given gravitational field (such as Earth's gravity), the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, so the standard [...] "weights" [...] used with balances are usually labeled in units of mass (g, kg, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|Dry {{friction}} {{as used in}} wheel brakes, {{by using}} disks (classically made of leather) at the <b>pivot</b> of a <b>lever,</b> with friction forced by springs. Used in early automobiles such as the Ford Model T, up through some British cars of the 1940s. Although now considered obsolete, an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw clamping the disks, {{and it can be}} easily rebuilt with simple hand tools. A disadvantage is that the damping force tends not to increase with the speed of the vertical motion.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a liquid helium {{temperature}} prototype secondary mirror assembly (PSMA) under development for the NASA Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) program is described. The SIRTF assembly must operate below 4 K and provide the functions of highly precise two-axis periodic tilting ('chopping') {{in addition to the}} conventional functions of focus and collimation adjustment. The PSMA design employs a fused quartz mirror kinematically attached at its center to an aluminum cruciform.
