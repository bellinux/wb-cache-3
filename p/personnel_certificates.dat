30|$|The current teacher {{education}} system {{came into being}} in 1949 through the Educational <b>Personnel</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law/Act. This law was based on recommendations from the United States Education Mission to Japan during the Occupation Period (1945 – 1952). Normal and higher normal schools were abolished, and two principles for {{teacher education}} were established that have existed since WWII: (1) teacher education at universities; and (2) an open teacher certificate system for licensure (hereinafter {{referred to as the}} open system) (e.g., Isozaki & Ochi, 2017; Miyoshi, 1979).|$|R

30|$|Teacher {{education}} at universities mandates that teachers graduate from four-year-courses at universities {{that have been}} accredited by the Ministry of Education as teacher education institutions. Therefore, in Japan, a bachelor’s degree is the basic qualification for obtaining a certificate to teach kindergarten through upper secondary school (grades 10 – 12). Prospective teachers must take three courses of study at the university level: general education for liberal arts, professional studies, and a teaching subject specialty (e.g., science or mathematics). The open system means that all university faculties and teacher education universities accredited by the Ministry of Education receive equal treatment under the Educational <b>Personnel</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law, regardless of national or private status, with educational or other faculties. Moreover, accredited universities can {{offer a variety of}} teacher certificates to accommodate newly implemented six-year elementary school, three-year lower secondary school, and three-year upper secondary school systems. These principles of teacher education {{may have contributed to the}} serious shortage of qualified teachers at the inception of the new system, and produced teachers who were motivated to work hard and develop professionally. However, some problems remain unsolved. For example, many prospective teachers as a student teacher must take compulsory teaching practice in schools as part of their professional studies, but few become teachers, and issuing teacher certificates becomes an “easy-going way” (Tokuhiro, 1970, p. 142) for some institutions to attract students, which has spoiled the prestige of teaching.|$|R
