500|$|The {{final round}} of {{negotiations}} started at the royal kraal {{on the morning of}} 30 October. The talks took place at an indaba between the izinDuna and Rudd's party; the king himself did not attend, but was nearby. The izinDuna pressed Rudd and his companions as to where exactly they planned to mine, to which they replied that they wanted rights covering [...] "the whole country". When the izinDuna demurred, Thompson insisted, [...] "No, we must have Mashonaland, and right up to the Zambezi as well—in fact, the whole country". According to Thompson's account, this provoked confusion among the izinDuna, who did not seem to know where these places were. [...] "The Zambezi must be there", said one, incorrectly pointing south (rather than north). The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through [...] "procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance", in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel-Jones, until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave. The izinDuna were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to <b>please</b> <b>stay</b> and continue, which they did. It was then agreed that inDuna Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's progress to the king.|$|E

60|$|Every morning I {{walked over}} to Rothland and {{received}} two hours' instruction from the curate, and in the afternoon my mother taught me modern languages. The {{rest of the day}} I spent alone, wandering whithersoever I <b>pleased,</b> <b>staying</b> away as long as I chose, and returning when I felt inclined. The results of such a life at my age soon developed themselves. I became something of a misanthrope, a great reader, and a passionate lover of Nature. At any rate, it was healthy, and my taste for all sorts of outdoor sport prevented my becoming a bookworm.|$|R
