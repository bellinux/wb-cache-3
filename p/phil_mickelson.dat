5|$|Nicklaus has {{the most}} Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Palmer and Tiger Woods won four each, and five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson.</b> Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the {{champion}} in 1980 and 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 the Masters began {{presenting}} an award, {{known as}} the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur {{and then go on}} to win the Masters as a professional. These players are Cary Middlecoff, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Crenshaw, <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson,</b> Tiger Woods and Sergio García.|$|E
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson.</b> Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Jarrett {{is an avid}} golfer and has a 2 {{handicap}} in {{golf and}} in 2003 was once featured in a commercial with <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson,</b> Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky where they were golfing at Doral Golf Resort & Spa.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> won {{his first}} Open Championship at Muirfield. His victory meant that he had won 3 of the 4 majors {{in pursuit of the}} career grand slam, just needing the U.S. Open, where he has {{finished}} runner-up six times.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson,</b> ranked one of {{the best}} golfers in the world, signed a three-year global {{sponsorship}} deal with KPMG. As part of the agreement, Mickelson was to wear the KPMG logo on his headwear during all golf related appearances.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November 2009, Els almost {{ended his}} year-long slump by {{shooting}} a course-tying record 9-under 63 {{in the final}} round of the WGC-HSBC Champions to finish at 16-under par 272, a stroke back of <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> who finished with a 17-under 271 total, including a final round of 3-under 69.|$|E
25|$|Els first {{achieved}} {{prominence in}} 1984, {{when he won}} the Junior World Golf Championship in the Boys 13–14 category. <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> was second to Els that year. Els won the South African Amateur Championship a few months after his 17th birthday, becoming the youngest-ever winner of that event, breaking the record which had been held by Gary Player.|$|E
25|$|For Woods, {{the year}} 2006 was {{markedly}} different from 2005. While he began just as dominantly (winning {{the first two}} PGA tournaments he entered on the year) {{and was in the}} hunt for his fifth Masters championship in April, he never mounted a Sunday charge to defend his title, allowing <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> to claim the green jacket.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the major}} {{revision}} of the rating method in September 2001, the highest points average {{as well as the}} largest lead in points average were set by Tiger Woods on September 16, 2007. After winning the BMW Championship and The Tour Championship in consecutive weeks, he had an average of 24.36 and a lead of 14.73 points over <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match in}} the series took place on July 28, 2003, and used the same fourball format as the {{previous}} year, but with four top PGA Tour players. Woods and García were again in opposition, this time paired with Ernie Els and <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> respectively. The match also had a new venue, The Bridges Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, and was titled Battle at the Bridges as a result.|$|E
25|$|Tiger Woods {{holds the}} record for most weeks in the World Top 10, with 860. He is {{followed}} by Ernie Els (788 weeks) and <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> (774 weeks).

25|$|On January 30, 2011, Watson won {{his second}} PGA Tour event, the Farmers Insurance Open, {{finishing}} one stroke ahead of runner-up <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson.</b> Watson {{picked up his}} second win of the 2011 season and third career PGA Tour title on May 1 when he defeated Webb Simpson at the second playoff hole at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. Both players birdied the first playoff hole, with Watson holing a 12-footer; he birdied the next hole to win the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In , Räikkönen {{was among}} the two Formula One drivers who made it into Forbes magazine's The Celebrity 100 list, the other being Fernando Alonso. He was 36th on the magazine's The Celebrity 100 list of 2008, and 41st the {{previous}} year. On the same list, in 2008, he was listed as the 26th highest-paid celebrity overall and the 5th highest-paid sportsman behind Tiger Woods, David Beckham, Michael Jordan and <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson.</b> In , Räikkönen was listed as the 2nd highest-paid athlete in the world, behind Woods.|$|E
25|$|Westwood {{earned a}} career-best second {{place at the}} 2010 Masters Tournament, leading by one shot going into the final day before being {{overtaken}} by eventual champion <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson.</b> Westwood came through with his 2nd tour victory at the St. Jude Classic {{the week before the}} U.S. Open. Westwood claimed another second-place finish at the 2010 Open Championship, although he was a distant runner-up to Louis Oosthuizen. Despite the two 2nd-place finishes at the season's first three majors, Westwood did not compete in the PGA Championship due to injury.|$|E
25|$|At the 2016 Ryder Cup, McIlroy played five matches winning three points, {{all when}} paired with Thomas Pieters: the European duo {{overcome}} Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar, 3 and 2, in the Friday fourballs, Rickie Fowler and <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson,</b> 4 and 2, in the Saturday foursomes, and Brooks Koepka and Johnson, 3 and 1, in the Saturday fourballs. McIlroy paired with Andy Sullivan in the Friday foursomes, losing to Mickelson and Fowler, 1 up. In the Sunday singles, he lost to Patrick Reed,1 up, {{thanks to a}} birdie by the American at the last hole.|$|E

He has participated in the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am tournament seven times as of 2007 and teamed with <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> to share the AT pro-am title in 2001 with the team of Tiger Woods and Jerry Chang. In the Golf Digest rankings of Top 100 in Music, according to golf handicap indexes of major musicians, he was first in 2006 and second in 2008. He is a member at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California.|$|E
25|$|Hogan {{remains the}} only golfer in history to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same {{calendar}} year (1953). His 14-under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for 12 years, and he remains one of just 10 golfers (Jack Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd, Ben Crenshaw, Tiger Woods, David Duval, <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson,</b> Charl Schwartzel, Jordan Spieth and Justin Rose) to have recorded such a low score in the tournament. In 1967, at age 54, Hogan shot a record 30 {{on the back nine}} at the Masters; the record stood until 1992.|$|E
25|$|Though never {{seriously in}} contention, Woods {{finished}} tied for fourth at the Masters Tournament, won by Adam Scott in a sudden-death playoff over Ángel Cabrera. In his next event, Woods won The Players Championship {{for the second}} time. Tied with Woods going to the 71st hole, Sergio García hit two balls in the water surrounding the famous island green essentially handing Woods the tournament. Woods finished far down the leaderboard at the U.S. Open at Merion in June won by Justin Rose. At the Open Championship at Muirfield in July, Woods was in contention but a poor fourth round dropped him into a tie for sixth, five shots behind <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson,</b> who won his first Open Championship.|$|E
25|$|In the 2013 Open Championship, Westwood led after 54 holes by two strokes over Hunter Mahan and Tiger Woods. They {{were the}} only three players in the field under par for the tournament. Westwood shot a four-over-par 75 in his final round to finish in a tie for third, four strokes back at one-over-par. <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> {{went on to win}} the tournament with a total of three-under-par, the only player to {{complete}} the tournament under par. This was the second time Westwood had taken the lead into the final round of a major championship, with the other being in the 2010 Masters, which Mickelson also won. Westwood has now finished in the top-three eight times in majors without ever winning one.|$|E
25|$|Jones's four {{titles in}} the U.S. Open remain tied for the most ever in that championship, along with Willie Anderson, Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus. His four second-place {{finishes}} in the U.S. Open place him second all-time with Sam Snead and Nicklaus. <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> holds the dubious record with six (1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013) second-place finishes. His five {{titles in the}} U.S. Amateur are a record. Jones was ranked as the fourth greatest golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine in 2000. Nicklaus was first, Hogan second, and Snead third. Jones was ranked as the third greatest golfer of all time in a major survey published by Golf Magazine, September 2009. Nicklaus was ranked first, with Tiger Woods second, Hogan fourth, and Snead fifth.|$|E
25|$|During 2010, {{there was}} much debate as to whether Woods' {{continued}} retention of the No. 1 ranking (which he held up {{until the end of}} October) was justified given his relatively poor form—Woods finished fourth in two major championships in 2010, but failed to finish in the top ten of any other events he entered. During the 2010 season, several of his rivals for the No. 1 spot - including Masters champion <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> (who had won four majors since 2004 but had yet to reach No. 1 in the rankings), Lee Westwood (who had yet to win a major but had finished second in both the Masters and Open Championships in 2010), and then Martin Kaymer (who had won the PGA Championship among four worldwide wins)— each missed opportunities to win particular events that would have taken them above Woods, before Westwood finally became world No. 1 on October 31.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Pat Tillman, ASU has had many renowned athletes attend the school. Those athletes include: World Golf Hall of Fame member <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson,</b> Baseball Hall of Fame member Reggie Jackson, Major League Baseball home run king Barry Bonds, National Basketball Association All-Star James Harden, and 2011 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Terrell Suggs.

ESPN Magazine reported that Pacquiao was one of the two top earning athletes for 2010, alongside American Major League Baseball player Alex Rodriguez. According to the magazine's annual salary report of athletes, Pacquiao earned $32 million (approximately PhP 1.38 billion) for his two 2010 boxing matches against Clottey and Margarito.|$|E
25|$|Woods {{earned his}} 60th PGA Tour {{victory at the}} BMW Championship by {{shooting}} a course record 63 {{in the final round}} to win by two strokes. He sank a fifty-foot putt in the final round and missed only two fairways on the weekend. He led the field in most birdies for the tournament, and ranked in the top five in driving accuracy, driving distance, putts per round, putts per green, and greens in regulation. Woods finished his 2007 season with a runaway victory at the Tour Championship to capture his fourth title in his last five starts of the year. He became the only two-time winner of the event, and the champion of the inaugural FedEx Cup. In his 16 starts on Tour in 2007, his adjusted scoring average was 67.79, matching his own record set in 2000. His substantial leads over the second, third, and fourth players were similar in 2000 (1.46 (<b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson),</b> 1.52 (Ernie Els), 1.66 (David Duval)) and 2007 (1.50 (Els), 1.51 (Justin Rose), 1.60 (Steve Stricker)).|$|E
25|$|A lengthy weather delay {{forced a}} few pairings to {{complete}} their first round on Friday morning. It was clear though on Thursday that Robert Karlsson and Jeev Milkha Singh would share the 18-hole lead after shooting matching 68s. Sergio García, still looking for his first major championship, headed up a group of five that shot one-under 69s. <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> shot an even-par 70 to place him in an eight-way tie for eighth. Retief Goosen appeared to be piecing together a fabulous opening round when he birdied four of his first seven holes to get to -4. His fortunes would change, however, as he shot six-over {{the rest of the}} way to drop four strokes off the lead after the first day. Like Goosen, 2008 Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington, got off to a flying start by birdieing his first three holes. Unfortunately for him, he shot four-over {{the rest of the way}} to finish his round with a 71. Kenny Perry was forced to withdraw due to the effects of an eye problem that began plaguing him earlier in the week.|$|E
25|$|Third round play resumed Sunday at 7:15 am. The 2003 Open Champion, Ben Curtis stormed {{into the}} lead with birdies at {{four of his}} first six holes, and despite a bogey at the 18th hole, Curtis shot two-under 68 for a one stroke lead after 54 holes. Second round leader J. B. Holmes {{remained}} in contention with an even par 70 to place himself in a tie for second with Henrik Stenson. 2007 and 2008 Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington shot a four-under 66 to shoot up the leaderboard into a tie for fourth. Also among those at +1 was Sergio García, who shot a one-under 69. South Korean, Charlie Wi shot a one-over 71 to place himself in the three way tie for fourth. Andrés Romero, who completed his round Saturday, woke up much higher on the leaderboard as his five-under 65 put him four strokes off the lead and in a tie for seventh. Former PGA Champions David Toms and <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> sat five and six strokes off the lead respectively.|$|E
25|$|While {{attending}} Ohio State University, {{he won the}} U.S. Amateur twice (1959, 1961), and an NCAA Championship (1961). In the 1959 U.S. Amateur, Nicklaus defeated two-time {{winner and}} defending champion Charles Coe in the final 36-hole match 1-up, with a birdie on the final hole. This was significant {{not only because of}} Coe's proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to Robert A. Gardner, who won in 1909. In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S. Amateur in the same year. He was followed by <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> (1990), Tiger Woods (1996), Ryan Moore (2004), and Bryson DeChambeau (2015). Nicklaus also won the NCAA Big Ten Conference Championship that year with a 72-hole aggregate of 283, while earlier claiming the Western Amateur in New Orleans. In his second and last U.S. Amateur win in 1961, Nicklaus convincingly defeated Dudley Wysong 8 & 6 at Pebble Beach in the 36-hole championship match. For the week, Nicklaus was 20 strokes under par, including 34 birdies and two eagles.|$|E
25|$|Camilo Villegas had {{his best}} major {{finish with a}} tie for fourth, which was his second top 10 finish at the 2008 majors. He backed up his 67 earlier {{in the third round}} with a two-under 68 to finish four strokes behind Harrington. J. B. Holmes, who was one shot back to start the final round, triple bogeyed the first hole en route to an 11-over-par 81. Henrik Stenson had his second {{straight}} top 5 at the majors despite shooting a two-over 72 to fall into a tie with Villegas. Steve Flesch found the cup from the fairway on the 18th to become the first on the day to birdie the hole. He finished by himself in sixth place and recorded his second top 10 finish at the majors in 2008. <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> birdied three of his first four holes to put himself in contention, but did not birdie another hole and fell into a tie for seventh with Andrés Romero. Romero was unable to back up the 65 he shot in the third round and never mustered up a challenge for the leaders.|$|E
25|$|His 2012 season {{started at}} the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship on the European Tour in late January. For {{the first two days}} of play Tiger was grouped with Rory McIlroy and world No.1 Luke Donald. He shot under par rounds of 70 and 69 on Thursday and Friday respectively, which left him in joint 4th place at 5-under par. His low round of the week came on Saturday, {{shooting}} a 6-under par 66, giving him the joint lead with England's Robert Rock. Woods struggled on Sunday and couldn't mount a big enough charge, shooting a level par 72 and settling for joint 3rd place. Woods' second tournament of the year came at the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in early February which he had not played since 2002. His amateur partner for the week was Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Woods shot solid rounds of 68-68-67 on the first three days, and began Sunday in third place, four shots behind leader Charlie Wi. However, he struggled with his putting and shot a final round 75 while his playing partner <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> shot a 64 and won the tournament.|$|E
500|$|The first {{winner of}} the Masters Tournament was Horton Smith in 1934, and he {{repeated}} in 1936. The player with the most Masters victories is Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have each won four, and Jimmy Demaret, Gary Player, Sam Snead, Nick Faldo, and <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> have three titles to their name. Player was the tournament's first overseas winner with his first victory in 1961. [...] Two-time champions include Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, José María Olazábal, and Bubba Watson.|$|E
500|$|When Woods first {{joined the}} PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives {{had a large}} impact on the world of golf. However, {{when he did not}} upgrade his {{equipment}} in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance), many opponents caught up to him. <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using [...] "inferior equipment", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, {{made him one of the}} Tour's lengthiest players off the tee once again.|$|E

She competed against Fred Couples, <b>Phil</b> <b>Mickelson</b> and Mark O'Meara in the 2003 Skins Game, finishing second with five skins worth $225,000; Sörenstam holed a [...] bunker shot on the ninth hole—the eighth eagle in Skins Game history. In September, {{she was part of}} the winning European Solheim Cup team in her native Sweden. She was awarded her second Jerringpriset award in Sweden plus the 2003 Golf Writers' Trophy by the Association of Golf Writers.|$|E
