40|$|Villars Cave is {{a typical}} shallow cave from South-West France (45. 44 °N; 0. 78 °E; 175 m asl) that has {{provided}} several speleothem palaeoclimatic records such as the millennial scale variability of the Last Glacial period and the Last Deglaciation. Monitoring the Villars cave environment over a 13 -year period has helped {{in the understanding of}} the stable isotopic speleothem content and in the hydrology. For example, it was demonstrated that most of the calcite CaCO 3 carbon comes from the soil CO 2, which explains the sensitivity of the δ 13 C to any vegetation and climatic changes. Drip rate monitoring, carried out under four stalactites from the lower and upper galleries, has shown a well marked seasonality of the seepage water with high flow rates during winter and spring. A time delay of about two months is observed between the water excess (estimated from outside meteorological stations) and the drip rate in the cave. A great heterogeneity in the flow rate amplitude variations and in the annual quantity of water between two nearby stalactites is observed, confirming the complexity of the micro-fissure network system in the unsaturated zone. At a daily scale, the air pressure and drip rates are anti-correlated probably because of pressure stress on the fissure network. Cave air CO 2 concentration follows soil CO 2 production and is correlated with its δ 13 C content. Since the beginning of the monitoring, the cave air temperature, in both lower and upper galleries, displays a warming trend of ~+ 0. 4 °C± 0. 1 / 10 yrs. This might be the consequence of the outside temperature increase that reaches the Villars Cave galleries through thermal wave conduction. Chemistry monitoring over a few years has shown that the seepage water of the lower gallery stations is significantly more concentrated in trace and minor elements (i. e. Sr, Mg, Ba, U) than the upper stations, probably due to the 10 - 20 m depth difference between these galleries, which implies a different seepage pathway and different water/rock interaction durations. There is also, in the elemental concentration (i. e. [Ca]), a seasonal signal which causes variation in the speleothem growth rates. Modern calcite deposit experiments conducted for several years have permitted the calculation of vertical growth rates, which are extremely high in Villars (i. e. 1. 0 to 1. 75 mm/ yr). <b>Pollen</b> <b>filter</b> experiments in the cave have demonstrated that most of the pollen grain found in the cave comes from the air and not from the water. The specificity of the Villars Cave records is that the climatic variations were well recorded in the calcite δ 13 C whereas the δ 18 O is usually used in such studies. Overall, these results are helpful for the interpretation of speleothem records for palaeoclimatic reconstructions, but more work is needed, especially numerical modelling of the temperature, chemistry and hydrology...|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} data on maize pollen deposition obtained using the <b>pollen</b> mass <b>filter</b> (PMF) passive aerosol particle sampler over 10 years of field measurements at 216 sites in Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium. The methodology used has been standardized {{according to the}} VDI standard 4330 - 3 (which gives the general norm for all pollen types) [46] with the specifications for maize pollen described in [47]. This guarantees comparable data. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze the data on maize pollen deposition in relation to distance from the nearest maize field. This reflects the basic rule applied in regulations based on minimum distance requirements (i.e., isolation buffer zones). The variability of data represents maize pollen deposition under common cultivation conditions in Central Europe. The information presented here substantially extends the database and conclusions of an earlier report [47].|$|R
30|$|Because {{exposure}} {{is the basis}} of any effect, the interpretation of maize pollen leaf deposition data is highly relevant to the above debate. For several reasons, successful interpretation is non-trivial. To date, virtually all measurements of leaf pollen deposition—both direct measurements of pollen deposition on leaves and indirect measurements (other acceptors, technical instruments, proxy parameters)—have been obtained by non-standardised methods that differ in methodology, time span and available background information on the quantity of pollen shedding. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to compare these data directly [15]. In addition, some commonly used methods, {{such as the use of}} adhesive slides in open exposure, are non-standardised methods regarded as semi-quantitative [16 – 18]. Although standardised methods such as Durham trap [16] and <b>pollen</b> mass <b>filter</b> (PMF) [19] approaches were described as early as the 1940 s, only a few authors have used such techniques to facilitate data comparison. Similarly, few researchers have determined pollen release rates over the flowering period using standardised volumetric pollen monitors such as the Hirst trap [20] or the PMO [10].|$|R
30|$|The sensitivity/robustness {{tradeoff}} {{issue has}} not been discussed in depth in earlier works on key-dependent wavelet transforms [12, 37] {{in the context of}} robust hashing. As already mentioned, in the CBIR scenario [37], the high robustness of the feature extraction itself prevents a satisfactory key-dependency of the hash string. In [12], parameterized (<b>Pollen)</b> wavelet <b>filters</b> as well as key-dependent wavelet packet subband structures have been investigated for their usefulness {{in the context of an}} authentication hashing scheme. Key-dependency, key-space, and attack resistance have been found to be in sensible ranges, however, the sensitivity/robustness tradeoff {{has not been}} investigated explicitly. However, the high variation in the Hamming distances found suggests varying sensitivity as found in this work. In recent work [42], we have investigated key-dependent wavelet packet subband structures as a means to add key-dependency to the JPEG 2000 PBHash and found robustness to be significantly reduced as compared to the standard pyramidal subband structure, while sensitivity was found to be almost identical to the standard case. Parameterized lifting as employed in this work is clearly better suited to add key-dependency as compared to key-dependent wavelet packet structures, at least in the case of the JPEG 2000 PBHash.|$|R

30|$|In this commentary, {{we respond}} to {{a report of the}} EFSA GMO Panel (EFSA EFSA Supp Publ, 1) that criticises the {{outcomes}} of two studies published in this journal (Hofmann et al. Environ Sci Eur 26 : 24, 2; Environ Sci Eur 28 : 14, 3). Both publications relate to the environmental risk assessment and management of Bt-maize, including maize events MON 810, Bt 11 and maize 1507. The results of Hofmann et al. (Environ Sci Eur 26 : 24, 2), using standardised <b>pollen</b> mass <b>filter</b> deposition measurements, indicated that the EFSA Panel model had underestimated pollen deposition and, hence, exposure of non-target organisms to Bt-maize pollen. The results implied a need for safety buffer distances in the kilometre range for protected nature reserve areas instead of the 20 – 30  m range recommended by the EFSA Panel. As a result, the EFSA Panel revised their model (EFSA EFSA J 13 : 4127, 4), adopting the slope of the empirical data from Hofmann et al. The intercept, however, was substantially reduced to less than 1 % at one point by introducing further assumptions based on the estimates of mainly panel members, citing possible ‘uncertainty’. Hofmann et al. (Environ Sci Eur 28 : 14, 3) published extensive empirical data regarding pollen deposition on leaves. These results were part of a larger 3 -year study involving detailed measurements of pollen release, dispersal and deposition over the maize flowering period. The data collected in situ confirmed the previous predictions of Hofmann et al. (Environ Sci Eur 26 : 24, 2). Mean levels and observed variability of pollen deposition on maize and four lepidopteran host plants exceeded the assumptions and disagreed with the conclusions of the EFSA Panel. The EFSA Panel reacted in a report (EFSA EFSA Supp Publ, 1) criticising the methods and outcomes of the two published studies of Hofmann et al. while reaffirming their original recommendations. We respond here point-by-point, showing that the critique is not justified. Based on our results on Urtica leaf pollen density, we confirm the need for specific environmental impact assessments for Bt-maize cultivation with respect to protected habitats within isolation buffer distances in the kilometre range.|$|R
3000|$|GMO {{monitoring}} {{should take}} place in areas exposed to GMO, preferably cultivated fields and their environment, but should include also regions with no or unknown GMO exposure. On a case-by-case basis depending on the GMO characteristics, the selected indicators, checkpoints and related analytical methods should consider relevant different spatial and temporal scales [49, 22]. Hence, the monitoring of ecological effects of GMO must be standardised with regard to parameters, methods, survey intervals and sites so that data are comparable in terms of measurement methods and, thus, can be analysed statistically and interpreted meaningfully [22]. This comprises standards concerning molecular-biological detection methods, vegetation mapping and faunistic surveys to evaluate changes in population density and behaviour of endangered species, for example. This standardisation is to ensure a Germany-wide comparability of sampling data and to provide legal certainty for the user [50]. Accordingly, the WebGIS GMO monitoring should support realisation of particular parts of the guideline VDI 4330 [22]: [...] "Monitoring the ecological effects of genetically modified organisms - Basic principles and strategies" [...] (VDI 4330, part 1), [...] "Pollen monitoring: Pollen sampling using <b>pollen</b> mass <b>filters</b> (PMF) and Sigma- 2 samplers" [...] (VDI 4330, part 3), [...] "Pollen monitoring: Biological sampling by honey bees" [...] (VDI 4330, part 4). In this context, Reuter et al. (2006, 2010) [23, 24] developed a concept of an information system for GMO monitoring (ISMO). The database concept encompasses three components: The [...] "Knowledge Database" [...] comprises information related to different levels of biological organisation being affected by GMO cultivation. Therein, scientific hypotheses regarding ecological effects of GMO as well as checkpoints for monitoring possible impacts were described in detail. The [...] "Monitoring Database" [...] should provide GMO monitoring data and interfaces to existing environmental information systems being of relevance for GMO monitoring issues. The WebGIS GMO monitoring is designated {{to be part of}} the monitoring database enabling data retrieval, mapping and analysis of relevant monitoring data and geodata. The [...] "Administrative Database" [...] structures all data necessary for the approval process. ISMO enables support by competent authorities in the notification process and post market monitoring of environmental effects [24]. Checkpoints defined by ISMO were used to compile and integrate appropriate environmental monitoring programmes in the WebGIS GMO monitoring.|$|R
40|$|Radioactivity {{occurs in}} trithloroacetic acid (TCA) -soluble and precipitable, {{cytoplasm}} and salt-washed walls following germination of Lilium longiflorum, cv. 'Ace' pollen in medium containing [14 C]-proline (Pro). Sephadex gel filtration on G- 25 through G- 100 {{was employed to}} determine whether radioactivity in cytoplasm, wall and growth medium from pollen fed [14 C]-Pro or [3 H]=Pro plus [14 C]-arafbinose (Ara) was contained within molecules possessing molecular weights of 5, 000 to 100, 000 daltones or greater. G- 25 elution profiles of a crude cytoplasmic fraction (15, 000 X g supernatant) from [14 C]-Pro labelled pollen yielded a radioctive void volume peak and a retarded peak. The void volume peak contained hydroxyproline (Hyp), and exhibited a coincidence of [3 H]-Pro and [14 C] -Ara labelling when pollen was double labelled with the two isotopes. This peak also contained radioactivity when pollen was germinated in 2 -[3 H]-myo-inositol. Germination in medium supplemented with 100 µM 2, 2 '-dipyridyl eliminated radioactivity from 2 -[3 H]-myo-inositol or [14 C]-,Pro in the peak. Filtratian on G- 25 of aTCA-soluble fraction of a salt-extract of walls from [14 C]-Pro labelled pollen resulted in void volume and two retarded peaks. Void volume and two retarded peaks were also obtained upon G- 25 filtration of a cellulase-digest of walls from [M]-Pro labeled pollen. The void volume peak contained Hyp, Lys, Gly, Ala, Ser, Glu and Asp acids, Val, Tyr, Leu or lieu and Pro.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of allergic diseases {{in western countries}} increased during the last decades due to greater awareness towards a hygienic lifestyle. The hygiene hypothesis relates the reduced expo- sure to microbial pollution to an underdevelopment of the immune system, which in turn favours the development of allergies. In order to provide information to affected individuals on adequate pre-emptive measures, numerous studies on the health impact of allergenic pollen focus on their atmospheric abundance and dispersion, including observations and simulation of emission and transport. Prognostic models for the spatial distribution and concentration of different pollen species on a regional scale are operational in many countries {{in order to identify}} highly affected regions and allow health offices to announce warnings to the affected population. These models are capable of predicting long-range transport in a full spatial resolution with respect to meteoro- logical conditions. However, the initial abundance of airborne pollen in the models is determined with empirically derived emission parameters, which are mostly based on long-term observation averages with respect to large areas. Field measurements and modelling work conducted in the framework of this thesis aimed at de- scribing the emission and dispersion characteristics of an isolated natural birch pollen source in the micro-scale, in order to improve the accuracy of the emission part in prognostic pollen transport models. The basic approach was to infer the emission of the pollen source from downwind obser- vations, with respect to meteorological conditions, by reproducing the observed pollen dispersion with numerical simulations. Birch pollen are used, because they are among the most important aeroallergens in Europe. In terms of quantifying the absolute pollen emission in speciffic cases, however, the field observations of pollen concentrations were subject to various difficulties related to sensor uncertainties and non-stationary conditions in the natural environment. Firstly, the detailed investigation of pollen transport up- and downwind of the isolated source relied on a large array of different instruments. In order to make the observations of birch pollen concentrations comparable among different used instruments, a substantial part of this thesis is dedicated to the description of performance and uncertainty of different pollen sampling methods. Secondly, since naturally emitted pollen are used for tracers, instead of a controlled release of artifficial particles, the observed pollen concentration can be biased by natural background con- centration, which relates to emission from unknown sources upwind of the experiment site. The wind ow directed towards the birch canopy is substantially disturbed by its roughness and, addi- tionally, a certain amount of airborne <b>pollen</b> is <b>filtered</b> by its vegetation elements. Observations of undisturbed concentrations upwind of the windbreak thus fall short of describing the complex pattern of downwind distribution. A computational uid dynamics model, therefore, is used to simulate Lagrangian-based trajectories of the pollen with respect to the disturbance of the wind field. The results indicate that the portion of background concentration in the observed downwind concentration is largely dependent on effects of accumulation due to deceleration of the wind ow. Deposition within the birch canopy is accounted for in a separate model, which is based on the optical porosity of the windbreak. A combination of the two model approaches allows to eliminate the portion of background concentration from the measured downwind concentrations, providing information on the emissivity of the isolated birch pollen source. Based on the corrected concentrations downwind of the windbreak, i. e. un-biased by background concentration, a method of estimating the source strength of the isolated pollen source with a Lagrangian particle model is assessed...|$|R
