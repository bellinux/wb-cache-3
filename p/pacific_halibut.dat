5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of {{wildlife}} and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut,</b> and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California clapper rail, the snowy egret, and the black crowned night heron.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut</b> {{is found}} on the {{continental}} shelf of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Fishing for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut</b> is mostly concentrated in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, off {{the west coast of}} Canada. Small halibut catches are reported in coastal Washington, Oregon, and California. <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut</b> is broken up into 10 regularity management areas.|$|E

25|$|Seafood Watch {{have placed}} {{on their list}} of seafood that sustainability-minded {{consumers}} should avoid the following demersal fish: sturgeon (imported wild), Chilean seabass, cod (Atlantic, imported <b>Pacific),</b> flounder (Atlantic), <b>halibut</b> (Atlantic), sole (Atlantic), grouper, monkfish, orange roughy, demersal shark, red snapper and tilapia (Asia farmed).|$|R
50|$|The North <b>Pacific</b> {{commercial}} <b>halibut</b> fishery {{dates to}} the late 19th century and today {{is one of the}} region's largest and most lucrative. In Canadian and US waters, long-line fishing predominates, using chunks of octopus ("devilfish") or other bait on circle hooks attached at regular intervals to a weighted line that can extend for several miles across the bottom. The fishing vessel retrieves the line after several hours to a day. The effects of long-line gear on habitats are poorly understood, but could include disturbance of sediments, benthic structures, and other structures.|$|R
25|$|On the Pacific Coast {{important}} {{species are}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut,</b> Pacific salmon, groundfish, pelagic fishes and nearshore species. The stocks are mostly overfished or fully exploited.|$|E
25|$|The salmon {{species in}} Alaska (chinook, coho, pink, sockeye, and chum) {{generally}} produce good harvest, though some stocks are declining. Up to 1977, foreign fishing controlled the groundfish fisheries in Alaska (apart from <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Oregon Coast is also host to many {{recreational}} activities. Hiking, camping, sport fishing, and cycling are {{the most}} common activities and are ubiquitous to the Oregon Coast. Sport fishing has traditionally been the primary outdoor recreational activity along the Oregon Coast, and is a major industry in several of Oregon's port cities, especially Astoria, Newport, and Coos Bay. Because of this, Oregon has strict regulations concerning the harvest of fish for sport. Charter boats usually take groups out for half day and full day fishing trips for Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, and <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Yup'ik {{region is}} rich with waterfowl, fish, and sea and land mammals. The coastal {{settlements}} rely {{more heavily on}} sea mammals (seals, walrusses, beluga whales), many species of fish (<b>Pacific</b> salmon, herring, <b>halibut,</b> flounder, trout, burbot, Alaska blackfish), shellfish, crabs, and seaweed.

25|$|Deep sea corals {{together}} with other habitat-forming organisms host a rich fauna of associated organisms. Lophelia reefs can host up to 1,300 species of fish and invertebrates. Various fish aggregate on deep sea reefs. Deep sea corals, sponges and other habitat-forming animals provide protection from currents and predators, nurseries for young fish, and feeding, breeding and spawning areas for numerous fish and shellfish species. Rockfish, Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut,</b> sablefish, flatfish, crabs, and other economically important species in the North Pacific inhabit these areas. Eighty-three percent of the rockfish found in one study were associated with red tree coral. Flatfish, walleye pollock and Pacific cod {{appear to be more}} commonly caught around soft corals. Dense schools of female redfish heavy with young have been observed on Lophelia reefs off Norway, suggesting the reefs are breeding or nursery areas for some species. Oculina reefs are important spawning habitat for several grouper species, as well as other fishes.|$|E
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the <b>Pacific</b> <b>halibut</b> caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for Nephrops norvegicus, the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E

40|$|Effort, catch, {{and catch}} rates for {{southern}} California sportfishing from private boats {{and from the}} shoreline were estimated for one-year periods. These categories represent two of four major types of marine sportfishing; the others are fishing from party boats and from piers and jetties. Probability sampling plans employing fisherman interviews were used in obtaining the basic data for the surveys. Shoreline surveys were supplemented by aerial progressive counts of fishing poles. Private boat sportfishing activities during 1964 were estimated at 2. 8 million man hours (mh) of fishing. The catch of almost 1 million fish was composed primarily of five species, <b>Pacific</b> bonito, California <b>halibut,</b> white croaker, sand bass, and kelp bass. A 12 -month survey, 1965 – 66, revealed that surf fishermen expended an estimated 1. 7 million mh of effort in taking 0. 5 million fish. More fishing effort was expended from the bay shoreline, 869, 557 mh, than from the open coast, 776, 732 mh. The catch in each area was markedly different. White croaker, queenfish, and smelt (jack and top) were the most significant species in inland bays, while for the open coast, barred surfperch, opaleye, and California corbina were most important. A synoptic picture of the annual sportfishing activities and harvest in southern California was constructed. The total effort from party boats, piers, jetties, private boats, and the shoreline {{was estimated to be}} 12. 3 million man hours of fishing. Three groups contributed well over half of the 7. 3 million fish captured: tunas, 1. 9 million; sea basses, 1. 4 million; and croakers, 1. 1 million. Pacific bonito, with 1. 6 million fish, made the largest contribution by a single species. California barracuda was second with 0. 6 million and white croaker was third with 0. 5 million...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of at-sea {{discards}} is {{an issue}} that has received considerable attention worldwide. With this increasing focus, {{there is a need for}} greater precision of weight estimates for less common and fishery-limiting species. While one solution is to mandate full (100 %) observer coverage to reduce uncertainty in estimation at the trip level, variance from on-deck sampling methods (e. g. within-haul) should also be properly addressed. Commercial fishing vessels are not perfect sampling platforms and all sampling methods suffer from implementation issues that potentially impact the quality of the data collected and the resulting estimates. We conducted a cooperative study with industry to evaluate two observer sampling methods on trawl vessels delivering their catch to shore side processors. The alternative observer sampling method that targets the portion of the haul that would be discarded directly at-sea, relying on shore side reports of retained catch to generate total catch estimates, was tested against the standard methods currently used by the NMFS North <b>Pacific</b> Groundfish and <b>Halibut</b> Observer Program that sample the entire catch, both retained and discarded portions (combined). Methods were tested simultaneously by deploying two observers to sample each haul on study trips within three Gulf of Alaska trawl fisheries that varied widely in amount and species composition of discards: Rockfish Program, arrowtooth flounder, and shallow water flatfish. Although the alternative method was successfully implemented in two of the three fisheries, logistical constraints decreased sampling effectiveness in the third. In some situations, observers were unable to collect multiple samples under both methods, preventing variance estimation. This occurred more often for the observer using standard methods. Detection of less common and rare species was higher using the alternative sampling method. Discard estimates from the two methods were found to be significantly different in two of the fisheries examined (Rockfish Program and arrowtooth flounder). Discard estimates under the alternative method tended to have smaller variances than for the standard method, although this was not universally the case. These results provide an important comparison of the relative performance of different on-deck sampling methods under varying catch conditions and fisheries...|$|R
