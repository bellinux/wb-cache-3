25|$|Though 5,000 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> {{permitted}} {{to use the}} Erez Crossing {{to go to their}} places of work inside Israel, the crossing was frequently closed by the Israeli authorities, impeding their ability to get to work. Additionally, the permits issued have not always been honoured by soldiers, who in some cases confiscated them at the crossing.|$|E

50|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimated}} that about 2,700 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> stripped of Jordanian nationality between 2004 and 2008. It is {{estimated that}} over 40,000 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> affected by this policy.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> {{almost totally}} Sunni Muslim, though {{at some point}} Christians counted as high as 40% with Muslims at 60%. The numbers of Palestinian Christians has diminished in later years, as many have managed to leave Lebanon. During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian Christians sided {{with the rest of}} the Palestinian community, instead of allying with Lebanese Eastern Orthodox or other Christian communities.|$|E
25|$|In a later {{repetition}} of these developments, the pan-Islamic sentiments embodied by the Muslim Brotherhood {{and other religious}} movements, would similarly provoke conflict with Palestinian nationalism. About 90% of <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> Sunni Muslims, and while never absent from the rhetoric and thinking of the secularist PLO factions, Islamic political doctrines, or Islamism, didn't become {{a large part of}} the Palestinian movement until the 1980s rise of Hamas.|$|E
25|$|Israelis {{allege that}} <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> {{deliberately}} removing {{significant amounts of}} archaeological evidence about the Jewish past of the site and claim to have found significant artifacts in the fill removed by bulldozers and trucks from the Temple Mount. Since the Waqf is granted almost full autonomy on the Islamic holy sites, Israeli archaeologists have been prevented from inspecting the area, and are restricted to conducting excavations around the Temple Mount. Muslims allege that the Israelis are deliberately damaging the remains of Islamic-era buildings found in their excavations.|$|E
25|$|As {{word of the}} {{incident}} spread throughout the occupied territories, confrontations broke out in which a further 20 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> killed and 120 injured. In the first 6 days following the massacre, 21 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> killed by live ammunition from the IDF.|$|R
5000|$|Following the 2011 Nakba Day riots, when {{a number}} of <b>Palestinian</b> {{refugees}} <b>were</b> killed during clashes with Israeli security forces as they attempted to breach Israel's borders as part of protests demanding {{the implementation of the}} Palestinian right of return, Kaufman gave a speech criticising Israeli actions, claiming that <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> [...] "slaughtered", and said [...] "the way in which Israeli soldiers maltreat <b>Palestinians</b> <b>is</b> appalling".|$|R
25|$|Until 2005, <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> {{forbidden}} {{to work in}} over 70 jobs {{because they do not}} have Lebanese citizenship.

25|$|On 17 October 2013, Abbas reiterated {{his view}} {{that he would}} not accept any Israeli {{military}} presence on Palestinian territory. On 22 October, Israel and the <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> reported to have discussed the issue of water. On 27 October, Israel prepared to release another round of Palestinian prisoners to create a positive climate for the ongoing peace talks. On 28 October, Netanyahu categorically rejected the Palestinian right of return and said that Jerusalem must remain undivided. On 29 October, the second stage of the Palestinian prisoners' release was completed as 26 prisoners were released.|$|E
25|$|The ADL {{has accused}} Tutu of veering into {{religious}} anti-Semitism. Sudanese {{human rights activist}} Simon Deng, writing for the Gatestone Institute, has criticized Tutu for referring to Israel as an apartheid state, stating that Arabs in Israel enjoy a variety of rights that blacks in apartheid-era South Africa did not, {{including the right to}} vote, and that <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> only stopped at checkpoints to prevent attacks. Deng asks why Tutu criticizes Israel for apartheid policies it does not have, but ignores what Deng believes to be actual apartheid practices in other countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and especially his own country Sudan.|$|E
25|$|According to the Palestinian Water Authority, {{the average}} Israeli {{consumption}} {{of water is}} 300 liter per person per day, {{which is more than}} 4 times that of the Palestinian use of 72 liters per day. Some Palestinian village communities live on even less water than the average Palestinian consumption, in some cases no more than 20 liters per person per day. According to the World Bank, water extractions per capita for West Bank <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> about one quarter of those for Israelis, and have declined over the last decade. In 1999, Palestinians in the West Bank used only 190 lpcd from the West Bank resources, the settlers 870 lpcd, and the Israelis used even 1,000 lpcd. Israeli settlers in the West Bank thus used about 4.5 times the amount of water available to the Palestinians.|$|E
50|$|According to Addameer, Israel held 285 Palestinians in {{administrative}} detention in June 2012. Eighteen {{of them were}} members of parliament, out of 4,706 political prisoners. According to B'Tselem, as of April 2012, about 308 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> being held under administrative detention by the Israel Prisons Service (IPS) and statistics on those held by the IDF were unavailable. According to IPS figures for December 2012, 178 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> being held {{in administrative}} detention (without charge or trial). As of December 2013, B'Tselem reported that 140 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> being held under administrative detention by the IPS.|$|R

25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
25|$|Ron Prosor, Israel's {{representative}} to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice {{when it comes to}} the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arabâ€“Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E
25|$|The Upper Jordan River flows {{south into}} Sea of Galilee, which {{provides}} the largest freshwater storage capacity along the Jordan River. Lake Tiberias drains into the Lower Jordan River, which winds further south through the Jordan Valley to its terminus in the Dead Sea. The <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> denied any {{access to this}} water. About {{a quarter of the}} 420 million m3 Israel pumps from the Sea of Galilee goes to the local communities in Israel and to Jordan; the rest is diverted to Israel through the National Water Carrier (NWC) before it can reach the West Bank. Virtually all water from the Yarmouk River, north of the West Bank is diverted by Israel, Syria and Jordan. The water of the Tirza Stream, the largest stream in the central Jordan Valley, fed by rainwater, is diverted by Israel to the Tirza Reservoir and used by settlements in the area for irrigation of crops and for raising fish.|$|E

25|$|From 2006â€“2007 {{more than}} 600 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> killed in {{fighting}} between Hamas and Fatah. In {{the aftermath of}} the Gaza War, a series of violent acts killed 54 Palestinians, while hundreds have claimed they <b>were</b> tortured. 349 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> killed in fighting between factions in 2007. 160 Palestinians killed each other in June alone.|$|R
25|$|<b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> {{barred from}} using Al-Shuhada Street, a {{principal}} commercial thoroughfare.â€³Those who still live on Shuhada Street canâ€™t enter {{their own homes}} from the street. Some use the rooftops {{to go in and}} out, climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or up a flight of stairs to a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization Bâ€™Tselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)â€”some 1,014 familiesâ€”have abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.â€³ As a result, about half the Arab shops in H2 have gone out of business since 1994.|$|E
25|$|Although {{freedom of}} access was {{enshrined}} in the law, as a security measure, the Israeli government currently enforces a ban on non-Muslim prayer on the site. Non-Muslims who are observed praying on the site are subject to expulsion by the police. At various times, when there is fear of Arab rioting upon the mount resulting in throwing stones from above towards the Western Wall Plaza, Israel has prevented Muslim men under 45 from praying in the compound, citing these concerns. Sometimes such restrictions have coincided with Friday prayers during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Normally, West Bank <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> allowed access to Jerusalem only during Islamic holidays, with access usually restricted to men over 35 and women of any age eligible for permits to enter the city. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, which because of Israel's annexation of Jerusalem, hold Israeli permanent residency cards, and Israeli Arabs, are permitted unrestricted access to the Temple Mount. The Mughrabi Gate is the only entrance to the Temple Mount accessible to non-Muslims.|$|E
25|$|The Coastal Aquifer is {{the only}} source of water in the Gaza strip. It runs beneath the coast of Israel, with Gaza {{downstream}} {{at the end of the}} basin. With the water flows underground mainly east-west, however, Palestinian extractions from the aquifer have no effect on the Israeli side. Israel, on the contrary, has installed a cordon of numerous deep wells along the Gaza border and in this way extracts much of the groundwater before it can reach Gaza. Israel sells a limited part of the water to the Palestinians in Gaza. While Israel transports water from the north of its territory to the south, the <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> not allowed to move water from the West Bank to Gaza. This is a reason why this aquifer is heavily over-exploited, resulting in seawater intrusion. The aquifer is polluted by salt as well as nitrate from wastewater infiltration and fertilizers. Only 5-10% of the aquifer yields drinking water quality. By 2000, the water from the Coastal Aquifer in the Gaza region was considered no longer drinkable due to high salinity from the sea water intrusion and high nitrate pollution from agricultural activity.|$|E

5000|$|According to The Economist, [...] "The Israeli {{security}} forces closed off {{the area around}} Hebron. Some 23,000 local <b>Palestinians</b> <b>were</b> barred from travelling to their jobs in Israel.

Hebronites were prevented from travelling abroad." ...|$|R
500|$|Frank {{has been}} a {{determined}} supporter of the State of Israel. [...] "The Israeli government {{has been a}} wholly democratic one from the beginning," [...] {{he said in a}} lecture to students. [...] "It is one of the freest democracies in the world". He attributed the primary reason for Israelâ€™s long war to his belief that <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> unwilling to make concessions.|$|E
500|$|Austria and Italy {{had both}} been {{involved}} in trying to arrange peace talks. Sources close to Abu Nidal told Seale that Libyan intelligence had supplied the weapons. The damage to the PLO was enormous, according to Abu Iyad, Arafat's deputy. Most people in the West and even many Arabs could not distinguish between the ANO and Fatah, he said. [...] "When such horrible things take place, ordinary people are left thinking that all <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> criminals." ...|$|E
500|$|By the 1860s, many Jews and Muslims {{had come}} to see the {{limestone}} structure as housing the tomb of the biblical Joseph, and it was referred to in Arabic as [...] "Qabr en-Nabi YÅ«suf" [...] ("Tomb of the Prophet Joseph"). A decorative cloth photographed in 1917, draped over the tomb itself, asserted this perception. <b>Palestinians</b> <b>are</b> also said to regard the site as the burial place of YÅ«suf Dawiqat, an Islamic sheikh. It has been claimed that this tradition is an innovation in response to Israeli control of the site since the 1970s.|$|E
