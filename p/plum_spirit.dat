Insititia varieties similar to damsons are used to make slivovitz, a distilled <b>plum</b> <b>spirit</b> made in Slavic countries. Damson wine was once common in England: a 19th-century reference said that [...] "good damson wine is, perhaps, the nearest approach to good port that we have in England. No currant wine can equal it." ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{traditional}} {{types of}} pálenka in Moravia and Slovakia are slivovica (<b>plum</b> <b>spirit),</b> ražná (grain spirit), borovička (a {{special kind of}} liquor distilled from the berries of Juniperus communis), hruškovica (pear spirit), jablkovica (apple spirit). Popular are also čerešňovica (cherry spirit) and marhuľovica (apricot spirit). Very distinctive among pálenkas are the ones distilled from fermented forest berries, including raspberries, blueberries, wild black thorn (planá trnka) and cranberries. Drienkovica (a spirit distilled from Cornelian cherries (Cornus mas) was popularized by the former Slovak president Rudolf Schuster.|$|E
40|$|Phthalates are {{ubiquitous}} environmental contaminants that, due {{to their}} lipophilicity, migrate more readily into beverages with higher ethanol content. The aim of this work was to study the occurrence of phthalates in samples during the <b>plum</b> <b>spirit</b> production and in the final product, <b>plum</b> <b>spirit</b> manufactured by registered producers from five European countries, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A decreasing trend of mean values was observed for diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-iso-butyl phthalate (DiBP), and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) as the distillation process went on. Levels of benzyl-butyl phthalate (BBP) and di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) increased in the distillation phase compared to concentrations in the preceding phases. In commercial plum spirits, DEHP and DiBP were detected in the highest concentrations. Results also indicated that a moderate daily consumption of <b>plum</b> <b>spirit</b> does not pose a health risk regarding the Tolerable Daily Intake of BBP, DEHP, and DB...|$|E

30|$|Newspaper {{advertisements}} recorded {{about two-thirds}} of the number of available dyestuffs indicated by Edmonds (some used as mordants as well): Spanish annatto, red sulphuret of arsenic (orpiment), indigo (East India, Spanish and paste), chemic (indigo in sulphuric acid), lac spirits (possibly Indian or other lac extract), madder, munjeet (Bengal madder), <b>plum</b> <b>spirits</b> (logwood mixed with tin mordant), citron bark (quercitron), safflower, woad, turmeric, sumac (Sicily and Malaga), the wood dyes barwood or camwood (African sandalwood), old fustic, logwood, peach wood and sanders (red sandalwood) [26, 27]. It was anticipated that the historical and experimental evidence would inform each other, thereby enhance, and expand our understanding of the dyestuffs used in Norwich to produce primary—reds, yellows, blues—and compound colours [7].|$|R
