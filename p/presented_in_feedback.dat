40|$|The {{traditional}} {{paternalistic model}} of medical decision-making, in which doctors {{make decisions on}} behalf of their patients, has increasingly come to be seen as outdated. Moreover, the role of the patient in the consultation has been emphasised, notably through the adoption of 'patient-centred' strategies. Models that promote patients' active involvement in the decision-making process about treatment have been developed. We examine one particular model of shared decision making [Charles, C., Gafni, A., Whelan, T, 1997. Shared decision-making in the medical encounter: what does it mean? (or it takes at least two to tango). Social Science & Medicine 44, 681 - 692. ]. The model has four main characteristics. These are that (1) both the patient and the doctor are involved, (2) both parties share information, (3) both parties take steps to build a consensus about the preferred treatment and (4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement. Focusing on the first two of the four characteristics of the model, we use the findings from a study of 62 consultations, together with interviews conducted with patients and general practitioners, to consider participation in the consultation in terms of sharing information about, and views of, medicines. We found little evidence that doctors and patients both participate in the consultation in this way. As a consequence there was no basis upon which to build a consensus about the preferred treatment and reach an agreement on which treatment to implement. Thus even the first two of the four conditions said to be necessary for shared decision making were not generally present in the consultations we studied. These findings were <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>feedback</b> sessions with participating GPs, who identified a number of barriers to shared decision making, as well as expressing an interest in developing strategies to overcome these barriers.

In this paper it is shown that state assignments can also be employed for reducing the number of delay elements in such machines.

It will be shown that the existence of assignments which reduce the number of delay elements in machines realized with PFM circuits is closely related to the existence of a "NNP pair" of partitions, that is, a partition with nonnegation property with respect to a partition with substitution property (Hartrnanis).

This thesis demonstrates that CT??

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we obtain {{information}} theoretical conditions for tracking in linear time-invariant control systems. We consider the particular {{case where the}} closed loop contains a channel <b>in</b> the <b>feedback</b> loop. The mutual information rate between the feedback signal and the reference input signal is used to quantify information about the reference signal that is available for feedback. This mutual information rate must be maximized {{in order to improve}} the tracking performance. The mutual information is shown to be upper bounded by a quantity that depends on the unstable eigenvalues of the plant and on the channel capacity. If the channel capacity reaches a lower limit, the feedback signal becomes completely uncorrelated with the reference signal, rendering feedback useless. We also find a lower bound on the expected squared tracking error in terms of the entropy of a random reference signal. We show a misleading case where the mutual information rate does not predict the expected effect of nonminimum phase zeros. However, mutual information rate helps generalize the concept that there is a tradeoff when tracking and disturbance rejection are simultaneous goals, and a constraint communication channel is <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the <b>feedback</b> loop.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Continual {{growth of}} the world's energy {{consumption}} {{and the demand for}} long-term clean renewable energy resources has {{led to the development of}} ocean-based wave energy technologies. Emerging technologies are advancing potential solutions to the complex problem of energy generation in the harsh and corrosive ocean environment. To develop these technologies, new tools are needed for simulation and analysis of the ocean's interactions with newly designed wave energy generating devices. OSU's Ocean Wave Energy Linear Test Bed is one such tool that is capable of testing and providing baseline simulations of ocean wave interactions with point absorber ocean wave energy generating devices. To provide accurate ocean wave simulation with the Linear Test Bed, a closed-loop force control scheme must be developed. To date, this force control scheme has been unsuccessful because of ambient Gaussian noise <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the machine's <b>feedback</b> signal lines. A Linear Quadratic Gaussian Estimator was constructed to solve this noise issue by providing estimates of the Linear Test Bed's feedback signals and system states. The Kalman filter is constructed from a mathematical model of the Linear Test Bed physical movements and through statistical analysis of the Gaussian noise <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the <b>feedback</b> signal lines. The concern of sensor accuracy is also addressed by a calibration check of the machine's force measuring load cells and through development of a simple methodology of calibrating the load cells. The major results of this thesis show that Kalman filtration of the Linear Test Bed's feedback signals will provide relatively noise-free estimates that do not suffer phase delay issues common to the low-pass filter, while Kalman estimations of feedback signals reduce noise as measured by signal variance. The load cell sensors and signal lines experience drift over time, and therefore must be calibrated to more accurately reflect the state of an ocean energy generating device under test. Development of this machine's advanced control systems will allow quicker and more accurate testing of ocean-based energy generating devices, that can help solve the world's growing energy needs...|$|R

Such field oscillations, however, are not merely a result of coherent neuronal activity. They may also play active roles in information processing in the brain. In this study, we observed that, in cultured hippocampal slices, CA 3 pyramidal cells responded to single-pulse stimuli with monosynaptic and polysynaptic potentials and firing spikes which occurred after variable latencies. The variability of the spike latencies was greatly reduced in the presence of weak electric field oscillations, especially the oscillation in the gamma-band frequency range, that per se induced only small fluctuations in the subthreshold membrane potential, and this effect was inhibited by blockade of NMDA receptor activity. Furthermore, the latency of the firing spikes changed if the stimulus was applied at a different phase of the imposed gamma oscillations.
