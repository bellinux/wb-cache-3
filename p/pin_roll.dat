5000|$|Slotted {{spring pins}} are {{cylindrical}} <b>pins</b> <b>rolled</b> from {{a strip of}} material with a slot to allow the pin to have some flexibility during insertion. Slotted spring pins are also known as <b>roll</b> <b>pins</b> or [...] "C" [...] pins.|$|R
50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches are {{designed}} with a small projection {{in the center of}} the pin tip to support the circumference of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> The tips of <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches are not flat and should never be used on regular solid <b>pins.</b> If a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch is used on a solid pin, it will mar or mark the pin.|$|R
50|$|Spring punches, {{also called}} <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches, {{are used to}} drive <b>roll</b> <b>pins.</b> Standard pin punches should never be used on a <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> Because of the hollow, thin wall {{construction}} of a <b>roll</b> <b>pin,</b> a standard pin punch will often collapse, mar or distort {{the end of the}} pin or be driven into, and jammed inside, the hollow core of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> When choosing a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch, select one that is no larger than the compressed diameter of the pin. If a punch is used that is larger than the pin,the surrounding metal in which the pin is seated can be damaged. Also, a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch should not be used which is smaller than the compressed diameter of the pin. If this occurs, {{it may be possible to}} drive the punch through the hollow center of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of the bifilar pendulum, a hub-mounted self-tuning vibration absorber used on certain rotorcraft. The bifilar consists of a tuning mass {{that acts as a}} pendulum and is connected to a support frame by means of two cylindrical tuning pins. The tuning <b>pins</b> <b>roll</b> without sliding on curves of cycloidal shape machined into the tracking holes on the support frame and tuning mass. In this work, a detailed model of this device is presented, which involves nonlinear holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. The formulation is developed within the framework of finite element based dynamic analysis of nonlinear, flexible multibody systems, and features energy preserving and decaying time integration schemes that provide unconditional stability for nonlinear systems. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach...|$|R

50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension <b>pin</b> or <b>roll</b> <b>pin)</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining fastener. Spring pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R

50|$|A {{rolling pin}} is a {{cylindrical}} food preparation utensil used to shape and flatten dough. Two styles of rolling pin are found: rollers and rods. Roller types {{consists of a}} thick cylinder with small handles at each end; rod type rolling pins are usually thin tapered batons. <b>Rolling</b> <b>pins</b> of different styles and materials offer advantages over another, as they are used for different tasks in cooking and baking.|$|R
2500|$|When a <b>pin</b> <b>rolls</b> back, {{the smaller}} {{diameter}} of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first. [...] The wheel brings the pin {{to the top and}} drops it into a metal tray, called a [...] "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a conveyor belt lifts the pin up, letting it slide into one of ten spots – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin – in a rotating metal basket called the [...] "turret" [...] (located just above the deck) with only the deck itself, protected with the attached sheet metal [...] "deck shield", visible to the bowler as it descends to handle the pins. When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or [...] "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute {{in the center of the}} turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck.|$|R
5000|$|A typical [...] "house pattern" [...] {{ranges from}} 38 to 42 {{feet in length}} and the oil is tapered from the outside to the center such that {{the outside of the}} lane has the least amount of oil and the center has the most. The lack of oil {{on the outside of the}} lane and an {{abundance}} of oil near the center creates a funnel effect that causes balls rolled on the outside of the lane to hook to the <b>pins</b> and balls <b>rolled</b> in middle of the lane to slide to the pins.|$|R
5000|$|Four celebrities played each game, {{separated}} into two pairs (usually each pair included {{one man and}} one woman).

The SIG P220 series incorporates a hammer-drop lever {{to the rear of the}} trigger on the left side, which first appeared on the Sauer 38H before World War I. After chambering a round, the hammer will be cocked, so for safe carriage the hammer drop is actuated with the thumb, dropping the hammer in a safe manner.|$|R

5000|$|The {{slide of}} the pre-1996 P226 {{was a heavy}} gauge, mill {{finished}} sheet metal stamping with a welded on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion was a machined insert attached to the slide by means of brazing and a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> visible from either side. Since 1996, production has shifted to CNC machining and the slide is now milled from {{a single piece of}} stainless steel. Therefore, the current standard P226 has a Nitron coated, stainless steel slide. This resulted in a stronger slide, which was necessary to chamber the more powerful [...]40 S&W and [...]357 SIG cartridges. The frame of most models is made from hard anodized aluminum alloy.|$|R
50|$|In 1800s, she {{invented a}} special type of clothes-wringer {{which was a}} machine that had two rollers in a frame that was {{connected}} to a crank. Clothes would be fed in between the two rollers and as the crank was turned the clothes would have the water pressed out of them. A clothes wringer was made from two wooden pins that are {{on top of each}} other with a crank attached to allow the <b>pins</b> to <b>roll.</b> This invention came at a time when there were not a lot of ways to wash clothes other than with your hands. Therefore, this was an amazing invention and concept. However, Eglin decided to sell her patent to a “white person interested in manufacturing the product” for $18. In the April 1890 issue of Woman Inventor, Eglin was quoted as saying “You know I am black and if it was known that a Negro woman patented the invention, white ladies would not buy the wringer. I was afraid to be known because of my color in having it introduced into the market that is the only reason.” The buyer went on to reap considerable financial awards.|$|R

50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two hollow <b>roll</b> <b>pins,</b> one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed. The newer milled slides are a one-piece unit and do not have a removable breech block.|$|R
50|$|Next {{the round}} is rolled {{with a special}} steel rolling pin. The pin has deep grooves about 1/8 inch wide and 1/8 inch apart. It is also cut {{laterally}} at 1/8 inch intervals. The pin presses creases into the round {{but because of the}} lateral grooves it does not cut the round into ribbons of dough. This <b>pin</b> is firmly <b>rolled</b> across the round and then again at right angles to the original direction leaving a cross-hatch pattern which seals the top and bottom surfaces of the round to each other. The round may also be slightly sealed to the tabletop. A lefse stick is a thin, flat, wooden stick with straight sides about 2 ft long and 1½ inches wide which has been sanded smooth. This stick is used to slide under the krotekake to release it from the floured surface. It is also used to scrape the table or pin clean of dough.|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} {{scheduled}} match Jerry Lynn faced Sean Waltman. The contest duration was 15 minutes and 31 seconds. During the bout while Lynn {{stood on the}} ring apron, Waltman attempted to suplex {{him back into the}} ring, however, Lynn countered and instead suplexed Waltman over the ring ropes and down to the floor. Waltman scored a near-fall following a groin hit and slamming Lynn's face into the mat with his signature X-Factor maneuver. Chris Sabin, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt came from the backstage area to view this encounter from ringside. Lynn gained the pinfall on Waltman after countering a scoop powerslam into a victory <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> Following the bout, Waltman and Lynn shook hands and hugged in a display of mutual respect. This instead was a trick by Waltman, allowing him to attack Lynn and bash Lynn's arm with a steel chair while it was draped over the ring apron until Dutt, Sabin, and Shark Boy came to Lynn's aid.|$|R
50|$|The second match {{featured}} United States Champion Antonio Cesaro {{defending his}} title against The Miz, {{who came into}} the match with an injured shoulder via an attack by Cesaro on Raw. Cesaro eventually won by disqualification after he knocked The Miz's leg, causing him to fall knee-first into his groin therefore forcing the referee to call for a low blow. Afterwards, a frustrated The Miz intentionally gave Cesaro a low blow.The third match was the Elimination Chamber match, which involved Mark Henry, Daniel Bryan, Randy Orton, Kane, Chris Jericho, and Jack Swagger. Jericho and Bryan started the match, while the other four competitors were locked inside 'pods'. One pod at a time opened during the match at intervals of four minutes, releasing a wrestler into the match. Swagger was the first wrestler released, followed by Kane, Orton, and finally Henry. Before Henry entered the match, all of the five were down. Henry used the World's Strongest Slam to pin Bryan and eliminate him after approximately 16-and-a-half minutes. Kane was also eliminated by Henry in the same way. Swagger, Jericho and Orton teamed up to eliminate Henry, after a Big Boot by Swagger, Codebreaker by Jericho and an RKO by Orton to pin Henry after 23 minutes. After Henry was eliminated, he reentered the chamber and executed the World's Strongest Slam on the three. Jericho was the next man to be eliminated, after an RKO from Orton. Immediately after the <b>pin,</b> Swagger <b>rolled</b> Orton up to win and become the Number 1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 29.|$|R
