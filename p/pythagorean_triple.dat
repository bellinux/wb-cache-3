5|$|This tiling {{is called}} the Pythagorean tiling {{because it has been}} used as the basis of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem by the ninth-century Arabic {{mathematician}}s Al-Nayrizi and Thābit ibn Qurra, and by the 19th-century British amateur mathematician Henry Perigal. If the sides of the two squares forming the tiling are the numbers a and b, then the closest distance between corresponding points on congruent squares is c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle having sides a and b. For instance, in the illustration to the left, the two squares in the Pythagorean tiling have side lengths 5 and 12 units long, and the side length of the tiles in the overlaying square tiling is 13, based on the <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>triple</b> (5,12,13).|$|E
25|$|Clearly, any <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>triple</b> is a Heronian triple, {{since in}} a <b>Pythagorean</b> <b>triple</b> {{at least one}} of the legs a, b must be even, so that the area ab/2 is an integer.
