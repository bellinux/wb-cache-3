25|$|The {{process of}} {{aromatic}} nitration to afford <b>picric</b> acid from the trinitration of phenol {{was performed in}} the early 19th century, though {{it is possible that}} Johann Rudolf Glauber may have reported it much earlier. Nitroesters would find use in gun propellant formulation. Nitroaromatics like <b>picric</b> acid eventually found use in explosive cannon shells owing to their ability to withstand the severe shock of firing.|$|E
25|$|Aprotic {{solvents}} are neutral, chemically {{inert substances}} such as benzene and chloroform. They {{have a low}} dielectric constant, do not react with either acids or bases and therefore do not favor ionization. The fact that <b>picric</b> acid gives a colorless solution in benzene which becomes yellow on adding aniline shows that <b>picric</b> acid is not dissociated in benzene solution and also that {{in the presence of}} the base aniline it functions as an acid, the development of yellow color being due to formation of the picrate ion.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works began {{producing}} {{smokeless powder}} for firearms ammunition {{in the early}} 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared at Santa Cruz {{under the direction of}} assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW Smokeless powder and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid cartridge case corrosion caused by <b>picric</b> acid in the Peyton Powder.|$|E
25|$|German armour-piercing shells {{were far}} more {{effective}} than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a <b>picric</b> acid mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.|$|E
25|$|Although Jaffe's name {{is synonymous}} with {{clinical}} creatinine testing, his paper only described the principle behind what would later become the enduring method. It was Otto Folin (1867–1934), a Harvard biochemist, who adapted Jaffe's research—abandoning the standard Neubauer reaction of the time—and published several papers using the Jaffe reaction to analyze creatinine levels in both blood and urine. Folin began using the <b>picric</b> acid procedure in 1901 and included it in his 1916 Lab Manual of Biological Chemistry. During his career, Folin modified and improved several quantitative colorimetric procedures, {{the first of which}} was for creatinine. He took advantage of technology available at the time, using a Duboscq colorimeter for measurement precision, and is credited for introducing colorimetry into modern biochemical analysis.|$|E
25|$|Creatinine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in vitro by Ivan Horbaczewski in 1885. One year later, Jaffe's research {{was published in}} the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäre in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins. Jaffe had noticed that, when mixed in a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, <b>picric</b> acid and creatinine formed a reddish-orange color and needle-like crystal precipitate. By using zinc chloride in a process known as the Neubauer reaction, and then performing the Weyl's test, a colorimetric reaction using sodium nitroprusside (SNP), he determined that the precipitated compound was a double salt of the solution. Although he found the amount of precipitate directly proportional to the creatinine concentration, he also noted that the reaction was highly nonspecific and could be observed with many other organic compounds.|$|E
25|$|She was {{chartered}} {{to carry}} a complete cargo of miscellaneous types of military explosives from New York to France in November 1917. Mont-Blanc was not an especially old vessel but was a relatively slow, common, three-island type tramp steamer, typical of many wartime freighters. She left New York December 1 to join a convoy in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She arrived from New York late on 5 December, {{under the command of}} Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives TNT and <b>picric</b> acid, the high-octane fuel benzole, and guncotton. She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe, but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.|$|E
25|$|The Jaffe {{reaction}} is a colorimetric method used in clinical chemistry to determine creatinine levels {{in blood and}} urine. In 1886, Max Jaffe (1841–1911) wrote about its basic principles in the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäure in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins in which he described the properties of creatinine and <b>picric</b> acid in an alkaline solution. The color change that occurred was directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine, however {{he also noted that}} several other organic compounds induced similar reactions. In the early 20th century, Otto Folin adapted Jaffe's research into a clinical procedure. The Jaffe reaction, despite its nonspecificity for creatinine, is still widely employed as the method of choice for creatinine testing due to its speed, adaptability in automated analysis, and cost-effectiveness, and is the oldest methodology continued {{to be used in the}} medical laboratory. It is this nonspecificity that has motivated the development of new reference methods for creatinine analysis into the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|The French {{cargo ship}} [...] arrived from New York late on 5 December, {{under the command}} of Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the {{explosives}} TNT and <b>picric</b> acid, the highly flammable fuel benzole, and guncotton. She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe, but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.|$|E
500|$|Further tests {{included}} {{the explosion of}} several Type 8 torpedoes filled with 300–346kg (660–760lbs) of <b>picric</b> acid within Tosas designed magazine for them, which was located forward of the first turret and had been considered a weak point in previous battleship designs. This caused [...] "extreme structural damage above the waterline" [...] to Tosa, and confirmed that any problem {{in that part of}} the ship could seriously harm it. Possible solutions {{included the}} installation of additional armor over the room or the use of walls on one side of the magazine that would be blown out and away from the ship in the event of any serious explosion inside. This would have the effect of focusing the explosion outside, minimizing structural damage to the ship itself. Another test involved the explosion of [...] of TNT [...] away from the side of the ship.|$|E
500|$|Behind Yuhuatai the 88th Division had {{stationed}} its barely trained {{new recruits}} atop Nanking's Zhonghua Gate. The Japanese had already tried {{the previous night}} to infiltrate a [...] "suicide squadron" [...] bearing explosive <b>picric</b> acid up to this gate to blow a hole in it, but it {{got lost in the}} morning fog and failed to reach the wall. At noon on December 12 a team of just six Japanese soldiers made it across the moat in a small boat and succeeded in scaling the wall at Zhonghua Gate on a shaky bamboo ladder and raising the Japanese flag there. Five of them were killed by gunfire but the last man grabbed a Chinese machine gun and held the position singlehandedly. Soon after another Japanese team set a fire in front of the gate to create a smokescreen. By 5:00 pm more and more Japanese troops were crossing the moat and swarming Zhonghua Gate by fording makeshift bridges so rickety their engineers had to hold them aloft with their own bodies, {{and with the help of}} some well aimed Japanese artillery fire from atop Yuhuatai parts of the wall finally crumbled. Meanwhile, just west of Zhonghua Gate, other soldiers also of Japan's 10th Army had punched a hole through Chinese lines in the wetlands south of Shuixi Gate and were launching a violent drive on that gate with the support of a fleet of tanks.|$|E

2500|$|SS Mont-Blanc was a {{freighter}} {{built in}} Middlesbrough, England in 1899 and {{purchased by the}} French company, Société Générale de Transport Maritime (SGTM). On Thursday morning, 6 December 1917, she entered Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada laden with a full cargo of highly volatile explosives. As {{she made her way}} through the Narrows towards Bedford Basin, she was involved in a collision with the Norwegian ship, [...] A fire aboard the French ship ignited her cargo of wet and dry <b>picric</b> acid, TNT, and guncotton. The resultant Halifax Explosion levelled the Richmond District and killed approximately 2,000 people.|$|E
2500|$|Phenol {{is highly}} {{reactive}} toward electrophilic aromatic substitution as the oxygen atom's pi electrons donate electron density into the ring. [...] By this general approach, many groups can be appended to the ring, via halogenation, acylation, sulfonation, and other processes. However, phenol's ring is so strongly activated—second only to aniline—that bromination or chlorination of phenol leads to substitution on all carbon atoms ortho and para to the hydroxy group, {{not only on}} one carbon. Phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid at room temperature to give a mixture of 2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol while with concentrated nitric acid, more nitro groups get substituted on the ring to give 2,4,6-trinitrophenol which is known as <b>picric</b> acid.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, a U.S. Employment Service Bulletin {{estimated}} that 75,000 unemployed laborers in Puerto Rico {{were available for}} work in the United States. The War Department agreed to transport workers to labor camps in the United States {{where they would be}} housed and fed while working on government construction contracts at defense plants and military bases located mostly in Louisiana, North and South Carolina and Georgia. In 1918, nearly 1,500 were sent to Arkansas to work in a <b>picric</b> acid factory. At least 176 died from influenza that fall. [...] Many of these work camps, however, subjected the new migrants to harsh conditions and even forced labor, which Rafael Marchán, a laborer, described in his 1918 deposition to the commissioner of Puerto Rico.|$|E
2500|$|Nitroester, {{resulting}} in an unstable C-O-N(O)-O linkage. The other relevant [...] "nitro" [...] composition developed in the 19th century was the nitroaromatic functionality with its Ar-N(O)-O linkage, where Ar stands for a Benzene ring. Trinitrotoluene and <b>picric</b> acid are examples of nitroaromatics. compositions nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin were developed by Henri Braconnot in 1832 and Ascanio Sobrero in 1846, respectively. The development of smokeless powder stemmed from efforts by numerous workers to produce an improved gun propellant providing better resistance to moisture, greater muzzle velocity, and generally greater reliability. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, nitroester compositions Poudre B, Ballistite, and Cordite were the major smokeless propellants. Significantly, many nitroesters were capable of detonation without confinement. The classic gunpowder composition was only capable of Deflagration in the open.|$|E
2500|$|Abhinav Bharat Society had two goals: {{to create}} through {{propaganda}} in Europe and North America an Indian {{public opinion in}} favour of nationalist revolution, and to raise funds, knowledge and supplies to carry out such a revolution. It emphasised actions of self-sacrifice by its members for the Indian cause. These were revolutionary activities which the masses could emulate, but which did not require a mass movement. The outbuilding of India House was converted to a [...] "war workshop" [...] where chemistry students attempted to produce explosives and manufacture bombs, while the printing press turned out [...] "seditious" [...] literature, including bomb-making manuals and pamphlets promoting violence toward Europeans in India. In the house was an arsenal of small arms that were intermittently dispatched to India through different avenues. Savarkar {{was at the heart}} of these, spending a great deal of time in the explosives workshop and emerging on some evenings, according to a fellow revolutionary, [...] "with telltale yellow stains of <b>Picric</b> acid on his hands". The residents of India House and members of Abhinav Bharat practiced shooting at a range in Tottenham Court Road in central London, and rehearsed assassinations they planned to carry out.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not often}} that Ann found {{occasion}} to rejoice at the presence in her uncle's {{house of the}} six geniuses whom Mrs. Pett had installed therein. As a rule, she disliked them individually and collectively. But to-day their company was extraordinarily welcome to her. They might have their faults, but at least their presence tended to keep the conversation general and prevent it becoming a duologue between Lord Wisbeach and Jimmy {{on the subject of}} old times. She was still feeling weak from the reaction consequent upon the slackening of the tension of her emotions on seeing Lord Wisbeach greet Jimmy as an old acquaintance. She had never hoped that that barrier would be surmounted. She had pictured Lord Wisbeach drawing back with a puzzled frown on his face and an astonished [...] "But this is not Jimmy Crocker." [...] The strain had left her relieved, but in no mood for conversation, and she replied absently to the remarks of Howard Bemis, the poet, who sat on her left. She looked round the table. Willie Partridge was talking to Mrs. Pett about the difference between <b>picric</b> acid and trinitrotoluene, than which a pleasanter topic for the luncheon table could hardly be selected, and the voice of Clarence Renshaw rose above all other competing noises, as he spoke of the functions of the trochaic spondee. There was nothing outwardly to distinguish this meal from any other which she had shared of late in that house.|$|E
6000|$|When I am {{told that}} an Act of this kind is a {{restriction}} on {{the freedom of the}} Press, I do not accept it for a moment. I do not {{believe that there is a}} man in England who is more jealous of the freedom of the Press than I am. But let us see what we mean. It is said, [...] "Oh, these incendiary articles"--for they are incendiary and murderous--"are mere froth." [...] Yes, they are froth; but they are froth stained with bloodshed. When you have men admitting that they deliberately write these articles and promote these newspapers with a view of furthering murderous action, to talk of the freedom of the Press in connection with that is wicked moonshine. We have now got a very Radical House of Commons. So much, the better for you. If I were still a member of the House of Commons, I should not mind for a moment going down to the House--and I am sure that my colleagues will not mind--to say that when you find these articles on the avowal of those concerned, expressly designed to promote murderous action, and when you find as a fact that murderous action has come about, it is moonshine to talk of the freedom of the Press. There is no use in indulging in heroics. They are not wanted. But an incendiary article is part and parcel of the murderous act. You may put <b>picric</b> acid in the ink and pen, just as much as in any steel bomb. I have one or two extracts here with which I will not trouble you. But when I {{am told that}} we should recognise it as one of the chief aims of good Government that there may be as much public discussion as possible, I read that sentence with proper edification; and then I turn to what I had telegraphed for from India--extracts from Yugantar. To talk of public discussion in connection with mischief of that kind is really pushing things intolerably far.|$|E
50|$|Modern safety {{precautions}} recommend storing <b>picric</b> acid wet. Dry <b>picric</b> acid is relatively sensitive to shock and friction, so laboratories that use it store it in bottles under {{a layer of}} water, rendering it safe. Glass or plastic bottles are required, as <b>picric</b> acid can easily form metal picrate salts that are even more sensitive and hazardous than the acid itself. Industrially, <b>picric</b> acid is especially hazardous because it is volatile and slowly sublimes even at room temperature. Over time, the buildup of picrates on exposed metal surfaces can constitute a grave hazard.|$|E
50|$|It was prematurely {{rushed into}} {{production}} in 1916 and early guns {{suffered from a}} number of defects, mainly stemming from the German use of substitute materials to reduce consumption of strategic metals. It also suffered from a large number of premature detonations of its shells during 1916. These were traced to poor quality control of its shells, which were sometimes too large in diameter, and problems with the <b>picric</b> acid used as high explosive filler in lieu of TNT. The <b>picric</b> acid would form very sensitive <b>picric</b> salts within days of filling the shells and would often detonate from the shock of firing. Lacquering the insides of the shells and spraying them with a turpentine/starch solution neutralized the <b>picric</b> acid and prevented it from forming <b>picric</b> salts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picric</b> acid was {{probably}} first {{mentioned in the}} alchemical writings of Johann Rudolf Glauber in 1742. Initially, it was made by nitrating substances such as animal horn, silk, indigo, and natural resin, the synthesis from indigo first being performed by Peter Woulfe in 1771. Its synthesis from phenol, and the correct determination of its formula, were successfully accomplished in 1841. Not until 1830 did chemists think to use <b>picric</b> acid as an explosive. Before then, chemists assumed that only the salts of <b>picric</b> acid were explosive, not the acid itself. In 1871 Hermann Sprengel proved it could be detonated and most military powers used <b>picric</b> acid as their main high explosive material. <b>Picric</b> acid is also used in the analytical chemistry of metals, ores, and minerals.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} picrates, {{potassium}} picrate may {{be produced by}} the neutralization of <b>picric</b> acid with the corresponding carbonate.As <b>picric</b> acid is barely soluble in water the reaction must be done in an appropriate solvent like methanol.First dissolving the <b>picric</b> acid in methanol and then adding potassium carbonate will result in potassium picrate. Temperature control is important to prevent detonation or excessive methanol evaporation.|$|E
50|$|By far, {{the largest}} use {{has been in}} munitions and explosives. Explosive D, also known as Dunnite, is the {{ammonium}} salt of <b>picric</b> acid—more powerful but less stable than the more common explosive, TNT (which is produced in a similar process to <b>picric</b> acid but with toluene as the feedstock). Picramide, formed by aminating <b>picric</b> acid (typically beginning with Dunnite), can be further aminated to produce the highly stable explosive TATB.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} the three {{chemicals}} in Bouin solution balance each other. Formalin causes cytoplasm to become basophilic but this effect is balanced by {{the effect of the}} <b>picric</b> acid. This results in excellent nuclear and cytoplasmic H&E staining. The tissue hardening effect of formalin is balanced by the soft tissue fixation of <b>picric</b> acid. The tissue swelling effect of acetic acid is balanced by the tissue shrinking effect of <b>picric</b> acid.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Picric</b> acid was {{the first}} high {{explosive}} nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. Nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose (guncotton) were available earlier but shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in the artillery barrel {{at the time of}} firing. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eugène Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast <b>picric</b> acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887 the French government adopted a mixture of <b>picric</b> acid and guncotton under the name Melinite. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, under the name Lyddite. Japan followed with an [...] "improved" [...] formula known as shimose powder. In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with trinitrocresol, or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured under the name ecrasite in Austria-Hungary. By 1894 Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with <b>picric</b> acid. Ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite or explosive D) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. However, shells filled with <b>picric</b> acid become highly unstable if the compound reacts with metal shell or fuze casings to form metal picrates which are more sensitive than the parent phenol. The sensitivity of <b>picric</b> acid was demonstrated in the Halifax Explosion. <b>Picric</b> acid was used in the Battle of Omdurman, Second Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. [...] Germany began filling artillery shells with TNT in 1902. Toluene was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than <b>picric</b> acid, but improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused replacement of <b>picric</b> acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars.|$|E
50|$|Gendre {{solution}} is an alcoholic version of Bouin solution. An alcoholic solution saturated with <b>picric</b> acid {{is used instead}} of an aqueous solution saturated with <b>picric</b> acid when making this solution.

50|$|<b>Picric</b> acid gauze, if {{found in}} antique first aid kits, {{presents}} a safety hazard because <b>picric</b> acid of that vintage (60-90 years old) will have become crystallized and unstable, {{and may have}} formed metal picrates from long storage in a metal first aid case.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, <b>picric</b> acid was stocked in {{pharmacies}} as an antiseptic {{and as a}} treatment for burns, malaria, herpes, and smallpox. <b>Picric</b> acid-soaked gauze was also commonly stocked in first aid kits from that period as a burn treatment. It was most notably used for the treatment of burns suffered by victims of the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. <b>Picric</b> acid was also used {{as a treatment for}} trench foot suffered by soldiers stationed on the Western Front during World War I.|$|E
