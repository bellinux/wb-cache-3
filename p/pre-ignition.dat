5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{task of the}} metallurgists was {{to determine}} how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium. The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300°C to 450°C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the <b>pre-ignition</b> problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.|$|E
25|$|A {{centrifugal}} supercharger has {{the advantage}} of generating less heat than other designs, especially scroll-type or screw-type superchargers. Excess heat in the intake charge can cause <b>pre-ignition</b> that will destroy the engine.|$|E

40|$|Currently {{there is}} a large {{interest}} in alternative transport fuels. There are two underlying reasons for this interest: the desire to decrease the environmental impact of transports and the need to compensate for the declining availability of petroleum. In the light of both these factors, the CNG-diesel dual fuelengine is an attractive concept. The primary fuel of the dual fuel engine is methane, which can be derived both from renewables and from fossil sources. Methane from organic waste, commonly referred to as biomethane, can provide a reduction in greenhouse gases unmatched by any other fuel. Furthermore, fossil methane, natural gas, {{is one of the most}} abundant fossil fuels. Thedual fuelengine is, from a combustion point of view, a hybridof the diesel and theOtto-engineand it shares characteristics with both. From a market standpoint, the dual fuel technology is highly desirable; however, from a technical point of view it has proven difficult to realize. The aim of this project was to identify limitations to engine operation, investigate these challenges, and,as much as possible, suggest remedies. Investigations have been made into emissions formation, nozzle-hole coking, impact of varying in-cylinder air motion, behavior and root causes of <b>pre-ignitions,</b> and the potential of advanced injection strategies and unconventional combustion modes. The findings from each of these investigations have been summarized, and recommendations for the development of a Euro 6 compliant dual fuel engine have been formulated. Two key challenges must be researched further for this development to succeed: an aftertreatment system which allows for low exhaust temperatures must be available, and the root cause of <b>pre-ignitions</b> must be found and eliminated.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in alternative transport fuels. There are two underlying reasons for this interest; the desire to decrease {{the environmental impact of}} transports and the need to compensate for the declining availability of petroleum. In the light of both these factors the Diesel Dual Fuel, DDF, engine is an attractive concept. The primary fuel of the DDF engine is methane, which can be derived both from renewables and from fossil sources. Methane from organic waste; commonly referred to as biomethane, can provide a reduction in greenhouse gases unmatched by any other fuel. The DDF engine is from a combustion point of view a hybrid between the diesel and the otto engine and it shares characteristics with both. This work identifies the main challenges of DDF operation and suggests methods to overcome them. Injector tip temperature and <b>pre-ignitions</b> have been found to limit performance in addition to the restrictions known from literature such as knock and emissions of NOx and HC. HC emissions are especially challenging at light load where throttling is required to promote flame propagation. For this reason it is desired to increase the lean limit in the light load range in order to reduce pumping losses and increase efficiency. It is shown that the best results in this area are achieved by using early diesel injection to achieve HCCI/RCCI combustion where combustion phasing is controlled by the ratio between diesel and methane. However, even without committing to HCCI/RCCI combustion and the difficult control issues associated with it, substantial gains are accomplished by splitting the diesel injection into two and allocating most of the diesel fuel to the early injection. HCCI/RCCI and PPCI combustion can be used with great effect to reduce the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons at light load. At high load, the challenges that need to be overcome are mostly related to heat. Injector tip temperatures need to be observed since the cooling effect of diesel flow through the nozzle is largely removed. Through investigation and modeling it is shown that the cooling effect of the diesel fuel occurs as the fuel resides injector between injections and not during the actual injection event. For this reason; fuel residing close to the tip absorbs more heat and as a result the dependence of tip temperature on diesel substitution rate is highly non-linear. The problem can be reduced greatly by improved cooling around the diesel injector. Knock and preignitions are limiting the performance of the engine and the behavior of each and how they are affected by gas quality needs to be determined. Based on experiences from this project where pure methane has been used as fuel; preignitions impose a stricter limit on engine operation than knock. QC 20120626 Diesel Dual Fue...|$|R
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} model year 1999, an {{increasing}} number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and light trucks (a class containing minivans, SUVs and pickup trucks) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% (E85) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric (no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix. In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without <b>pre-ignition</b> when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned. This method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect <b>pre-ignition</b> and detonation.|$|E
25|$|An intercooler, was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (<b>pre-ignition</b> knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The intercooler, which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the intercooler's excess charge heat.|$|E
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including <b>pre-ignition,</b> overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E
25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid <b>pre-ignition</b> or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine. The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E

2500|$|With {{traditional}} {{gasoline and}} diesel engines the energy {{density of the}} air-fuel mixture is limited because the liquid fuels do not mix well in the cylinder. [...] Further, gasoline and diesel auto-ignite at temperatures and pressures relevant to engine design. [...] An important part of traditional engine design is designing the cylinders, compression ratios, and fuel injectors such that <b>pre-ignition</b> is avoided, {{but at the same}} time as much fuel as possible can be injected, become well mixed, and still have time to complete the combustion process during the power stroke.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of using nitrous oxide in a reciprocating engine {{is that it can}} produce enough power to damage or destroy the engine. Very large power increases are possible, and if the mechanical structure of the engine is not properly reinforced, the engine may be severely damaged, or destroyed, during this kind of operation. It is very important with nitrous oxide augmentation of petrol engines to maintain proper operating temperatures and fuel levels to prevent [...] "pre-ignition", or [...] "detonation" [...] (sometimes referred to as [...] "knock"). Most problems that are associated with nitrous oxide do not come from mechanical failure due to the power increases. Since nitrous oxide allows a much denser charge into the cylinder, it dramatically increases cylinder pressures. The increased pressure and temperature can cause problems such as melting the piston or valves. It also may crack or warp the piston or head and cause <b>pre-ignition</b> due to uneven heating.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing <b>pre-ignition</b> and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved out of the military position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E
2500|$|A {{complete}} re-working of {{the front}} header and bumper highlighted the 1977 Grand Prix, which was the final year for the 1973-vintage bodyshell that was set {{to be replaced by}} a downsized GP for 1978. [...] The parking lamps were now positioned between the quad headlamps, and the previous year's 'waterfall' grille was replaced by a narrower one that extended into the lower portion of the bumper. [...] Behind the bumper were new reinforcements (mounting panels) made from aluminum rather than steel to reduce weight. [...] In back the taillights were simplified to eliminate the weighty pot metal bezels that created the horizontal stripe effect in 1976. [...] The same three models (J, LJ and SJ) were carried over with engine revisions. The base Model J got Pontiac's new [...] V8 as standard equipment, which was much too small and underpowered to propel a 4,000-pound car. Optional engines included a [...] V8 or [...] those two engines standard on the LJ and SJ models, respectively. [...] The original thinking on the 301 CID engine was that the weight savings from using a significantly lighter engine would cancel out the horsepower loss from the smaller displacement. [...] This turned out to be a major miscalculation and 301 equipped cars became much less desirable among Grand Prix enthusiasts and collectors in later years. [...] The 301 also had a knocking (<b>pre-ignition)</b> problem that was later determined to be caused by the shape of the combustion chamber.|$|E
50|$|Knocking {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>pre-ignition</b> - they are two separate events. However, <b>pre-ignition</b> is usually followed by knocking.|$|E
50|$|Low-speed <b>pre-ignition</b> (LSPI), {{also known}} as {{stochastic}} <b>pre-ignition</b> (SPI), is a <b>pre-ignition</b> event that occurs in gasoline vehicle engines {{when there is a}} premature ignition of the main fuel charge. LSPI is most common in certain turbocharged direct-injection vehicles operating in low-speed and high-load driving conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{challenges}} {{associated with}} <b>pre-ignition</b> {{have increased in}} recent years {{with the development of}} highly boosted and [...] "downspeeded" [...] spark ignition engines. The reduced engine speeds allow more time for autoignition chemistry to complete thus promoting the possibility of <b>pre-ignition</b> and so called [...] "mega-knock". Under these circumstances, there is still significant debate as to the sources of the <b>pre-ignition</b> event.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of highly {{supercharged}} or high compression multi-cylinder engines, particularly ones that use methanol (or other fuels prone to <b>pre-ignition),</b> <b>pre-ignition</b> can quickly melt or burn pistons since the power generated by other still functioning pistons will force the overheated ones along no matter how early the mix pre-ignites. Many engines have suffered such failure where improper fuel delivery is present. Often one injector may clog while the others carry on normally allowing mild detonation in one cylinder that leads to serious detonation, then <b>pre-ignition.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If {{the nominal}} {{compression}} ratio of an engine is given, the <b>pre-ignition</b> cylinder pressure {{can be estimated}} using the following relationship: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-ignition</b> (or preignition) in a {{spark-ignition}} engine is a technically different phenomenon from engine knocking, and describes the event wherein the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder ignites before the spark plug fires. <b>Pre-ignition</b> is initiated by an ignition source {{other than the}} spark, such as hot spots in the combustion chamber, a spark plug that runs too hot for the application, or carbonaceous deposits in the combustion chamber heated to incandescence by previous engine combustion events.|$|E
5000|$|In the hot bulb engine, before 1910 fuel was {{injected}} earlier {{into the}} vaporiser (during the intake stroke). This causes {{the start of}} combustion {{to be out of}} synchronization with the crank angle, meaning that the engine would only run smoothly at one low-speed or load. If the engine's load increased, so would the temperature of the bulb, causing the ignition period to advance, causing <b>pre-ignition.</b> To counteract <b>pre-ignition,</b> water would be dripped into the air intake, providing some flexibility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-ignition</b> {{and engine}} knock both sharply {{increase}} combustion chamber temperatures. Consequently, either effect {{increases the likelihood}} of the other effect occurring, and both can produce similar effects from the operator's perspective, such as rough engine operation or loss of performance due to operational intervention by a powertrain-management computer. For reasons like these, a person not familiarized with the distinction might describe one by the name of the other. Given proper combustion chamber design, <b>pre-ignition</b> can generally be eliminated by proper spark plug selection, proper fuel/air mixture adjustment, and periodic cleaning of the combustion chambers.|$|E
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} supercharger has {{the advantage}} of generating less heat than other designs, especially scroll-type or screw-type superchargers. Excess heat in the intake charge can cause <b>pre-ignition</b> that will destroy the engine.|$|E
50|$|While {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for an automobile engine to continue on for thousands of kilometers with mild detonation, <b>pre-ignition</b> can destroy an engine in just a few strokes of the piston.|$|E
50|$|The {{power of}} the engine could also change {{according}} to the octane rating of the aviation fuel being used. Higher octane fuels allowed boost pressures to be increased without the risks of <b>pre-ignition</b> or knocking.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{drawback}} {{of adding}} silicon to pistons {{is that the}} piston becomes more brittle as the ratio of silicon to aluminum is increased. This makes the piston more susceptible to cracking if the engine experiences <b>pre-ignition</b> or detonation.|$|E
5000|$|The highest {{projectile}} speed recorded from a spud gun is 933.3 m/s (approximately 2.7 {{times the}} speed of sound) with a 16.6 g 20 mm plastic slug from a hybrid using a [...] <b>pre-ignition</b> mixture of air and propane.|$|E
5000|$|The mixture {{known as}} {{gasoline}} or petrol, {{when used in}} high compression internal combustion engines, {{has a tendency to}} knock (also called [...] "pinging" [...] or [...] "pinking") and/or to ignite early before the correctly timed spark occurs (<b>pre-ignition,</b> refer to engine knocking).|$|E
50|$|Performance {{gains are}} {{realized}} {{by adjusting the}} ignition timing advance. Different timing may result in better performance. However, to cope with advanced timing, one must run high-octane gasoline to avoid <b>pre-ignition</b> detonation or pinging. Manufacturers design for a specific timing and this may limit performance accordingly.|$|E
50|$|First, {{a higher}} {{mechanical}} compression ratio (or, with super-charged or turbo-charged engines, maximum combustion pressure) {{may be used}} for better thermodynamic efficiency. Since fuel is not present in the combustion chamber until virtually the point at which combustion is required to begin, there is no risk of <b>pre-ignition</b> or engine knock.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of the way}} {{detonation}} {{breaks down}} the boundary layer of protective gas surrounding components in the cylinder, such as the spark plug electrode, these components can start to get very hot over sustained periods of detonation and glow. Eventually {{this can lead to}} the far more catastrophic <b>pre-Ignition</b> as described above.|$|E
50|$|For {{his first}} 15 years with Ricardo & Co., first as student, {{then as a}} member of staff, and from 1947 as Head of the Petrol Engine Department, Downs pursued a study of {{fundamental}} study of abnormal combustion phenomena in the petrol engine, resulting in a clearer understanding of the problems of knock and <b>pre-ignition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most engines require {{one or more}} {{systems to}} start and shut down the engine and to control {{parameters}} such as the power, speed, torque, pollution, combustion temperature, and efficiency and to stabilise the engine from modes of operation that may induce self-damage such as <b>pre-ignition.</b> Such systems may {{be referred to as}} engine control units.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon {{deposits}} form a {{heat barrier}} {{and can be}} a contributing factor to <b>pre-ignition.</b> Other causes include: An overheated spark plug (too hot a heat range for the application).

50|$|The {{problem with}} {{compressed}} charge engines {{is that the}} temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause <b>pre-ignition.</b> If this occurs {{at the wrong time}} and is too energetic, it can damage the engine.
