This level is assumed to vary slightly under natural conditions with latitude, period of the year, temperature, water turbulence, and interferences.

40|$|Iodide/triiodide (View the MathML sourceI−/I 3 −) redox {{electrolyte}} in hybrid electrochromic (EC) devices provides high charge {{capacity and}} thereby a high optical modulation can be achieved. However, its corrosive nature and absorption in UV and in blue range of light forming an unpleasant yellowish coloration limits smart window application. In this regard, tetramethylthiourea/tetramethylformaminium disulphide (TMTU/TMFDS 2 +), 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 1 -piperidinyl-oxy (TEMPO) /TEMPO+ and <b>potassium</b> ferrocyanide/potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> (K 4 [Fe(CN) 6]/K 3 [Fe(CN) 6]) are studied as alternative redox couples.

40|$|A {{putative}} interspecific hybridization in Pinaceae {{family was}} investigated. Very rarely the physiological methods were involved in hybridization processes that occurs in the hybrid zones. It {{is well known}} that in most gymnosperms, the plastid genome is inherited from the paternal component while the mitochondrion is inherited from the maternal one. Therefore functioning pattern of organelles in the hybrid plant can suggest parent, from which they were inherited. The aim {{of this study was to}} indirectly establish the inheritance energy-transducing organelles (mitochondria, chloroplast) according to their functioning. Current year needles from Siberian Stone Pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) and Japanese Stone Pine (Pinus pumila (Pall.)  Regel) as parent species and their putative hybrids were collected from Baikal Region.  The photosynthesis rate was determined by using the spectrophotometer. The study of emission CO 2 under dark respiration of needle was conducted with laser optical-acoustic gasanalyzer.  The quantity was measured at 1, 2  and 3 hour after experiment start. The rate of the photoreduction <b>ferricyanide</b> <b>potassium</b> was characterized by the primary photochemical processes activity at the level of photosystem II. Comparison of pure species was shown that Japanese Stone Pine had higher functional activity of chloroplast as compared with Siberian Stone Pine in spite of the fact that they are growing in similar environment conditions.  Two of three analyzed hybrids had decreased activity of their chloroplasts. Unfortunately, in this case we can't conclude if the chloroplasts were inherited from Siberian Stone Pine or from Japanese Stone Pine. Chloroplast activity of the third hybrid was approximately similar to that of Japanese Stone Pine suggesting that its chloroplasts were inherited from this parent.  Consequently, the Siberian Stone Pine and the Japanese Stone Pine were maternal and paternal, respectively parents of the hybrid. Compared to the Siberian Stone Pine, the Japanese Stone Pine had higher dark respiration rate. The hybrid respiration rate was similar to that of the Japanese Stone Pine suggesting that the hybrid inherited mitochondria from this species. Our findings indicated that the P.  pumila exhibited particular ecological plasticity and this phenomenon is attributable to its high potential activity of photosynthetic and respiratory processes. These physiological features explained the large transcontinental natural habitat of Japanese Stone Pine. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of human {{activities}} rely on conventional computing devices producing huge quantities of data. These “traditional computers” may eventually fail {{to deal with such}} demands. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop novel computing paradigms, this project aims to fabricate and explore the potential of novel computing devices, based on the space-time dynamics of travelling waves in non-linear media. The designed prototype computing devices are all experimentally implemented in chemical reaction-diffusion media. A light sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction was used to construct a number of logic gates and arithmetic circuits. A 1 -bit half adder was constructed using the collisions of wave fragments within channels in a weakly excitable analogue of the BZ reaction. The excitability of the reaction is controlled by altering the light levels projected onto an immobilised light sensitive catalyst within an open reactor fed with fresh BZ reagents. This approach was extended by projecting a series of interconnected discs with differing connection weight and size. Using this approach an inverter gate, an AND gate, a NAND gate, a NXOR gate, an XOR gate and a diode were created in addition to a compact 1 -bit half adder circuit and memory circuits [...] Using an excitable BZ analogue a 4 -bit input, 2 -bit output integer square root circuit has been implemented. This utilises the principal of constant speed wave propagation and the annihilation of colliding wave fronts coupled with light controlled valves. The light sensitive BZ reaction was also used as a substrate for exploring the potential of applying co-evolutionary algorithms coupled with memory to control the dynamics in order to solve specific computational tasks. It was shown that learnt solutions from simulation experiments could be directly applied to experimental systems. A “gas free” cyclohexadione analogue of the BZ reaction was encapsulated in 3 -D lipid stabilised vesicles. The transfer of excitation between adjacent vesicles could be induced by altering the reaction chemistry. It was also possible to selectively initiate waves using lasers at selected wavelengths. Light activation is important because it will enable initiation in required position of computational schemes. In addition there is a need to study pattern formations in simple inorganic systems in order to gain a better understanding of pattern formation and the control thereof in order to synthesise functional materials and implement computation by utilising the inherent self-assembly mechanisms. Therefore, a simple reaction between aluminium chloride and sodium hydroxide was studied; a phase diagram was constructed of the reaction. A controllable region was found where circular wave, target waves, cardioid like double spiral, simple Voronoi and additively weighted Voronoi diagrams could be constructed. In addition, a group of simple chemical reactions capable of geometric calculations (Generalised and Weighted Voronoi diagrams) are presented. Drops of metal ion solution were placed on either <b>potassium</b> ferrocyanide or <b>ferricyanide</b> gel to construct complex tessellations of the plane (sometimes calculating multiple Voronoi diagrams in parallel). The reactions were utilised to reconstruct natural tessellations such as those observed on animal coat patterns. Therefore, these simple reactions may be valuable in helping understand natural pattern formation...|$|R
