2500|$|Morton's first posting was to IPC {{headquarters}} in Jerusalem, from where geological surveys were conducted across two countries, Palestine and Transjordan. The primary {{role of the}} geologists was to survey the terrain by mapping and <b>plane</b> <b>tabling</b> exposed rock formations. Field parties would venture from the main field camps, Kurnub (Palestine) and Mafraq (Trans-Jordan), setting up smaller tented camps, known as [...] "fly camps" [...] in the desert terrain.

30|$|Among {{the past}} {{earthquakes}} we examined, those with positive ACFF values outnumbered those with negative values. For the entire data set, there were 18, 790 (1 st nodal plane)/ 18, 828 (2 nd nodal plane) earthquakes with positive ACFF, and 5, 677 (1 st nodal plane)/ 5, 850 (2 nd nodal plane) with negative ACFF. This suggests that seismicity in the Kanto region will increase {{as long as}} earthquakes with the same focal mechanisms continue to occur. Since the ratios {{of the number of}} earthquakes with positive ACFF to the number with negative ACFF are almost identical for both the magnitude thresholds and nodal <b>planes</b> (<b>Table</b> 1), the results for the first nodal plane will be illustrated in the figures.|$|R

A belt slid round above him, and on either side were turning wheels, while he had {{in front of him}} a long vista of sliding logs, {{whirring}} saws, and toiling men. The air was heavy with gritty dust, and a sweet resinous smell, while here and there a blaze of sunshine streamed into the great open-sided building. Something had gone wrong with the big engine, and its sonorous panting, which reverberated across the still, blue inlet, had slackened a trifle. There was not, as a result of this, power enough to drive all the machines in the mill, and Brooke was waiting until the engineer should set matters right.|$|R

5000|$|Alfred H. Brooks also complimented Major Bagley in his {{preface to}} his USGS Bulletin: [...] "The plate camera has heen used {{for many years}} in {{topographic}} surveying in the United States and Canada, as well as in many European coimtries, and since 1910 J. W. Bagley, a topographic engineer of the United States Geological Survey, has been employing the panoramic film camera in conjunction with the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> in surveys in Alaska. Mr. Bagley has devised some new instruments and methods and has proved conclusively that the panoramic camera is extremely valuable in certain kinds of topographic work. Some of the results of his phototopographic surveys are presented in the maps accompanying this bulletin. These maps give conclusive evidence of the refinements that are made possible by the use of that instrument. The methods and instruments here described have thus far been used only in Alaska, but they promise to have a wider appUcation in topographic surveys; hence this bulletin has been prepared. As the camera is used in conjunction with the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> the bulletin includes also a brief account of the uses of the <b>plane</b> <b>table.</b> Mr. Bagley shows clearly that the field cost of surveys made by the use of the panoramic camera and <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> is far lower than that of surveys made by the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> alone, and though the compilation of the field data in the office is more laborious the final cost of the completed map is nevertheless lower. The methods here described are especially applicable to regions where the field season is short, the field cost high, and the climatic conditions adverse to topographic work." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{extent of}} the Hawley Collection was matched by {{the extent of his}} {{knowledge}} regarding it. It comprises over 70,000 tools, mostly but not entirely from Sheffield, as well as catalogues and other documents. The tools include many examples of such things as <b>planes,</b> <b>table</b> knives, anvils, files, taps and dies, rules, micrometers, scissors, hammers, handsaws, and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people.Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co-authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> {{became a}} popular {{instrument}} for surveying. [...] Its use was widely taught.

40|$|Introduction Pelvic tilt {{influences}} acetabular orientation (AO). Anteversion (AA) and inclination (AI) define anatomical acetabular orientation. Pelvic tilt determines functional acetabular orientation {{because of}} its spatial relocation. Anterior pelvic plane is used for calculation of anatomical AO, whereas functional AO {{is defined by the}} <b>table</b> <b>plane</b> of operating <b>table</b> or medical imaging. The following analysis shows, if there is an influence of pelvic tilt on functional AO. Secondary was verified, if anteversion and inclination give equivalent information for correct AO. Material and methods Computed tomography – based three dimensional reconstruction of bony pelvic structures provided the basis of the following analysis. 138 pelvises were determined with the patients supine. APP was distinguished by the most ventral points of the right and left Spina iliaca anterior superior and both pubic tubercles, while the angle between APP and coronal plane defined pelvic tilt. Results Pelvic tilt supine amounted to - 0, 1 °± 5, 5 °. 79 % of the collective showed a physiological pelvic tilt. AA amounted to 18, 3 °± 4, 5 ° relative to APP and 18, 5 °± 4, 6 ° relative to <b>table</b> <b>plane.</b> AI was 46, 9 °± 3, 7 ° for both reference planes. AA and pelvic tilt correlated positive relative to APP (all: p < 0, 01, r = 0, 497, R 2 = 0, 320) and negative relative to <b>table</b> <b>plane</b> (all: p < 0, 01, r = - 0, 366, R 2 = 0, 117). 29 persons showed increased posterior or anterior pelvic tilt of - 10, 3 °± 4, 5 ° respectively 8, 5 °± 1, 8 °. These individuals showed a difference of AA between both reference planes. AA differed from 8, 3 °± 3, 1 ° (females) and 7, 7 °± 3, 6 ° (males) with extensive posterior tilt and from 6, 2 °± 1, 0 ° (females) and 5, 4 °± 2, 0 ° (males) with extensive anterior tilt. AI showed less marked differences of 2, 2 °± 0, 8 ° for extensive pelvic tilt. Discussion Pelvic tilt compensated for increased AO. Individuals with high anatomical AA showed high pelvic tilt, which reduced functional AA. Conversely individuals with low anatomical AA had low pelvic tilt and therefore enlarged functional AA. Pelvic tilt is considered by APP, but it is not by <b>table</b> <b>plane.</b> Hence in individuals with physiological pelvic tilt both reference planes can be used for correct AO. By contrast <b>table</b> <b>plane</b> is no reliable reference plane for correct anatomical AO in individuals with extensive pelvic tilt. Conclusion Anatomical anteversion influences pelvic tilt. Pelvic tilt has a compensating influence on functional acetabular orientation. In conclusion results of this study serve to further understand the functional anatomy of the acetabulum and demonstrate the importance of pelvic tilt for correct AO...|$|R
