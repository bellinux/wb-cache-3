To support multiple video streams, a pricing-based mechanism has been introduced to the bit-rate allocation[5], where the price is adjusted based on the difference between supply and demand for the current slot. In all the above works, the throughput gain has been chosen as the optimization objective without considering the heterogeneity of spectral efficiency and network status and all the available networks must participate in collaborative transmission. Then the heavy-load network will be easily saturated and packets will be dropped. Furthermore, {{it makes no sense}} for a low traffic flow to be distributed to different networks in pursuit of fairness, where the cost of <b>packet</b> <b>disassembling</b> and resembling cannot be ignored.|$|E

30|$|Collaborative SCTP, a new scheme {{with the}} {{collaboration}} of multiple entities and cross layer interactions, {{is designed to}} deal with variable bit error rate of wireless network, especially in high BER wireless channel. In contrast to other schemes, this approach exploits SCTP features, message-oriented and multistreaming, to cope with loss differentiation problem. Analysis indicates that the smaller the frame size, the greater the probability of successful transmission in the high BER wireless networks. Based on the characteristic of SCTP packet, SCTP sender can transmit chunks into small <b>packets</b> by <b>disassembling</b> large <b>packets,</b> to alleviate wireless losses in high BER wireless networks. The drawback of the disassembly function is to produce more overhead by IP and SCTP headers. In addition, other hosts, such as the base station and the receiver that receives fragmentation data should have the reassembly function to recover the original packets. The disassembly function also can help in differentiating wireless loss from congestion loss. Sender logs the bundle chunks and uses the records to distinguish loss events. If all chunks in an original packet have been lost, we would have viewed it as a congestion loss. Otherwise, the sender considers that wireless loss occurred and retransmits the lost packet without dropping the congestion window. After observing the simulation results, when BER is very low, the overhead of disassembly function may damage performance due to the transmission of more headers and control frames. SCTP hosts should try to estimate the current BER and decide when to activate these functions. Unfortunately, the implementation of this scheme is complicated because of cooperation of multiple layers and multiple entities. In addition, base stations may get burdened under the heavy traffic load since {{the execution of the}} disassembly function would exhaust the CPU resource and cause the poor performance.|$|R

This paper presents a combination of analytical and simulated results in verifying additional delays incur, and confirms them for all levels of aggregation and class-based (aggregate) utilization. In short, limitations, in general, in using larger burst sizes, which could deteriorate service quality, in an aforementioned environment, are emphasized.
