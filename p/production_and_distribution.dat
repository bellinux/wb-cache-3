In 1957, a brewer was recruited to develop a local beer.

The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years—even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire.|$|E

5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that {{had turned to}} him for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E

A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.|$|E

North of the strip, NY390 curves to the northeast, passing along {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY104.

5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
5|$|Post-punk brought {{together}} a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped {{to develop the}} <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s. Smoothing the edges of their style {{in the direction of}} new wave, several post-punk bands such as New Order (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience. Bauhaus was one of the formative gothic rock bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|RKO Pictures Inc., {{also known}} as RKO Radio Pictures and in its later years RKO Teleradio Pictures, was an American film <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> company. It {{was one of the}} Big Five studios of Hollywood's Golden Age. The {{business}} was formed after the Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) vaudeville theatre circuit and Joseph P. Kennedy's Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) studio were brought together {{under the control of the}} Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in October 1928. RCA chief David Sarnoff engineered the merger to create a market for the company's sound-on-film technology, RCA Photophone. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor Floyd Odlum.|$|E

Shankar retained Sabu Cyril, his production designer from Boys, to handle the set design; the scenes were edited by V. T. Vijayan. While the action sequences were orchestrated by Peter Hein and assisted by Stunt Silva, the dance sequences were choreographed by Raju Sundaram, Kalyan and Ahmed Khan. Film institute student Prabhu Raja Chozhan, who would later turn director with Karuppampatti (2013), joined Shankar as his protégé and worked as his assistant.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Wang Anshi's reforms {{outlined}} in the New Policies centered on state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers, putting government monopolies on saltpetre and sulphur <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> in 1076 (to ensure that gunpowder solutions would not {{fall into the hands}} of enemies), and aggressive military policy towards Song's northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties. A few years after Song Dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day Yan'an, Shaanxi province). During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song Dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia. The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen's military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor. However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen's proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main citadel, so as to deny him any glory in chance of victory. The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as the forces of the arrogant officer were decimated; Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000. Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.|$|E
5|$|From 1886, Worthington {{began to}} acquire public houses, which {{provided}} a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became {{a public company}} in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners. By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826–1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was {{in the hands of}} William Posnette Manners (1846–1915), who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879–1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved {{to be more than a}} match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution,</b> there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.|$|E
