40|$|We {{examined}} bactericidal and opsonizing {{activity of}} pooled adult 'immune ' serum against Haemophilus influenzae type b {{with and without}} the addition of phagocytes. Four type b strains from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and three such strains from the nasopharynx (NP) of healthy children were examined. Duplicate reaction mixtures contained organisms in exponential (E) or stationary phase (S) of growth, serum, a complement source (human agammaglobulinaemic serum), and culture medium (bactericidal assay); separate assays contained the above components and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (opsonization system). A decrease in bacterial density of 2 1 log,, unit was considered significant. All four S-CSF strains, three of four E-CSF strains and one of three S-NP strains were sensitive to the bactericidal activity of <b>pooled</b> <b>serum.</b> The other E-CSF strain, two S-NP strains and all three E-NP strains were resistant to the bactericidal activity of <b>pooled</b> <b>serum.</b> Two of three E-NP strains were opsonized by pooled serum; the other strains resistant to the bactericidal activity of <b>pooled</b> <b>serum</b> were also resistant to opsonization. Bactericidal and opsonizing activity of serum from an immunized adult was {{greater than or equal}} to that of <b>pooled</b> <b>serum</b> against each strain. Assuming normal adults are immune to invasive H. inzuenzae type b infection, an experimental test reflecting this immunity is the bactericidal activity against CSF isolates tested in stationary phase.

40|$|The factors {{involved}} {{in the establishment of}} persistent hepadnavirus infection are poorly understood. Recent findings demonstrate that the sequence of the genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is variable in infected individuals and that, in some cases, virus mutants predominate. Our objectives {{in the present study were}} to analyze the variability of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) genomes in an infected animal and to determine whether sequence heterogeneity played a critical role in the ability of WHV to induce chronic infection. We cloned and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of three supercoiled genomes from an animal that became infected after inoculation with a standardized WHV <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> (i. e., the WHV 7 virus pool). We found that there were four nucleotide substitutions among the three genome sequences as well as a 73 -nucleotide deletion in one of the recombinants. DNA transfection experiments revealed that only one of the three recombinants was capable of independent replication. These data suggest that a significant proportion of replicative templates in woodchucks that are infected with WHV are defective virus genomes. Next, we compared the outcome of acute infection after inoculation with a <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> containing a uniform population of replication competent virus (i. e., the WHV 7 R <b>pool)</b> with a <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> composed of WHV genomes of variable sequence. The WHV 7 R <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> originated from a woodchuck that became a chronic carrier after in vivo transfection of the liver with the infectious WHV 7 recombinant. Neonatal woodchucks were inoculated with 5 x 10 (6) WHV genome equivalents of either the WHV 7 pool or the WHV 7 R pool. All animals in the study became acutely infected with WHV. Of the animals infected with the WHV 7 <b>serum</b> <b>pool,</b> 65 % became chronic carriers, while 80 % of the animals infected with the WHV 7 R <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> developed chronic infection. Thus, infection of woodchucks with a <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> containing defective virus resulted in a rate of chronic WHV infection that was similar to, or even lower than, a rate from a pool containing only wild-type virus.

Methods and Results: Samples of meat juice, serum, caecal contents, carcase swabs and pooled faeces from pig pens were taken from 20 commercial pig finishing farms and comparisons were made between the results of Salmonella culture, individual ELISA tests on serum and meat juice and pooled samples of serum and meat juice. Salmonella was isolated from samples from 19 of 20 farms. None of the ELISA tests showed a statistically significant correlation with caecal carriage of Salmonella or contamination of carcases. Serum mean optical density (O. D.) from pools of five, 10 or 20 sera showed a significant correlation with the Salmonella status of farm pen faeces. All <b>pooled</b> <b>serum</b> O.

The optimal assay conditions for phagocytosis of 75 Se-labeled P. aeruginosa 1348 A included 20 % <b>pooled</b> human <b>serum</b> and {{a ratio of}} one PMN to between 10 and 20 bacteria. For the bactericidal assay, 20 % <b>pooled</b> human <b>serum</b> and a ratio of one PMN to between one and five bacteria were used. Chemotaxis of PMNs was studied by agarose gel technique with 10 (- 7) M f-Met-Leu-Phe or 0. 01 to 35 micrograms of cytotoxin per ml as a chemoattractant. The degree of PMN destruction was dependent on cytotoxin concentrations and PMN exposure time to cytotoxin. Virtually complete PMN lysis was observed after a 2 -h exposure to 6 to 10 micrograms of cytotoxin per ml. PMN exposure to 2 micrograms of cytotoxin per ml {{for as long as}} 2 h had no adverse effect on phagocytosis. PMN exposure to {{greater than or equal to}} 4 micrograms of cytotoxin per ml for 2 h demonstrated a significant decrease in the percentage of bacteria killed. The results of experiments designed to separate cytotoxin effect on PMN lysis from the effect on PMN bactericidal capacity showed that there is an effect of cytotoxin on PMN bactericidal function. PMN exposure to 4 micrograms of cytotoxin per ml for 30 min caused a significant decrease in PMN migration. Cytotoxin had no chemoattractant qualities or effect on <b>pooled</b> human <b>serum</b> as studied by chemotaxis and phagocytosis assays. Although a cytotoxin concentration of greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml was required to demonstrate PMN ultrastructural changes observed in transmission electron microscopy studies, at a concentration of 0. 1 microgram/ml, cytotoxin caused an impairment in the integrity of the PMN membrane, allowing a low-molecular-weight substance (ruthenium red) to enter into the cytoplasm. Cytotoxin may be an important factor in the pathogenesis and in the high mortality rate of patients with P. aeruginosa infections...|$|R
40|$|Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS), {{an acute}} demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, may {{be triggered by}} an acute infectious illness; infection with Campylobacter jejun is the most frequently reported antecedent event. In Japan, O: 19 {{is the most common}} serotype among GBS-associated C. jejuni strains. To determine whether serotype O: 19 occurs among GBS-associated strains in the United States and Europe, we serotyped seven such strains and found that two (29 %) of seven GBS-associated strains from patients in the United States and Germany were serotype O: 19. To determine whether GBSassociated strains may be resistant to killing by normal human serum (NHS), we studied the serum susceptibility of 17 GBS- and 27 enteritis-associated strains (including many O: 19 and non-O: 19 strains) using C. jejuni antibody positive (pool 1) or negative (<b>pool</b> 2) human <b>serum.</b> Using <b>pool</b> 1 <b>serum</b> we found that one (6 %) of 18 serotype O: 19 strains compared with 11 (42 %) of 26 non-O: 19 strains were killed; results using <b>pool</b> 2 <b>serum</b> were nearly identical. Finally, 8 O: 19 and 8 non-O: 19 strains were not significantly different in their ability to bind complement component C 3. Serotype O: 19 C. jejuni strains were overrepresented among GBS-associated strains in the United States and Germany an...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Matrix effects {{hinder the}} {{transferability}} of accuracy for cholesterol. A general {{assumption is that}} pooled and individual samples yield similar results. We tested the hypothesis that serum-pooling affects the recovery for cholesterol. We <b>pooled</b> 100 <b>serum</b> samples, determining cholesterol of pool and of the individual samples with Hitachi 717 and 914. Over twenty days, we daily determined cholesterol of individual and pooled samples, using a Hitachi 736 and 747 analyzers. For the hundred-sample pool, the pool was 1. 1 to 1. 5 % lower than the individual samples. With the daily pool study, the ratio of 747 to 736 was 1. 7 % lower for the pooled compared with the individual samples. Therefore, <b>pooling</b> of <b>serum</b> samples causes a decreased recovery, averaging from 1. 1 — 1. 7 %, and representing 37 - 57 % of the allowable bias for cholesterol (< 3 %), and it is thereby significant...|$|R
