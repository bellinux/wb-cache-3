25|$|The new {{building}} materials of the 19th {{century and a}} better understanding of the forces within structures from the 20th century has opened up new possibilities. Iron and steel beams, steel cables, and <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>concrete</b> have eliminated the need for external buttressing and enabled far thinner domes. Whereas earlier masonry domes may have had a radius to thickness ratio of 50, the ratio for modern domes can be in excess of 800. The lighter weight of these domes has not only permitted far greater spans, but also allowed for the creation of large movable domes over modern sports stadiums.|$|E
25|$|Work {{began on}} the {{southern}} approach road in July 1972 by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe. The 2.5km approach road to the A1077 junction, by Costain Civil Engineering began in September 1976. It included a 320m span from the southern anchorage of seven <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>concrete</b> box sections, and the A1077 junction, costing £4.25million. Work on the bridge substructure (foundations) began in March 1973. To reduce heat of hydration in the concrete, which produces calcium silicate hydrate from belite, as much as 60% of the Portland cement was replaced with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). It took longer to build the southern anchorage due to a diaphragm wall design due to not enough shallow bedrock. The main southern approach roads from Barton to the M180 motorway junction at Barnetby {{were built in the}} late 1970s by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe, opening in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The River Test {{runs along}} the western border of the city, {{separating}} it from the New Forest. There are bridges over the Test from Southampton, including the road and rail bridges at Redbridge {{in the south and}} the M27 motorway to the north. The River Itchen runs through the middle of the city and is bridged in several places. The northernmost bridge, and the first to be built, is at Mansbridge, where the A27 road crosses the Itchen. The original bridge is closed to road traffic, but is still standing and open to pedestrians and cyclists. The river is bridged again at Swaythling, where Woodmill Bridge separates the tidal and non tidal sections of the river. Further south is Cobden Bridge which is notable as it was opened as a free bridge (it was originally named the Cobden Free Bridge), and was never a toll bridge. Downstream of the Cobden Bridge is the Northam Railway Bridge, then the Northam Road Bridge, which was the first major <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge to be constructed in the United Kingdom. The southernmost, and newest, bridge on the Itchen is the Itchen Bridge, which is a toll bridge.|$|E

25|$|In many areas, regular {{avalanche}} tracks can {{be identified}} and precautions {{can be taken to}} minimise damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. To mitigate the effect of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure (snow fence) and may be constructed of steel, wood or <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>concrete.</b> They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called avalanche dams stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they {{can also be used to}} channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called snow sheds, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work aims {{to develop an}} optimal design using Finite Element (FE) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods to replace the traditional concrete and timber material by a Synthetic Polyurethane fibre glass composite material in railway sleepers. The conventional timber railway sleeper technology is associated with several technical problems related to its durability and ability to resist cutting and abrading action of the bearing plate. The use of <b>pre-stress</b> <b>concrete</b> sleeper in railway industry has many disadvantages related to the concrete material behaviour to resist dynamic stress {{that may lead to}} a significant mechanical damage with feasible fissures and cracks. Scientific researchers have recently developed a new composite material such as Glass Fibre Reinforced Polyurethane (GFRP) foam to replace the conventional one. The mechanical properties of these materials are reliable enough to help solving structural problems such as durability, light weight, long life span (50 - 60 years), less water absorption, provide electric insulation, excellent resistance of fatigue and ability to recycle. This paper suggests appropriate sleeper design to reduce the volume of the material. The design optimization shows that the sleeper length is more sensitive to the loading type than the other parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} in {{reinforced}} concrete bridges leads to costly maintenance and repairs. As a result, {{the application of}} FRP materials {{as an alternative to}} steel has developed increasing interest in the last decade. This {{can be attributed to the}} FRP’s potential to be utilised within sustainable infrastructure as a lightweight, non-corrosive material with high tensile strength. A perceived issue regarding the use of FRP bars is the lower elastic modulus despite the higher tensile strength in comparison to conventional reinforcing steel resulting in greater deflections of beams under similar loading. A solution is to <b>pre-stress</b> <b>concrete</b> beams to reduce deflections. Basalt Fibre Reinforced Polymer (BFRP) is an alternative to E-Glass or Aramid FRP. This report details an experimental investigation into the behaviour of <b>concrete</b> beams <b>pre-stressed</b> with BFRP bars and describes the development of a pre-stressing method. Beams were subjected to four-point flexural testing under load control conditions with the SLS and ULS behaviour observed and compared with reinforced beams under no pre-stress. Furthermore, BFRP was cast in self-compacting concrete (5 CC) using waste material to partially replace Portland cement thus providing a durable, homogenous, low carbon alternative. Test variables considered include the pre-stress material and beams with and without pre-stress. This research is part of a FP 7 EiroCrete project with the aim to develop zero maintenance, low energy solutions to reduce the long-term costs associated with infrastructure projects...|$|R
500|$|Station {{reconstruction}} {{to accommodate}} the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure {{to be used as}} exits with The lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for {{five and a half years}} (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the [...] "umbrella" [...] covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3ft diameter concrete foundations, sunk from 43 up to 73ft deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>concrete</b> raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a pilot tunnel Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line lift shaft. A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the bottom of the shaft. With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} {{procedures for}} the estimation of the reliability of land-based structures as they deteriorate with time, such as resulting from fatigue and corrosion, including depth of pitting. Many forms of deterioration are influenced by environmental conditions. Materials of interest include structural steels, reinforced and <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>concretes,</b> masonry and stone, timber and, to a small extent, various fibre-reinforced plastics. Typically the likely 'design life' is of interest. As most structures consist of multiple components (or members) interaction between members must be considered, although many structures can be idealized as 'series' systems. The theory for this is outlined and solution techniques such as Monte Carlo analysis and importance sampling are also outlined. This includes situations with multiple loading systems, for which extreme value representations for loads are not appropriate since the occurrence of the maximum of one load is unlikely {{to coincide with the}} occurrence of the maximum of another load. The so-called Turkstra's rule is a convenient but simplified approach in this case. When the resistance of the structural system is time-dependent, and more than one stochastic load is applied, outcrossing theory must be applied and the 'outcrossing rate' v(t) estimated. This may be a function of time and thus enable consideration of deteriorating structural systems. Some recent efforts for this in the literature are reviewed...|$|R
