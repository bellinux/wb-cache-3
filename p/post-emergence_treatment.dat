40|$|Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocapsules {{have been}} used as a carrier system for the {{herbicide}} atrazine, which is commonly applied to maize. We demonstrated previously that these atrazine containing polymeric nanocapsules were ten-fold more effective in the control of mustard plants (a target species), as compared to a commercial atrazine formulation. Since atrazine can have adverse effects on non-target crops, here we analyzed the effect of encapsulated atrazine on growth, physiological and oxidative stress parameters of soil-grown maize plants (Zea mays L.). One day after the <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> with PCL nanocapsules containing atrazine (1 mg mL- 1), maize plants presented 15 and 21 % decreases in maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and in net CO 2 assimilation rate, respectively, as compared to water-sprayed plants. The same treatment led to a 1. 8 -fold increase in leaf lipid peroxidation in comparison with control plants. However, all of these parameters were unaffected four and eight days after the application of encapsulated atrazine. These results suggested that the negative effects of atrazine were transient, probably due to the ability of maize plants to detoxify the herbicide. When encapsulated atrazine was applied at a ten-fold lower concentration (0. 1 mg mL- 1), a dosage that is still effective for weed control, no effects were detected even shortly after application. Regardless of the herbicide concentration, neither pre- nor <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> with the PCL nanocapsules carrying atrazine resulted in the development of any macroscopic symptoms in maize leaves, and there were no impacts on shoot growth. Additionally, no effects were observed when plants were sprayed with PCL nanocapsules without atrazine. Overall, these results suggested that the use of PCL nanocapsules containing atrazine did not lead to persistent side effects in maize plants, and that the technique could offer a safe tool for weed control without affecting crop growth...|$|E

Hand weeded and weedy plots were kept for comparison of yield and economic gains. Most of the herbicides applied and hand weeded plots controlled the weeds density per unit area by 19 and 100 % and significantly increased grain yield by 9 to 113 % (440 kg/ha to 936 kg/ha).

The effects of the different treatments on soil water content, soil temperature, and weed control in beans and corn were investigated. The effect of cultivation on the degree of root rot infection and the effect of different planting dates were also investigated in the bean study. The pre-emergence treatment (ridged just before the plants emerge) produced a 48 percent greater bean yield and a 40 percent greater corn yield than the control treatment (no cultivation). The planting-ridge treatment (ridged at planting time) produced 21 percent greater bean yield than the control treatment. The <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> (cultivated after the plants emerged) yielded 10 percent more beans and 20 percent more corn than the control treatment. The second and third planting dates produced 16 and 42 percent, respectively, greater bean yields than the first planting date.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in short-rotation poplar plantations for biomass production and cropping techniques and weed control strategies are being developed. Slow initial poplar growth can favour weed infestation and so {{there is a need for}} appropriate timing of weed control, based on an understanding of the competitive relationship and dynamics between poplar and weeds. A field experiment with annual and biennial crop cycles was conducted over two years. A 35 cm wide within-row weedy strip was allowed to develop as the basis for competition. Yield data were fitted with sigmoidal equations, in order to find the critical point (CP) and critical period of weed control (CPWC), using thermal time as the independent variable. Results showed that poplar is very sensitive to weed competition, especially in the first growing season after planting or cutting, and that competition can cause important yield losses. In the annual cycle, the CP corresponds to a yield loss of 26 % and 8 % in the first and second growing season respectively; in the biennial cycle the CP corresponds to a yield loss of 29 %. Furthermore, the CPWC is long. For example, in the first year, based on a 5 % yield loss, it lasts from 30 to 84 days after planting. This makes effective weed control difficult to achieve only using a pre-emergence herbicide, and thus necessitates a <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatment,</b> either with herbicides or inter-row cultivation. These results, together with the inability of the crop to recover from damage, mean that resources must be invested in weed control soon after the beginning of the cropping cycl...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out over 2 years (2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004) on a private farm in the Alentejo (Évora), in the South of Portugal where rainfed wheat is sown after the {{beginning}} of the winter rainfall season. A no-till wheat crop was used as this technology provides the necessary soil bearing capacity for the post-emergence application at different weed development stages. A mixture of diclofop-methyl+fenoxaprop-p-ethyl+mefenepir-diethyl was used at three doses on two timings with three different application volumes. The results indicate that lower herbicide concentrations using higher water application volumes decreased weed control efficiency at both weed development stages. For every treatment, the first weed development stage (beginning of tillering) provided a higher crop grain yield. At this stage, both weeds and crop are more sensitive to the herbicide and as consequence the higher weed control efficiency was not reflected in a higher grain yield, due to some crop fitotoxicity caused by the herbicide when its concentration increased. Weed reinfestation was low for both application timings, indicating that lower herbicide doses than the recommended ones (2. 5 – 31 ha− 1) or those normally used by the Portuguese farmers (21 ha− 1) can be used for a satisfactory control of Lolium rigidum G.

40|$|In recent years, soybean acreage has {{increased}} significantly in western Canada. One {{of the challenges}} associated with growing soybean in western Canada is the control of volunteer glyphosate resistant (GR) canola, as the majority of soybean cultivars are also glyphosate resistant. The objectives of this thesis were (1) to determine the most effective combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicides to control volunteer GR canola in GR soybean; and (2) to determine the optimal soybean seeding rate and seeding date for soybean in western Canada to compete with volunteer canola, while still being economically feasible for producers. Experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at three sites in Saskatchewan and one site in Manitoba. In the herbicide study, treatments consisted of combinations of one of three different pre-emergence herbicide treatments (2, 4 -D, tribenuron and saflufenacil) and five different <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatments</b> (bentazon, imazamox+bentazon, cloransulam, thifensulfuron and fomesafen), {{as well as a}} glyphosate-only check. Treatments containing 2, 4 -D pre-emergence, thifensulfuron post-emergence or fomesafen post-emergence caused crop injury, while the remaining treatment combinations provided excellent volunteer canola control and low crop injury, with similar soybean yield results. The optimal combinations were tribenuron+imazamox+bentazon and saflufenacil+imazamox+ bentazon, as they contain the most herbicide groups, and therefore should be most effective at delaying herbicide resistance. In the cultural control study, soybean was seeded at five different seeding rates (targeted 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 plants m- 2) at three seeding dates (targeted mid-May, late May and early June). Soybean yield consistently increased with higher seeding rates, while volunteer canola biomass decreased, however seeding date results were inconsistent across site-years.

[14 C]Pronamide was applied as a sunflower seed treatment by coating or soaking. Herbicide absorption was affected by method of seed treatment, but not the subsequent pattern of herbicide distribution within the sunflower plant. Herbicide absorption by the seed was 9. 8 and 3. 4 %, respectively. The translocation of the radioactive herbicide from the treated seed {{to the rest of}} the plant was greater for the coating than for the soaking treatment, regardless of the presence or absence of parasitic plants. The leaves were the sunflower component in which larger amount of [14 C]pronamide was detected, reaching up to 3. 24 and 2. 45 % for the coating application and the non-infested and infested sunflower, respectively. Translocation of the herbicide from the root system of the host plant to the parasitic plant was 0. 61 and 0. 21 % for the coating and soaking treatments, respectively, in infested sunflower. [14 C]Glyphosate and [14 C]imazapyr were applied as a <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> to sunflower, whether it was parasitized by O. cumana or not. Glyphosate translocation within the host plant did not differ between O. cumana-infested and non-infested plants and most of the radioactivity remained in the treated leaf. Translocation of [14 C]glyphosate to O. cumana reached 5. 5 % at 3 DAT. The absorption of [14 C]imazapyr by the treated leaf was greater than [14 C]glyphosate absorption at 1 DAT. Similarly, higher levels of imazapyr were accumulated by O. cumana from the treated leaf. The metabolism study of [14 C]imazapyr showed a constant presence of imazapyr in the treated leaf at 16 %, but in O. cumana the parent compound was 51. 4 % of the total recovered radioactivity 6 DAT. The deposit of imazapyr in O. cumana and the low metabolism in this species may explain the control of O. cumana by this herbicide. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In {{previous}} research, bromacil gave {{good performance}} {{when it was}} applied in early fall with fairly dry soil conditions and before the fall germinating weeds had started growth. On the other hand, if bromacil was applied in late November, December, or January on nearly saturated soil with weeds that had grown {{for one or two}} months, weed control was quite noticeably reduced. Field and greenhouse studies were conducted at Corvallis, Oregon, to determine the influence of soil moisture and time of herbicide application on bromacil movement and performance. In one field trial, two or six acre-inches of water were applied by sprinkler irrigation at intervals following herbicide treatment. Intervals used were one day, two, four, or eight weeks following herbicide application on dry soil. Field bioassay with rape, wheat, oats, annual bluegrass, sugar beets, and winter field peas indicated that the performance of bromacil applied to dry soil was not affected by differences in irrigation levels or by the time interval between application and irrigation. Bioassay of core segments taken from the top six inches of soil showed no difference due to treatment and indicated that bromacil was not leached below three inches regardless of irrigation treatment. Of the bromacil found in the top three inches, approximately half of it was in the 0 - 1 inch segment. Difficulty in duplicating fall conditions appeared to have a definite effect on results of field studies. Extensive loss of soil moisture due to evaporation was probably the main factor causing deviation from the desired conditions. Another field trial included 0 -, 1. 5 -, 3 -, and 6 -inch sprinkler irrigation rates on an annual bluegrass stand which had been treated with either pre- or post-emergence applications of bromacil. Irrigations were applied immediately after the <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatment.</b> Both pre- and post-emergence applications of bromacil gave good control of annual bluegrass regardless of subsequent post-emergence irrigation. However, total precipitation during the first month was only 0. 25 inches and where there was no irrigation, bromacil did not give adequate control. Greenhouse leaching studies with soil columns did not give satisfactory results. Consistent patterns of leaching throughout replications could not be accomplished. When bromacil movement was determined by the use of soil columns and subirrigation with 1. 5 inches of water, {{there was no difference in}} movement whether it was applied to water-saturated or dry soil. A preliminary experiment with a shorter subirrigation period, however, resulted in less movement of the bromacil applied to dry soil. Bromacil movement in soil by subirrigation is not the same as leaching downward.

40|$|The {{rolling harrow}} was {{developed}} and patented at the MAMA of DAGA of the University of Pisa during 2003 and 2004. The new harrow is equipped with spike discs placed at the front and gage rolls mounted at the rear. The spike discs and gage rolls are each placed on horizontal axles and are connected to one another by a chain drive with a ratio equal to 2. Thus, the rolls work with a peripheral speed {{twice as high as}} that of the discs. The discs and the rolls can be placed differently on the axles: (1) close arrangement in order to make non-selective pre-emergence mechanical weed control (false seedbed technique); (2) spaced arrangement with the aim to make selective post-emergence inter-row weeding. The action of the rolling harrow is characterised by the passage of the spike discs (that till the top 3 - 4 cm of the soil) followed by the passage of the gage rolls that work at a higher peripheral speed whereby the 1 - 2 cm top soil is tilled and crumbled. Thus, it is possible to kill those weed seedlings that are included and protected by small lumps that are normally left on the soil after common mechanical weed control on crusty wet and plastic soils. The machine was tested in some organic vegetable crops with very good results. The working width can be varied from 1 m and up to 18 m for pre-emergence control. For <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatments,</b> the implement can be adjusted to different inter-row width ranging from 15 cm and up to 90 cm.

Oilseed rape, pea, broad bean, Senecio vulgaris, Veronica persica, Lolium renne, Poa annua, Poa trivialis and prates were severely a ed 5 y pre-emergence and post-emergence applications of triasulfuron but wheat and barley were much more resistant. The development of injury symptoms was generally slow and was characterized by an initial growth retardation followed by chlorosis and necrosis with death occuring 3 - 4 weeks after application. The herbicide had a flat dose-response curve throughout the investigations. Wheat and barley showed greater tolerance to post-emergence than to pre-emergence applications. Pre-emergence applications of triasulfuron reduced tiller numbers in barley and wheat but application of the herbicide at the 2 - 3 leaf stage stimulated the outgrowth of tiller buds but this effect was temporary and was {{not the result of}} visible physical damage to the shoot meristem. There was no intra-specific variability between cultivars of wheat and barley. Grain yield and other yield components of spring barley were not affected by <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatments</b> of triasulfuron. Triasulfuron had high activity through the soil and both the roots and subterranean shoots of developing seedlings absorbed the herbicide from the soil. The bioactivity and mobility of the herbicide down the soil profile was inversely related to the organic matter content of the soil. The amount and frequency of rainfall directly influenced the rate of leaching of the herbicide down the soil profile. Comparisons of the rates of disappearance of triasulfuron in autoclaved and non-autoclaved soils suggested the involvement of a biglogical degragation pathway. Triasulfuron disappeared faster at 30 C than at 10 C and higher moisture levels enhanced the rate of breakdown. Studies on the mode of action of triasulfuron indicated that the herbicide acts by inhibiting cell division in susceptible plants. Evidence suggested that the inhibition occurred during interphase rather than during the mitotic sequence. The addition of a 1 : 1 mixture of isoleucine and valine to the treatment solution prevented the inhibition of cell division at the root tips of broad bean...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years only a few new action {{mechanisms}} have been introduced in the chemical weed control sector. Consequently, when product innovation slows down, process innovation becomes the only possible solution to reduce dependence on chemical herbicides. To rationalize weed control is a priority in this process. Developing and spreading via the Internet a DSS that can advise farmers about weed management, suggesting the correct timing and appropriate mixture of active ingredients for each situation, may represent a key step for this. The combination of two existing models, GESTINF and AlertInf, makes possible the realization of this complete DSS. GESTINF is an existing DSS that evaluates the cost effectiveness of weed control, providing users with a ranking of possible technical alternatives, i. e. herbicide mixtures, according to their specific economic return and the environmental risk of ground and surface water contamination by leaching and runoff. AlertInf has recently been created to predict weed emergence dynamics of several weeds in maize fields. AlertInf provides the percentage of emergence reached by a given weed species in real time using meteorological data, such as soil temperature and soil water potential. The major cause of poor post-emergence weed control is improper application timing, which can be either too early or too late. AlertInf, estimating daily the percentage of weeds that have already emerged and the successive seedling emergence dynamics, allows to make appropriate evaluation on the timing for post-emergence applications to achieve efficient weed control. The two models are integrated in a unified DSS that is able to indicate to the users the date for the single scouting {{to be carried out}} in the field to know the quali-quantitative characteristics of the infestation and estimate the density of each weed species {{for the rest of the}} season. The predicted daily density of each species is used by the DSS as input without any further survey. The single time survey method for indicating the survey date and estimating the density for the rest of the season, uses the cumulated emergence estimated by AlertInf; the method is described in Masin et al. (2011). The DSS gives indications on <b>post-emergence</b> <b>treatments</b> in traditional tillage maize and soybean and no-tillage maize in terms of herbicide to use ranked according to economic net return. The output of the combined DSS is a more complete information about if, when and how control weeds in their specific situation. This combination of models has the objective to overcome the constraints that have so far hindered the use of DSS, such as GESTINF, by farmers. Furthermore the combined DSS available on-line should encourage farmers to adopt the criteria and methods of IWM...|$|R

The results obtained have allowed to affirm the cassava plants (cultivar IAC- 12), exhibited changes in leaf anatomy in response to herbicide application even on cassava leaves without no visual toxicity symptoms. The products caused alterations both in tissue thickness as in tissue proportion in the leaf blade. For the fluazifop, a eudicotyledonous selective herbicide, changes were observed in tissue thickness and proportion of leaf blade, even without any visual toxicity detected. Cassava plants (IAC- 12), showed structural changes in leaf anatomy in response to application of herbicides. The leaf anatomy of cassava cv. IAC- 12, can be used to indicate the herbicide effect on cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz. cv. IAC- 12) plants...|$|R

A split-factor design was used with tillage (conventional and strip tillage) as the main plot and herbicide treatments (bromoxynil, DCPA, oxyfluorfen, and pendimethalin) as sub-plots. Neither tillage nor herbicide treatments affected onion stand counts. Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album) densities were lower in strip tillage compared to conventional tillage up to {{three weeks after the}} post-emergence applied herbicides. In general, micro-rate <b>post-emergence</b> herbicide <b>treatments</b> provided greater early-season broadleaf weed control than pre-emergence herbicide treatments. Onion yield and grade did not differ among herbicide treatments because the mid-season herbicide application provided sufficient control/suppression of the early-season weed escapes that these initial weed escapes did not impact onion yield or bulb diameter. In 2007, onion in the strip tillage treatment were larger in diameter resulting in greater total and marketable yields compared to conventional tillage. Marketable onion yield was 82. 1 Mg ha− 1 in strip tillage and 64. 9 Mg ha− 1 in conventional tillage. Results indicate that strip tillage use in direct-seeded onion production was beneficial, especially when growing conditions were conducive to higher yields and that the use of strip tillage in onion may provide an alternative to using a companion crop as it did not interfere with either early-season weed management system...|$|R

A LiDAR-based detection procedure was tested for characterisation of the weed vegetation present in the inter-row area of a maize field. This procedure was based on the hypothesis that weed species with different heights can be precisely detected and discriminated using non-contact ranging sensors such as LiDAR. The sensor was placed in the front of an all-terrain vehicle, scanning downwards in a vertical plane, perpendicular to the ground, in order to detect the profile of the vegetation (crop and weeds) above the ground. Measurements were taken on a maize field on 3 m wide (0. 45 m 2) plots at the time of <b>post-emergence</b> herbicide <b>treatments.</b> Four replications were assessed {{for each of the four}} major weed species: Sorghum halepense, Cyperus rotundus, Datura ferox and Xanthium strumarium. The sensor readings were correlated with actual, manually determined, height values (r 2 = 0. 88). With canonical discriminant analysis the high capabilities of the system to discriminate tall weeds (S. halepense) from shorter ones were quantified. The classification table showed 77. 7 % of the original grouped cases (i. e., 4800 sampling units) correctly classified for S. halepense. These results indicate that LiDAR sensors are a promising tool for weed detection and discrimination, presenting significant advantages over other types of non-contact ranging sensors such as a higher sampling resolution and its ability to scan at high sampling rates.

40|$|The Clearfield® {{production}} system for winter oilseed rape is now registered in France and a introduction for Germany is planned. In this {{production system}}, imidazolinone herbicides are used. These herbicides {{belong to the}} same mode of action (HRAC group B) as the active ingredient triflusulfuron-methyl in the herbicide Debut®. Therefore, a reduced efficacy of this active ingredient for the control of Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape is expected. Today non-Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape in sugar beets is effectively controlled with triflusufuronmethyl. Due to the fact that oilseed rape and sugar beet are increasingly cultivated in the same crop rotation, Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape could be expected in future sugar beet crop rotations. To determine the performance of different herbicide treatments for a sufficient control of Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape in sugar beet, in 2010 and 2011 14 field-trials were conducted in four countries, Germany, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. These trials had been set up in a two way split-plot design with non-Clearfield®-rape and Clearfield® oilseed rape. The effects of ten treatments with different herbicides and application dates were tested. The results of both years showed large differences in the herbicide efficacy among the herbicide treatments. Pre-emergence application led to insufficient results in both years on both cultivars. Applied <b>post-emergence,</b> the herbicide <b>treatment</b> with Debut® (triflusulfuron-methyl) controlled non-Clearfield® volunteer rape considerable better, than the Clearfield® volunteer rape.

40|$|Thiencarbazone-methyl {{is a new}} {{herbicide}} for {{the selective}} control of grasses and broadleaf weeds primarily in corn. The active ingredient belongs to the chemical class of sulfonly-amino-carbonyl-triazolinones (SACT) and acts as an inhibitor of the ALS-enzyme. The compound offers cross spectrum activity against grasses and broadleaf weeds and can be applied at the pre-emergence and the post-emergence timing. The use rate depends on the application timing and may vary from 22 – 45 g a. i. /ha in pre-emergence applications and 10 – 15 g a. i. /ha in <b>post-emergence</b> applications. Sequential <b>treatments</b> are possible {{as long as the}} maximum seasonal dose of 45 g a. i. /ha is not exceeded. In commercial corn herbicides, TCM is always combined with safener technology such as the novel safener cyprosulfamide and with other herbicidal active ingredients. In pre-emergence applications, the primary herbicidal mixpartner is isoxaflutole. In herbicides designed for postemergence use, TCM is co-formulated with foramsulfuron, iodosulfuron or tembotrione. The commercial herbicides composed of TCM and CSA plus sulfonylurea or triketone partners have demonstrated high weed control success in conventional and herbicide-tolerant corn production systems. Depending on the product, the potential for one pass weed control has been confirmed. Control of perennial grasses like Sorghum halapense and Elymus repens together with control of problem weeds like Polygonum convolvulus and suppression of Cirsium arvense and Convolvulus arvensis appear to be among the most attractive features of TCM-based herbicides under European conditions. High crop tolerance of herbicides combining two or three highly active ingredients in one commercial product is ensured by the novel safener cyprosulfamide which can protect corn via root uptake and via leaf uptake from herbicide damage...|$|R

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Kevin W. Bradley. Due {{to the increase in}} glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds, two agrochemical companies have developed soybeans with resistance to 2, 4 -D and dicamba in an effort to provide growers with new options for the control of problematic GR species. Due to the high sensitivity of non-transformed soybeans that may be grown in close proximity to 2, 4 -D- or dicamba-resistant crops, there is increasing concern about the potential for off-target movement of these herbicides through drift, volatility, and/or tank contamination. Traditionally, applications of fungicides have been made to corn between tasseling (VT) and silking (R 1); however in recent years some pesticide manufacturers have promoted early-season fungicide coapplications with <b>post-emergence</b> (POST) herbicide <b>treatments.</b> Corn is also a nitrogen-demanding crop, where nitrogen uptake is often limited due to soil characteristics and environmental factors. The ability to co-apply agrochemicals allows growers the option of combining desirable products with a POST herbicide application at no additional application cost. The objectives of this research are to: 1) compare the relative soybean phytotoxicity of eight synthetic auxin herbicides to one another and 2) determine the effects of V 5 herbicide, fungicide, and/or slow-release N co-applications on corn injury and yield. Results from these experiments suggest significant yield reductions can occur if proper application methods are not followed when applying synthetic auxin herbicides. Also, the addition of a fungicide and/or slow-release N fertilizer at V 5 is not likely to increase corn grain yields in comparison to an herbicide treatment alone.

It was used and tested {{in several of the}} CURE trials and officially released as RD 33 on March 6, 2007. For crop management practices, improved establishment and weed control methods were evaluated in a minimum of eight farmers' fields per key site with participation of farmers and agricultural development workers. Participatory experiments were conducted on five upper and five lower fields in Phimai District {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} pre-emergence and <b>post-emergence</b> herbicides <b>treatments</b> in direct-seeded crops relative to water level fluctuations on weed pressure. The second activity evaluated farmers' usual weed management to plots that were clean weeded by hand. The third activity tested a rice-mungbean intercrop system with six farmers, as farmers had indicated an interest in this practice. Weed pressure reduced yields by an average 0. 6 t/ha in direct-sown fields relative to cleanly weed crops. Complete weed control resulted in a 25 - 30 percent yield increase in direct-seeded crops. For nutrient management, improved nutrient management methods that take into account water status and pest risk were evaluated in a minimum of eight fields per key site with participation of farmers and extension workers. The observed farmers' practice of using fertilizers, which may be as much as 85 percent below the current recommended rates, was highly field-specific and cost-efficient, and maintained system productivity. Participatory experiments evaluating fertilizer treatments were conducted on 10 farms at the Roi Et site. The results showed that farmers' low fertilizer rates are as productive but often more profitable than recommended doses for traditional-type varieties like RD 6, RD 15, and KDML 105, which can yield up to 4. 0 t/ ha only under favorable conditions of standing water (usually occurring in lower fields) and in soils with a clay content greater than 5 percent. On-farm trials verified the effectiveness of farmers' practice of applying low N rates on N-use efficiency in tests on eight fields each in upper and lower terraces in Roi Et Province. In general, the tests showed that small rates of fertilizer (20 - 8. 7 - 8. 3 NPK/ha) could get as good results as medium rates (40 - 8. 7 - 8. 3 NPK/ha). But the amount of improvement on crop growth and yield depended on the field position in the toposequence. On upper terraces, the tests showed that fertilizer could significantly improve crop growth and grain yield, but the amount of improvement diminished quickly as higher rates were applied. A doubled rate of N brought about only a slight improvement of crop growth and yield. On lower terraces, even low fertilizer rates (20 - 8. 7 - 8. 3 NPK/ha) could only slightly improve crop growth and yield, and a doubled N rate (40 - 8. 7 - 8. 3 NPK/ha) did not increase yields significantly.

Here, we present a retro-observation approach based on lake sediment record to monitor micropollutants and to evaluate the long term impact of pesticides treatments on a vineyard catchment in Savoie (France). In this study, we combined sedimentological and geochemical analyses to reconstruct {{the recent history of}} wine practices. The sediment sequence chronology, based on short-live radionuclides (210 Pb/ 137 Cs), provides a well constrain continuous age-depth relationship covering to the last century. Over this period, we reconstruct the succession of fungicides, insecticides and herbicides in relation to the appearance of new chemical substances and the banning of old ones. The first use of fungicide began {{at the end of the}} 19 th century with the Bordeaux mixture (Cu). After the World War II, we observed an intensification of fungicides treatment against mildew, powdery mildew, Botrytis fungi and black rot with specific molecules succession. Insecticides used in vineyard treatment against tetranychid and eriophyid mites were observed since 1940 with a main increase in 1970. Dicofol, Bromopropylate, Bifenthrin succeed to DDT banning in 1972, but a secondary source of DDT appeared at the early of 90 's. The first herbicides use was observed between 1960 and 1970 with the presence of Triazine metabolite (pre-emergence herbicide) and high value of AMPA (Glyphosate metabolite, Roundup®), used as post-emergence herbicide, were found since 1990. Two sedimentation rate increases in 1973 and 1994 could be directly assigned to wine practices.
