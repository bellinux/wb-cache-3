Our approach extends traditional models by allowing for nonlinearities in input variables and unobserved individual heterogeneity with possible temporal dependence. This permits us to develop nonlinear {{models for the}} assessment of individual risks in the presence of moral hazard and adverse selection. In practice, these phenomena are confronted by banks and insurance companies in their basic activities of fund supply and loss coverage.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two aspects}} of {{insurance}} theory. Essays I, II and III deal with the ownership structure in the insurance industry. Essays IV and V deal {{with the effects of}} background risks on an individual’s insurance decision against a given risk. Essay I uses game theory to analyze mutual contracts. Whether or not there are <b>pure</b> risk <b>premiums</b> is assumed to distinguish mutual contracts from insurance contracts. It is found that the mutual game with the absence of <b>pure</b> risk <b>premiums</b> has a nonempty core. Thus, stable mutual sharing is possible. However, the Pareto-efficient allocation may not be in the core, as opposed to the insurance game in which the Pareto can be in the core. In Essay II, a bargaining model is used to study how individuals in a mutual society design mutual contracts in order to share their risks. It is found that, 1) there is a general consistence between the mutual and insurance contracts: The same risk premium is required against the same risk and the high-risks are required to pay higher risk premiums than the low-risks; 2) There are situations where the mutual contract requires only an assessment of the relative value of the probabilities of losses, which shows an advantage of the mutual contract over the insurance contract because the insurance contract generally requires an assessment of th...|$|R

40|$|I A {{diminishing}} {{number of}} Reinsurers till {{seem to work}} with percentage loadings which are applied with more or less sophistica-tion to the <b>pure</b> risk <b>premium</b> rate. A more sensible approach is to study {{the distribution of the}} total claims amount of the layer reinsured (standard eviation, variance, skewness). In practice this distribution is not known and we have to work with estimates E * and ~, 2 of the first moment which is the <b>pure</b> risk <b>premium</b> (E) and of the second central moment (~). Because of the positive skewness of the distribution, E * will fall below E in {{more than half of the}} cases and sometimes considerably below. 2 One security loading principle could be to add a proportion k of ~ * to E * in such a way that Prob. [E * + ka *> E] = I [...] ~. If ~ is put equal to 0. 25 this reflects our wish to ensure that our security loaded rates are too low only in 25 % of the cases. A e-loading here emerges as a result of the statistical uncertainty. 3 If we analyse the result fluctuations we are led to apply a variance loading (I), which can be interpreted as a price for capacity (2).
