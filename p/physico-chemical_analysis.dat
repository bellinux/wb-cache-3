40|$|Problem statement: The {{underground}} {{waters in}} the oriental regions of the Algerian Sahara, present real chemical quality problems. Their content in fluorides always exceeds the limit of the recommended levels. That is 0. 8 mg L - 1, according to the maximum temperature in the region. Combined to a high salinity, it affects {{the health of the}} population living around the region. The present work, deals with the presence of fluoride and the geochemical origin in the Complex Terminal aquifer of Ouargla, rarely examined in the Algerian Sahara. Approach: Is based on the following aspects: Sampling and <b>physico-chemicals</b> <b>analysis</b> of water, statistical treatment of the physico-chemical water parameters and simulation to natural and isotherm 25 °C evaporation of water parameters. Results: The results show the presence of fluoride in the studied water. The rates vary between 1 and 2 mg L - 1. The calculation of water saturation index in relation with the preponderant minerals, using the thermodynamic model phreeqci reveals a sensitivity of carbonate minerals towards precipitation and dissolution of evaporitic minerals and clayey fluorides as well. Conclusions/Recommendations: The increasing alkalinity of water in contact with the aquifer during long periods of stay decreases the chemical activity of calcium and helps with alteration of clayey minerals and fluoride as a necessary condition for a possible fluorite mineralization. Knowing the origin of that fluoridation leads to possible solutions, through the optimization of a water treatment meets the standards...|$|R
