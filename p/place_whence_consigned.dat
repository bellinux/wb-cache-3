5000|$|And slay them {{wherever}} ye find them, {{and drive}} {{them out of}} the <b>places</b> <b>whence</b> they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter... and fight them until fitnah is no more, and religion is for Allah.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well answered," [...] said Godwin, [...] "in {{this ancient}} <b>place,</b> <b>whence</b> so many have journeyed home; all the Romans who are dead, {{when it was}} their fortress, and the Saxons who came after them, and others without count." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{grass was}} growing under it. It had only lain {{there a few}} days. There {{was no sign of}} a <b>place</b> <b>whence</b> it had been taken. It {{corresponds}} with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon." ...|$|R
60|$|Meantime Sir Kay {{had come}} nigh, and finding that Beaumains had {{prepared}} himself, {{he also made}} himself straightway ready for battle. Then Lynette drew her palfrey {{to one side of}} the way and to a <b>place</b> <b>whence</b> she might behold all that befell.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Colcord, [...] "we {{are only}} talking of the Hospital. You will find no more {{interesting}} place anywhere.

60|$|At that Sir Mellegrans was {{overwhelmed}} with amazement, {{and a great}} fear seized upon him and gripped at his vitals.

60|$|The {{following}} morning Marvel and Nerle once more {{set out to}} leave the Kingdom of Spor and its ugly king.

6000|$|The Azhar is {{the grand}} collegiate Mosque of this city,-the Christ Church, in fact, of Cairo,-once celebrated {{throughout}} the world of Al-Islam.
