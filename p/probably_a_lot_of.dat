5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

There is <b>probably</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> propaganda in the inscriptions, but they give a detailed record of the Ming court's efforts to assert suzerainty over the Jurchen.|$|R

50|$|Thalberg also {{realized}} that old stars few had heard of could be made into new ones. Marie Dressler, a fifty-nine-year-old early vaudeville star, was unable to get any roles in films. MGM screenwriter Frances Marion suggested to Thalberg that she might fit well in a starring role for a new film, and was surprised when he knew of her prior successes. Thalberg approved of using her without a screen test and offered his rationale: My theory is that anybody who once hits the bull's-eye—it doesn't matter in what profession—has the brains and stamina to stage a comeback. So I figure that a woman who held the spotlight {{for so many years}} has been the victim of bad writing—and <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bad advice. By 1932, shortly before she died, Dressler was the country's number one box office star.|$|E

50|$|In Norway {{the total}} number of buses is, as of November 2014, well over 500, with well over 350 that are 8900 and a bit over 150 that are 8900LE.

The Volvo 7900 Hybrid has <b>probably</b> taken <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the share that the 8900LE would have had, as full low-floor buses are not generally popular in Norway, but the hybrids are selling quite well due to environmental requirements in the tender competitions.|$|R
