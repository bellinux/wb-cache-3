5000|$|Real ear {{measurement}} (REM, {{also known}} as insitu- or <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> measurement) is the measurement of sound pressure level in a patient's ear canal developed when a hearing aid is worn.

[...] The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and American Academy of Audiology (AAA) recommend real ear measures as the preferred method of verifying the performance of hearing aids.Used by audiologists and other hearing healthcare practitioners in the process of hearing aid fitting, real ear measures are the most reliable and efficient method for assessing the benefit provided by the amplification.

Face-to-face and remote <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> measurements were carried out in 60 hearing aid users (mean age 67 yrs) with uni- or bilateral hearing losses (105 ears tested). The participant and a facilitator were located in a room equipped with a <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> system interfaced to a PC. Desktop videoconferencing and application sharing was used to allow an audiologist in another room to instruct the facilitator and control the equipment via the LAN. There were significant correlations between face-to-face and remote real ear unaided response (REUR), aided response (REAR) and insertion gain (REIG) at seven discrete frequencies from 250 to 6000 Hz.

40|$|Abstract There are {{numerous}} well-documented measurement methods available to evaluate hearing protector attenuation, however, some are flawed or difficult to implement and some can {{and have been}} misused with the erroneous results fostering misleading conclusions. This paper will examine the three most robust methods including the “gold standard ” in hearing protector attenuation measurements, namely real-ear attenuation at threshold. It will {{be compared to the}} most useful alternatives such as microphone in real ear, including the use of <b>probe</b> <b>microphones,</b> imbedded microphones, and miniature microphones, and to measurements using acoustical test fixtures, also called blockheads. Examples of the latter include the ANSI- and ISO-specified blockheads, KEMAR, and others. Illustrative data will be provided to guide the user in the application of such techniques and tools, and to point out errors to avoid. None of the three methods is entirely “accurate, ” all being plagued by various experimental artifacts. However, REAT has been thoroughly “road tested ” and standardized around the world, and {{has been shown to be}} the most accurate at estimating the performance for a defined group of subjects under a given set of conditions. 1...|$|R
50|$|Listening {{through air}} ducts {{is a time}} honored method of {{eavesdropping}} since almost all modern rooms have supply ducts that connect to a multiplicity of rooms. Ducts can be effective speaking tubes; the speech attenuation is particularly weak in unlined metal ducts. In some cases, exhaust ducts will connect to uncontrolled spaces. Surveillance {{can be accomplished by}} direct listening or with <b>probe</b> <b>microphones</b> or vibration devices within the duct where they are not visible for inspection. Vibration sound maskers, appropriately located at room perimeters, are attached directly to metallic duct walls and use the duct wall as the masking speaker. The figure on the right shows the masking of conversations in the duct afforded by a vibration masker at the room wall. External speaker maskers must be used at appropriate positions to radiate sound into fiberglass ducts to provide the same protection.|$|R

An MLS burst-augmented excitation signal is presented to compensate for unpredictable delay added in sound-acquisition software that lacks the capability of synchronized record/playback. The HRTF measurements obtained with an external <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> are compared with those obtained with the standard in-ear microphones that the KEMAR is equipped with, to reveal that care should be taken to select a <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> that has a low susceptibility to multipath interference.

40|$|The {{absolute}} measurement of acoustic particle velocity using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) provides {{the basis for}} a method of microphone calibration. In this thesis, after the current standardized calibration method (called reciprocity) is explained, the application of LDA to the determination of sound pressure acting on a microphone is discussed. From a measurement of the output voltage for a given sound pressure, the sensitivity of the microphone can be calculated. In LDA, there are two different techniques for detecting and analysing the Doppler signal generated by acoustic particle motion: continuous detection followed by frequency or time domain analysis, and photon correlation. After a brief discussion of the theory of both methods, their application to measurements within a standing-wave tube is investigated. Velocity measurements extracted from Doppler signals are used to derive values of sound pressure, which are compared with <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> measurements. The continuous detection and photon correlation LDA systems are used to measure particle velocity amplitude in a standing wave for frequencies between 660 Hz and 4 kHz and velocities between 1 mms⁻¹ and 18 mms⁻¹. LDA is applied to the measurement of microphone sensitivity. The frequency response of the <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> is characterized relative to the response of a reference microphone. From the frequency response information, the output voltage of the <b>probe</b> <b>microphone,</b> and the LDA derived sound pressure in a standing wave the sensitivity of the reference microphone is established. Using the continuous detection system, the microphone sensitivity is measured to within ± 0. 1 dB of the sensitivity obtained by reciprocity calibration for frequencies between 660 Hz and 2 kHz. Using the photon correlation system, the sensitivity is measured to within ± 0. 2 dB for the same frequency range. Initial measurements were performed in a free field environment, using the photon correlation system, to demonstrate the potential for further development of the LDA calibration technique...|$|E

A miniature <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> was used {{along with a}} reference microphone to determine the amplitude and phase of the sound pressure near and in the high speed flow field. The transverse structure of the unsteady pressure field was investigated by moving the <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> sufficiently far into the jet so that pressure fall-off was observed. Five islands of high sound pressure level have been distinguished which {{may be associated with}} the actual local sources of sound production. These sources of screech noise are closely associated with the jet shock structure as would be expected, with the peak region of noise level being found slightly downstream of each of the five observed shocks. The third and fourth noise sources have the highest levels and are about equal in strength. All of the apparent noise sources have their peak levels in the subsonic flow region. Strong cancellations in the acoustic field are observed in the downstream and sideline directions which may account for the predominant upstream propagation of the fundamental tone noise...|$|E
40|$|The biophysical {{properties}} of the external ear of the Tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii (Desmarest), have been investigated using <b>probe</b> <b>microphones</b> implanted in the ear canal. An acoustic axis of the pinna exists above 2 kHz which is located close to the horizonal plane for natural ear positions, whereas azimuthal location of the acoustic axis is determined by pinna orientation on the head. The maximum on-axis acoustic pressure gain of the external ear reaches 25 - 30 dB for frequencies near 5 kHz. This results from pressure transformation by the horn-like pinna combined with resonance of the auditory meatus. The directionality of the pinna {{is similar to the}} sound diffraction {{properties of}} a circular aperture with an average radius based on the circumference of the pinna face. These properties determine the acceptance angle of the main lobe containing the acoustic axis and the spatial location of nulls. Large binaural intensity differences, exceeding 30 dB, can be produced by the interaction of peaks and nulls between monaural directivity patterns, depending on the relative position of each pinna...|$|R

40|$|Outside {{of major}} {{metropolitan}} areas, Arizona has limited options for hearing healthcare. The Arizona Affordable Hearing Aid Task Force proposed {{the development of}} a statewide program to provide low-cost hearing aids and audiologic care to low-income residents. The purpose of this review was to determine the status of the literature on the clinical outcomes of teleaudiology services for evaluations and hearing aid fittings which could be used to serve inhabitants of rural counties and address the goals of the Task Force. A literature search was performed to identify articles with original research in teleaudiology in the areas of evaluation and treatment and yielded 234 results. After exclusion criteria were applied, there were 15 articles for review; 10 articles focused on audiological evaluation and 5 articles focused on verification, validation, and counseling for hearing aid fittings. Evaluation-related articles showed that pure-tone air conduction testing was generally within the ± 5 dB acceptable range of variability, with little evidence on bone conduction or speech testing reliability. Studies reporting real-ear measurements with <b>probe</b> <b>microphones</b> were shown to yield similar results in traditional and teleaudiology fitting sessions and validation measures documented similar or better outcomes from teleaudiology fittings.

40|$|The human {{vocal folds}} {{experience}} mechanical stresses during phonation. In particular, the contact {{pressure on the}} vocal fold medial surface is postulated to be one major source of phonotrauma. A knowledge of mechanical stresses within the vocal folds is required. A physical replica of the human vocal folds {{was used as a}} test bed to investigate mechanical stresses within the vocal folds during phonation. The validity of the physical replica was confirmed by comparing phonation onset characteristics obtained using a theoretical model with those from experimental observations through a series of tests. ^ Mechanical stresses within the physical replica were obtained using a tuned FEM model built based on experimental data. The FEM model allowed the extrapolation of deformation data that were not available from the experiment. Detailed stress and strain distributions on model surfaces were obtained. Maximum von Mises stresses were found on the medial and inferior surfaces when no vocal fold collision is involved. The fact that lesions seldom develop on the inferior surface, where von Mises stresses are the largest, suggest that stress states associated with vocal fold collisions play a more important role in lesion development. ^ A <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> was developed for direct contact pressure measurements. Indirect estimations including estimation based on a Hertzian impact model and a well-tuned FEM model were performed. These estimations were compared with the direct measurement data. The estimation based on the Hertzian impact model was found to be a good first cut estimate, although the temporal resolution of the contact pressure data is limited to the camera frame rate. The estimation based on the well-tuned FEM model was able to provide detailed information with high temporal and spatial resolution, but for a rather high computational cost. ^ The <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> was then used for in-vivo measurements of the contact and subglottal/supraglottal acoustic pressures. Contact pressures for breathy, normal and pressed voices were obtained. The overall contact pressure amplitudes were found to be smaller than those reported in previous studies due to the probe size. The <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> was found to be a robust tool for future clinical studies. ...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of cochlear implant electrode insertion on middle-ear low frequency function in humans. Background: Preservation of residual low frequency hearing with addition of electrical speech processing can improve the speech perception abilities and hearing in noise of cochlear implant users. Preservation of low frequency hearing requires an intact middle-ear conductive mechanism in addition to intact inner-ear mechanisms. Little is known about the effect of a cochlear implant electrode on middle-ear function. Methods: Stapes displacement was measured in seven patients undergoing cochlear implantation. Measurements were carried out intra-operatively before and after electrode insertion. Each patient acted as his or her own control. Sound was delivered into the external auditory canal via a speaker and calibrated via a <b>probe</b> <b>microphone.</b> The speaker and <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> were integrated into an individually custom-made ear mould. Ossicular displacement in response to a multisine stimulus at 80 dB SPL was measured at the incudostapedial joint via the posterior tympanotomy, using an operating microscope mounted laser Doppler vibrometry system. Results: Insertion of a cochlear implant electrode into the scala tympani had a variable effect on stapes displacement. In three patients, there was little change in stapes displacement following electrode insertion. In two patients, there was a significant increase, while in a further two there was a significant reduction in stapes displacement. This variability may reflect alteration of cochlear impedance, possibly due to differing loss of perilymph associated with the electrode insertion. Conclusion: Insertion of a cochlear implant electrode produces a change in stapes displacement at low frequencies, which may have an effect on residual low frequency hearing thresholds...|$|E

40|$|When fitting {{hearing aids}} with {{conventional}} earmoulds using real ear measurements (REM) {{it is recommended}} to use the modified pressure with concurrent equalization method whereby a reference microphone is used to monitor the REM loudspeaker output level. The {{review of the literature}} indicates good test-retest reliability for REM using conventional earmoulds. However, in REM using open-fit, another sound field equalization method (the modified pressure with stored equalization method) should be used to minimize any inaccurate measurements resulting from the amplified sound leakage when the open-fit hearing aid is used. In addition the sound is delivered via a generic ear tip rather than a custom made earmould. Therefore, the test-retest reliability for conventional occluded earmould REM cannot be generalized to the open-fit measures. Twenty otologically normal participants were tested to investigate short-term test-retest reliability for open-fit REM, and for conventional earmoulds at both 0 o and 45 o head-to-loudspeaker azimuths by performing repeated measurements at the same participant visit but after removing both the probe tube and the hearing aid and reinserting them. It was found that open-fit REM have good short-term test-retest reliability (mean 1. 57 dB, SD 1. 10 dB) at both azimuths and are in agreement with measured (mean 2. 12 dB, SD 1. 45 dB) and reported (SD ranged from 1 to 3. 2 dB) conventional earmould REM test-retest variability values in the 0. 25 to 4 kHz frequency range (Ringdahl A & Leijon A, 1984, The reliability of insertion gain measurements using <b>probe</b> <b>microphones</b> in the ear canal, Scandinavian Audiology, 13, 173 - 8).

40|$|Abstract: Recently, a {{measurement}} set-up {{was presented to}} detect small nonlinear distortions in the vibration of acoustically driven mechanical systems.

The generated sound pressure is measured with a <b>probe</b> <b>microphone</b> {{in front of the}} test object, and an heterodyne vibrometer measures the corresponding vibration. Due to the high degree of linearity of the heterodyne technique, very small nonlinear distortions can be detected. In this paper the set-up is used to verify whether small nonlinear distortions are present in the vibration of the middle ear system, which is classically considered to be a completely linear system. In vitro measurements on the right ear of an adult male gerbil proved that nonlinear distortions are present in the vibration of the tympanic membrane. Similar results were seen in measurements on the left ear. The influence of post-mortem changes on the nonlinear behaviour of the middle ear was verified in a number of successive measurements.

Acoustic measurements were taken with an axially translating <b>microphone</b> <b>probe,</b> and with a polar <b>microphone</b> <b>probe</b> which was fixed to the propeller nacelle and could take both sideline and circumferential acoustic surveys. Aerodynamic measurements were also made to establish propeller operating conditions. The propeller was run at two setting angles (front angle/rear angle) of 36. 4 / 43. 5 and 41. 1 / 46. 4 degrees, forward rotor tip speeds from 165 to 259 m/sec, rotor spacings from 8. 48 to 14. 99 cm based on pitch change axis separation, and angles of attack to 16 degrees. The aft rotor diameter was 85 percent of the forward rotor diameter to reduce tip vortex-aft rotor interaction as a major interaction noise source. Results are compared with equal diameter F 7 /A 7 data which was previously obtained under similar operating conditions. The aft rotor-alone tone was 7 dB lower for the reduced diameter aft rotor, due to reduced tip speed at constant rpm. Interaction tone levels for the F 7 /A 3 propeller were higher at minimum row spacing and lower at maximum spacing...|$|R
40|$|Shock noise {{associated}} with unheated supersonic jets were investigated using a near field microphone array {{and a single}} sensor wedge shaped hot-film probe. Both over and underexpanded cases were investigated using Mach 1. 5 and 2. 0 convergent-divergent nozzles. Correlation measurements through each shock cell of a single underexpanded case with the Mach 1. 5 nozzle were obtained between the hot-film <b>probe</b> and <b>microphone</b> array. The results show for the Mach number cases selected that the probe's response is primarily sensitive to velocity. The results of the hot-film near field microphone correlations show general agreement with certain theoretical models as to the location for shock noise production, although they demonstrate the existence of some large perhaps turbulent structure that collectively interacts and phases {{the motion of the}} downstream shocks. The near field microphone correlations demonstrate that downstream shocks dominate shock noise production, and suggests the existence of a Doppler effect in near field of the sources. In addition broadband shock noise is found to also propagate at small angles to the jet axis...|$|R
