40|$|Knot rejects {{obtained}} from <b>pulp</b> <b>screening</b> after sulphite pulping {{are difficult to}} dewater, which makes landfilling expensive and burning inefficient. The rejects were found to contain up to 50 % cellulose, which is very susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. Knot rejects were hydrolyzed at 20 % consistency in a laboratory peg mixer with cellulase enzyme. The thick slurry was liquefied within the first hour of mixing and resulted in a glucose concentration of over 100 g/L after 24 hours of reaction. This solution was fermented by yeast to give an ethanol concentration of over 5 %. The laboratory results were confirmed at pilot scale with a mortar mixer (high consistency) or stirred tank reactor (medium consistency) at the 400 L and 6000 L scales, respectively. It was found that washing the knots with ammonia resulted in increased glucose conversion. Enzyme costs could be lowered by separating the enzyme from the hydrolyzed sugars by membrane ultrafiltration and recycling the enzyme to the subsequent batch of substrate. The combination of high-consistency hydrolysis and enzyme recycling minimizes capital investment, energy requirements, and enzyme costs, which are significant factors in the overall economic viability of cellulose conversion to ethanol...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} pulp {{processing}} on softwood fiber properties strongly influence {{the properties of}} wet and dry paper webs. Pulp strength delivery studies have provided observations {{that much of the}} strength potential of long fibered pulp is lost during brown stock fiber line operations where the pulp is merely washed and transferred to the subsequent processing stages. The objective of this work was to study the intrinsic mechanisms which maycause fiber damage in the different unit operations of modern softwood brown stock processing. The work was conducted by studying the effects of industrial machinery on pulp properties with some actions of unit operations simulated in laboratory scale devices under controlled conditions. An optical imaging system was created and used to study the orientation of fibers in the internal flows during pulp fluidization in mixers and the passage of fibers through the screen openings during screening. The qualitative changes in fibers were evaluated with existing and standardized techniques. The results showed that each process stage has its characteristic effects on fiber properties: Pulp washing and mat formation in displacement washers introduced fiber deformations especially if the fibers entering the stage were intact, but it did not decrease the pulp strength properties. However, storage chests and pulp transfer after displacement washers contributed to strength deterioration. <b>Pulp</b> <b>screening</b> proved to be quite gentle, having the potential of slightly evening out fiber deformations from very deformed pulps and vice versa inflicting a marginal increase in the deformation indices if the fibers were previously intact. Pulp mixing in fluidizing industrial mixers did not have detrimental effects on pulp strength and had the potential of slightly evening out the deformations, provided that the intensity of fluidization was high enough to allow fiber orientation with the flow and that the time of mixing was short. The chemical and mechanical actions of oxygen delignification had two distinct effects on pulp properties: chemical treatment clearly reduced pulp strength with and without mechanical treatment, and the mechanical actions of process machinery introduced more conformability to pulp fibers, but did not clearly contribute to a further decrease in pulp strength. The chemical composition of fibers entering the oxygen stage was also found to affect the susceptibility of fibers to damage during oxygen delignification. Fibers with the smallest content of xylan were found to be more prone to irreversibledeformations accompanied with a lower tensile strength of the pulp. Fibers poor in glucomannan exhibited a lower fiber strength while wet after oxygen delignification as compared to the reference pulp. Pulps with the smallest lignin content on the other hand exhibited improved strength properties as compared to the references...|$|E

50|$|Wire {{has many}} uses. It forms the raw {{material}} of many important manufacturers, such as the wire netting industry, engineered springs, wire-cloth making and wire rope spinning, in which it occupies a place analogous to a textile fiber. Wire-cloth of all degrees of strength and fineness of mesh is used for sifting and screening machinery, for draining paper <b>pulp,</b> for window <b>screens,</b> and for many other purposes. Vast quantities of aluminium, copper, nickel and steel wire are employed for telephone and data cables, and as conductors in electric power transmission, and heating. It is in no less demand for fencing, and much is consumed {{in the construction of}} suspension bridges, and cages, etc. In the manufacture of stringed musical instruments and scientific instruments, wire is again largely used. Carbon and stainless spring steel wire have significant applications in engineered springs for critical automotive or industrial manufactured parts/components. Pin and hairpin making; the needle and fish-hook industries; nail, peg, and rivet making; and carding machinery consume large amounts of wire as feedstock.|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus macarthurii {{is a cold}} {{tolerant}} eucalypt which is widely planted on colder, high altitude and low productivity sites in South Africa and is used for pulp and paper production. Currently, <b>screened</b> <b>pulp</b> yield (SPY) is determined using a destructive method, felling of trees that uses wood chips obtained from discs in Kraft pulping. This project was undertaken to design a calibration model {{for the use of}} Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in a non-destructive manner using sawdust to predict SPY. Two series of yield measurements of E. macarthurii revealed that these trees were very uniform in their performance, which complicated the development of a calibration model. Therefore, different data sets were combined to compare the yields using Kraft and NIR spectroscopy. A robust calibration model was created using a large number of E. macarthurii yield values as well as yield values of other eucalypt species. A comparison between Kraft yields and NIR spectroscopy yields revealed a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 93 %, which was validated with a R 2 of 83 %. The model will be used to screen advanced generation of E. macarthurii selections to identify those with the best pulping properties...|$|R
