5|$|The <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> from Little's Sopwith Triplane {{was fitted}} with a clock in its hub by his fellow officers, who {{presented}} it to his widow; she transported it back to Australia in three pieces and it later went {{on display at the}} Australian War Memorial, along with his awards and the wooden cross of his original burial place at Nœux. The Sopwith Pup he flew with No.8 Squadron RNAS, N5182, was rebuilt to flying standard and in October 1976 led a flypast to commemorate the squadron's Diamond Jubilee, before going on permanent display at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon. One of the buildings of the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) in Canberra, opened in 1986, was named in Little's honour.|$|E

25|$|The aircraft, a CASA C-212~C {{registered}} N432CA, was {{put into}} service with Executive Airlines in October 1986 after it was purchased from Prinair. As {{a result of the}} impact of the crash and subsequent fire, the aircraft was destroyed. The aircraft involved in the crash had prior maintenance troubles related to engine torque. In fact, just a day before the accident, issues with the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> angle were addressed by Executive's maintenance department.|$|E
25|$|A USAAF {{search and}} rescue PBY Catalina mission was also mounted, escorted by 12 P-38s. C.202 and C.205s of 51° Stormo, led by Ennio Tarantola, intercepted this flight. The Catalina was taken by {{surprise}} on the surface near the Sardinian coast, having broken a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> in the heavy sea conditions. The Italians also claimed to have downed all 12 P-38s, whereas the Americans claimed three or four victories over the Axis fighters with no losses. Later records showed that only the Catalina and the C.202 of Maresciallo Bianchi, {{a close friend of}} Tarantola, had been shot down.|$|E
25|$|After the war ended, Anzac {{was placed}} into reserve at Portsmouth. On 21 March 1919, Anzac and five S-class destroyers were {{transferred}} to the RAN as a gift. Anzac was commissioned into RAN service on 27 January 1920, and departed from Plymouth on 26 February for the voyage to Australia. Early in the voyage, a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> was damaged, so the destroyer {{had to return to}} Plymouth for repairs. Anzac departed again on 10 March, and arrived in Sydney on 29 April, having visited Gibraltar, Suez, Aden, Bombay, Colombo, Singapore, Surabaya, and Thursday Island en route.|$|E
25|$|On {{her maiden}} voyage in February 1875, City of Tokios sister ship City of Peking lost <b>propeller</b> <b>blades,</b> and also {{required}} {{the replacement of}} 5,000 rivets, amounting to a total repair bill of $300,000.

25|$|In May 1908, Tarmo {{was sent}} {{for the first}} time to the Bothnian Bay to open the harbors and fairways for the spring. On 2 June, she was run hard aground near Raahe due to an error by a pilot when {{navigating}} by sight, resulting in extensive damage to the bottom plating and a lost <b>propeller</b> <b>blade.</b> Kept afloat by her own pumps, she returned to Raahe for emergency repairs and continued to Helsinki, where she was drydocked from 7 June until early August. In 1912 she was again run aground near Hanko, but the damage was not as extensive as on the first time.|$|E
25|$|In late December 1934 the Ulmarra {{was partly}} disabled, {{by the loss}} of a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> when the blade was snapped off when it came into contact with a {{submerged}} object in the Clarence River the Nimbin came to assistance and towed the Ulmarra the voyage of nearly 300 miles. The master of the Ulmarra (Captain Bysanton) said that the Ulmarra was not rendered helpless by the accident, and she could, if necessary, have steamed unaided, but as the motor ship Nimbin, was coming down to Sydney from Richmond River it was considered advisable for her to assist. During the long tow the Ulmarra was able to run her engines, and at times a speed of well lover 11 knots was attained.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April 1936, the Potez 630-01, {{equipped}} {{with a pair of}} 580hp Hispano-Suiza 14, conducted its maiden flight from Méaulte, Picardy. Initially, the prototype was {{equipped with}} an experimental feature {{in the form of a}} braced horizontal stabilizer that incorporated no dihedreal. On 6 May 1936, the prototype suffered some damage due to a hard landing following the mid-air loss of a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade.</b> On 3 August 1936, after receiving repairs, the Potez 630-01 was transferred to Villacoublay Air Base, Île-de-France; it was soon refitted with an alternative tail arrangement similar to later production aircraft and long-stroke landing gear. On 20 November 1936, flight testing of the prototype resumed; it was shortly thereafter delivered to the Centre d'Essais de Matériels Aériens (CEMA) for official tests.|$|E

500|$|Brunel, who {{prior to}} {{commencement}} of service had substituted a six-bladed [...] "windmill" [...] design {{of his own}} for Smith's proven four-bladed propeller design, now {{decided to try to}} improve the speed by riveting an extra two inches of iron to each <b>propeller</b> <b>blade.</b> On her next crossing to New York, carrying 104 passengers, the ship ran into heavy weather, losing a mast and three propeller blades. After repairs in New York, she set out for Liverpool with only 28 passengers, and lost four propeller blades during the crossing. By this time, another design flaw had become evident. The ship rolled heavily, especially in calm weather without the steadying influence of sail, causing great discomfort to passengers.|$|E
500|$|The vessels {{had four}} screws, {{with the two}} {{outboard}} screws mounted in skegs. As completed, the ships had all four-bladed propellers, but vibration tests {{would result in the}} ships of the class having different <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> arrangements throughout the war. The Massachusetts and Alabama had five blades in the outboard propellers and four blades inboard, while the Indiana had three blades inboard. The power output was , while overloading permitted up to , which drove the ships at a design speed of 27.5 knots. The displacement of the vessels gradually increased over World War 2, mainly due to additional light anti-aircraft gun placements and greater fuel oil carriage to refuel smaller escorts. By 1945, the Alabama achieved 27.08 knots at 42,740 tons on [...]|$|E
500|$|Above the waterline, {{there was}} little {{evidence}} of the collision. The stewards in the first class dining room noticed a shudder, which they thought might {{have been caused by}} the ship shedding a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade.</b> Many of the passengers felt a bump or shudder – [...] "just as though we went over about a thousand marbles", as one survivor put it – but did not know what had happened. Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being [...] "awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side. No one was very much alarmed but knew we had struck something". Fireman George Kemish heard a [...] "heavy thud and grinding tearing sound" [...] from the starboard hull.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{informed}} of the accident, seven officials of the French aviation accident investigation agency Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile arrived at the accident site {{the next day at}} 17:00 h. The investigation lasted almost eight months; the final report was released on 16 March 16, 1954, stating the cause of the accident as [...] "the failure of a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> resulting in the separation of the No.3 engine from the aircraft, and loss of control of the No.4 engine. The cause of the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> fracture could not be determined." [...] Didier Daurat, Director of Orly Operations Centre, was tasked with shedding light on the cause of propeller blade's failure.|$|E

2500|$|... he {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the loss of control in flight {{as a result of}} a malfunction of the left engine propeller control unit which allowed the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> angles to go below the flight idle position. Contributing to the accident was the deficient design of the propeller control unit by Hamilton Standard and the approval of the design by the Federal Aviation Administration. The design did not correctly evaluate the failure mode that occurred during this flight, which resulted in an uncommanded and uncorrectable movement of the blades of the airplane’s left propeller below the flight idle position.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB {{found that}} the flight crew would {{have been unable to}} {{perceive}} any problem with the airplane until the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> angle was between 24 and 26 degrees. They stated that the airplane would have [...] "become very difficult to control after the propeller reached the 22-degree stop. Therefore, it is most likely that the pilots of flight 2311 did not notice a problem with the airplane until the propeller began to overspeed and roll control was affected." [...] Thus, the flight crew would have been unable to declare an emergency as the event was so sudden.|$|E
