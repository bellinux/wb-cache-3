5000|$|The Mangusta uses {{a unique}} roof {{mechanism}} {{referred to as}} the [...] "roto-top", designed by Gandini and inspired by the folding roof of the TVR Griffith. The roto-top features a center removable panel (similar to normal targa configurations) but also allows the rear section to electrically rotate (on a forward <b>pivot)</b> <b>out</b> of sight into a cavity behind the seats. This transforms the car into a full convertible.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{completion}} of the causeway, a punt operated across the deep, navigable section of the river, but could not cope with traffic demands. To resolve this issue, the first bridge across this point of the Derwent opened in 1849. The bridge was designed by the firm of architect and former convict James Blackburn. Being a swing bridge, it could <b>pivot</b> <b>out</b> {{of the way to}} allow ships to pass. In the late 1870s, the Launceston-Hobart Railway called for modifications to the causeway so they could lay tracks over it. The causeway required widening and the swing bridge was modified as well.|$|E

By 3 p.m. the daily rains had started, making a slippery slope of the battlefield. Lorencez withdrew to distant positions, counting 462 of his men killed against only 83 of the Mexicans. He waited a couple of days for Zaragoza to attack again, but Zaragoza held his ground. Lorencez then completely withdrew to Orizaba.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} {{strike is}} an access control device used for doors. It replaces the fixed strike faceplate often {{used with a}} latchbar (also known as a keeper). Like a fixed strike, it normally presents a ramped surface to the locking latch allowing the door to close and latch just like a fixed strike would. However, an electric strike's ramped surface can, upon command, <b>pivot</b> <b>out</b> of the way when the lock on the door is in the locked position and the door is opened, allowing a user {{to open the door}} without operating the mechanical lock or using a mechanical key. After the door is opened past the keeper, the keeper returns to its standard position and re-locks when power is removed or applied, depending upon the strike's configuration.|$|E

50|$|A {{centreboard}} or centerboard (US) is a retractable keel which <b>pivots</b> <b>out</b> of a slot in {{the hull}} of a sailboat, known as a centreboard trunk (UK) or centerboard case (US). The retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters, to move the centre of lateral resistance (offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the centre of effort aft), to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed, or when removing the boat from the water, as when trailering. A centreboard which consists of just a pivoting metal plate is called a centerplate. A daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind {{from the rear}} and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were lever setting, with a unique design of set lever which <b>pivoted</b> <b>out</b> from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00.|$|R
50|$|The PP-90 {{consist of}} the {{following}} main groups: the receiver which houses the barrel, action (bolt and recoil mechanism), safety, fire selector switch and supports the pistol grip with magazine well and the shoulder rest. When carried in the stowed position (the bolt is in its forward, closed position) the pistol grip and magazine are folded under the barrel {{in line with the}} bore axis and covered by the folded stock body. The folded weapon resembles a cuboid with the following dimensions - 270x90x32 mm, devoid of any protruding elements, enabling easy concealment. To ready the weapon for firing the stock is <b>pivoted</b> <b>out</b> (simultaneously the pistol grip with magazine, trigger and trigger guard deploy), the safety is disengaged and the bolt cocked. The bolt’s cocking handle is installed {{at the rear of the}} receiver and is accessed from beneath the stock.|$|R
50|$|Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras {{viewed the}} scene through the taking lens. Early SLRs were plate cameras, with a {{mechanism}} to insert a mirror between the lens and the film which reflected the light upwards, where it could be seen at waist level on a ground glass screen. When {{ready to take the}} picture, the mirror was <b>pivoted</b> <b>out</b> of the way (without moving the camera). Later SLRs had a mechanism which flipped the mirror out of the way when the shutter button was pressed, followed immediately by the shutter opening. Instead of a waist-level arrangement, a prism was used to allow the camera to be held to the eye. The big advantage of the SLR was that any lens, or other optical device, could be used; the viewfinder always showed exactly the image that would be projected onto the film. The live preview feature of digital cameras share this advantage of the SLR, as they also show the image exactly as it will be recorded, with no additional optics or parallax error.|$|R

50|$|The dance move {{begins by}} {{stepping}} backward {{with one foot}} with that heel tilted inward. The foot is positioned slightly behind the other (stationary) foot. With the weight on the ball of the starting foot, the heel is then swiveled outward. The same process is repeated with the other foot: step back and behind with heel inward, <b>pivot</b> heel <b>out,</b> and so on. The pattern is continued for as many repetitions as desired. The step may be incorporated in various dances either as a separate routine or as a styling of standard steps.|$|R

60|$|At {{another place}} {{they came to}} a bridge that led across the canal. This bridge turned on a <b>pivot</b> placed <b>out</b> near the middle of the canal, so that it could be moved out of the way when there was a boat to go by. A man was turning it when Mr. George and Rollo came along. They stopped to witness the operation. They were quite amused, not merely with the {{manoeuvring}} of the bridge, but with the form and appearance of the boat that was going through. It seemed to be half boat and half house. There was a room built in it, which rose somewhat above the deck, and showed several little windows with pretty curtains to them. There was a girl sitting at one of these windows, knitting, and two or three children were playing about the deck {{at the time that the}} boat was going through the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} erected over the Big Monon Ditch in 1905 by the Winamac Bridge Company. It was {{designed}} by William E. Stearns, {{and is the only}} Stearns Truss Bridge known left in existence in the United States. A unique feature of the bridge is that it was designed to be easily moved. Various connecting points were made to easily <b>pivot</b> into and <b>out</b> of place, and the caissons were made to be loaded and unloaded with ballast to anchor the structure in place. This allowed the bridge to carry a much greater load as a function of its weight.|$|R

50|$|The {{suspension}} {{changes to}} the car were quite extensive; the car received shorter struts up front, forged track control arms and 5.5J by 13 steel wheel rims. The rear was even more radical with vertical coil spring/dampers replacing the leaf springs and two trailing arms with a A- bracket (which connected to the differential housing and brackets near the trailing arm <b>pivots)</b> sorting <b>out</b> axle location. To support this set-up, further braces were put behind the rear seat and from the rear wheelarch down to chassis in the boot. The stiffening braces meant that the spare wheel had to be moved from the standard Cortina's wheel well and was bolted {{to the left side}} of the boot floor. The battery was also relocated to the boot, behind the right wheelarch. Both of these changes made big improvements to overall weight distribution. Another improvement the Cortina Lotus gained was the new braking system (9.5 in front discs) which were built by brake specialist Girling. This system also was fitted to Cortina GTs but without a servo, which was fitted in the Cortina Lotus engine bay.|$|R

25|$|By 1960, SAC {{had begun}} moving to {{low-level}} penetration which greatly reduced radar detection distances. At the time, SAMs were ineffective against low-flying aircraft, and interceptor aircraft had {{less of a}} speed advantage at low altitudes. The Air Force's Tactical Air Command (TAC) was largely concerned with the fighter-bomber and deep strike/interdiction roles. TAC {{was in the process}} of receiving its latest design, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, which was designed to deliver nuclear weapons fast and far, but required long runways. A simpler variable geometry wing configuration with the <b>pivot</b> points farther <b>out</b> from the aircraft's centerline was reported by NASA in 1958, which made swing-wings viable. This led Air Force leaders to encourage its use. In June 1960, the USAF issued specification SOR 183 for a long-range interdiction/strike aircraft able to penetrate Soviet air defenses at very low altitudes and high speeds. The specification also called for the aircraft to operate from short, unprepared airstrips.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{innovative}} {{aspect of the}} design was the variable-incidence wing which <b>pivoted</b> by 7° <b>out</b> of the fuselage on takeoff and landing (not {{to be confused with}} variable-sweep wing). This allowed a greater angle of attack, [...] increasing lift without compromising forward visibility. This innovation helped the F-8's development team win the Collier Trophy in 1956. Simultaneously, the lift was augmented by leading-edge slats drooping by 25° and inboard flaps extending to 30°. The rest of the aircraft took advantage of contemporary aerodynamic innovations with area-ruled fuselage, all-moving stabilators, dog-tooth notching at the wing folds for improved yaw stability, and liberal use of titanium in the airframe. The armament, as specified by the Navy, consisted primarily of four 20mm (.79in) autocannon; the Crusader happened to be the last U.S. fighter designed with guns as its primary weapon. They were supplemented with a retractable tray with 32 unguided Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket (Mighty Mouse FFARs), and cheek pylons for two guided AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Vought also presented a tactical reconnaissance version of the aircraft called the V-392.|$|R
40|$|Apparatus is {{described}} for automatically mating {{a pair of}} connectors and protecting them prior to mating, which minimizes weight and uses relatively simple and reliable mechanisms. Lower and upper connectors (24, 26) are held in lower and upper parts (14, 16) of a housing, with the upper connector mounted on a carrier (32) that is motor driven to move down and mate the connectors. A pair of movable members (36, 38) serve as shields, as coarse alignment aids, and as force transmitters. The movable members are pivotally mounted {{at the bottom of}} the upper housing, and as the carrier moves down it <b>pivots</b> the members <b>out</b> of the way. The movable members have socket elements (116) that closely receive pin elements (120) on the lower housing part, to coarsely align the connectors and to react mating and unmating forces between the housings. The carrier has a pair of plate portions (60, 62) with slots (64), and the movable members have cam followers engaged with the slot walls, to move the members with precision.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{reports a}} {{theoretical}} study {{to explain how}} the intrinsic property of chirality is retained throughout the radical cascade rearrangement of an enantiopure chiral enyne-allene (bearing one stereogenic center) selected as a model for this family of reactions. Calculations at the MRPT 2 / 6 - 31 G(d) //CASSCF(10, 10) / 6 - 31 G(d) level of theory were used to determine the entire reaction pathway which includes singlet state diradicals and closed-shell species. The cascade process involves three elementary steps, i. e., by chronological order: Myers–Saito cycloaromatization (M-S), intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and recombination of the resulting biradical. The enantiospecificity of the reaction results from a double transmission of the stereochemical information, from the original center to an axis and eventually from this axis to the final center. The first two steps lead to a transient diradical intermediate which retains the chirality via the conversion of the original static chirogenic element into a dynamic one, i. e., a center into an axis. The only available routes to the final closed-shell tetracyclic product imply rotations around two σ bonds (σ(C–C) and σ(C–N), bonds β and α respectively). The theoretical calculations confirmed that the formation of the enantiomerically pure product proceeds via the nonracemizing rotation around the σ(C–C) <b>pivot.</b> They ruled <b>out</b> any rotation around the second σ(C–N) pivot. The high level of configurational memory in this rearrangement relies on the steric impediment to the rotation around the C–N bond in the chiral native conformation of the diradical intermediate produced from tandem M-S/ 1, 5 -HAT...|$|R
