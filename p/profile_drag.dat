25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E

40|$|This note is {{the fifth}} of a series {{covering}} an investigation {{of a number of}} related airfoils. It presents the results obtained from tests of a group of six low-cambered airfoils in the variable-density wind tunnel. The mean camber lines are identical for the six airfoils and are of such a form that the maximum mean camber is 2 per cent of the chord and is at a position 0. 4 of the chord behind the loading edge. The airfoils differ in thickness only, the maximum-thickness/chord ratios being 0. 06, 0. 09, 0. 12, 0. 15, 0. 18, and 0. 21. The results have been presented in the form of both infinite and finite aspect-ratio characteristics. The values of C(sub L) max/C(sub d) degrees min for this group of airfoils are among the highest thus far obtained, the minimum <b>profile</b> <b>drags</b> being approximately equal to those for the symmetrical series of corresponding thickness, while the maximum lift coefficients are considerably higher...|$|R

40|$|Cavitation always {{leads to}} complex gas–liquid {{interactions}} and turbulence structures with multi-scale eddies and vortices. It usually involves cavity growth, break-off and collapse processes; posing great challenges in modeling. This paper focuses on modeling instantaneous cavitating flows using the large eddy simulation (LES) and validating the predictions against experimental data using the time-average method. The {{volume of fluid}} (VOF) model was adopted to describe phase equations and coupled with the Schnerr–Sauer cavitation model for describing the evaporation-condensation mass transfer. Simulations were performed to predict the unsteady cavitating flows of both the cylinder and Clark-Y hydrofoil configurations. Firstly, the mechanisms of cavity shedding, vapor cloud forming and collapsing were well revealed. The time-averaged pressure distribution and cavity length around the cylinder were in good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the periodic cavity shedding and pressure fluctuation around the Clark-Y hydrofoil were also predicted. Different cavity patterns were clearly identified in a typical cycle, {{and the effect of}} cavity pattern on hydrodynamic forces was investigated. The computational results of cavity patterns, velocity <b>profiles,</b> <b>drag</b> and lift coefficients were compared with experimental results and good agreements were obtained. The present work provides a valid numerical modeling framework for various cavitating flows...|$|R

50|$|In {{a coordinated}} turn, adverse yaw is {{effectively}} compensated {{by the use}} of the rudder, which results in a sideforce on the vertical tail that opposes the adverse yaw by creating a favorable yawing moment. Another method of compensation is 'differential ailerons', which have been rigged such that the down-going aileron deflects less than the up-going one. In this case the opposing yaw moment is generated by a difference in <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> between the left and right wingtips. Frise ailerons accentuate this <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> imbalance by protruding beneath the wing of an upward-deflected aileron, most often by being hinged slightly behind the leading edge and {{near the bottom of the}} surface, with the lower section of the aileron surface's leading edge protruding slightly below the wing's undersurface when the aileron is deflected upwards, substantially increasing <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> on that side. Ailerons may also be designed to use a combination of these methods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> of a rotor {{corresponds}} to the cube of its rotational speed.Reducing the rotational speed is therefore a significant reduction of rotor drag, allowing higher aircraft speed or lower power consumption. A conventional rotor such as the UH-60A has lowest consumption around 75% rpm, but higher aircraft speed (and weight) requires higher rpm.|$|E
40|$|The {{surfactant}} used in {{this study}} is well known as an additive for drag reduction in straight (non-swirling) pipe flow. This paper deals with swirling flow characteristics of a surfactant solution. We investigated the effects of surfactant concentration and Reynolds number on flow characteristics. It is shown that the drag reducing effect is less than in straight pipe flow, and that the surfactant solution must be highly concentrated with great elasticity in order to produce a drag reduction. As the results of velocity measurement by LDV and wall pressure measurement in the axial direction, it is expected that the swirl intensity of the drag reducing swirling flow with a surfactant decays more quickly as the flow progresses downstream. And we propose that this mechanism helps create the drag reduction in swirling flow. For the velocity <b>profiles</b> of <b>drag</b> reducing swirling flow, only the forced-vortex type is observed in this experiment. This suggests that the velocity <b>profiles</b> of <b>drag</b> reducing swirling flow change more quickly to a forced-vortex type from a Rankin's combined vortex type. It is also reported that turbulence intensity of drag reducing swirling flow is smaller than turbulence intensity of a solvent...|$|R
40|$|AN {{investigation}} {{was made of}} a large-chord NACA 23030 airfoil with a 40 - and a 25. 66 percent-chord slotted flap to determine the section aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil affected by flap chord, slot shape, flap position, and flap deflection. The flap positions for maximum lift, the position for minimum drag at moderate and high lift coefficients, and the complete section aerodynamic characteristics of selected optimum arrangements are given. Envelope polar of various flap arrangements are included. The relative merits of slotted flaps of different chords on the NACA 23030 airfoil are discussed, and a comparison is made of each flap size with a corresponding flap size on the NACA 23021 and 23012 airfoils. The lowest <b>profile</b> <b>drags</b> at moderate lift coefficients were obtained with an easy entrance to the slot. The 25. 66 -percent-chord slotted flap gave lower drag than the 40 -percent-chord flap for lift coefficients less than 1. 8, but the 40 -percent-chord flap gave considerably lower drag for lift coefficients. The drag coefficients at moderate and high lift coefficients were greater with both sizes of flap on the NACA 23030 airfoil than on either the NACA 23021 or the NACA 23012 airfoil. The maximum lift coefficient for the deflections tested with either flap was practically independent of airfoil...|$|R
30|$|Differences in {{endpoint}} timing {{are important}} for terminal haptic feedback, where haptic feedback is fed to the users {{at the end of}} gesture execution. When the tracking was stable, the endpoints of the measured motion <b>profiles</b> during <b>drag</b> gestures were close to that of the reference motion curves. However, when tracking was unstable, the endpoints of measured motion profiles were delayed compared to the actual motion profile. One can observe a significant delay in the endpoints of the filtered motion profiles compared to the measured and synthesized data for the drag gesture.|$|R
50|$|The drag of a wing {{consists}} of two components, the induced drag, which {{is related to the}} production of lift, and the <b>profile</b> <b>drag,</b> largely due to skin friction which is contributed to by the whole wing area. It is therefore desirable for a wing to have the least area compatible with the desired lift characteristics. This is best achieved with a high aspect ratio, and high-performance types often have this kind of wing.|$|E
50|$|The above lift {{equation}} neglects {{the skin}} friction forces, which typically have a negligible {{contribution to the}} lift compared to the pressure forces. By using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral, we obtain an expression for the pressure drag Dp (which includes the pressure portion of the <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> and, if the wing is three-dimensional, the induced drag). If we use the spanwise vector j, we obtain the side force Y.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{research}} {{performed by}} NASA {{concluded that the}} advantage in lift and field length performance achieved did not offset the layout's many deficiencies in climb and high speed ability, and problems meeting certification requirements for general aviation. The main issue is that the semi-circular beam wing configuration incurs increased <b>profile</b> <b>drag</b> and weight penalties over a conventional wing of the same lifting planform, and a common straight wing could provide almost the equivalent lift enhancement when exposed to the same slipstream induced increased dynamic pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of seagrasses with {{the dynamics of}} an oscillatory wave induced flow is assessed with a new Lagrangian plant model. The plant model simulates moving plants in canopies and their dissipative effect on the ambient flow. Concomitantly the plant model is interactively coupled to a 3 D hydrodynamic numerical model allowing for a bilateral feedback between moving plants and flow. Model results demonstrate that this interaction causes a modification of current profiles within and above a canopy as compared to an undisturbed flow. While the overall effect of submerged plant canopies is a dampening of dynamics, the flow may locally be intensified. The model predicted an intensification of the flow {{near the top of}} a canopy in concurrence with field and laboratory observations. Dissipation in the coupled model, due to the applied non-linear friction law, grows exponentially with increasing flow. As a result the permeability of a canopy to the ambient flow decreases with increasing dissipation. Consequently, at high flow velocities, while becoming increasingly impermeable, a canopy acts like an obstacle that deflects the flow above it, which causes the observed intensification. Results for canopies consisting of seagrasses with different leaf structure and plant geometry show remarkable differences in predicted plant motions, current <b>profiles,</b> <b>drag</b> forces, and velocity shear. Predictions for moving plants are compared with those for rigid, less flexible, structures and undisturbed flow...|$|R

50|$|Under usual flight conditions, the {{boundary}} layer remains attached {{to both the}} upper and lower surfaces {{all the way to the}} trailing edge, and its effect on the rest of the flow is modest. Compared to the predictions of inviscid-flow theory, in which there is no boundary layer, the attached boundary layer reduces the lift by a modest amount and modifies the pressure distribution somewhat, which results in a viscosity-related pressure drag over and above the skin-friction drag. The total of the skin-friction drag and the viscosity-related pressure drag is usually called the <b>profile</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
