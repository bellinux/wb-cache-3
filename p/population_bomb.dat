25|$|Paul R. Ehrlich (born 1932, {{class of}} 1949), entomologist, {{professor}} of population studies {{and author of}} The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a 2004 Grist Magazine interview, Ehrlich {{acknowledged}} {{some specific}} predictions he had made, {{in the years}} around the time The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> was published, that had not come to pass. However, as {{to a number of}} his fundamental ideas and assertions he maintained that facts and science proved them correct.|$|E
25|$|In a 2008 {{discussion}} {{hosted by}} the website Salon, Paul Ehrlich has become more critical of the United States specifically, claiming that it should control its population and consumption as an example {{to the rest of}} the world. He has disavowed some of what he said in The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb.</b> He still thinks that governments should discourage people from having more than two children, suggesting, for example a greater tax rate for larger families.|$|E

5000|$|On 14 September, the French Air attaché in Warsaw {{reported}} to Paris, [...] "the German Air Force acted {{in accordance to}} the international laws of war ... and bombed only targets of military nature. Therefore, {{there is no reason}} for French retorsions." [...] That day - the Jewish New Year - the Germans concentrated again on the Warsaw's Jewish <b>population,</b> <b>bombing</b> the Jewish quarter and targeting synagogues. According to professor Szarota the report was inaccurate - as its author Armengaud didn't know about the most barbaric bombings like those in Wieluń or Kamieniec, left Poland on 12 September, and was motivated by his personal political goal to avoid French involvement in the war, in addition the report published in 1948 rather than in 1939.|$|R

25|$|A lecture that Ehrlich gave on {{the topic}} of {{overpopulation}} at the Commonwealth Club of California was broadcast by radio in April 1967. The success of the lecture caused further publicity, and the suggestion from David Brower {{the executive director of the}} environmentalist Sierra Club, and Ian Ballantine of Ballantine Books to write a book concerning the topic. Ehrlich and his wife, Anne Ehrlich, collaborated on the book, The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> but the publisher insisted that a single author be credited.|$|E
25|$|In his 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population, the British scholar Thomas Malthus {{incorrectly}} {{predicted that}} continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. Malthus wrote the essay to refute {{what he considered}} the unattainable utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet, as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind. In 1968, Paul R. Ehrlich reprised Malthus' argument in The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Ehrlich became {{well known}} for his {{controversial}} 1968 book The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> which asserted that the world's human population would soon increase {{to the point where}} mass starvation ensued. Among the solutions he suggested in that book was population control, to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail. Ehrlich has been criticized for his opinions; for example, Ronald Bailey termed Ehrlich an irrepressible doomster. However, Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich's warnings had encouraged governments to change their policies to avert disaster. Ehrlich has acknowledged that some of what he predicted has not occurred, but maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct, and that overpopulation is a major problem.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{causing a}} great deal of damage and disrupting the daily lives of the {{civilian}} <b>population,</b> the <b>bombing</b> of Britain failed to have an impact. British air defenses became more formidable, and attacks tapered off as Germany abandoned its efforts against Britain and focused more on the Soviet Union.|$|R
40|$|The only {{certainty}} concerning {{predictions for}} the future of the environment is that most of them are likely to be wrong. This is illustrated by the fate of past predictions, such as those contained in Paul Ehrlich 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Populations</b> <b>Bomb,</b> Gregg Easterbrook 2 ̆ 7 s A Moment on the Earth, and Bjørn Lomborg 2 ̆ 7 s The Skeptical Environmentalist. While it is difficult to guess at the future of the environment, predictions concerning environmental law are even more hazardous because they turn in large part on the future of politics. After reviewing current political gridlock over environmental concerns, this Article considers contemporary forecasts of the fate of the planet (including those contained in Al Gore 2 ̆ 7 s The Future and the 2052 Report) and the role of technological change in creating opportunities for environmental progress...|$|R

2500|$|In {{answer to}} the question: [...] "Were your {{predictions}} in The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> right?", Ehrlich responded: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1948 two {{widely read}} books were {{published}} that would inspire a [...] "neo-Malthusian" [...] debate on {{population and the}} environment: Fairfield Osborn’s Our Plundered Planet and William Vogt’s Road to Survival. Although, they are now much less well known than <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> they inspired many works such as the original <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> pamphlet by Hugh Everett Moore in 1954 that inspired the name of Ehrlich's book, {{as well as some}} of the original societies concerned with population and environmental matters. D.B. Luten has said that although the book is often seen as a seminal work in the field, the <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> is actually best understood as [...] "climaxing and in a sense terminating the debate of the 1950s and 1960s.” Ehrlich has said that he traced his own Malthusian beliefs to a lecture he heard Vogt give when he was attending university in the early 1950s. For Ehrlich, these writers provided “a global framework for things he had observed as a young naturalist." ...|$|E
5000|$|With {{this process}} 25% of live bombs can be {{identified}} without being detonated, 50% will be detonated and 25% remain uncertain. By repeating the process with the uncertain ones, the ratio of identified non-detonated live bombs approaches 33% of the initial <b>population</b> of <b>bombs.</b> See the [...] "Experiments" [...] section below for a modified experiment that can identify the live bombs with a yield rate approaching 100%.|$|R
2500|$|In The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb's</b> opening {{lines the}} authors state {{that nothing can}} prevent famines in which {{hundreds}} of millions of people will die during the 1970s (amended to 1970s and 80s in later editions), and that there would be [...] "a substantial increase in the world death rate." [...] Although many lives could be saved through dramatic action, it was already too late to prevent a substantial increase in the global death rate. However, in reality the global death rate has continued to decline substantially since then, from 13/1000 in 1965–74 to 10/1000 from 1985–1990. Meanwhile, the population of the world has more than doubled, while calories consumed/person have increased 24%. The UN does not keep official death-by-hunger statistics so it is hard to measure whether the [...] "{{hundreds of millions of}} deaths" [...] number is correct. Ehrlich himself suggested in 2009 that between 200-300 million had died of hunger since 1968. However, that is measured over 40 years rather than the ten to twenty foreseen in the book, so it can be seen as significantly fewer than predicted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This is {{the first}} report of {{registration}} at birth, and of incidence of major structural birth defects (BD) obtained in Gaza at Al Shifa Hospital, where 28 % of total births in Gaza Strip occur. Doctors registered 4, 027 deliveries, with a protocol comprehensive of clinical, demographic, kin and environmental questions. Prevalence of BD is 14 / 1, 000, without association with intermarriage or gender of the child. Prevalence of late miscarriages and still births are respectively 23. 3 / 1, 000 and 7. 4 / 1, 000, and of premature births 19. 6 / 1, 000. Couples with a BD child have about 10 times higher frequency of recurrence of a BD in their progeny than those with normal children, but none of their 694 siblings and only 10 / 1, 000 of their 1, 423 progeny had BD, similar to the frequency in general population. These data suggest occurrence of novel genetic and epigenetic events in determination of BD. Children with BD were born with higher frequency (p < 0 001) in families where one or both parents were under “white phosphorus ” attack, that in the general <b>population.</b> <b>Bombing</b> of the family home and removal of the rubble were also frequently reported by couples with B...|$|R
2500|$|During a 2004 interview, Ehrlich {{answered}} {{questions about the}} predictions he made in The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb.</b> He acknowledged that {{some of what he}} had published had not occurred, but reaffirmed his basic opinion that overpopulation is a major problem. He noted that, [...] "Fifty-eight academies of science said that same thing in 1994, as did the world scientists' warning to humanity in the same year. My view has become depressingly mainline!" [...] Ehrlich also stated that 600 million people were very hungry, billions were under-nourished, and that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct. Retrospectively, Ehrlich believes that The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> was [...] "way too optimistic".|$|E
2500|$|In their {{sequel to}} The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> the Ehrlichs wrote {{about how the}} world's growing {{population}} dwarfs the Earth's capacity to sustain current living standards. The book calls for action to confront population growth and the ensuing crisis: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> {{was written}} at the {{suggestion}} of David Brower {{the executive director of the}} environmentalist Sierra Club, and Ian Ballantine of Ballantine Books following various public appearances Ehrlich had made regarding population issues and their relation to the environment. Although the Ehrlichs collaborated on the book, the publisher insisted that a single author be credited, and also asked to change their preferred title: Population, Resources, and Environment. The title <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> was taken (with permission) from General William H. Draper, founder of the Population Crisis Committee and a pamphlet issued in 1954 by the Hugh Moore Fund. The Ehrlichs regret the choice of title, which they admit was a perfect choice from a marketing perspective, but think that [...] "it led Paul to be miscategorized as solely focused on human numbers, despite our interest in all the factors affecting the human trajectory." ...|$|E
50|$|Area bombing {{is a form}} of {{strategic}} bombing. It can serve several intertwined purposes: to disrupt the production of military materiel, to disrupt lines of communications, to divert the enemy's industrial and military resources from the primary battlefield to air defence, and to demoralise the enemy's <b>population</b> (See terror <b>bombing).</b>|$|R

The crowd's demands were [...] "quickly rejected by the United Nations and the country’s internationally recognized government." [...] Meanwhile, Saudi planes roared above the <b>population</b> and <b>bombed</b> nearby leaving {{an unknown number of}} casualties.|$|R
50|$|In {{the city}} the Cabinet War Rooms and the Admiralty Citadel were built to protect command and control centres, {{and a series of}} deep-level shelters prepared, as refuge for the general <b>population</b> against <b>bombing.</b> In June 1940 under the {{direction}} of General Edmund Ironside, concentric rings of anti-tank defences and pillboxes were constructed: The London Inner Keep, London Stop Line Inner (Line C), London Stop Line Central (Line B) and London Stop Line Outer (Line A). Work on these lines was halted weeks later by Ironside's successor, General Alan Brooke, who favoured mobile warfare above static defence.|$|R
2500|$|Norman Borlaug, one of {{the most}} {{important}} figures in the Green Revolution, was the subject of an admiring Easterbrook article in 1997, and again in 2009 marking Borlaug's passing. [...] Both articles said that Borlaug had disproved the earlier dire predictions of Paul R. Ehrlich, author of the 1968 book The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb.</b> [...] Ehrlich has severely criticized Easterbrook’s 1995 book A Moment on the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Biologist Paul R. Ehrlich {{wrote in}} his 1968 bestseller The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> [...] "The battle to feed all of {{humanity}} is over...

[...] Ehrlich said, [...] "I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971," [...] and [...] "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> is {{a best-selling}} book written by Stanford University Professor Paul R. Ehrlich and his wife, Anne Ehrlich (who was uncredited), in 1968. It warned of mass {{starvation}} of humans in the 1970s and 1980s due to overpopulation, {{as well as}} other major societal upheavals, and advocated immediate action to limit population growth. Fears of a [...] "population explosion" [...] were widespread in the 1950s and 1960s, but the book and its author brought the idea to an even wider audience.|$|E

2500|$|One {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> {{is that it}} focused on spectacle and exaggeration {{at the expense of}} accuracy. Pierre Desrochers and Christine Hoffbauer remark that [...] "at the time of writing The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> Paul and Anne Ehrlich should have been more cautious and revised their tone and rhetoric, in light of the undeniable and already apparent errors and shortcomings of Osborn and Vogt’s analyses." [...] Charles Rubin has written that it was precisely because Ehrlich was largely unoriginal and wrote in a clear emotionally gripping style that it became so popular. He quotes a review from Natural History noting that Ehrlich does not try to [...] "convince intellectually by mind dulling statistics," [...] but rather roars [...] "like an Old Testament Prophet." [...] Gardner says, [...] "as much as the events and culture of the era, Paul Ehrlich's style explain the enormous audience he attracted." [...] Indeed, an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson helped to propel the success of the book, as well as Ehrlich's celebrity. Desrochers and Hoffbauer go on to conclude that it seems hard to deny that using an alarmist tone and emotional appeal were the main lessons that the present generation of environmentalists learned from Ehrlich's success.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{position}} of the Sierra Club has generally been favorable towards immigration, some critics of the Sierra Club have charged that the efforts of some club members to restrain immigration, are a continuation of aspects of human population control and the eugenics movement. In 1969, the Sierra Club published Paul R. Ehrlich's book, The <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb,</b> in which he said that population growth was responsible for environmental decline and advocated coercive measures to reduce it. Some observers have argued that the book had a [...] "racial dimension" [...] {{in the tradition of the}} Eugenics movement, and that it [...] "reiterated many of Osborn's jeremiads." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ehrlich's {{opinions}} {{have evolved}} over time, {{and he has}} proposed different {{solutions to the problem}} of overpopulation. In <b>Population</b> <b>Bomb</b> he wrote, [...] "We must have population control at home, hopefully through a system of incentives and penalties, but by compulsion if voluntary methods fail. We must use our political power to push other countries into programs which combine agricultural development and population control." [...] Voluntary measures he has endorsed include the easiest possible availability of birth control and abortion. [...] In 1967 he had expressed his belief that aid should only be given to those countries that were not considered to be [...] "hopeless" [...] to feed their own populations.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "heightened {{security}} measures" [...] {{also affected}} the target <b>populations.</b> During the <b>bombing</b> campaign Israelis were questioned by armed guards {{and given a}} quick pat down before being let into cafes. In the US, the post-9/11 era meant [...] "previously inconceivable security measures—in airports and other transportation hubs, hotels and office buildings, sports stadiums and concert halls".|$|R
