40|$|BACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) have {{acute and}} chronic manifestations, and {{can result in}} {{lifetime}} morbidity. Disease burden is difficult to quantify, yet quantitative evidence is required to justify large-scale deworming programmes. A recent Cochrane systematic review, which influences Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates for STH, has again called into question the evidence for deworming benefit on morbidity due <b>to</b> <b>STH.</b> In this narrative review, we investigate in detail what the shortfalls in evidence are. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically reviewed recent literature that used direct measures to investigate morbidity from STH and we critically appraised systematic reviews, particularly the most recent Cochrane systematic review investigating deworming impact on morbidity. We included six systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 36 literature reviews, 44 experimental or observational studies, and five case series. We highlight where evidence is insufficient and where {{research needs to be}} directed to strengthen morbidity evidence, ideally to prove benefits of deworming. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the Cochrane systematic review and recent studies indicate major shortfalls in evidence for direct morbidity. However, it is questionable whether the systematic review methodology should be applied <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> due <b>to</b> heterogeneity of the prevalence of different species in each setting. Urgent investment in studies powered to detect direct morbidity effects due <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> is required. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) - a {{class of}} parasites that affect billions of people - can be mitigated using mass drug administration, though reinfection {{following}} treatment occurs within a few months. Improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) likely provide sustained benefit, but few rigorous studies have evaluated the specific WASH components most influential in reducing infection. There {{is a need for}} alternative analytic approaches to help identify, characterize and further refine the WASH components that are most important <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> reinfection. Traditional epidemiological approaches are not well-suited for assessing the complex and highly correlated relationships commonly seen in WASH. We introduce two recursive partitioning approaches: classification and regression trees (C&RT) and conditional inference trees (CIT), which can be used to identify complex interactions between WASH indicators and identify sub-populations that may be susceptible <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> reinfection. We illustrate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these approaches utilizing school- and household-level WASH indicators gathered as part of a school-based randomized control trial in Kenya that measured STH reinfection of pupils 10 months following deworming treatment. C&RT and CIT analyses resulted in strikingly different decision trees. C&RT may be the preferred approach if interest lies in using WASH indicators to classify individuals or communities as STH infected or uninfected, whereas CIT is most appropriate for identifying WASH indicators that may be causally associated with STH infection. Both tools are well-suited for identifying complex interactions among WASH indicators. C&RT and CIT are two analytic approaches that may offer valuable insight regarding the identification, selection and refinement of WASH indicators and their interactions with regards <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> control programs; however, they represent solutions to two distinct research questions and careful consideration should be made before deciding which approach is most appropriate...|$|R
