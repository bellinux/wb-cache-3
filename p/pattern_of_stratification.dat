40|$|This {{study of}} {{vertical}} fatty acid profiles, based on analysis of 58 fatty acids sampled at 3 -mm intervals throughout the blubber column {{of a model}} marine mammal, the ringed seal (Pusa hispida), revealed three chemically distinct layers. The average depths of the outer and inner layers were quite consistent (~ 1. 5 and ~ 1 cm, respectively). Consequently, the middle layer varied greatly in thickness, from being virtually absent in the thinnest animals to 2. 5 cm thick in the fattest. The relative consistencies of the thickness and composition of the layers {{as well as the}} nature of the fatty acids making up each layer support the generally assumed function of the various layers: (1) the outer layer is primarily structural and thermoregulatory, (2) the inner layer is metabolically active with a fatty acid composition that is strongly affected by recent/ongoing lipid mobilization/deposition, and (3) the middle layer is a storage site that contracts and expands with food availability/consumption. The remarkable dynamics of the middle layer along with the discrete <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> found in the vertical fatty acid profiles have important implications for methodological sampling design for studies of foraging ecology and toxicology based on analyses of blubber of marine mammals...|$|E
40|$|Lake Texoma, a large, {{relatively}} shallow reservoir on the Oklahoma-Texas border, is stratified in late summer. In summers of 1982 and 1983 we made weekly determinations {{of vertical}} physicochemical profiles and fish distribution at rive {{stations in the}} main "deep basin " of the reservoir. This part of the reservoir, formed by the junction of the Red River and Washita River arms of Lake Texoma, has a distinct "chemocline " at which there is characteristically a sharp decrease in oxygen and pH, {{and an increase in}} specific conductance. In contrast to many natural lakes, Lake Texoma exhibits a gradual decrease in temperature from surface to bottom, without an abrupt thermocline. Although the basic <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> was similar from July to early September in both years, there were important differences between years in the depth of the chemocline (defined as depth in meters at which dissolved oxygen dropped below 2. 0 ppm). Depth of the chemocline also differed substantially among stations on some of the sampling dates. During stratification in both years, the hypolimnion was anoxic. In both years during maximum stratification fish were concentrated in a few meters of the water column immediately above the chemocline.

40|$|Maturation ponds are a type {{of waste}} {{stabilisation}} pond (WSP) designed to reduce carbon, nutrients and pathogens {{in the final stages}} of a WSP wastewater treatment system. In this study, a one-dimensional plug-flow pond model is proposed to predict temperature and E. coli concentration distributions and overall pond disinfection performance. The model accounts for the effects of vertical mixing and ultraviolet light-dependent die-off rate kinetics. Measurements of radiation, wind-speed, humidity and air temperature are recorded for model inputs and good agreement with measured vertical temperature distributions and outlet E. coli concentrations is found in an operational, subtropical maturation pond. Measurements and the model both show a diurnal <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> during daylight hours and natural convective mixing at night on days corresponding to low wind speeds, strong heat input from solar radiation and clear night skies. In the evenings, the thermal stratification is shown to collapse due to surface energy loss via longwave radiation which triggers top-down natural convective mixing. The disinfection model is found to be sensitive to the choice of die-off kinetics. The diurnal mixing pattern is found to play a vital role in the disinfection process by ensuring that pathogens are regularly transported to the near-surface layer where ultraviolet light penetration is effective. The model proposed in this paper offers clear advantages to pond designers by including geographical specific, time-varying boundary conditions and accounting for the important physical aspects of vertical mixing and sunlight inactivation processes, yet is computationally straightforward.

40|$|Background Minimal {{residual}} {{disease is}} an important independent prognostic factor in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The classical detection methods such as multiparameter flow cytometry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis are expensive, time-consuming and complex, and require considerable technical expertise. Design and Methods We analyzed 229 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to the GBTLI- 99 protocol at three different Brazilian centers. Minimal residual disease was analyzed in bone marrow samples at diagnosis and on days 14 and 28 by conventional homo/heteroduplex polymerase chain reaction using a simplified approach with consensus primers for IG and TCR gene rearrangements. Results At least one marker was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 96. 4 %, of the patients. By combining the minimal residual disease results obtained on days 14 and 28, three different prognostic groups were identified: minimal residual disease negative on days 14 and 28, positive on day 14 /negative on day 28, and positive on both. Five-year event-free survival rates were 85 %, 75. 6 %,, and 27. 8 %, respectively (p< 0. 0001). The same <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> held true for the group of intensively treated children. When analyzed in other subgroups of patients such as those at standard and high risk at diagnosis, those with positive B-derived CD 10, patients positive for the TEL/AML 1 transcript, and patients in morphological remission on a day 28 marrow, the event-free survival rate {{was found to be}} significantly lower in patients with positive minimal residual disease on day 28. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the detection of minimal residual disease on day 28 is the most significant prognostic factor. Conclusions This simplified strategy for detection of minimal residual disease was feasible, reproducible, cheaper and simpler when compared with other methods, and allowed powerful discrimination between children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a good and poor outcome.

(2) The impact of global {{restructuring}} of the economy on the social geography {{of the city is}} twofold: at one extreme the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> has changed with the emergence of new social layer of high-level professionals working in the finance sector and specialized services, at the other, there has been an increase in the informal, causal low-skilled, low-paid labour. The extreme inequality of the new era can distinguish itself with its magnitude in both social and spatial terms. The measurement of class-based inequality has been generally incorporated with income and earnings produced {{as a consequence of the}} sphere of production, i. e. labour market. The role of the household in the labour market is accepted as the main factor in determining the level of welfare and standard of living. However, in actuality, the factors that identify the income inequality cannot be limited by the sphere of production. There is common consensus that a social grouping identified by the sphere of reproduction (consumption) and exchange mechanism is needed for fully-fledge stratification and class analysis. This paper tries to show that not just income, but also the sphere of social reproduction including the housing dimension, has to be incorporated in the measurement of the deep social divide that exists between haves and have-nots. The objective here is to discuss the criterion employed in the measurement of class based segregation in urban structure. The major assertion is that not income but also housing is of utmost importance for the analysis of the class-based segregation in Ankara’s urban structure. Special attention is paid to the relationship between the concepts of “social polarization”, “social stratification ” and socio-spatial divide in terms of material value, living conditions and ownership pattern of housing in the intermediary period of the late 1990 s and the early 2000 s in Ankara.

40|$|Japan’s {{population}} is rapidly contracting. If current trends continue, its population will fall {{to just one}} third of its 2010 peak by as early as 2095, with even faster declines in the working age population. Scholars are unsure how population contractions in Japan {{and the rest of}} the developed world will alter or uphold existing status hierarchies. On one hand, those at the top of the economic hierarchy may strengthen their grip on a shrinking number of good jobs. Alternatively, labor shortages may create new opportunities for formerly disadvantaged people. In three papers this dissertation examines the forms and causes of economic inequality in the context of Japan’s demographic decline. It uses original data collected from 539 white collar workers at twelve large Japanese firms. The first paper on gender inequality finds little evidence that firms exclude women from good jobs. However, within jobs, firms continue to pay women less than men, even after adjustments for performance. The results indicate that labor shortages do induce firms to admit more women to good jobs, but may even increase their incentives to discriminate against them within jobs. The second paper compares economic outcomes for skilled foreign workers and their Japanese counterparts. After adjustments for acculturation and human capital quality, the data show that Western immigrants to Japan earn more even than Japanese doing similar jobs, while East Asians earn less. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> suggests that context of reception—particularly the attitudes of Japanese people towards members of different groups—is more influential in generating stratification within firms than the acculturation of foreign workers. The third paper tests directly whether ethnic and racial attitudes matter for inequality between Japanese and foreign workers. Using the results of a survey experiment on attitudes, I show that in firms where coworkers are more biased against non-Japanese East Asians, inequality between Japanese and other Asians is greater. Similarly, in firms where coworkers demonstrate more pro-Western bias, Western employees are at a greater wage advantage. Together, the three papers show that, in a context of demographic decline, outsiders do move into good jobs, but do not overturn existing status hierarchies...|$|E
40|$|The {{exchange}} of flow and scalars between an estuary and its perimeter controls the hydrodynamics in the estuary's fringes {{as well as}} along its axis. The flow and scalar fields in these two regions are coupled through tidally-driven lateral exchange. The physical processes that regulate this exchange operate on tidal timescales (hours, days) and respond to perturbations such as meteorological events and morphologic changes. The long-term, or residual, effects of this system of processes define the physical and ecological functioning of an estuary by controlling its morphology, salt field, and distribution of flows. In this dissertation research, field observations and theoretical analysis are used to {{explore the influence of}} an estuary's exchange with its perimeter on flow and scalar fields at tidal and residual timescales. In-situ measurements of flow velocity and water properties were collected in a macrotidal slough in the South San Francisco Bay lined by mudflats and recently connected to former salt ponds. The interplay between tidal flows, bathymetry, and the longitudinal salt gradient define the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> and mixing during a tidal cycle. The mechanism of tidal straining combined with the longitudinal baroclinic pressure gradient typically work together to enhance stratification on ebb tides and break it down through active mixing on flood tides. In the presence of sharp bathymetric transitions, such as the shoal-channel interface, the typical dynamics can be overwhelmed by local exchange. On flood tides, baroclinically-driven lateral circulation between the channel and mudflats freshens the surface layer in the channel, and reduces its velocity, producing a sub-surface velocity maximum. The input of buoyancy and the velocity shear result in stable stratification. On ebb tides, outflow from the mudflats transports trapped, high-salinity water over the freshening bottom layer, producing strong lateral shear and unstable stratification near the channel-mudflat boundary. As the ebb tide progresses and the mudflat outflow decelerates, the water column becomes well-mixed, and exhibits increased turbulent motions that result from shear and buoyant production. In short, lateral exchange in this tidal channel has reversed the classical <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> at the mudflat-channel boundary. The transport of suspended sediment through an estuary is determined by an intricate system of physical, biological, and chemical processes. The physical transport dynamics are sometimes described by a balance of particle settling and turbulent resuspension, but in a tidal channel that exchanges with a complex perimeter, this balance is overly simple. Along the channel's axis, resuspension is the main mechanism elevating suspended sediment concentrations on the flood, and particle settling reduces concentrations when slack tide arrives. On the ebb, horizontal advection results in quickly recovering concentrations of sediment before turbulent stresses increase enough to suspend material from the bed. Tidal asymmetries reflect the role of the settling and scour lags, and make this balance an unsteady one where the net transport is landward. The tidal asymmetry reverses and increases in magnitude in response to wet weather as newly deposited material works its way down-estuary on successive ebb tides. In the presence of irregular bathymetry, such as near the channel-mudflat boundary and inside a breached salt pond, much of the sediment deposited in the shallows cannot be resuspended on the ebb due to strong friction opposing tidal forcing, resulting in net deposition. The combination of low concentrations of suspended sediment in the shallows on ebb tides with bathymetrically generated shear in local velocities produces the periodic occurrence of high sediment concentrations near the water surface and low concentrations near the bed. This establishes the importance of the role of lateral advection on ebb tides. The presence of complex bathymetry therefore requires that horizontal advection and unsteadiness be accounted for when describing the mechanisms driving transport of suspended sediment. Understanding dispersion of scalars, such as salt and sediment, in an estuary over long timescales is critical for estuarine physics as well as managing the influence of humans on the environment. An irregular shoreline and accompanying bathymetry result in tidal trapping, a dispersive mechanism that arises from differences in phasing of flow velocities and scalar concentrations between the estuary's axis and its perimeter, as well as the variations in mixing between these regions. Classical theories describing the residual effects of tidal trapping assume that exchange between the estuary and perimeter is diffusive, but this framework neglects the role of tidal advection, such as the filling and draining of side-embayments, and the branching of flows into channel networks. A new theoretical framework is developed to represent estuarine dispersion from tidal trapping driven by advective exchange. The new advective framework compares well to observations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The MRC {{brain tumour}} {{prognostic}} index, which uses clinical variables to place patients in different outcome categories, {{has not been}} evaluated on a cohort outside a randomised controlled trial. The aims {{of this study were}} to (a) determine in a large cohort of patients, derived solely from one centre and not in a clinical trial, whether the MRC prognostic index stratified patients for outcome; (b) compare actual outcomes with those obtained in the original studies; and (c) examine whether neuropathological diagnosis was an independent prognostic variable.  METHODS—The MRC prognostic index was calculated for 236 patients with either glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma managed at a dedicated neuro-oncology clinic in Edinburgh between 1989 and 1995.  RESULTS—For this mixed population of malignant glioma the median survival was 8. 6 months. Two year survival was 72. 2 % for patients with an MRC index score of 1 - 10; 36. 3 % for those with an index score of 11 - 15; 25. 1 % for those scoring 16 - 20; 20. 4 % with those scoring 21 - 25; 4. 8 % with those scoring 26 - 33; and 0 % for those scoring 34 - 38. Exclusion of 79 patients who would not have been eligible for the MRC studies from which the index was derived, because they were either too old or did not receive radiotherapy, still resulted in a similar <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> but with significantly improved median survival times for the lowest two categories. Multivariate analysis of prognostic variables in the Edinburgh cohort showed that patients with anaplastic astrocytoma did significantly better than those with glioblastoma (p< 0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—Although there were some differences in median survival times between the patients in the original MRC studies and the Edinburgh cohort in similar prognostic categories and a tendency to improved two year survivorship in the Edinburgh cohort these differences have arisen because (a) the Edinburgh cohort was accrued about 10 years later than the MRC cohorts and thus had optimal radiotherapy; and (b) many Edinburgh patients were included in experimental and other chemotherapy studies on relapse. This study has shown that even outside the setting of a prospective controlled trial and with relaxed inclusion criteria the Medical Research Council (MRC) prognostic index is a robust predictor of outcome in patients with malignant glioma. Survival clearly declines as the prognostic index increases. Moreover, the prognostic model can be substantially improved by the addition of histology data, although {{there is some evidence that}} this will require complex modelling procedures. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{effects of}} two {{patterns}} of logging on the intragravel environment were studied in three Oregon coastal streams between June 1968 and June 1969. The watershed of one stream (Needle Branch) had been clearcut, {{and that of}} a second stream (Deer Creek) cut in staggered settings in 1966. A third watershed (Flynn Creek) served as an unlogged control. The dissolved oxygen content, biochemical oxygen demand, and temperature of the intragravel water were determined, {{as well as the}} size composition and organic content of the gravel. Changes were evaluated in terms of their effects on the survival of salmonid eggs and alevins. Water samples for analysis of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand were removed from the streambed by means of standpipes. Intragravel water temperature was obtained with a thermister probe forced into the redds and with thermograph probes buried at selected locations in the streambed. Gravel samples were removed from recent redds and from previously used spawning sites ("former redds") with a newly-developed sampler that incorporated dry ice and acetone to freeze an intact core of gravel around an iron pipe. Samples were cut into strata 8. 3 cm in depth and analyzed for size composition by volumetric displacement and for organic content by weight loss upon ignition. Dissolved oxygen in redds of Needle Branch averaged 7. 15 mg/ 1, whereas that in Deer Creek averaged 8. 91 mg/ 1 during 1969. Oxygen levels in Needle Branch redds in 1969 were 37. 4 percent lower than those reported in 1964. Oxygen in Deer Creek redds dropped 12. 7 percent in the same period. Dissolved oxygen at permanent standpipe locations was significantly lower than that in redds and showed greater variability. Oxygen levels were positively correlated with streamflow and negatively correlated with temperature. Organic content of the gravel ranged from 0. 33 to 7. 52 percent by weight; less than 3 percent of the organic material was larger than 6. 35 mm. The quantity of organic material was directly related to the amount of fine sediment in the sample. Recent redds in Needle Branch contained significantly less organic debris than did former redds. However, the organic content of redds in Needle Branch did not differ statistically from that in Deer and Flynn Creeks. The biochemical oxygen demand of the intragravel water averaged 1. 95 mg/ 1 for the three streams; differences among streams were not statistically significant. Stratification of fine sediment was evident in many redds, but a definite <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> could not be detected. Gravel size composition in Needle Branch did not differ statistically from that of the other streams. Recent redds in Needle Branch contained significantly less sediment than did former redds. Intragravel water temperature lagged from 2 to 6 hours behind surface temperature in attaining the diurnal maximum. Water temperature decreased with depth in the gravel in Needle Branch and Deer Creek on clear days, but the intragravel water was almost isothermal in Flynn Creek. Fluctuation in intragravel water temperature occurred as early as March, and maxima as great as 19. 7 °C were recorded prior to complete emergence of coho salmon. Surface and intragravel temperatures reflected the amount of shade over the stream surface. Survival to emergence of coho salmon appeared to be little affected by the observed changes in the intragravel environment...|$|E

Using nationally representative data, we find mixed support for these hypotheses. Socioeconomically disadvantaged parents and minority parents are less likely to provide estimates of college tuition and, when they provide estimates, tend to make larger errors. On average, though, parents provide upwardly biased estimates of cost that are uniform across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.

Evidence clearly indicates that stratification exists within scientific disci-plines (Allison, Long, and Krauze 1982; Cole and Cole 1973; Zuckerman 1988). 1 The production of knowledge by a few elite scholars has been characteristic of science since the emergence of scientific societies in 17 th century England (the Royal Society) and France (the French Academy). 2 The pattern has not changed significantly in contemporary science.

After mapping the social structure and introducing indicators of socioeconomic status, demographic features, and purchasing habits of individuals, we show that typical consumption patterns are strongly correlated with identified socioeconomic classes leading to <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> in the social structure. In addition, we measure correlations between merchant categories and introduce a correlation network, which emerges with a meaningful community structure. We detect multivariate relations between merchant categories and show correlations in purchasing habits of individuals. Finally, by analysing individual consumption histories, we detect dynamical patterns in purchase behaviour and their correlations with the socioeconomic status, demographic characters and the egocentric social network of individuals. Our work provides novel and detailed insight into the relations between social and consuming behaviour with potential applications in resource allocation, marketing, and recommendation system design...|$|R
40|$|This study compiles {{colocated}} oceanic {{observations of}} high-resolution vertical profiles of nitrate concentration and turbulent microstructure around the Svalbard shelf slope, covering both the permanently ice-free Fram Strait and the pack ice north of Svalbard. The authors present an overview over the seasonal {{evolution of the}} distribution of nitrate and its relation to upper ocean stratification. The average upward turbulent diffusive nitrate flux across the seasonal nitracline during the Arctic summer season is derived, with average values of 0. 3 and 0. 7 mmol m − 2 d − 1 for stations with and without ice cover, respectively. The increase under ice-free conditions is attributed to different <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> under sea ice versus open water. The nitrate flux obtained from microstructure measurements lacked a seasonal signal. However, bottle incubations indicate that August nitrate uptake was reduced by more than an order of magnitude relative to the May values. It remains inconclusive whether the new production was limited by an unidentified factor other than N O 3 − supply in late summer, or the uptake was underestimated by the incubation method. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} {{employing}} organizations divide up the tasks they do, and therefore how they structure their employees’ jobs. Much {{research in the}} past three decades has shown that employing organizations’ job structures determine the social, economic, and psychological outcomes experienced by workers, and thus determine <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> and social mobility. Although much {{attention has been paid to}} the consequences of organizational job structures, little has been done to analyze their causes. Our analysis of job structures in U. S. wineries adds to the handful of causal studies on this topic. Building on sociological theory, we predict that technical factors – scale and scope of operations – increase the complexity of job structures, specifically the number of job titles, functions delineated by those titles, and people with multiple job titles. We further predict that cultural factors – organizational age, prevailing notions of what is “normal,” and organizational form – influence job structures. We find strong effects of both technical and cultural factors. We also find that these forces can conflict and complement each other, and that the identities embedded in organizational forms determine whether and how technical and cultural factors affect job structures...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the relationship between economic restructuring, the changing division of labour and social stratification, with particular reference to New Zealand in the period since the 1980 s. It begins with a critique of theories of capitalist development, leading to the adoption of an approach which focuses on both the longterm evolution of the division of labour {{and the ways in which}} production and employment are subject to periodic upheavals from episodes of economic crisis and restructuring. The regulation approach is used to analyse the restructuring of the New Zealand economy following the global crisis of the 1970 s, which transformed it from a model based on mass production and interventionist regulation to one based on flexible production and liberal regulation. This provides a context for analysing related changes in employment, focussing particularly on the massive job losses in New Zealand’s goods-producing industries, the subsequent period of high unemployment and the eventual resurgence in job growth based on more flexible use of labour, expansion in producer and consumer service industries, and growth in both skilled and routine whitecollar occupations. The remainder of the thesis {{is concerned with}} the effects of these changes on <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> social <b>stratification.</b> A consideration <b>of</b> the theoretical and conceptual issues surrounding class, stratification and the division of labour leads to the development of a model of class structure based on relations of production and hierarchical divisions of labour. Census data is reclassified to fit the model and analysed to show changes in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> since the 1980 s, looking particularly at shifts in the relative size and composition of middle-class and working-class employment and the implications for class formation. The model is also used to analyse changes in structural inequalities between the sexes and between ethnic groups, with a focus on the ways in which different groups were affected by the restructuring process and how this was influenced by historically gendered and ethnicised divisions of labour. The thesis concludes with an assessment of the extent of change in employment and stratification and whether this is indicative of a transition to a post-industrial economy...|$|R

It is found that the social stratification in Sweden has decreased compared to other comparable countries and that this probably is due to increased equality outside of the educational sector and increased economic safety. However the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> social <b>stratification</b> in higher education, though weaker, persists with few changes. It is also found that the return to education increases with social class and the economic incentives to study at university level are, on the whole, lower for lower classes. litteraturöversikt; utbildning; socialgrupp...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{depletion}} {{in coastal}} and estuarine waters {{has been increasing}} rapidly around the globe {{over the past several}} decades, leading to decline in water quality and ecological health. In this study we apply a numerical model to understand how salt wedge dynamics, changes in river flow and temperature together control oxygen depletion in a micro-tidal riverine estuary, the Yarra River estuary, Australia. Coupled physical–biogeochemical models have been previously applied to study how hydrodynamics impact upon seasonal hypoxia; however, their application to relatively shallow, narrow riverine estuaries with highly transient <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> river inputs and sporadic periods of oxygen depletion has remained challenging, largely due to difficulty in accurately simulating salt wedge dynamics in morphologically complex areas. In this study we overcome this issue through application of a flexible mesh 3 -D hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model in order to predict the extent of salt wedge intrusion and consequent <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> oxygen depletion. The extent of the salt wedge responded quickly to the sporadic riverine flows, with the strength <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> and vertical density gradients heavily influenced by morphological features corresponding to shallow points in regions of tight curvature ("horseshoe" bends). The spatiotemporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> led to the emergence of two "hot spots" of anoxia, the first downstream of a shallow region of tight curvature and the second downstream of a sill. Whilst these areas corresponded to regions <b>of</b> intense <b>stratification,</b> it was found that antecedent conditions related to the placement of the salt wedge {{played a major role in}} the recovery of anoxic regions following episodic high flow events. Furthermore, whilst a threshold salt wedge intrusion was a requirement for oxygen depletion, analysis of the results allowed us to quantify the effect of temperature in determining the overall severity and extent of hypoxia and anoxia. Climate warming scenarios highlighted that oxygen depletion is likely to be exacerbated through changes in flow regimes and warming temperatures; however, the increasing risk of hypoxia and anoxia can be mitigated through management of minimum flow allocations and targeted reductions in organic matter loading. A simple statistical model (R 2 > 0. 65) is suggested to relate riverine flow and temperature to the extent of estuary-wide anoxia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} cross-national {{differences}} in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> gender economic inequality, revealing their affinity to both welfare state policies and prevailing conceptions of gender equality. By mapping multiple aspects of inequality and assembling them into distinctive profiles, the paper shows that each <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> state intervention {{is accompanied by}} an uneven record of achievements and failures in promoting gender equality. These tradeoffs can best be understood by placing them in the ideological contexts in which gender-related policies are embedded. Empirical illustrations are provided for four countries - Sweden, the USA, Germany and Italy - in each of which both the welfare state and the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>stratification</b> are qualitatively distinct. Data are presented on labor force participation, women's placement in the occupational and wage hierarchies, their economic wellbeing, and their autonomy from male partners...|$|R

However, like many regions where marine mega-fauna gather, these waters are also {{the focus of a}} flourishing local eco-tourism and whale watching industry. Our aim was to establish current trends in habitat preference in female-calf humpback whale pairs within this region, focusing specifically on the busy, eastern portions of the channel. We used an equally-spaced zigzag transect survey design, compiled our results in a GIS model to identify spatial trends and calculated Neu’s Indices to quantify levels of habitat use. Our study revealed that while mysticete female-calf pairs on breeding grounds typically favor shallow, inshore waters, female-calf pairs in the Au’au Channel avoided shallow waters (, 20 m) and regions within 2 km of the shoreline. Preferred regions for female-calf pairs comprised water depths between 40 – 60 m, regions of rugged bottom topography and regions that lay between 4 and 6 km from a small boat harbor (Lahaina Harbor) that fell within the study area.

40|$|Social {{psychological}} theorizing {{assumes that}} 1) members of dominant and oppressed racial groups {{subscribe to the}} same set of cultural beliefs regarding the racial hierarchy in the United States and 2) that <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> deference in task groups reflect broader <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> inequality in society. With the use white and black research participants at two research sites, this thesis examines these assumptions with regards to the proposed tri-racial hierarchy of the Latin Americanization Thesis, which asserts that the racial hierarchy in the U. S. is now primarily determined by phenotype, as opposed to traditional racial and ethnic boundaries. Do White and Black Americans associate similar perceptions of status with members of the proposed tri-racial hierarchy? In addition, skin tone is associated with socioeconomic status among blacks in the U. S., but do research participants defer to members of the pigmentocracy {{in a manner consistent with}} these broader <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> inequality? These questions are assessed by matching white and black research participants with either a white, light-skinned black, or dark-skinned black partner for the completion of a joint task. The results of the multi-site experiment suggest that there is racial invariance with the perceived status associated with members of the pigmentocracy. More generally, whites exhibit <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> active denial and report that most others believe dark-skinned blacks are more competent than light-skinned blacks, who most others believe are more competent than whites. Whites purportedly personally subscribe to these <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> beliefs. Blacks, however, exhibit a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> active resistance to stigmatizing beliefs: while they report that oppressed members of the pigmentocracy are held in lower regard by most others in society, they refuse to personally endorse these stigmatizing beliefs. These attitudinal reactions had implications for the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> deference that emerged when jointly completing the group task. While <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> influence emergent in group tasks generally reflect broader <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> in society, this failed to be the case when participants interacted with members of the pigmentocracy most phenotypically distinct from themselves. That is, when racial distinctions were most salient, research participants consciously reacted against the pigmentocracy, obstructing the activation of the status generalization process. The implications of these results for model testing and development, and for identifying racial biases in the current racial climate are discussed...|$|R
