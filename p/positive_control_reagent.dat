40|$|Background: β -Thalassaemia, an {{autosomal}} recessive hemoglobinopathy, {{is one of}} the commonest genetically transmitted disorders throughout the world. Collective measures including carrier identification, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis are required for preventing β-thalassemia. Aim: To achieve this objective, Identification of the spectrum of genetic mutations, especially for various ethnic backgrounds in Pakistan. Therefore, we designed a cross sectional prospective study to identify the frequency of various gene mutations in different ethnic groups of Pakistan. Materials and Methods: Over a 5 -year period, DNA from 648 blood samples {including specimens of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) } were analyzed for the twelve most common β-thalassemia mutations found in the Pakistani population by a Multiplex amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). Each sample was analyzed for the mutation as well as the normal gene, appropriate with negative and <b>positive</b> <b>controls,</b> and <b>reagent</b> blanks. Results: Out of 648 samples mutations were identified in 640 (98. 75 %) samples by multiplex ARMS. 8 common β-thalassemia mutations were identified in 8 different ethnic groups accounting for 93. 9 % of the β-thalasemia alleles. Conclusions: Based on the outcome of this study a cost effective proposal is formulated for detection of β-thalassemia mutations...|$|R
40|$|Tularemia, {{caused by}} Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis), is a {{zoonotic}} disease transmitted through contact with infected animals and contaminated environment. The disease {{has been reported}} from many {{countries of the world}} but no study has been done in Pakistan. In the current project, a total of 2280 soil samples representing 456 villages of eight districts of Punjab province were collected from way-points having human-animal interaction, processed for genomic extraction and tested through real time PCR for presence or absence of F. tularensis. Association of risk factors was determined from data such as gender and age of animals, plough method, irrigation system, fertilizer type used, availability of veterinary services, level of farmer education, physical and chemical composition of the soil. Moreover serum samples (n= 707) collected randomly from goat (n = 200), sheep (n = 175), cattle (n = 179), and buffalo (n = 153) were analyzed for antibodies against F. tularensis by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seventy four soil samples (3. 24 percent) were found positive for F. tularensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed 100 percent similarity index with F. tularensis sub specie holarctica reported from other regions like USA, Sweden, Spain, Turkey and Germany. Presence of F. tularensis in soil showed negative association with increase in number of human density (0. 7159; 0. 3834 0. 2054). Prevalence of anti- Ft ELISA antibodies were significantly higher (p 0. 05) between small and large ruminants. Whereas, rain-irrigation system (2. 96 : 1. 35 - 6. 48), lack of veterinary services (4. 77 : 1. 26 - 18. 03) and use of organic fertilizer (5. 3 : 11. 38 - 20. 39) have positive association with prevalence of anti- Ft ELISA antibodies in the serum. Sero-prevalence of F. tularensis in the animals has significant association with quantity of clay in soil (p< 0. 05). A conventional PCR based test has also been optimized for detection of F. tularensis using tul 4 gene specific primers. Specificity of primer showed Ft detection in soil DNA in the presence of other cross-reactive organism. Sensitivity was determined in two fold dilutions with detection limit of up to 320 pg/µL. Utilizing pET 28 a vector, a construct was prepared containing transformed tul 4 gene (450 bp) showing 100 percent sequence homology to query gene sequence.

The objective of this 90 -day study was to characterize differences in biological activity between two quartz species, ground quartz particles (well-characterized <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> DQ 12) versus a quartz-containing material (geologically ancient Quartz Isolate from bentonite). Total doses of 15. 2 mg/kg body weight of the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> and Quartz Isolate were administered to rats by intratracheal instillation. Controls received saline only. Bronchoalveolar lavagate analysis showed that, relative to the controls, the total leukocyte counts at 3 days were significantly elevated in both the Quartz Isolate and <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> groups. At 28 and 90 days, the Quartz Isolate values were no longer statistically different from the control values whereas the corresponding <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> values were about 12 and 65 times greater than control values. At 3, 28 and 90 days, the percentages of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were 18 %, 25 % and 32 % for the Quartz Isolate group and 39 %, 45 % and 46 % for the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group, respectively. Histopathologically, the Quartz Isolate group showed moderate effects compared to controls after 28 days with no progression of severity at 90 days. In contrast, the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group exhibited more severe effects at 28 days and a progression in intensity at 90 days. In conclusion, in the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group, a persistent inflammation (interstitial fibrosis, alveolar lipoproteinosis) was observed.

40|$|A {{total of}} 294 nursery pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, {{initially}} 15. 2 lb, 3 d postweaning) {{were used in}} a 28 -d trial to evaluate the effects on growth performance of eliminating specific crystalline amino acids from a low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet. On d 3 after weaning, pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments. A 2 -phase diet series was used, with treatment diets fed from d 0 to 14 and a common diet fed from d 14 to 28. All diets were in meal form. The formulation was {{based on data from}} previous trials in which fish meal was replaced with crystalline amino acids in the diet for 15 - to 25 -lb pigs. The objective of this trial was to determine which amino acids are required in this low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet. The <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet contained L-lysine HCl, DL-methionine, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine. The 6 treatments were (1) <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> (2) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine deleted from the diet, (3) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-tryptophan deleted, (4) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> L-valine deleted, (5) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-glutamine and L-glycine deleted, and (6) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine deleted from diet (negative control). There were 7 pigs per pen and 7 pens per treatment. Pigs and feeders were weighed on d 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to calculate ADG, ADFI, and F/G. From d 0 to 14, pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet had improved (P 0. 40) ADG, ADFI, and F/G to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> but had improved (P 0. 12) ADG to the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> There were no differences (P > 0. 10) in ADFI from d 14 to 28. Because of the decrease in ADG from d 0 to 14, pigs fed the negative control or diets without L-tryptophan or L-valine had decreased (P < 0. 04) ADG for the overall trial (d 0 to 28) compared to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> ADFI from all treatment diets decreased compared to the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> although only the negative control group tested significantly (P 0. 24) in F/G for the overall data. In conclusion, L-tryptophan and L-valine were needed in the low-CP, high amino acid-fortified nursery diet to achieve maximum growth performance from 15 to 25 lb. This suggests that the tryptophan:lysine and valine:lysine requirements are greater than 15 and 57 % of lysine, respectively. The numerical decrease in performance when L-glutamine and L-glycine were removed from the diet during the first period suggests a need for nonessential nitrogen in the low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet or a benefit to one of these amino acids separate from its role as a nitrogen source...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings A recombinant human IgG 4 antibody to Ov 16 was identified by screening against a syn-thetic human Fab phage display library and converted into human IgG 4. This antibody was developed into different <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> formulations for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) platforms. Variation in ELISA results and util-ity as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> of the antibody were assessed from multiple laboratories. Tempera-ture and humidity conditions were collected across seven surveillance activities from 2011 – 2014 to inform stability requirements for RDTs and <b>positive</b> <b>controls.</b> The feasibility of th...|$|R
40|$|Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) {{measure the}} {{relative}} expression levels of a protein in many samples simultaneously. Observed signal from these arrays {{is a combination}} of true signal, additive background, and multiplicative spatial effects. Background subtraction alone is not sufficient to remove all nonbiological trends from the data. We developed a surface adjustment that uses information from <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> spots to correct for spatial trends on the array beyond additive background. This method uses a generalized additive model to estimate a smoothed surface from <b>positive</b> <b>controls.</b> When <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> are printed in a dilution series, a nested surface adjustment performs an intensity-based correction. When applicable, surface adjustment is able to remove spatial trends and increase within slide replicate agreement better than background subtraction alone as demonstrated on two sets of arrays. This work demonstrates the importance of including <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> spots on the array...|$|R
40|$|In a {{study on}} bioassay-directed {{chemical}} factionation of sediment extracts, problems were encountered using benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> in the Mutatox™ bacterial genotoxicity assay. Genotoxic responses of tests with this compound, prescribed by the Mutatox supplier, could only be measured using supersaturated concentrations that exceeded its aqueous solubility more than 250 times. Additional to three obvious requirements for a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> of this test system (it should demonstrate that the bacteria are alive and grow after reconstitution, that the bacteria are mutated, and that the bacteria emit light), a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> should meet two criteria: the metabolic routes of genotoxic response induction for <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and test compound(s) should be identical, and test concentrations (of both <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and test compound) should be at environmentally relevant concentrations, i. e., below the aqueous solubilities. As BaP does not meet this last criterion, it does not fully qualify as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> in testing genotoxicity of solutes with the Mutatox assay. Testing of other unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHS) did not yield another PAH as choice for <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> Furthermore, {{the results of our}} study imply that calculating the bioavailability of BaP from the aqueous solubility alone is not sufficient, as this tends to underestimate the amount of BaP available to either the S 9 enzyme system or the bacteria, whereas the interference between toxic and genotoxic effects hampered the interpretation of test results, as variations in toxicity may be interpreted as variations in genotoxicity. Quantitative S 9 -mediated genotoxicity assessments using the Mutatox test appeared difficult to make, as the two parameters that are proposed by the supplier (CMR, concentration of maximum genotoxic response, and LOEC, lowest observable [genotoxic] effect concentration) showed significant dependency on the sensitivity of the S 9 system toward the test compound (CMR) or the initial test compound concentration (LOEC...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of immunohistochemistry, {{antibody}} control tissues are an important and necessary part of the quality <b>control</b> of the <b>reagents</b> {{that are used to}} determine if a tumor or other structure is positive or negative. Many pathologists prefer to use known positive tumor tissue as their <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> others prefer a sausage block control, and some use normal tissues that are known to contain the specific antigen that they are trying to identify. For many laboratories, obtaining specific tumor controls can be a problem.

40|$|Radiotherapy causes various {{complications}} including low immunity. Past {{research has}} shown that the low immunity is due to the low amount of lymphocytes and consumption of citrullus vulgaris will alleviate this problem. Based on this a study was conducted to identify how citrullus vulgaris was able to produce radioprotection on the lymphocyte membrane. A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used and divided into three equals groups of <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> negative control and treatment. For seven days, <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and negative control were force fed with normal saline of 40 ml/kg animal weight while the treatment group received 40 g/kg animal weight fresh juice of citrullus vulgaris daily. After a week <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and treatment group were irradiated with 0. 9 Gy gamma ray. Viable lymphocyte were determined using propidium iodine and acridine orange stain. Results clearly shows that <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> negative and treatment group were significantly different at 34 3 %, 80 2 % and 71 2 % respectively.

40|$|We {{examined}} the mechanisms {{and efficacy of}} Codonopsis lanceolata water extract (CLW) for treating type 2 diabetic (T 2 DM) symptoms. Partial pancreatectomized (Px) rats, a non-obese T 2 DM model, were provided high fat diets containing cellulose (control), 0. 3 % (CLW-L) or 1 % CLW (CLW-H) for eight weeks. The <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> group was provided with rosiglitazone (20 mg/kg bw/day). The control group had lower epididymal fat masses than the CLW and the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> groups, possibly due to urinary glucose loss, although CPT- 1 and SIRT- 1 expression was higher in the CLW group. CLW-H significantly reduced serum glucose levels and urinary glucose loss compared to the untreated control. The improvement of glucose utilization {{was associated with a}} higher fat mass in the CLW-H and <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> groups. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was higher in the untreated control than other groups and CLW tightly regulated insulin secretion as much as the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> and it was much tighter than the untreated control. Glucose infusion rates were higher during the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in the CLW and <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> than the untreated control, and liver glucose outputs were lower during basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions in the CLW and <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> groups than the untreated control group. The increased hepatic insulin sensitivity was associated with enhanced insulin signaling in CLW (pAkt➔pGSK- 1 β). In conclusion, CLW consumption effectively alleviated diabetic symptoms by improving insulin sensitivity, potentiating hepatic insulin signaling and tightly regulating the insulin secretion capacity in non-obese T 2 DM rats...|$|R
