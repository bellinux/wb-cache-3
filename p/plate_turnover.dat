Herein, we investigated {{the time course of}} collagen II cleavage and fibril disruption in the well-validated Hartley guinea pig model of spontaneous OA of the knee. MethodsKnee joints of 46 male Hartley guinea pigs were analyzed at 3 weeks, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 18 months of age for histological severity of OA, cartilage collagen fibril disruption by semi-quantitative polarized light microscopy, and expression of type II collagen degradation biomarkers, 9 A 4 and Coll 2 - 1, by immunohistochemistry. In addition, serum biomarkers specific for collagen II degradation, CTX-II, C 2 C, and Coll 2 - 1 were quantified. ResultsCollagen fibril disruption and expression of the collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitope, 9 A 4, were observed as early as 2 months of age, despite the appearance of histological OA at 4 months of age. Only serum Coll 2 - 1 increased coincident with the early disruption of the collagen fibril between 3 weeks and 7 months, in contrast to serum C 2 C, which did not change significantly or correlate with histological severity.

40|$|ABSTRACT The growth {{plates of}} birds reared for meat {{production}} {{are susceptible to}} diseases such as tibial dyschondroplasia (TD). We have modified a tibial explant culture system to study the regulation of growth <b>plate</b> cartilage <b>turnover.</b> The purpose of these experiments was to characterize some of the biochemical changes that occur in cultured tibiae as the cartilage is degraded. Tibiae were dissected from 12 -d-old embryos and cultured in medium formulated for chondrocytes. Proteoglycan and nitric ox-ide concentrations as well as metalloproteinase and lac-tate dehydrogenase activities were measured in recov-ered media. Metalloproteinase activity was also measured in cartilage extracts from tibiae collected every 2 d during the culture period. Proteoglycan and nitric oxide concen-trations in recovered media increased after 8 d in cultur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Bisphosphonates {{decrease}} chondrocyte turnover at {{the growth}} plate and impact bone growth. Likewise vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{plays an important}} role in endochondral bone elongation by influencing chondrocyte turnover at the growth plate. To investigate whether the action of bisphosphonate on the growth plate works through VEGF, VEGF protein expression and isoform transcription in endochondral chondrocytes isolated from growing mice and treated with a clinically used bisphosphonate, alendronate, were assessed. Alendronate at 10 M and 100 M concentrations decreased secreted VEGF protein expression but not cell associated protein. Bisphosphonates are known to inhibit the mevalonate intracellular signaling pathway used by VEGF. Addition of the mevalonate pathway intermediates farnesol (FOH) and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) interacted with the low concentration of alendronate to further decrease secreted VEGF protein whereas FOH partially restored VEGF protein secretion when combined with the high alendronate. Similar to the protein data, the addition of alendronate decreased VEGF mRNA isoforms. VEGF mRNA levels were rescued by the GGOH mevalonate pathway intermediate at the low alendronate dose whereas neither intermediate consistently restored the VEGF mRNA levels at the high alendronate dose. Thus, the bisphophonate alendronate impairs growth <b>plate</b> chondrocyte <b>turnover</b> by down-regulating the secreted forms of VEGF mRNA and protein by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway...|$|R
