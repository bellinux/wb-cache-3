5|$|Hebron {{glass is}} an {{attraction}} for {{both domestic and}} foreign tourists. Today, however, due to ongoing export problems, the decline in tourism, and restrictions on Palestinian freedom of movement {{in the aftermath of}} the Second Intifada, industry <b>production</b> <b>has</b> suffered. According to Nazmi al-Ju'bah, the director of RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation, under these circumstances, the survival of the Hebron glass industry is in question.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate <b>production</b> <b>has</b> the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E
5|$|Lithium <b>production</b> <b>has</b> greatly {{increased}} {{since the end}} of World War II. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals. The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450°C.|$|E
5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European steel <b>production</b> <b>has</b> been the {{smelting}} of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.|$|E

Since 2012, <b>production</b> <b>has</b> also included Volkswagen up! and badge-engineered SEAT Mii and Skoda Citigo.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{production}} of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only {{started in the}} 1870s after {{the discovery of the}} Diamond fields in South Africa. <b>Production</b> <b>has</b> increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5billion carats have been mined since that date. About 20% of that amount has been mined in the last 5 years alone, and during the last ten years 9 new mines have started production while 4 more are waiting to be opened soon. Most of these mines are located in Canada, Zimbabwe, Angola, and one in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; <b>production</b> <b>has</b> since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E

5|$|In August 2005, the Swedish concept {{designer}} Niklas Jansson {{created an}} adaptation of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, superimposing the Flying Spaghetti Monster over God. This became and remains the Flying Spaghetti Monster's de facto brand image. The Hunger Artists Theatre Company produced a comedy called The Flying Spaghetti Monster Holiday Pageant in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism. The <b>production</b> <b>has</b> spawned a sequel called Flying Spaghetti Monster Holy Mug of Grog, performed in December 2008. This communal activity {{attracted the attention of}} three University of Florida religious scholars, who assembled a panel at the 2007 American Academy of Religion meeting to discuss the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, the {{disconnect}} with local <b>production</b> <b>has</b> had an {{adverse effect on}} quality; for example, in the 1990s, some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus Tylopilus, which are rather similar in appearance, and when dried, are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from Boletus. Tylopilus species typically have a very bitter taste, a bitterness that is imparted to the flavour of the porcini {{with which they are}} mixed.|$|E
5|$|The Apache {{originally}} {{started as}} the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army's Advanced Attack Helicopter program {{to replace the}} AH-1 Cobra. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The first production AH-64D Apache Longbow, an upgraded Apache variant, was delivered to the Army in March 1997. <b>Production</b> <b>has</b> been continued by Boeing Defense, Space & Security; over 2,000 AH-64s have been produced to date.|$|E

5|$|The Chronic {{peaked at}} number {{three on the}} Billboard 200 and had been {{certified}} triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with sales of 5.7 million copies in the United States, which led to Dr. Dre {{becoming one of the}} top ten best-selling American performing artists of 1993. Dr. Dre's <b>production</b> <b>has</b> been noted for popularizing the G-funk subgenre within gangsta rap. The Chronic has been widely {{regarded as one of the}} most important and influential albums of the 1990s and regarded by many fans and peers to be one of the most well-produced hip hop albums of all time. The Chronic was ranked at #138 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.|$|E
5|$|The barite {{reserves}} are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion tonnes. The maximum production, 8.3 million tonnes, {{was produced in}} 1981, but only 7–8% was used for barium metal or compounds. Barite <b>production</b> <b>has</b> risen since {{the second half of}} the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011.

5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War <b>production</b> <b>has</b> markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E

Since its 2003 debut, Wicked has broken box office records around the world, currently holding weekly-gross-takings records in Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis, and London. In the week ending January 2, 2011, the London, Broadway and both North American touring productions simultaneously broke their respective records for the highest weekly gross. In the final week of 2013, the Broadway production broke this record again, earning $3.2 million. The West End production and the North American tour have each been seen by over two million patrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in <b>production</b> <b>has</b> caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the glass}} was melted using local raw materials, {{including}} sand from neighbouring villages, sodium carbonate (from the Dead Sea), and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide. Nowadays, recycled glass {{is often used}} instead. Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city. The products made include glass jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained glass windows, and glass lamps.
