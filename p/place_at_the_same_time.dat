5|$|On 17 June 2013, the {{municipality}} executive of Aalborg {{decided not to}} bid for hosting the contest due to the city's lack of sufficient hotel capacity.

5|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{received}} the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine poll, but many votes were disqualified {{as they had been}} posted from the same <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> and were written in green ink; although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes. This meant that the Beatles reached the top position, with the Hurricanes coming fourth, even though the Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves. Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses when he left the hospital after breaking a leg during a performance, or playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.|$|E
5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E
