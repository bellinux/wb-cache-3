Toponymic evidence implies the presence of the Anglo-Saxons and Norsemen in the locality, and inscribed stones discovered in 1986 at Lowhouse Farm, one of which has Latin text, suggest the existence of a 9th-century Anglo-monastic site, or of a Viking-Age literate community from Milnrow, Rochdale or the surrounding region.|$|E
