40|$|A sharp {{increase}} in 2005 of pp'DDT and its metabolites was observed in mussels and fish from lakes Como and Iseo, the main glacier-fed southern Alpine lakes. DDTs in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were more than 150 times higher than levels in 2003, and concentrations in pelagic fish (0. 12 mg kg(- 1) w. w.) exceeded the Italian safety threshold for human consumption (0. 05 mg kg(- 1) w. w.). The histological examination of the ovaries revealed many mussels with oocyte degeneration throughout the studied period. Prior to being banned in Italy in 1978, DDT was used in large amounts for fruit-tree treatment from the 1950 s to 1970 s in valleys just below the glaciers. Since glacier volume was increasing {{at that time and}} then continuously retreated, meltwater should be the main cause of the <b>pollution</b> <b>peak</b> recently observed in biota of downstream lakes.

We performed on-farm pesticide use surveys during 87 weeks and monitored pesticides in water weekly during 67 weeks at the outlet of a small catchment in Martinique. We identified three types of pollution. First, we showed long-term chronic pollution by chlordecone, diuron and metolachlor resulting from horticultural practices applied 5 - 20 years ago (quantification frequency higher than 80 %). Second, we showed <b>peak</b> <b>pollution.</b> High amounts of propiconazole and fosthiazate applied at low frequencies caused river <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks</b> for weeks following a single application. Low amounts of diquat and diazinon applied at low frequencies also caused <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks.</b> The high amounts of glyphosate applied at high frequency resulted into <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks</b> by glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in 6 and 20 % of the weeks.

Third, relatively low amounts of glufosinate-ammonium, difenoconazol, spinosad and metaldehyde were applied at high frequencies. Unexpectedly, such pesticides remained barely detected (< 1. 5 %) or undetected in water samples. We showed that AMPA, fosthiazate and propiconazole have serious leaching potential.

40|$|The Paris {{agglomeration}} is a {{major source}} of pollutants that can stay trapped in the atmospheric boundary layer (BL), making BL depth a crucial parameter that modulates pollutant concentrations and peak intensity. It is commonly assumed that pollutants, except very short-lived species, are well mixed in the BL, implying that the BL integrated content (column) can easily compare with ground-based in-situ measurements using BL depth. On a few day case study chosen during the MEGAPOLI field campaign, we analyze Airparif in-situ air quality measurements at ground level and at the Eiffel Tower summit and interpret the differences using BL observations from an elastic backscatter lidar located in Qualair station, in central Paris.

40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) measurements {{have been}} performed in a forested site in central Greece {{in the framework of}} the AEROBIC (AEROsol formation from Biogenic Carbon) campaign in summer 1997. The mean CO observed during the whole campaign ranged between 114 and 250 ppbv (mean of 170 +/- 27 ppbv), reflecting continental influence. The observed mean diurnal cycle of CO presented a minimum in the early morning due to the efficient deposition of CO in a shallow nocturnal layer sealed from the free tropospheric air during the night (loss rates of about 2 ppbv h(- 1)). In the early morning and in the late afternoon, a sharp and fluctuating increase of CO was observed as the consequence of CO primary sources, likely by local traffic as suggested by the concomitant enhancements of black carbon (BC) and other combustion tracers. The morning <b>pollution</b> <b>peak</b> (6 : 30 - 8 : 30 local time) preceded slightly the opening of the nocturnal layer to the free troposphere, which resulted in CO reduction down to background levels at about 10 : 00, During the day (10 : 00 - 17 : 00), a slight but regular increase was observed on CO levels. For lack of simultaneous increase of Other anthropogenic tracers, this CO enhancement has been attributed to its photochemical formation initiated by the oxidation of reactive biogenic hydrocarbons. This observed net production of CO averaging 1. 2 ppbv h(- 1) is quite well reproduced by a box model containing an explicit chemical scheme of isoprene and alpha- and beta-pinene and taking into account the measured mixing ratios and the reactivity of all biogenic organic reactive compounds when uncertainties in measurements and modelling are considered.

This methodology is illustrated {{on a case}} study: {{the design of a}} "software" or "virtual" sensor of ammonia. Ammonia {{is one of the main}} indicator of water pollution. Its monitoring is thus needed to assess the water quality in rivers and in waste water treatment plants. Some important decisions are derived from this monitoring: in a river, the intake of a downstream drinking water production plant should be closed to avoid a <b>pollution</b> <b>peak.</b> In a waste water treatment plant, an efficient feedback control requires the real-time estimation of the ammonia concentration. The availability of the measurements is therefore crucial. Meanwhile, although commercial available ammonia sensors are improving, they are still expensive to buy and to maintain. Furthermore, they are not reliable in the long-term, and their long response time (10 - 25 minutes) causes delays in rising alarms, and difficulties in standard feedback control [9]. It is thus essential to estimate the ammonia concentration by other means than the physical sensor, i. e. by a software sensor. A software sensor computes an estimate of some quantity of interest, based on a mathematical model and other (faithful) measurements. The computed estimate may be used in place of the measurement when the latter is missing, or as a tool to validate an unreliable physical measurement. In most real world applications, the software sensor estimate will not be as accurate as a carefully tuned physical sensor. If it is designed to replace a physical sensor, the user should be ready to encounter an accuracy loss. But the software sensor has other purposes. It may give predictions of la [...] ...|$|E
40|$|After {{completing}} a 9 -month field experiment studying {{air pollution and}} meteorology in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, we set up the mesoscale meteorological model MM 5 to simulate the Kathmandu Valley's meteorology with a horizontal resolution of up to 1 km. After testing the model against available data, we used it to address specific questions to understand the factors that control the observed diurnal cycle of air pollution in this urban basin in the Himalayas. We studied {{the dynamics of the}} basin's nocturnal cold air pool, its dissipation in the morning, and the subsequent growth and decay of the mixed layer over the valley. During mornings, we found behavior common to large basins, with upslope flows and basin-center subsidence removing the nocturnal cold air pool. During afternoons the circulation in the Kathmandu Valley exhibited patterns common to plateaus, with cooler denser air originating over lower regions west of Kathmandu arriving through mountain passes and spreading across the basin floor, thereby reducing the mixed layer depth. We also examined the pathways of pollutant ventilation out of the valley. The bulk of the pollution ventilation takes place during the afternoon, when strong westerly winds blow in through the western passes of the valley, and the pollutants are rapidly carried out through passes on the east and south sides of the valley. In the evening, pollutants first accumulate near the surface, but then are lifted slightly when katabatic flows converge underneath. The elevated polluted layers are mixed back down in the morning, contributing to the morning <b>pollution</b> <b>peak.</b> Later in the morning a fraction of the valley's pollutants travels up the slopes of the valley rim mountains before the westerly winds begin.

40|$|Dating of {{sediment}} cores from the Baltic Sea {{has proven to}} be difficult due to uncertainties surrounding the 14 C reservoir age and a scarcity of macrofossils suitable for dating. Here we present the results of multiple dating methods carried out on cores in the Gotland Deep area of the Baltic Sea. Particular emphasis is placed on the Littorina stage (8 ka ago to the present) of the Baltic Sea and possible changes in the 14 C reservoir age of our dated samples. Three geochronological methods are used. Firstly, palaeomagnetic secular variations (PSV) are reconstructed, whereby ages are transferred to PSV features through comparison with varved lake sediment based PSV records. Secondly, lead (Pb) content and stable isotope analysis are used to identify past peaks in anthropogenic atmospheric Pb pollution. Lastly, 14 C determinations were carried out on benthic foraminifera (Elphidium spec.) samples from the brackish Littorina stage of the Baltic Sea. Determinations carried out on smaller samples (as low as 4 µg C) employed an experimental, state-of-the-art method involving the direct measurement of CO 2 from samples by a gas ion source without the need for a graphitisation step - the first time this method has been performed on foraminifera in an applied study. The PSV chronology, based on the uppermost Littorina stage sediments, produced ten age constraints between 6. 29 and 1. 29 cal ka BP, and the Pb depositional analysis produced two age constraints associated with the Medieval <b>pollution</b> <b>peak.</b> Analysis of PSV data shows that adequate directional data can be derived from both the present Littorina saline phase muds and Baltic Ice Lake stage varved glacial sediments. Ferrimagnetic iron sulphides, most likely authigenic greigite (Fe 3 S 4), present in the intermediate Ancylus Lake freshwater stage sediments acquire a gyroremanent magnetisation during static alternating field (AF) demagnetisation, preventing the identification of a primary natural remanent magnetisation for these sediments. An inferred marine reservoir age offset (deltaR) is calculated by comparing the foraminifera 14 C determinations to a PSV & Pb age model. This deltaR is found to trend towards younger values upwards in the core, possibly due to a gradual change in hydrographic conditions brought about by a reduction in marine water exchange from the open sea due to continued isostatic rebound...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} years, {{polymeric}} membranes {{have been used}} as passive samplers to assess hydrophobic organic contaminant concentrations in aquatic environments. The amount of contaminant accumulated in situ during long exposure periods enables the determination of a so called time-weighted average dissolved concentration in water, which is supposed to assimilate the contamination variations over time (Huckins et al., 1993). The objectives of this study were (i) to show if polymeric membranes are reliable to quantify micropollutants in the receiving environment by comparing the actual exposure concentration to the mean concentration estimated by the sampler; (ii) to understand how polymeric membranes assimilate a concentration that varies over time. After being spiked with PRCs, two types of polymeric membranes (LDPE and PDMS) were deployed during 21 days in channels bypassing the French river Gave in Lacq. The flow rate was controlled in the channels and three scenarios of pollution were tested. The first scenario reproduced chronic pollution by continuous injection of PAHs (anthracene, chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene). Two levels were tested: Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) level and 1 / 3 of the EQS level. The second scenario reproduced an accidental pollution by an injection of PAHs in the river during the first 3 days of the 21 -day exposure. The third scenario was a discontinuous pollution with injection of PAHs during 3 periods of 3 days separated by 4 days. For the two latest scenarios, the same quantity of PAHs was released than during the first scenario. A duplicate of each sampler were retrieved at various time intervals to follow the PAH accumulation and the PRC elimination. During the experiment, grab samples of water were regularly analysed. PRC elimination and PAH accumulation were simultaneously observed for all the compounds allowing the determination of the time-weighted average dissolved concentrations in water for each duration of exposure. For the first scenario with continuous injections of PAHs, the concentrations calculated from passive samplers were the same for all exposure durations and consistent with the quantity of PAHs released in the channel. These results validated the laboratory calibration of kinetic parameters (presented in another IPSW abstract: Lorgeoux et al. 2013) and the use of PRC to correct in situ environmental exposure conditions. For the second and third scenarios with discontinuous injections, the accumulated quantities of PAHs followed the means of exposure concentrations. For the heaviest PAHs (chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene) the calculated concentrations were consistent with the average concentrations of grab samples. This demonstrates that polymeric membranes really incorporate changes in concentration over time for these molecules. For anthracene, the results also were conclusive for the scenario with 3 injections of 3 days. But for a single injection during the first 3 days of the 21 -day period, most anthracene were desorbed leading to a measured concentration underestimated compared to the theoretical value. For PAHs of low molecular weight, the exchange kinetics seems too fast to assimilate a <b>pollution</b> <b>peak</b> in the time-weighted concentration...|$|E

The presentation (movie) illustrates some of the major findings related to atmospheric composition changes as monitored by IASI during the last 10 years. It relies on accurate data available in near real time along with an excellent horizontal coverage. We will show the global scale mapping of gases, along with the detection of dust and ash particles, as well as the potential of the mission to catch special events such as volcanic eruptions, large fires and <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceExperimental {{studies and}} {{numerical}} modeling {{were conducted to}} assess the feasibility of a granular activated carbon column to buffer load variations of contaminants before wastewater treatment devices. Studies of cycles of adsorption, and more especially desorption, of methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and 2, 4 -dimethylphenol (2, 4 -DMP) {{have been carried out}} on granular activated carbon (GAC). Dynamic variations of contaminants concentrations were run at several conditions of duration (peaks). GAC fixed-bed exhibited a stable adsorption/desorption capacity after undergoing two conditioning cycles. The study of <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks</b> revealed that attenuation is largely dependent on the targeted pollutant: 2. 4 ± 0. 5 % attenuation/cm of bed for MDEA and 6. 0 ± 1. 2 % attenuation/cm of bed for 2, 4 -DMP. Mass balances calculated from both injected and recovered pollutant during peaks were respected. Finally, a coupling of the linear driving force model and isotherms models was used to fit experimental data for both adsorption breakthrough curves and desorption curves. The model was used to predict adsorption and desorption behaviors of following cycles. Good agreement with experimental values was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Wallonia (the Walloon Region of Belgium) has {{implemented}} the Nitrates Directive by designating four vulnerable zones (15 % of the territory) and introducing an Action programme {{at the start}} of November 2002. The Action programme entails various means of reducing the risks of the pollution of water by nitrate: (a) struggle against nitrate losses in fields using a range of good agricultural practices, including certain restrictions on the use of fertilisers (quantities, time periods, soil conditions, etc.), (b) keeping a balance on each farm between the organic nitrogen produced and utilisation capacities on agricultural land, (c) adapting storehouses for livestock effluent to a capacity of 6 months and perfect watertightness, and (d) promoting transfers of livestock effluent between farms in excess and farms which still have a way of using it on their land. In Wallonia, nitrate-related problems are obvious in several groundwater bodies and the development over the past 30 years is worrying. In general, the average pollution level is of agricultural origin. On the other hand, the <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks</b> observed in several places come often fro...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} and use of a pre-concentrator-thermo-desorber/micro-gas chromatograph/ mass spectrometer (mu TD/mu GC/MSD) coupling for the on-site analysis of VOCs in landfill gases are presented. The coupling has the advantage of analysing compounds with two detectors operated in series: the TCD (of the mu GC) initially analyses the gas without destroying it, and then the MSD identifies the compounds. Due to the TCD response, the results were quantified with reference to toluene. The reliability of the analytical chain for quantitative analysis was validated by sampling two gaseous standards, including the EPA TO 14 mixture, containing 39 compounds. With the OV 1 mu GC column, 24 compounds were identified and 16 correctly quantified. The repeatability of the measures estimated by their standard deviation was in the order of 1 - 2 %. The detection limit was evaluated at 0. 1 ppbv, for a 40 min preconcentration on the Tenax of the mu TD. The results of VOC analyses in the air of a landfill site obtained with the mu TD/mu GC/MSD coupling show its potential for on-site analyses: immediate results, high sensitivity, no storage for the samples, and measurements of <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Atmospheric {{pollutants}} concentration forecasting is {{an important}} issue in air quality monitoring. Qualitair Corse, the organization responsible for monitoring air quality in Corsica (France), needs to develop a short-term prediction model to lead its mission of information towards the public. Various deterministic models exist for local forecasting, but need important computing resources, a good knowledge of atmospheric processes and can be inaccurate because of local climatical or geographical particularities, as observed in Corsica, a mountainous island located in the Mediterranean Sea. As a result, we focus in this study on statistical models, and particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that have shown good results in the prediction of ozone concentration one hour ahead with data measured locally. The {{purpose of this study is}} to build a predictor realizing predictions of ozone 24 hours ahead in Corsica in order to be able to anticipate <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks</b> formation and to take appropriate preventive measures. Specific meteorological conditions are known to lead to particular pollution event in Corsica (e. g. Saharan dust events). Therefore, an ANN model will be used with pollutant and meteorological data for operational forecasting. Index of agreement of thi...|$|R
40|$|VILLE SUR ARCE has choosen for its winery wastewaters {{treatment}} (including lees and sediments) a new process. This one {{includes a}} long time storage (6 - 10 months) followed by an activated sludge. Four years of running show a good efficiency of the system in spite of an important pollution overload (150 %). Epuration rates are over 98 % for BOD 5. Long time storage doesn't produce any odour because natural acidification stops biological activity. TAIN L'HERMITAGE has decided in 1990 to treat his domestic and winery wastewater with a variable geometry treatment plant. STEREAU design, combines two biological stages with trickling filter SESSIL (high load) followed by a classical activated sludge (weak load). The trickling filter starts during <b>pollution</b> <b>peaks</b> (vintage). It eliminate 70 % of DOC and allows a constant load on activated sludge. The global epuration rates are over 95 % and treated water is conforming to e NK 2 level. Three years of running have demonstrated the interest of this two stages treatment plant for an easy operation and high performances. / Pour répondre aux problèmes de traitement d'effluents vinicoles, SAUR et STEREAU ont développé 2 procédés de traitement originaux : une filière associant un traitement par lit bactérien "forte charge" à une boue activée; une station traditionnelle précédée d'un stockage longue durée des effluents. Ces deux procedés sont décrits de manière détaillée dans cette communication...|$|R
