Its characteristics include (i) a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders; (ii) little or no tendency to increase the dose; (iii) some degree of <b>psychic</b> <b>dependence</b> {{on the effect of}} the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome withdrawal, and (iv) detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual.|$|E
40|$|It {{has become}} {{impossible}} in practice, and is scientifically unsound, {{to maintain a}} single definition for all forms of drug addiction and/or habituation. A feature common to these conditions {{as well as to}} drug abuse in general is <b>dependence,</b> <b>psychic</b> or physical or both, of the individual on a chemical agent. Therefore, better understanding should be attained by substitution of the term drug dependence of this or that type, according to the agent or class of agents involved, in discussions of these conditions, especially inter-disciplinary. Short descriptions, followed by concise listings of their characteristics, are formulated for the various types of dependence on at present widely abused major groups of substances...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to define a {{situation}} {{in the area of}} using legal and illegal habit forming drugs in a chosen file of respondents and to analyse the possibility of development of <b>psychic</b> problems as <b>dependence</b> of using habit forming drugs. The base was a file of questionnaires completed by students of universities in Great Britain in an academic year 2007 / 2008. 450 respondents, 37. 1 % men and 62. 9 % women, at the age from 21 - 26 years, took part. An average age was 22. 47 years. The most of respondents defined their ethnic origin as White - British (32. 7 %), White - Scottish (31. 1 %) and other white background (13. 3 %). The most often equivalent for the term "drug" is {{from their point of view}} an illegal drug, a habit forming drug or a medicine. As the most dangerous behaviour related to using habit forming drugs they considered occasional using of drugs. Almost two thirds of respondents have had an experience with smoking. The first experience with smoking was the most frequently at the age of 14 - 16. One third of respondents are smokers from which more than a half are daily smokers. A half of smokers have tried to stop smoking at least once in their life, especially because of health and financial reasons.

40|$|Background. Alcohol {{consumption}} {{among adolescents}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly widespread phenomenon in Italy, even among the younger population (Italy ranks first in Europa) with consequent negative effects on neurologic and <b>psychic</b> health. Alcohol <b>dependence</b> in adult age seems {{to be related to}} the inadequate way emotions and affects are perceived and managed since they are still not mentalized and poorly differentiated from physical states (alexithymia). Although evidence exists of a relationship between alexithymia and alcohol abuse in adults, there are no such studies on an adolescent sample. Objectives. Assess the potential correlation between alcohol consumption, alexithymia and the ability to attribute emotional states to others. Methods. Two samples were used for this study: one comprising high school students enrolled in the province of Padua and the other psychiatric patients affected by a Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct treated in the neuropsychiatric service of the local Hospital Unit n 16 in Padua. The mean age of adolescents was 15. 5 years. Adolescents were given the QASS (Questionario Adolescenti Sabato Sera), the TAS- 20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and the Emotion Attribution Test. Results. Our study seems to confirm some of the data contained in literature, namely that as adolescents get older there is an increase in alcohol consumption and a decrease of alexithymic traits. While studies on adults seem to confirm the relationship between alexithymia and alcohol abuse, in our study results were inverse. With regard to emotional attribution, there was a negative correlation between the former and alcohol consumption in the control group, which did not turn up in the case group, although the latter was significantly less capable to attribute an emotional state to others. Conclusions. This study is a valid preliminary contribution on the theme of adolescents, alcohol consumption and emotions, considering that its scarce visibility in literature. Additionally, from the perspective of its applicability, our study can be used to design preventive interventions which seek to reduce the use of alcohol among adolescents by working on emotional management as a risk factor...|$|R
5000|$|There is an {{additional}} connotation to the term habituation which applies to psychological dependency on drugs, and is included in several online dictionaries. A team of specialist from the World Health Organization (WHO) assembled in 1957 {{to address the problem}} of drug addiction and adopted the term [...] "drug habituation" [...] to distinguish some drug-use behaviors from drug addiction. According to the WHO lexicon of alcohol and drug terms, habituation is defined as [...] "becoming accustomed to any behavior or condition, including psychoactive substance use". By 1964 the America Surgeon's General report on smoking and health included four features that characterize drug habituation according to WHO: 1) [...] "a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders"; 2) [...] "little or no tendency to increase the dose"; 3) [...] "some degree of <b>psychic</b> <b>dependence</b> on the effect of the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome"; 4)"detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual". However, also in 1964, a committee from the World Health Organization once again convened and decided the definitions of drug habituation and drug addiction were insufficient, replacing the two terms with [...] "drug dependence". Substance dependence is the preferred term today when describing drug-related disorders, whereas the use of the term drug habituation has declined substantially. This is not to be confused with true habituation to drugs, wherein repeated doses have an increasingly diminished effect, as is often seen in addicts or persons taking painkillers frequently.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of de-addiction with the therapy of {{acupuncture}}, acupuncture plus opium, opium plus buprenorphine and opium plus Han's instrument for de-addiction and to study {{the effects of}} the four therapeutic methods on the protracted withdrawal syndrome and craving. METHODS: The effects of de-addiction were assessed with the opiate withdrawal scale and the craving degree with visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: The dominance of acupuncture treatment for withdrawal syndrome appeared to be after the 6 th day, and the dominance for controlling craving showed after the 8 th day, moreover, there were little side effects. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture treatment had the potentiality of preventing relapse and could be used for treating the protracted withdrawal syndrome and <b>psychic</b> <b>dependence</b> during the period between the stages of abstinence and rehabilitation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} {{of drug abuse}} is the continued use of a drug despite negative consequences. The step between abuse and addiction {{has to do with}} compulsion. The users have lost control of their use of drugs and those substances have become the most important things in their lives. In the past two decades, a great deal of research and several theories have been proposed to help with understanding the process of addiction. There are three leading models which attempt to explain the factors leading to addiction. One emphasizes the effect of heredity, the Addictive Disease Model, another is the effects of environment and behavior, The Behavioral/Environmental Model and the Academic Model stresses the physiological effects of psychoactive drugs. The addictive disease model says addiction is chronic, progressive, relapsing, incurable and potentially fatal condition that is mostly a consequence of genetic irregularities. The behavioral and environmental model says that certain influences of one’s environment, including stress, abuse, anger and peer pressure can induce addiction. The academic model says that it’s the use of drugs that causes the body to adapt through physiological mechanisms such as tolerance, tissue dependence, withdrawal and <b>psychic</b> <b>dependence.</b> Is Substance Abuse an Occupational Hazard...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{the last}} {{stages of a}} drug misuse {{escalation}} {{was defined as a}} state of dependence, ban arbitary term used to denote the presence of an acquired abnormal state wherein the regular administration of adequate amount of a drug has, through previous prolonged use, become requisite to physiologic equilibrium. Since it is not yet possible to diagnose physical dependence objectively without withhold-ing drugs, {{the sine qua non of}} physical dependence remains the demonstration of a physical abstinence syndromeQ (Himmelsbach, 1943). This authoritative definition evolved into the definition of physical dependence, an intense physical disturbance when drug usage was discontinued. Then, when no physical signs were observed, obvious other aspects of the process were considered, in particular the behavioral and psychic symptoms, resulting in the definition of <b>psychic</b> <b>dependence,</b> a condition in which a drug produces ba feeling of satisfaction and a psychic drive that require 570 pp] to account for the stages of the disease from impulse control disorder to compulsive disorders, for affective dynamics and for the relations between the symptoms and pathophysiology. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|KEY WORDS buprenorphine; {{narcotic}} dependence; drug evaluation AIM: To {{survey and}} assess the drug dependence and abuse potential liability of buprenorphine among opiate abusers. METHODS: Subjects of opiate dependence with history of buprenorphine use for 3 d at least were surveyed by interview. Physical dependence of buprenorphine was assessed using 30 items opiate withdrawal scale (OWS), which composed of 30 symptoms/signs. A 4 -point scale was used to rate each symptoms/signs: zero (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3). Subjects {{were asked to rate}} their symptoms according to severity of previous experienced buprenorphine withdrawal. The estimate of the degree of subjective euphoria for buprenorphine was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Subjects 1235 who met the research criteria cases completed this survey in multi-detoxification treatment centers. The main initial purposes of buprenorphine use were detoxification (77. 4 %) and protracted abstinence treated (26. 6 %) respectively. The scores of OWS of buprenorphine were between 0. 2 to 1. 3; The mean scores of OWS in 3 different categories of frequency of buprenorphine use on “continuous use”, “un-continuous use”, and “sometimes continuous, some-times un-continuous ” were 0. 9 ± 0. 9, 0. 4 ± 0. 5, and 0. 7 ± 0. 4, respectively (F= 70. 846, P 0. 05).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} self-administration of 30 μg infusions of either heroin or cocaine, or saline on {{the concentrations of}} β-endorphin-immunoreactivity (βE-IR) in the anterior part of the rat brain limbic system were studied. Self-administration of heroin and cocaine for 5 daily sessions resulted in a marked reduction of the concentrations of βE-IR in the nucleus accumbens, rostral striatum, septum and hippocampus {{at the time of}} the scheduled next session on day 6. In pooled extracts of these regions from rats receiving saline, combined application of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation and specific radioimmunoassays revealed the presence of a number of βE-related peptides co-chromatographing with synthetic non-acetylated and acetylated α, β- and γ-type endorphins. Similar profiles were found after HPLC fractionation of extracts of these regions from rats self-administering heroin and cocaine. Rats self-administering heroin or cocaine, however, showed decreased amounts of all detected forms of β-endorphin as compared to saline rats. These findings indicate that both self-administration of an opiate that induces psychic as well as physical dependence and of a non-opiate stimulant inducing psychic but not physical dependence, results in a significant decrease of βE and related peptides in limbic brain regions of the rat. All forms of βE detected after HPLC were equally affected, suggesting an overall effect of the drugs on peptide turnover. These results suggest that βE and related peptides may be involved in the neurochemical mechanisms underlying <b>psychic</b> <b>dependence</b> to drug...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{addiction}} {{is defined as}} a compulsion to take a drug with loss of control in limiting intake (33). It is considered a chronic disorder because the risk of relapse remains high even after completion of treatment and prolonged abstinence. In 1968, the term drug dependence replaced that of addiction in the nomenclature of the World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association. Defined as a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic symptoms indicative of an individual continuing substance use despite significant substance related problems, this term has become the accepted diagnostic term for compulsive use of a psychoactive substance. When defined as described, it is analogous to the term addiction. However, this term {{should not be confused with}} physical or <b>psychic</b> <b>dependence,</b> conditions in which the cessation or reduction of drug usage results in a withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal and tolerance often are associated with compulsive drug use; however, they are not required for drug addiction. Although individuals suffering from chronic pain may develop tolerance to the analgesic effects of an opiate and experience withdrawal symptoms, they do not exhibit signs of compulsive drugseeking behavior. The concept of reinforcement has provided the cornerstone for current theories and animal models of drug addiction. A reinforcer is defined operationally as ‘‘any event that increases the probability of a response’ ’ and often is used interchangeably with ‘‘reward. ’ ’ In general, drugs function as positive or conditioned reinforcers by virtue of their rewarding effects, and reward often connotes additional attri...|$|E
