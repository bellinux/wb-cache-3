40|$|Semlild Forest {{virus was}} inactivated by {{exposure}} to daylight or artificial light. The active wavelengths were in the region 3300 to 4700 A. Inactivation was reduced bycalf serum and completely prevented by cysteine or anaerobic conditions. Light destroyed the infectivity of the virus-associated RNA {{at the same rate}} as that of whole virus; it did not affect he reaction of the virus in immunodiffusion tests nor the infectivity of previously extracted RNA. Inactivation was probably the result of photo-oxidation f the viral nucleic acid which was sensitized by some naturally occurring pigment. Although riboflavin and vitamin A were able to increase the photosensitivity of Semliki Forest virus, the evidence presented indicates that neither of these substances was the natural photosensitizer. Sindbis, Murray Valley encephalitis, influenza and rabbitpox viruses also lost infectivity when exposed to light, but poliovirus was <b>photoresistant...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cells of the VSR 751 strain, {{which was}} {{previously}} isolated as a <b>photoresistant</b> revertant of the visAdeleted (ZiemF-deleted) strain of Escherichia coli K- 12, accumulated uroporphyrin (uro), coproporphyrin (copro) and protoporphyrin IX (proto), {{but did not}} accumulate as much protoporphyrin as cells of the parental strain (Ziem/f-deleted). Therefore, we concluded that strain VSR 751 must be defective in protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO), {{the product of the}} hemG gene.

The hemG gene is located at 86 mim on the E. coli chromosome, just upstream of the rrnA operon, and is transcribed clockwise {{in the same direction as}} the rrnA operon. This gene encodes a 181 -amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kDa.

Under the very same conditions, non-enveloped viruses (vac-cinia, polio and adenoviruses) are completely <b>photoresistant.</b> The photosensi-tivity of enveloped viruses can be enhanced by the presence of salts or increased pH values. Enveloped viruses are photosensitive ven when replicated in cells grown and maintained in the absence of serum and ribo-flavin. Human herpes virus strains obtained from herpetic lesions and never passaged in cultures were also readily inactivated by white light. Experiments with monochromatic right showed the 425 nm. wavelength to be most effective in inactivating the virus.

40|$|The review {{deals with}} commercially {{available}} organic dyes possessing large Stokes shifts and their applications as fluorescent labels in optical microscopy based on stimulated emission depletion (STED). STED microscopy breaks Abbe’s diffraction barrier and provides optical resolution beyond the diffraction limit. STED microscopy is non-invasive and requires photostable fluorescent markers attached to biomolecules or other objects of interest. Up to now, in most biology-related STED experiments, bright and <b>photoresistant</b> dyes with small Stokes shifts of 20 – 40 nm were used. The rapid progress in STED microscopy showed that organic fluorophores possessing large Stokes shifts are indispensable in multi-color super-resolution techniques. The ultimate {{result of the}} imaging relies on the optimal combination of a dye, the bio-conjugation procedure {{and the performance of}} the optical microscope. Modern bioconjugation methods, basics of STED microscopy, as well as structures and spectral properties of the presently available fluorescent markers are reviewed and discussed.

A simple chromophore correlation model is proposed to explain the self healing mechanism. Based on observations that the molecules are <b>photoresistant</b> at high dye concentration and low temperature, we propose that molecules form correlated regions that are resistant to damage and promote self-healing. We have developed a simple model for photodegradation and recovery that depends on three parameters: the intensity-dependent decay rate, the recovery rate, and the free energy advantage for a molecule being in a correlated group, which we call a domain. This model accounts for all observations of ASE and absorption spectroscopy of DO 11 dye in PMMA as a function of time, pump intensity, and concentration during decay and recovery with one fixed set of theses three parameters. Furthermore, the theory predicts the behavior as a function of temperature, and is consistent with all experimental observations. Department of Physic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the {{mitochondrial}} permeability transition pore (PTP) under oxidizing conditions with mitochondria-bound hematoporphyrin, which generates reactive oxygen species (mainly singlet oxygen, 1 O 2) upon UV/visible light-irradiation and promotes the photooxidative modification of vicinal targets. We have characterized the PTP-modulating properties of two major critical sites endowed with different degrees of photosensitivity: (i) the most photovulnerable site comprises critical histidines, whose photomodification by vicinal hematoporphyrin causes a drop in reactivity of matrix-exposed (internal), PTP-regulating cysteines thus stabilizing the pore in a closed conformation; (ii) the most <b>photoresistant</b> site coincides with the binding domains of (external) cysteines sensitive to membrane-impermeant reagents, which are easily unmasked when oxidation of internal cysteines is prevented. Photooxidation of external cysteines promoted by vicinal hematoporphyrin reactivates the PTP after the block caused by histidine photodegradation. Thus, hematoporphyrin-mediated photooxidative stress can either inhibit or activate the mitochondrial permeability transition depending {{on the site of}} hematoporphyrin localization and {{on the nature of the}} substrate; and selective photomodification of different hematoporphyrin-containing pore domains can be achieved by fine regulation of the sensitizer/light doses.

UV exposure also alters the properties and durability of materials and affects their lifetime. It is becoming increasingly important to develop new biocompatible and environmentally friendly materials to address these issues. Inspired by the strategy developed by fish, algae, and microorganisms exposed to UV radiations in confined ecosystems, we have constructed novel UV-protective materials that exclusively consist of natural compounds. Chitosan {{was chosen as the}} matrix for grafting mycosporines and mycosporine-like amino acids as the functional components of the active materials. Here, we show that these materials are biocompatible, <b>photoresistant,</b> and thermoresistant, and exhibit a highly efficient absorption of both UV-A and UV-B radiations. Thus, they have the potential to provide an efficient protection against both types of UV radiations and overcome several shortfalls of the current UV-protective products. In practice, the same concept can be applied to other biopolymers than chitosan and used to produce multifunctional materials. Therefore, it has a great potential to be exploited in a broad range of applications in living organisms and nonliving systems. Susana C. M.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{appears to}} be endowed with several {{favorable}} features {{for the treatment of}} infections originated by microbial pathogens, including a broad spectrum of action, the efficient inactivation of antibiotic-resistant strains, the low mutagenic potential, and the lack of selection of <b>photoresistant</b> microbial cells. Therefore, intensive studies are being pursued in order to define the scope and field of application of this approach. RESULTS: Optimal cytocidal activity against a large variety of bacterial, fungal, and protozoan pathogens {{has been found to be}} typical of photosensitizers that are positively charged at physiological pH values (e. g., for the presence of quaternarized amino groups or the association with polylysine moieties) and are characterized by a moderate hydrophobicity (n-octanol/water partition coefficient around 10). These photosensitizers in a micromolar concentration can induce a > 4 - 5 log decrease in the microbial population after incubation times as short as 5 - 10 minutes and irradiation under mild experimental conditions, such as fluence-rates around 50 mW/cm 2 and irradiation times shorter than 15 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: PDT appears to represent an efficacious alternative modality for the treatment of localized microbial infections through the in situ application of the photosensitizer followed by irradiation of the photosensitizer-loaded infected area. Proposed clinical fields of interest of antimicrobial PDT include the treatment of chronic ulcers, infected burns, acne vulgaris, and a variety of oral infections...|$|E

The extent of bipyrimidine photoproduct formation was analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. S. alaskensis was chosen as a reference species since it was previously shown to be <b>photoresistant.</b> Interestingly, P. angustum exhibited an even higher level of survival to UVB irradiation than S. alaskensis. This higher photoresistance was associated with a decrease in the rate of formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) at high UVB doses. Despite different distributions in UVB-induced lesions, the survival difference between the two marine bacteria could not be accounted for by qualitative differences in either photoreactivation or the rate of nucleotide excision repair of the photoproducts arising from the different bipyrimidine doublets (TT, CT, TC and CC). Dark repair was found to be much more efficient for P. angustum than S. alaskensis but the corresponding rate of photoproduct removal was lower than that observed at high UVB doses. We propose that the increased resistance of P. angustum under high UVB doses results from a UVB-induction of CPD photolyase(s) that may directly repair DNA damage and/or act indirectly by enhancing the rate of nucleotide excision repair. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies...|$|E

40|$|A photoaffinity {{label for}} {{corticotropin}} (ACTH) receptors was prepared by selective chemical {{modification of the}} single tryptophan residue in the hormone by reaction with 2 -nitro- 5 -azidophenylsulfenyl chloride. The photoreactive derivative, [(2 -nitro- 5 -azidophenylsulfenyl) -Trp 9]ACTH (2, 5 -NAPS-ACTH), stimulated corticosterone synthesis to 60 % of the maximal rate induced by ACTH in isolated rat adrenocortical cells. 2. 5 -NAPS-ACTH caused only a marginal stimulation of cyclic AMP production compared to the unmodified hormone. Stimulation of corticosterone production and cyclic AMP accumulation induced by ACTH were both inhibited in a competitive manner by 2, 5 -NAPS-ACTH. Photolysis of adrenocortical cells {{in the presence of}} 2, 5 -NAPS-ACTH resulted in a 40 % inactivation of ACTH receptors mediating steroidogenesis, as shown by the decrease in response to subsequent stimulation with ACTH. No loss of function was observed when photolysis was conducted {{in the presence of the}} <b>photoresistant</b> analog [(2, 4 -dinitrophenylsulfenyl) -Trp 9]ACTH. Covalent attachment of the hormone to the receptors was also demonstrated by photolyzing adrenocortical cells in the presence of tritiated 2, 5 -NAPS-ACTH of high specific radioactivity (90 Ci/mmol) and analyzing the cell proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein with an approximate molecular weight of 100, 000 was specifically labeled by this procedure.

40|$|Aims: To advance our {{understanding}} of the mechanisms involved in the RLP 068 phthalocyanine-photosensitized inactivation of Acanthamoeba palestinensis trophozoites through a precise identification of the targets of the photoprocess in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. Methods and Results: We followed the activities of selected marker enzymes as well as we performed fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy investigations of the alterations induced by the photoprocess in the fine structure of subcellular compartments. RLP 068 is preferentially located in the contractile vacuole: the fluorescence in that site is particularly evident in the unirradiated cells and becomes more diffused after irradiation. Electron microscopic analysis of photosensitized A. palestinensis cells clearly shows that the swelling of trophozoites and the appearance of vacuoles spread throughout the cytoplasm after phototreatment. The activity of a typical cytoplasmic enzyme, such as lactate dehydrogenase, underwent a 35 % decrease {{as a consequence of the}} photoprocess, reflecting the photodamage induced by migrating phthalocyanine molecules in their micro-environment. Conclusions: The presence of multiple targets for the phthalocyanine-photosensitized process is of utmost importance because this pattern of cell damage makes it unlikely that <b>photoresistant</b> A. palestinensis strains are gradually selected or mutagenic phenomena are developed as a consequence of the photoinduced damage. Significance and Impact of the Study: Photosensitization via phthalocyanines appears to represent an efficient and safe approach for achieving a close control of the population of a potentially pathogenic protozoan such as A. palestinensis, opening new perspectives for the disinfection of microbiologically polluted waters...|$|E
40|$|Carotenoids are {{produced}} by all photosynthetic organisms {{and a large number}} of bacteria and fungi. They are responsible for a lot of pigmentation in nature, as well as often playing an essential role in the provision of light protection to cells and as precursors of vitamin A in higher organisms. Myxobacton is the primary carotenoid ester generated in the <b>photoresistant</b> bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. It is created through a complex light-regulated gene expression cascade and acts to protect the bacteria from blue light and the resultant generation of damaging singlet oxygen species in the presence of porphyrins. The final stage in its production is a ketonisation, and the enzyme responsible for this stage was unknown in M. xanthus. We propose a possible location for the gene encoding such a ketolase, crtW. The gene is found located within a four-gene operon separate from the other known carotenoid biosynthetic genes, and appears to have two alternative promoter regions. The additional genes in the operon were found to encode a putative MutT/Nudix family hydrolase and a periplasmic, molybdopterin and haeme-dependent oxidoreductase, YedYZ. It is also shown that crtW transcription is independent of cell exposure to blue light and that the product is an inner membrane, integral membrane protein probable ketolase. The evolutionary origins of crtW are considered in conjunction with a number of other carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting that the gene {{was one of the last}} to be acquired by M. xanthus.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} rise in {{antibiotic resistance}} by microorganisms has stimulated intensive research toward {{the development of}} alternative therapeutic strategies. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is emerging as a promising modality {{for the treatment of}} localized microbial infections. Studies on the relationship between the chemical structure of photosensitising agents and their phototoxicity against microbial pathogens led to the identification of a selected number of compounds with optimal cytocidal effects. These include phenothiazine, porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives, whose molecule has been engineered to introduce the following features: (a) presence of cationic moieties, preferably due to quaternarized amino groups; (b) introduction of at least one N-alkyl group having a relatively long hydrocarbon chain; (c) overall amphiphilic character to promote the partitioning in the plasma membrane. Studies on cell cultures indicate that PDT is endowed with favourable properties to act as an antimicrobial modality: (a) broad spectrum of action, since one irradiation protocol can be used to obtain the inactivation of different groups of pathogens, such as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, mycoplasmas and protozoa in both vegetative and cystic stages; (b) fast association with microbial cells, which allows irradiations to be performed after incubation times as short as 5 - 10 min., thereby guaranteeing a high selectivity as compared with host tissues; (d) high photoinactivation efficiency, since a 5 - 6 log decrease in microbial population is obtained by irradiation under mild conditions; (e) photosensitising activity independent of the antibiotic-resistance spectrum of the given pathogen; (f) lack of selection of <b>photoresistant</b> strains upon repeated treatment and minimal risk to induce the onset of mutagenic processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{search for}} organic carbon {{at the surface}} of Mars, as clues of past {{habitability}} or remnants of life, is a major science goal of Mars' exploration. Understanding the chemical evolution of organic molecules under current Martian environmental conditions is essential to support the analyses performed in situ. What molecule can be preserved? What is the timescale of organic evolution at the surface? This paper {{presents the results of}} laboratory investigations dedicated to monitor the evolution of organic molecules when submitted to simulated Mars surface ultraviolet radiation (190 - 400 nm), mean temperature (218 ± 2 K) and pressure (6 ± 1 mbar) conditions. Experiments are done with the MOMIE simulation setup (for Mars Organic Molecules Irradiation and Evolution) allowing both a qualitative and quantitative characterization of the evolution the tested molecules undergo (Poch et al., 2013). The chemical structures of the solid products and the kinetic parameters of the photoreaction (photolysis rate, half-life and quantum efficiency of photodecomposition) are determined for glycine, urea, adenine and chrysene. Mellitic trianhydride is also studied in order to complete a previous study done with mellitic acid (Stalport et al., 2009), by studying the evolution of mellitic trianhydride. The results show that solid layers of the studied molecules have half-lives of 10 to 103 hours at the surface of Mars, when exposed directly to Martian UV radiation. However, organic layers having aromatic moieties and reactive chemical groups, as adenine and mellitic acid, lead to the formation of <b>photoresistant</b> solid residues, probably of macromolecular nature, which could exhibit a longer photostability. Such solid organic layers are found in micrometeorites or could have been formed endogenously on Mars. Finally, the quantum efficiencies of photodecomposition at wavelengths from 200 to 250 nm, determined for each of the studied molecules, range from 10 - 2 to 10 - 6 molecule photon- 1 and apply for isolated molecules exposed at the surface of Mars. These kinetic parameters provide essential inputs for numerical modeling of the evolution of Mars' current reservoir of organic molecules. Organic molecules adsorbed on Martian minerals may have different kinetic parameters and lead to different endproducts. The present study paves the way for the interpretation of more complex simulation experiments where organics will be mixed with Martian mineral analogs...|$|E
