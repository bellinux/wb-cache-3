40|$|Outdoor Free space optic (FSO) {{communication}} systems {{are sensitive to}} atmospheric impairments such as turbulence and fog, {{in addition to being}} subject to <b>pointing</b> <b>errors.</b> Fog is particularly severe because it induces an attenuation that may vary from few dBs up to few hundreds of dBs per kilometer. <b>Pointing</b> <b>errors</b> also distort the link alignment and cause signal fading. In this paper, we investigate and analyze the FSO systems performance under fog conditions and <b>pointing</b> <b>errors</b> in terms of outage probability. We then study the impact of several effective communication mitigation techniques that can improve the system performance including multi-hop, transmit laser selection (TLS) and hybrid RF/FSO transmission. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability are derived and practical and comprehensive numerical examples are suggested to assess the obtained results. We found that the FSO system has limited performance that prevents applying FSO in wireless microcells that have a 500 m minimum cell radius. The performance degrades more when <b>pointing</b> <b>errors</b> appear. Increasing the transmitted power can improve the performance under light to moderate fog.

The first part of the analysis contains a preliminary study whose results conclude on the need of a sun movement correction for the correct evaluation of the <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> from both new measurements. Once this correction is applied, both measurements show an equivalent behavior with differences under 0. 01 Â° in the evaluation of the <b>pointing</b> <b>error.</b> The second part of the analysis includes the incorporation of the cross scenario in the AERONET routine measurement protocol in order to monitor the <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> in field instruments. Using the data collected for more than a year, the <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> is evaluated on 7 sun-photometers belonging to AERONET-Europe. The <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> values registered are generally smaller than 0. 01 Â° though in some instruments values up to 0. 03 Â° have been observed. Moreover, the <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> evaluation has shown that this measure can be used to detect mechanical problems in the robots or dirtiness in the quadrant detector due to the stable behavior of the values against time and solar zenith angle. At the same time, the matrix scenario can be used to derive the value of the field of view. The methodology implemented and the characterization of five sun-photometers is presented in the last part of the study. To validate the method, a comparison with field of view values obtained from the vicarious calibration method was developed. The differences between both techniques are under 3 %...|$|E
