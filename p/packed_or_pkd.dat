40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the blood group antibody, anti-P, produced by p <b>or</b> <b>Pk</b> individuals may cause abortion early in pregnancy. The authors have studied and successfully treated a Pk woman with anti-P who had 13 consecutive first-trimester miscarriages. Anti-P was implicated {{as the cause of}} repeated pregnancy loss after extensive clinical, endocrinologic, immunologic, and chromosomal evaluations. To remove P blood group antibodies, plasmapheresis was begun at five weeks 2 ̆ 7 gestation during the 14 th pregnancy with one plasma volume exchange two to three times per week. This therapy resulted in a reduction in the titer of anti-P, and the patient was delivered of a viable female infant after 33 weeks 2 ̆ 7 gestation. The management and outcome indicate that habitual abortion presumably due to anti-P can be successfully treated with plasmapheresis. This case provides additional evidence that anti-P is responsible for abortions in p <b>or</b> <b>Pk</b> women, and that these abortions are immunologically mediated...|$|R

He is given special powers, and told that he has become a [...] "platyrhynchos kineticus", an energized duck, <b>or</b> <b>PK</b> for short, stepping around his Paperinik roots. The game was a commercial failure and represented the only English language use of the name PK. Before the game and after it, [...] "Duck Avenger" [...] has remained standard in American comic books. In 2008, a mobile Java game known as PK: Phantom Duck was released; with the help of Gyro, Paperinik has to fight against the plans of the Beagle Boys there.
