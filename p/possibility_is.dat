5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> {{that this man was}} one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles.

The predominant opinion indicated that it is possible that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans, although not all of the panelists believed the <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> equally likely: one thought the <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> strong, leaning toward probable, and five thought the <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> remote, leaning toward unlikely.

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, {{it is apparent that}} about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E

5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
5|$|A third <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> {{where the}} primary and moon are tidally locked to each other.

5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required for good health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity.

5|$|Although {{the first}} {{documentary}} {{reference to a}} castle at Framlingham occurs in 1148, the actual date of its construction is uncertain and three possible options have been suggested by academics. The first <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the castle was built by Roger Bigod in either the late 11th century or around 1100, similar to the founding of Bigod's caput at nearby Eye. A second <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that Roger's son, Hugh Bigod, built it {{during the years of}} the Anarchy in the 1140s on the site of an existing manor house; the castle would then be similar to the Bigod fortification at Bungay. A third <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that there were in fact two castles: the first being built in the late 11th century and then demolished by Hugh Bigod in the 1160s in order {{to make way for a}} newer, larger castle. Historian Magnus Alexander hypothesizes the castle might have been built on top of a set of pre-existing Anglo-Saxon, high prestige buildings, a practice common elsewhere in East Anglia, possibly echoing the arrangement at Castle Acre; this would be most likely if the castle was built in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that 55 Cancri e {{is a solid}} planet made of carbon-rich material {{rather than}} the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior. Further observations are necessary to confirm the nature of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that a {{gene for}} aposematism might be {{recessive}} and {{located on the}} X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E

5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost.

5|$|Echmarcach {{was the son}} of a {{man named}} Ragnall. Whilst Echmarcach bore a Gaelic name, the name of his father is {{ultimately}} derived from Old Norse, a fact that serves to exemplify the hybrid nature of the eleventh-century Irish Sea region, The identity of Echmarcach's father is uncertain. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that Ragnall was a member of the dynasty that ruled the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford in tenth- and eleventh centuries. If so, Echmarcach may have been the son of one of two Waterfordian rulers: Ragnall mac Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1018), or this man's apparent son, Ragnall ua Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1035). Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that Echmarcach belonged to a family from the Isles, and that his father was Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles (died 1004/1005), son and possible successor of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles (died 989). As a descendant of either of the aforesaid families, Echmarcach would appear to have been a member of the Uí Ímair, a royal dynasty descended from the Scandinavian sea-king Ímar (died c.873).|$|E
5|$|In 1939, a {{magnificent}} ship-burial was discovered under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk.

5000|$|The {{notion of}} <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> greatly {{analyzed}} by medieval and modern philosophers.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family.

5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions.

5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty.
