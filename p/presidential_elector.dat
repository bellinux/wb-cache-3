5|$|McCreary was {{nominated}} {{to serve as}} a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> for the ticket of Democrat Horatio Seymour in 1868; though he declined to serve, he attended the national convention as a delegate. His political career began in earnest in 1869 when {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Stanley's first {{venture into}} the {{political}} arena was in 1897 when he made an unsuccessful bid to become county attorney of Fleming County. He continued to practice law in Flemingsburg until March 1898 {{when he moved to}} Henderson because of financial hardships. He served as a Democratic <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> on the ticket of William Jennings Bryan in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's {{political}} career began in 1878 with an unsuccessful bid to become county clerk of Butler County. In 1880, {{he was an}} assistant <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> for Greenback candidate James Weaver. Two years later, he was elected county clerk of Butler County. He {{was the first person}} {{in the history of the}} county to successfully challenge a Democrat for this position.|$|E

5|$|Helm was a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> for Winfield Scott in the 1852 presidential election. After this he took {{twelve years}} off from politics. As early as 1836, Helm had {{advocated}} {{the construction of}} the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. On October 2, 1854, he became the railroad's second president. The previous president had been forced out of that position after a disagreement with Louisville's board of aldermen, and construction of the line had almost been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Owsley {{returned}} to the state House in 1831, and served {{in the state senate}} from 1832 to 1834. He also served as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> for Henry Clay in 1833. When James Turner Morehead ascended to the governorship upon the death of John Breathitt, he appointed Owsley Secretary of State for his shortened term from 1834 to 1836. In 1843, Owsley retired from the practice of law and purchased a farm in Boyle County.|$|E
5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Greenup {{was chosen as}} a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> for the ticket of James Madison and George Clinton. In 1812, he became a {{justice of the peace}} in Franklin County. In August 1812, Kentucky Secretary of State Martin D. Hardin {{recommended}} to Governor Isaac Shelby that Greenup be appointed Assistant Secretary of State. Shelby made the appointment, and when Hardin, resigned December 15, 1812, Shelby nominated Greenup as his replacement. The Kentucky Senate approved the nomination on February 3, 1813, and Greenup served until his resignation on March 13, 1813.|$|E
5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin became {{active in}} the Democratic Party, serving as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> in 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856 and as a {{delegate}} to the Democratic National Convention in 1848, 1856, 1860, and 1872. He served one term in the Kentucky Senate in 1850, but declined his party's nomination for {{a seat in the}} U.S. House of Representatives in 1851. In 1855 was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, running on a ticket with Beverly L. Clarke, who was defeated by Know Nothing candidate Charles S. Morehead.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Metcalfe {{represented}} Nicholas and Bracken Counties in the Kentucky Senate from 1834 to 1838. In 1836, {{he served as}} a Whig <b>presidential</b> <b>elector,</b> and he presided over the Kentucky Whig Convention in Harrodsburg on August 26, 1839. From 1840 to 1849, he {{served as president of the}} state board of internal improvements. Finally, he was appointed and subsequently elected as a Whig to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John J. Crittenden. He served from June 23, 1848, to March 3, 1849. During his short tenure, he denounced secession, and asserted that Kentucky would remain part of the Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the final pay {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort {{should not be in}} the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> with minimal opposition.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Johnson was {{selected}} as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President Martin Van Buren was defeated by former Ohio senator William Henry Harrison, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column. He {{was elected to the}} Tennessee Senate in 1841, where he served a two-year term. He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in Covington, Stevenson was elected county attorney for Kenton County. He was chosen as a delegate to the 1844 Democratic National Convention and was elected to represent Kenton County in the Kentucky House of Representatives the following year. He was reelected in 1846 and 1848. In 1849, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention that produced Kentucky's third state constitution. In 1850, he, Madison C. Johnson, and James Harlan were appointed as commissioners to revise Kentucky's civic and criminal code. Their work, Code of Practise in Civil and Criminal Cases was published in 1854. He was again one of Kentucky's delegates to the Democratic National Conventions in 1848, 1852, and 1856, serving as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> in 1852 and 1856.|$|E
5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> in 1793.|$|E

5|$|Kuykendall was {{a lifelong}} Democrat, and he cast his first vote for Democratic Party presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan in the United States presidential {{election}} of 1900. Kuykendall served one term {{as the chairman}} of the Executive Committee of West Virginia's 2nd congressional district and was elected to three terms {{as the chairman of}} the Hampshire County Democratic Party Central Committee. In 1916, Kuykendall was a delegate to the West Virginia Democratic Party State Convention at Parkersburg that nominated John J. Cornwell as the party's gubernatorial candidate. He was also both a delegate and chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party's Congressional Convention that nominated William Gay Brown, Jr., as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives. Kuykendall was a strong proponent of Brown, whom he supported in subsequent conventions and elections. He was also a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> in the Electoral College during the reelection of Woodrow Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Payne entered local {{politics}} as a Democrat, serving as a <b>Presidential</b> <b>elector</b> in 1848 for Democratic nominees Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler. He {{was elected to the}} Cleveland City Council in 1849, and served there until 1854. At the same time, {{he was a member of}} the Ohio Senate from 1849 to 1851. His skill as a parliamentarian led his party to nominate him for the United States Senate in 1851, but the election went to Whig candidate, Benjamin Wade, by a vote of 44–34. Payne attended the 1856 Democratic National Convention, where he worked successfully for the nomination of James Buchanan. He ran for Governor of Ohio in 1857, but narrowly lost to the incumbent Republican, Salmon P. Chase. With more than 300,000 votes cast, Payne fell short of victory by just 1,503. In 1860, he again attended the Democrats' convention, where he helped nominate his old friend Stephen A. Douglas, and sided with Douglas's faction as the party divided into northern and southern halves.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a <b>presidential</b> <b>elector</b> in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
50|$|On April 15, the Legislature enacted that {{henceforth}} the <b>presidential</b> <b>electors</b> {{should be}} elected statewide by general ticket, {{instead of in}} single districts.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, the President and Vice President {{are elected}} by the Electoral College, which {{consists}} of 538 <b>presidential</b> <b>electors</b> from the fifty states and Washington, D.C.. <b>Presidential</b> <b>electors</b> are themselves elected on a state-by-state basis. Since the election of 1824, most states have appointed their electors on a winner-take-all basis, based on the statewide popular vote on Election Day. Maine and Nebraska {{are the only two}} current exceptions, as both states use the congressional district method. Although ballots list the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates (who run on a ticket), voters actually choose electors when they vote for president and vice president. These <b>presidential</b> <b>electors</b> in turn cast electoral votes for those two offices. Electors usually pledge to vote for their party's nominee, but some [...] "faithless electors" [...] have voted for other candidates.|$|R
