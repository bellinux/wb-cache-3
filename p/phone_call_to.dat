5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} did not accept the {{agreement}} and, on 30 April, relieved both Vietinghoff and his Chief of Staff, Generalleutnant Hans Röttiger, putting them at the disposition of the OKW for a possible court martial. They were replaced by General Friedrich Schulz and Generalmajor Friedrich Wenzel respectively. The next morning, 1 May, Röttinger reacted by placing both Schulz and Wenzel under arrest, and summoning Lemelsen to take Schulz's place. Lemelsen initially refused, {{as he was in}} possession of a written order from Kesselring which prohibited any talks with the enemy without his explicit authorization. By this time, Vietinghoff and Wolff had concluded an armistice with the Allied Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Theatre, Field Marshal Alexander, which became effective on 2 May at 14:00. Lemelsen reached Bolzano, and Schulz and Wenzel regained control, this time agreeing with the officers pushing for a quick surrender. The German armies in Italy were now utterly defeated by the Allies, who were rapidly advancing from Garmisch towards Innsbruck. Kesselring remained stubbornly opposed to the surrender, but was finally won over by Wolff on the late morning of 2 May after a two-hour <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> Kesselring at his headquarters at Pullach.|$|E

Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again.

Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise {{the sound of her}} voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints {{he is going to}} fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going to}} lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer to make a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons {{do not have enough}} money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E
