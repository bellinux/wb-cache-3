25|$|On {{the death}} of George Loddiges in 1846, the nursery {{business}} passed to his son Conrad Loddiges II (1821–1865), who found {{it increasingly difficult to}} negotiate a new lease from the land-owner (St. Thomas' Hospital), given the much higher prices the land could now command for housing development, due to London's growth into the surrounding countryside. Similarly, the part of the nursery that was owned by the Loddiges family in freehold, was becoming more valuable as building land, whilst losing its attractive countryside village setting. Conrad was involved with the display of ferns and terrariums for the Great Exhibition. The nursery closed in stages between 1852 and 1854 due to expiry of the lease from St. Thomas' Hospital. Conrad Loddiges II offered the whole of the exotic <b>plant</b> <b>stock</b> to Kew Gardens for a sum of £9000 (20 years earlier the collection was valued at £200,0000) but this was refused. Many rare plants were auctioned via Stevens auctioneers, including rare orchids sold to John Day who would later become famous as a botanical illustrator. Joseph Paxton purchased 300 palms and plants for the opening of the new Crystal Palace at Sydenham. The Illustrated London News of 5 August 1854 illustrated plumed horses pulling a giant palm tree through the City of London on its way to be prominently displayed by Paxton in time for the opening of the Crystal Palace by Queen Victoria.|$|E

The chance of retrieval that had flashed upon him, as he sat smoking by that ruined hearth the evening before, stood him in such stead now as a sole hope may; and he said to himself that, having resolved not to sell his house, he was no more crippled by its loss than he would have been by letting his money lie idle in it; what he might have raised by mortgage on it could be made up in some other way; and if they would sell he could still buy out the whole business of that West Virginia company, mines, <b>plant,</b> <b>stock</b> on hand, good-will, and everything, and unite it with his own. He went early in the afternoon to see Bellingham, whose expressions of condolence for his loss he cut short with as much politeness as he knew how to throw into his impatience. Bellingham seemed at first a little dazzled with the splendid courage of his scheme; it was certainly fine in its way; but then he began to have his misgivings.|$|E

This technique uses a fog-cooling system to lower the temperature inside cutting boxes in a greenhouse. This method is suitable for mass production of vegetative propagules of some dipterocarps species. Rooting percentage of S. leprosula and S. selanica (meranti) cuttings was 95 % and 92 % respectively during the experimental stage, and 67 % at mass production stage. The <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> production of the dipterocarp cuttings in 1997 and 1998 were 42 000 and 53 000 respectively. Reforestation of degraded forest by using these dipterocarp cuttings was studied on 70 ha trial plot in West Java. <b>Planting</b> <b>stock</b> from cuttings and seedlings of S. leprosula and S. selanica were planted at various spacings. Preliminary results indicated that at this site S. selanica grows better than S. leprosula, <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> from cuttings of both species performed better than <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> from seedlings, and closer spacing resulted in better growth and survival.

50|$|The {{improved}} {{appearance of}} the gardens over {{recent years has been}} due to local government projects required as part of a Conservation Management Plan (CMP). The creation of mulched beds around significant trees has improved their condition and large herbaceous beds have been restored using heritage <b>plant</b> <b>stock.</b> The most obvious works include the reconstruction of the western half of the path network along accurately plotted heritage alignments using the original orange-coloured, granitic, sand surface and steel edging. This included the installation of an on-site stormwater dissipation system, which now uses surface runoff to help irrigate lawn areas and minimise water usage. The perimeter hedge around the gardens uses original Lonicera heritage <b>plant</b> <b>stock</b> sourced from Dame Elisabeth Murdoch's 'Cruden Farm.' This hedge will grow to a height of approximately 700mm. The CMP and further detailed historical investigations have led to the design of entry treatments for each of the entrances to the Gardens. Composed of bluestone walls and timber posts, the new entrances have been accurately designed to closely resemble the original appearance and layout of the old entrances. Reconstruction of the entry treatments in the western half of the Gardens commenced earlier this year. The northern and southern border beds have been planted with heritage <b>plant</b> <b>stock</b> in accordance with planting designs prepared by Jill Orr-Young.|$|E

Prior to Wakeley's (1954) demonstration {{of the importance of}} the physiological state of <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> in determining the ability of the stock to perform after outplanting, and to a considerable extent even afterwards, morphological appearance has generally served as the basis for estimating the quality of <b>planting</b> <b>stock.</b> Gradually, however, a realization developed that more was involved.

(1968), for instance, after assessing 10-year survival data from several experimental white spruce plantations in Manitoba noted that [...] "Perhaps the most important point revealed here is that certain lots of transplants performed better than others", even though all transplants were handled and planted with care. The intuitive [...] "stock that looks good must be good" [...] is a persuasive, but potentially dangerous maxim.

Data were gathered through personal interview and analysed using the SPSS program. A total of 59 smallholder nursery operators and 15 government personnel involved in managing government nurseries were interviewed. Government nurseries were established primarily to provide <b>planting</b> <b>stocks</b> to smallholder tree farmers; however, the farmers either individually or in groups are raising seedlings to meet their own <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> requirement. The type of species produced is largely determined by species availability. There is no free flow of information on germplasm sources resulting in inefficient distribution and utilisation of available species. This has resulted in the wide production of a few common exotics. Less emphasis is given on the use of genetically superior germplasm due to lack of information on a good-practice germplasm collection protocol and limited access to certified sources. The germplasm pathway in smallholder nursery system operates with a very weak link to agencies dealing with high quality planting materials. High quality germplasm enters the system but in a sporadic and uncontrolled way.
