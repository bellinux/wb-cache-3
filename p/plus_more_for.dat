50|$|The DuPont 12-hour {{rotating}} plan provides 24/7 coverage using 4 {{crews and}} 12-hour shifts while providing a week off.

In all the schedule is designed to improve safety. A particular advantage of this plan {{is that it can}} readily be slewed to fit business requirements. For example, if less coverage is required on a Sunday, stand-alone shifts are avoided by scheduling the fourth night and first day of four on that day. This also has the additional benefit of the quick turnaround day between three shift days and nights also falling on a Sunday.|$|R

40|$|The common urban {{waterfront}} {{is hardly}} approachable, much less swimmable, encrusted with wharves, switching yards, sewage outfalls and other barnacles. It {{is the true}} civic outcast, the ghetto of ghettos, familiar only to longshoremen, sanitary engineers and carp. THE WATERFRONT After World War II, {{a number of factors}} came together to affect the urban waterfront. Subsequently, these factors lead to the demise, and later the waterfront redevelopment phenomena of our time. In the 1940 's, the United States led the world in a series of technological innovations in Port design and industry. Most pertinent to the urban waterfront was the introduction of the container system which revolutionized the shipping industry, much to the expense of the urban waterfront. Soon after its introduction, the container system became the benchmark system in Port technology rendering the traditional "break bulk " dock facilities obsolete. With this systemic change also came a set of infrastructural requirements.

The beans are thought to symbolically purify the home by driving away the evil spirits that bring misfortune and bad health with them.

50|$|The most {{important}} component for CAS {{is the development}} of an accurate model of the patient. This can be conducted through a number of medical imaging technologies including CT, MRI, x-rays, ultrasound <b>plus</b> many <b>more.</b> <b>For</b> the generation of this model, the anatomical region to be operated has to be scanned and uploaded into the computer system. It is possible to employ a number of scanning methods, with the datasets combined through data fusion techniques. The final objective is the creation of a 3D dataset that reproduces the exact geometrical situation of the normal and pathological tissues and structures of that region. Of the available scanning methods, the CT is preferred, because MRI data sets are known to have volumetric deformations that may lead to inaccuracies. An example data set can include the collection of data compiled with 180 CT slices, that are 1 mm apart, each having 512 by 512 pixels. The contrasts of the 3D dataset (with its tens of millions of pixels) provide the detail of soft vs hard tissue structures, and thus allow a computer to differentiate, and visually separate for a human, the different tissues and structures. The image data taken from a patient will often include intentional landmark features, {{in order to be able}} to later realign the virtual dataset against the actual patient during surgery. See patient registration.|$|R
