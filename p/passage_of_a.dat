5|$|Ohio's {{governor}} had {{relatively little}} power—for example, he could recommend legislation, but not veto it—but with Ohio a key swing state, its governor {{was a major}} figure in national politics. Although McKinley believed that {{the health of the}} nation depended on that of business, he was evenhanded in dealing with labor.
