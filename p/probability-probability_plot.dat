40|$|The {{empirical}} {{process of}} the residuals from general autoregressions is investigated. If an intercept {{is included in the}} regression, the empirical process is asymptotically Gaussian and free of nuisance parameters. This contrasts the known result that in the unit root case without intercept the empirical process is asymptotically non-Gaussian. The result is used to establish asymptotic theory for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, <b>Probability-Probability</b> <b>plots,</b> and Quantile-Quantile plots. The link between sample moments and the empirical {{process of the}} residuals is established and used to establish the properties of the cumulant based tests for normality referred to as the Jarque-Bera test.

40|$|Landslide spatial, temporal, {{and size}} probabilities {{were used to}} perform a {{landslide}} hazard assessment in this study. Eleven intrinsic geomorphological, and two extrinsic rainfall factors were evaluated as landslide susceptibility related factors as they related to the success rate curves, landslide ratio plots, frequency distributions of landslide and non-landslide groups, as well as <b>probability–probability</b> <b>plots.</b> Data on landslides caused by Typhoon Aere in the Shihmen watershed were selected to train the susceptibility model. The landslide area probability, based on the power law relationship between the landslide area and a noncumulative number, was analyzed using the Pearson type 5 probability density function. The exceedance probabilities of rainfall with various recurrence intervals, including 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 yr, {{were used to determine}} the temporal probabilities of the events. The study was conducted in the Shihmen watershed, which has an area of 760 km 2 {{and is one of the}} main water sources for northern Taiwan. The validation result of Typhoon Krosa demonstrated that this landslide hazard model could be used to predict the landslide probabilities. The results suggested that integration of spatial, area, and exceedance probabilities to estimate the annual probability of each slope unit is feasible. The advantage of this annual landslide probability model lies in its ability to estimate the annual landslide risk, instead of a scenario-based risk...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} generalized <b>Probability-Probability</b> (P-P) <b>plots</b> {{in order}} to study the one-sample goodness-of-fit problem and the two-sample problem, for real valued data. These plots, that are constructed by indexing with the class of closed intervals, globally preserve the properties of classical P-P plots and are distribution-free under the null hypothesis. We also define the generalized P-P plot process and the corresponding, consistent tests. The behaviour of the tests under contiguous alternatives is studied in detail; in particular, limit theorems for the generalized P-P plot processes are presented. By their structure, the tests perform very well for spike (or pulse) alternatives. We also study the finite sample properties of the tests through a simulation study. ...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{of scale}} {{typically}} arise when comparing test score trends, gaps, and gap trends across different tests. To overcome {{some of these}} difficulties, test score distributions on the same score scale can be represented by nonparametric graphs or statistics that are invariant under monotone scale transformations. This article motivates and then develops a framework for the comparison of these nonparametric trend, gap, and gap trend representations across tests. The connections between this framework and other nonparametric tools, including <b>probability–probability</b> (PP) <b>plots,</b> the Mann-Whitney U test, and the statistic known as P(Y>X), are highlighted. The author describes the advantages of this framework over scale-dependent trend and gap statistics and demonstrates applications of these nonparametric methods to frequently asked policy questions...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe {{intention}} is to draw more specific connections between certain deconvolution methods and also to demonstrate {{the application of the}} statistical theory of estimation in the presence of measurement error. A parametric methodology for deconvolution when the underlying distribution is of the Pareto form is developed. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the parameters of the convolved distributions is considered. Standard errors of the estimated parameters are calculated from the inverse Fisher’s information matrix and a jackknife method. <b>Probability-probability</b> (P-P) <b>plots</b> and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodnessof- fit tests are used to evaluate the fit of the posited distribution. A bootstrapping method is used to calculate the critical values of the K-S test statistic, which are not available. South Afric...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} research, we aim {{to solve}} problems of two types of survival data, clustered survival data with potentially informative cluster size and sojourn time data. The methods for {{these two types of}} data are different. However, both data have right censored observations, and we use reweighting approaches to deal with the censoring issue. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation research, we consider marginal AFT models for correlated survival data with potentially informative cluster size. Informative cluster size means that the size of the correlated groups may be predictive of their survival characteristics. Two competing proposals, cluster-weighted AFT (CWAFT) marginal model and non-cluster-weighted AFT (NCW AFT) marginal model, are investigated. Simulation and theoretical results show that the CW AFT approach produces unbiased parameter estimation, but that the NCWAFT model does not when the cluster size is informative. We use <b>probability-probability</b> <b>plots</b> to investigate statistical properties of confidence intervals and adopt Wald tests to examine power properties for the CW AFT model. To illustrate our analysis, we apply the CWAFT model to a dental study data set. In the second part of the dissertation research, we consider the problem of comparing sojourn time distributions of a transient state in a general multi state system in two samples (groups) when the transition times are right censored. Under this setup, the censoring induced on the weight times is complex since both the state entry and exit are subjected to right censoring. Using the reweighting principle, a two sample MannWhitney type U-statistic is constructed that compares only the uncensored state sojourn times from the two distributions. A second Mann-Whitney type statistic is also constructed using a different reweighting that allows for comparison when one of the two sojourn times is either uncensored or singly censored. While both statistics are asymptotically unbiased and reduce to the standard Mann-Whitney statistic when there is no censoring, the second statistic has smaller variance since it effectively uses larger pairs of samples. Asymptotic normality of these statistics are established. A test of comparing the equality of sojourn time distributions in two independent samples is constructed by symmetrizing the pair specific Mann-Whitney type statistics mentioned above. The testing methodology is illustrated using a kidney disease patients data set...|$|R
40|$|The {{shortcomings}} of the proportion above cut (PAC) statistic used so prominently in the educational landscape renders it a very problematic measure for making correct inferences with student test data. The limitations of PAC-based statistics are more pronounced with cross-test comparisons due to their dependency on cut-score locations. A better alternative is using mean-based statistics that can translate to parametric effect-size measures. However, these statistics as well can be problematic. When Gaussian assumptions are not met, reasonable transformations of a score scale produce non-monotonic outcomes. The present study develops a distribution-wide approach to summarize trend, gap, and gap trend (TGGT) measures. This approach counters the limitations of PAC-based measures and mean-based statistics in addition to addressing TGGT-related statistics in a manner more closely tied to both the data and questions regarding student achievement. This distribution-wide approach encompasses visual graphics such as percentile trend displays and <b>probability-probability</b> <b>plots</b> fashioned after Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve methodology. The latter is framed as the P-P plot framework that was proposed by Ho (2008) {{as a way to}} examine trends and gaps with more consideration given to questions of scale and policy decisions. The extension in this study involves three main components: (1) incorporating Bayesian inference, (2) using a multivariate structure for longitudinal data, and (3) accounting for measurement error at the individual level. The analysis is based on mathematical assessment data comprising Grade 3 to Grade 7 from a large Midwestern school district. Findings suggest that PP-based effect sizes provide a useful framework to measure aggregate test score change and achievement gaps. The distribution-wide perspective adds insight by examining both visually and numerically how trends and gaps are affected throughout the score distribution. Two notable findings using the PP-based effect sizes were (1) achievement gaps were very similar between the Focal and Audit test, and (2) trend measures were significantly larger for the Audit test. Additionally, measurement error corrections using the multivariate Bayesian CTT approach had effect sizes disattenuated from those based on observed scores. Also, the ordinal-based effect size statistics were generally larger than their parametric-based counterparts, and this disattenuation was practically equivalent to that seen by accounting for measurement error. Finally, the rank-based estimator of P(X 3 ̆eY) via estimated true scores had smaller standard errors than for its parametric-based counterpart...|$|R
