5|$|While some {{birds are}} {{essentially}} territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators {{is particularly important}} in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This {{has led to the}} development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase <b>potential</b> <b>competition</b> for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.|$|E

It contains certain chemicals that may inhibit the female’s sex drive. Alternatively, it may physically plug the female’s gonophore. In either explanation, the spermatophore prevents the female from reproducing with another male. In essence, {{the use of a}} spermatophore is evolutionarily favorable because it increases the probability of the male’s genetic code being transferred to subsequent generations by lessening <b>potential</b> <b>competition</b> from other males.|$|E

The reservoir has a diverse fishery that includes large populations of native planktivorous Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and Threadfin Shad (D. petenense). Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are an invasive planktivorous fish species that invaded Kentucky Lake in 2004 and have successfully established a reproducing population. Silver Carp and Gizzard Shad have been shown to feed on similar food items that include both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Therefore, diet overlap between Silver Carp and Gizzard Shad is a major concern to biologists, commercial fishermen, and recreational fishermen due to the <b>potential</b> for <b>competition</b> with commercial and sportfish populations. We used stable isotope analyses to determine trophic position and <b>potential</b> for <b>competition</b> between Silver Carp and Gizzard Shad in Kentucky Lake.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityShallow water Antarctic benthic marine communities are composed primarily of trophic generalists that consume relatively unstable food item so Trophic specialists ingest more stable trophic resources or process adaptations that decrease their dependence on a food item when it is least abundant. Both generalists and specialists {{can be divided into}} groups or blocks of species, each block poccessing similar adaptations for dealing with the trophic resource regime. Potentially competitive interactions are confined to within these blocks, there being few interblock interactions. This may increase community stability. When the <b>potential</b> for <b>competition</b> is greatest, species within these blocks change, cease feeding or otherwise alter their feeding ecology, thereby, decreasing the <b>potential</b> for <b>competition.</b> This has been termed "decoupling". It is argued that decoupling increases community stability. Benthic trophic resources, including organic detritus and macroalgae, are found to be more stable through time than previously believed. This may explain why the majority of polar species produce non-planktonic larvae or are viviporous. It may also account for the large number of organisms that reproduce during the austral winter. Low species diversity in polar systems is probably the result of several factors, including the Antarctic Convergence which prevents invasion by homogeneity of the Antarctic province as a whole and the need to decrease the <b>potential</b> for <b>competition</b> (a destabilizing force) which prevents the evolution of finer niche partitioning...|$|R
