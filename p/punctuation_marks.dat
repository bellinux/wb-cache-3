In the letters state the teleprinter prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and <b>punctuation</b> <b>marks.</b> Teleprinters for languages using other alphabets also use an additional third shift state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.|$|E

Daalder argues that, as a result, there should be no <b>punctuation</b> <b>mark</b> after come.
