40|$|Tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) {{composite}} is a difficult-to-machine material {{owing to}} its excellent strength and hardness at elevated temperature. Wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) is a best alternative for machining of WC-Co composite into intricate and complex shapes. Efficient machining of WC-Co composite on WEDM is a challenging task since it involves large numbers of parameters. Therefore, in present work, experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the influence of important WEDM parameters on machining performance of WC-Co composite. Response surface methodology, which is a collection of mathematical and experimental techniques, was utilised to obtain the experimental data. Using face-centered central composite design, experiments were conducted to investigate and correlate the four input parameters: pulse-on time, pulse-off time, servo voltage and wire feed for three output performance characteristics &ndash; cutting speed (CS), surface roughness (SR) and <b>radial</b> <b>overcut</b> (RoC). Using analysis of variance on experimental data, quadratic vs. two-factor interaction (2 FI) models have been suggested for CS and RoC while two-factor interaction (2 FI) has been proposed for SR.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{research has}} gone into the field of electrical discharge machining (EDM), analysis related to the machining efficiency of the process with different electrodes has not been adequately made. Copper and brass are frequently used as electrode materials but graphite {{can be used as}} a potential electrode material due to its high melting point temperature and good electrical conductivity. In view of this, the present work attempts to compare the machinability of copper, graphite and brass electrodes while machining Inconel 718 super alloy. Taguchi’s L 27 orthogonal array has been employed to collect data for the study and analyze effect of machining parameters on performance measures. The important performance measures selected for this study are material removal rate, tool wear rate, surface roughness and <b>radial</b> <b>overcut.</b> Machining parameters considered for analysis are open circuit voltage, discharge current, pulse-on-time, duty factor, flushing pressure and electrode material. From the experimental analysis, it is observed that electrode material, discharge current and pulse-on-time are the important parameters for all the performance measures. Utility concept has been implemented to transform a multiple performance characteristics into an equivalent performance characteristic. Non-linear regression analysis is carried out to develop a model relating process parameters and overall utility index. Finally, the quantum behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms have been used to compare the optimal level of cutting parameters.

The present study investigates the effects of different electrodes, deep cryogenic treatment of tools subjected to different soaking duration and a hybrid approach of powder mixed EDM of cryogenically treated electrodes on machinability of Inconel 718 super alloy. Inconel 718 {{has been used as}} the work material owing to its extensive application in aerospace industries. A Box– Behnken design of response surface methodology (RSM) has been adopted to estimate the effect of machining parameters on the performance measures. The machining efficiency of the process is evaluated in terms of material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR), surface roughness, <b>radial</b> <b>overcut</b> and white layer thickness which are function of process variables viz. open circuit voltage, discharge current, pulse-on-time, duty factor and flushing pressure. In this work, a novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) has been proposed to get the Pareto-optimal solution. Mutation operator, predominantly used in genetic algorithm, has been introduced in the MOPSO algorithm to avoid premature convergence and to improve the solution quality. To avoid subjectiveness and impreciseness in the decision making, the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained through MOPSO have been ranked by the composite scores obtained through maximum deviation theory (MDT). Finally, a thermal model based on finite element method has been proposed to predict the MRR and tool wear rate (TWR) when work piece is machined with variety of electrode materials. A coupled thermo-structural model has been also proposed to estimate the residual stresses. The numerical models were validated through experimentations. Parametric study is carried out on the proposed model to understand the influence of important process parameters on the performance measures. The study offers useful insight into controlling the machining parameters to improve the machining efficiency of the EDMed components. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, nickel-based super alloys {{are widely}} used in aerospace, {{chemical}} and marine industries owing to their supreme ability to retain the mechanical properties at elevated temperature in combination with remarkable resistance to corrosion. Some of the properties of these alloys such as low thermal conductivity, strain hardening tendency, chemical affinity and presence of hard and abrasives phases in the microstructure render these materials very difficult-to-cut using conventional machining processes. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} current research is set to improve the productivity and surface integrity of machined surface of Inconel 625 (a nickel-based super alloy) by impregnating powder particles such as graphite, aluminum and silicon to kerosene dielectric during electric discharge machining (EDM). Initially, temperature distribution, material removal rate (MRR) and residual stress were predicted through numerical modelling of powder-mixed EDM (PMEDM) process. In the experimental investigation, particle size analysis of the as-received powder particles was carried out to identify the distribution of particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of particles indicated the presence of various phases including small amount of impurities. An experimental setup was developed and integrated with the existing EDM system for carrying out PMEDM process. The experiments were planned and conducted by varying five different parameters such as powder concentration, peak current, pulse-on time, duty cycle and gap voltage according to the central composite deign (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). Effects of these parameters along with powder concentration were investigated on various EDM characteristics such as material removal rate (MRR), <b>radial</b> <b>overcut</b> (ROC) and surface integrity aspects including surface crack density (SCD), surface roughness (SR), altered layer thickness (ALT), microhardness of surface and sub-surface regions, chemical and metallurgical alterations of the machined surface and residual stress. Results clearly indicated that addition of powder to dielectric has significantly improved MRR and surface integrity compared to pure dielectric. Among the powders used, graphite has resulted in highest MRR, lowest SCD, least ALT, least microhardness of surface and sub-surface regions. Least ROC, lowest surface roughness and least residual stress were obtained using silicon powder. Aluminum performed well in terms of MRR at low concentration range (upto 6 g/l). Therefore, optimal process performance under a given operating condition depends on judicious selection of powder materials, their size, concentration and process parameters...|$|R
