50|$|Among his notable {{contributions}} to astronomy was {{the design of}} the impersonal (<b>prismatic)</b> <b>astrolabe</b> now known as the Danjon astrolabe, which led to an improvement in the accuracy of fundamental optical astrometry. An account of this instrument, and of the results of some early years of its operation, are given in Danjon's 1958 George Darwin Lecture to the Royal Astronomical Society (in Monthly Notices of the RAS (1958), vol.118, pages 411-431).|$|E
40|$|Some {{questions}} concerning of complex analysis of all available information about observations of stars with <b>prismatic</b> <b>astrolabe</b> are discussed. This analysis is indispensable for enhancing {{the validity of}} long series of station coordinates, which was derived in the past. We suppose that application of new information technologies to arrays of astronomical data should improve the accuracy of ground-based astrometry, which is restricted by atmosphere influences...|$|E
