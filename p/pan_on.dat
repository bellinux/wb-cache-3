25|$|Once upon a {{time there}} were a pig, a wolf, a fox and a hare. One day they {{gathered}} together and decided that today they would send the wolf into the mountains for a sheep and they would eat. The pig sent the hare for water and sent the wolf and the fox into the mountain for a ram. At night, {{when they came to}} the flock of sheep, the fox began to moan from the eastern side. Since they heard the fox's moaning, the dogs ran in that direction and the wolf went towards the flock from the west and found a fat ram.

Pan Zhang was a heavy drinker and compulsive gambler, {{and he had to}} frequently borrow money to support these habits because his family was poor. When his creditors came to pursue debts, he always claimed that he would pay them back when he became wealthy.

Pan Zhang returned with more than 100 men and Sun Quan appointed him as a military officer. He became a Major of Separate Command (別部司馬) after defeating some bandits. Later, he was appointed as a da shi cijian (大巿刺姧; similar to a police chief) in Wu Commandery (吳郡; around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) and became famous after achieving success in maintaining high standards of security in the area.
