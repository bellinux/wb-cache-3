40|$|The {{aim of this}} postal {{questionnaire}} study was to measure attitudes to health care <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria</b> among the Finnish general public (n= 1156), politicians (n= 1096), doctors (n= 803) and nurses (n= 667), altogether 3722 subjects. The questionnaire consisted of questions on background data, a list of seven alternative prioritisation methods {{and a list of}} 11 possible criteria for health care prioritisation. The most acceptable prioritisation methods were increased treatment fees and restricting expensive treatments and examinations. Only a few supported administrative prioritisation decisions. One third of the general public indicated that they did not accept any limitations in health care, whereas only 5 % of doctors agreed with them. More doctors accepted prioritisation methods than respondents in other groups. Patient is a child, patient is an elderly person, severity of the disease and prognosis of the disease were the most accepted <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria.</b> Politicians and the general public also accepted self-induced nature of disease and patient's wealth as prioritisation crieteria. Logistic regression analysis of the general public respondents demonstrated that male gender, higher education and higher personal income were associated with acceptance of most <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria.</b> Similarly, older age of the respondent was associated with acceptance of self-induced nature of disease and patient's wealth as <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria.</b> Priorities in health Rationing Allocation of health care Prioritisation Resources Decision-making Purchasing Empirical study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Currently {{there is}} no {{framework}} for {{those involved in the}} identification, evaluation and prioritisation of new diagnostic technologies. Therefore we aimed to develop <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria</b> for the assessment of new diagnostic technologies, by gaining international consensus on not only which criteria should be used, but also their relative importance. Methods A two-round Delphi process was used to generate consensus amongst an international panel of twenty-six experts on priority criteria for diagnostic health technology assessment. Participants represented a range of health care and related professions, including government, industry, health services and academia. Results Based on the responses to the first questionnaire 18 criteria were placed into three categories: high, intermediate and moderate priority. For 16 of the 18 criteria, agreement with the categorisation of the criteria into the high, intermediate and moderate categories was high at ≥ 70 % (10 had agreement ≥ 80 %). A further questionnaire and panel discussion reduced the criteria to 16 and two categories; seven were classified as high priority and nine intermediate. Conclusions This study proposes an objective structure of <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria</b> to use when assessing new diagnostic technologies, based on an expert consensus process. The value of these criteria is that no one single component should be used as the decisive driver for prioritisation of new diagnostic technologies for adoption in healthcare settings. Future studies should be directed at establishing the value of these <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria</b> across a range of healthcare settings. </p...|$|E

The {{importance of each}} of the factors fluctuates depending on the repair scenario and the needs of the maintainer. In order to include the <b>prioritisation</b> of multiple <b>criteria,</b> a weighted decision making model is developed. The model evaluates all repair options and rates them individually for three decision making factors: survivability, cost, and downtime. The factor ratings are aggregated using designated weights, resulting in a final score for each of the repair options. This type of decision making evaluation provides flexibility in considering repair options that may otherwise be deemed unfavourable because of one factor. Case study results show one of five considered options as the best, for three of the four weight sets. The resulting best option of the other weight set demonstrates that definition of best repair is dependent on the priority of decision factors. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Objective—To {{devise a}} {{clinical}} prioritisation system for rationing {{access to a}} cardiac catheter waiting list and to describe its performance at predicting angiographic findings and selecting patients for angioplasty or {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery.  Setting—Tertiary level cardiology centre.  Methods—(1) 665  consecutive patients on an elective waiting list for coronary angiography were scored using a system derived from established clinical criteria for selecting patients for coronary surgery (New Zealand/Duke). The scores were compared with clinical outcome (referral for surgery, angioplasty, or medical management). (2) In a subset of 125  patients, scores derived from clinical criteria and exercise testing were compared with findings on coronary angiography. (3) Multivariate analysis was used in a new group of 178  patients to identify factors that would be better predictors of the angiographic score. (4) A new scoring system was devised based partly on the results of the multivariate analysis. It was applied to a new test group of 100  patients using clinical outcome and angiographic score as outcome measures.  Results—(1) Using the established clinical score, similar proportions of patients were referred after angiography for medical management, angioplasty, or coronary bypass grafting, irrespective of their original score. The exceptions were patients with a score <  20, who were more likely to continue medical management. (2) There was poor correlation (r =  0. 05) between the clinical score and the subsequent angiographic score. (3) Multivariate analysis identified age, male sex, previous myocardial infarction, high cholesterol, and diabetes as independent predictors of coronary score. (4) The modified scoring system, incorporating the predictors identified by multivariate analysis, performed better than the original scoring system in predicting coronary score when both were tested, but some patients had severe disease despite a low score.  Conclusions—Patients can be ranked using clinical and non-invasive criteria, and a rationing system implemented on this basis. With <b>prioritisation</b> by non-invasive <b>criteria,</b> the risk of missing serious coronary disease in patients with relatively mild symptoms must be accepted; this risk becomes greater the more stringently rationing is applied.    Keywords: prioritisation;  coronary angiograph...|$|R
40|$|Continuing {{interest}} in sustainable biofuel production is linked with sustainable farming and begs for insights from farming systems research on sustainability assessment {{and the role}} of family farms. The aims of this work were two-fold. First, to present a tools and methods selection framework supporting indicator-based sustainability assessment. Second, to apply the framework to the case of castor beans (Ricinus communis L.), family farmers and the biodiesel industry in the southeast of Brazil. The framework synthesizes existing work on sustainability assessment within the agricultural domain. Transparent selection of tools and methods is supported by sequentially accounting for the context of sustainability, dealing with space, classifying the ‘nature of research’ and the degree of integration of different facets of sustainability. The framework is demonstrated with an exploratory assessment of the potential for castor bean cultivation within the current farm type of extensive pasture and fodder crops for dairy cattle. The study accounted for the range of productivity levels within the current farm type and for different management decisions when including castor beans. Assessment was made against economic development, livelihood stability and soil fertility criteria. Selected tools and methods included farm surveys, alternative farming system design and input–output calculations. The results demonstrate the greatest opportunity for castor bean cultivation by currently low productive farms. There is a trade-off of income derived from milk production that is supported by fodder production, and income from castor beans. Decisions regarding areal extent of castor beans and supplementing animal feed, are shown to be farm-specific, and depend upon the interactions between current farm productivity and <b>prioritisation</b> of sustainability <b>criteria.</b> However, generally it is shown that castor bean cultivation should be linked to animal production so that current risk management and income levels can be supported and improved. Further, to maintain soil fertility, castor bean cultivation with nitrogen inputs is necessary. The cyclic nature of the framework supports the next contextualisation of the sustainability question. For our application, constructive future work in a next cycle could include extending to regional level and accounting for temporal variability. [...] -...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} hospital ward design and aspects of visual privacy as a design criterion. It involves three stakeholders: users (potential and actual patients), experts and architects. In particular it explores {{the relationships between the}} spatial design of the plan configuration of buildings, in this case hospital open wards, and subjective judgments on spatial location for privacy across different demographics and cultural backgrounds. These variables are considered {{in the context of the}} current guidelines on, and regulations of, ward design <b>criteria,</b> and architects’ <b>prioritisation</b> of these <b>criteria.</b> Mixed methodological approaches – i. e. qualitative and quantitative methods – are employed. Space Syntax theory and its particular technique Visibility Graph Analysis (VGA) are used to quantify the spatial structure of six generic open ward types. A series of statistical analyses allowed the investigation of the relationships between measures of plan configurations and patterns of preferences in relation to beds’ spatial location for privacy assessed by means of a questionnaire. This is followed by qualitative policy analyses and semi-structured interviews with experts to provide a set of the relevant ward design criteria, which is used to conduct choice-based conjoint analysis to explore architects’ prioritisation of ward design criteria including patient’s privacy. Results showed a systematic relationship between the chosen location for privacy and spatial properties of the ward plans best represented by two measures: Integration and Control, with integration being the best predictor of preference. This was found to encompass universal preference for spatial locations of privacy across culture, age and gender and a specific significant difference as a result of previous experience of space. A reasonable awareness of the importance of patient’s privacy as a design criterion was found not only in the current guidelines and regulations on ward design but also in experts’ perception and architects’ prioritisation of ward design criteria. However, it appears that there is no framework to assess people’s privacy preference or specific information to guide architects on spatial preference. Systematic findings with respect to plan configurations are not only important in themselves, they provide the context within which detailed design choices can be made.

40|$|Background Stroke is {{the most}} common cause of {{disability}} in the western World. Approximately 176, 000 new individuals in the United Kingdom and Ireland are diagnosed with stroke annually with up to one third experiencing aphasia. Aphasia is a chronic language disorder impairing comprehension, expression, reading, writing and spelling. The majority of people living with aphasia are over 65 years and live in the community. One of the most disabling impacts of aphasia is the way that it excludes the person from everyday conversation. People with Aphasia (PWA) frequently experience social isolation and marginalisation. The Conversation Partner Programme (CPP) is a community based aphasia intervention that emphasises communicative competence and life participation. Currently there is no national or international system for evaluating CPPs. Following policy imperatives for Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) and the recommendations of the World Report on Disability (WHO) it is important to involve service users in service design and evaluation. However, PWA are often excluded because of their communication disability. To create a CPP evaluation system PWA and other key stakeholder groups must determine core evaluation criteria. Service Learning (SL), the pedagogical tool used to implement the CPP in this study must also be examined because the mode of delivery is central to stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and experiences. Aims The primary aim is to: (1) use a Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) approach to include PWA and other key stakeholders as co-researchers in identifying CPP evaluation criteria. A secondary objective is to: (2) examine the effectiveness of SL the pedagogical tool underpinning the CPP. Methods Following a pilot study, the generation and analysis of qualitative data using a PLA approach was conducted. Using purposeful sampling, participants (n= 26) including PWA (n= 5); Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) (n= 5); students (n= 9); educators (n= 6) and the CPP co-ordinator (n= 1) were recruited and involved as co-researchers. Using PLA techniques to generate and analyse data (Flexible Brainstorming, Card Sort, Direct Ranking; Seasonal Calendar and PLA interviewing) in individual groups, or in interstakeholder groups (n= 22), co-researchers explored the lived experience of aphasia and identified CPP evaluation criteria. The principles of thematic analysis guided the co-analysis of data generated with stakeholder groups. Data generated in Ireland were presented to a leading non-governmental organisation for PWA in the United Kingdom, as a preliminary exploration of the transferability of findings. The effectiveness of SL was explored with key stakeholder groups using: (1) qualitative methods (PLA focus groups; interviews; orthodox focus groups) and (2) through a critical review of the SL literature in pre-professional healthcare curricula. Results In response to the primary research aims, co-researchers with aphasia generated eight themes in their own words to capture the lived experience of aphasia, including: (1) Back to pre-school; (2) Tiredness; (3) Itâs Like in Prison; (4) Emotions; (5) Not able to talk the words; (6) Escape; (7) Changing and Adapting; and (8) Family. The multi-perspectival analysis of the CPP resulted in the identification and <b>prioritisation</b> of evaluation <b>criteria</b> from the emic perspective of stakeholders including: (1) shared understanding of structure, (2) clarity about the programme, (3) agreed evaluation mechanism, (4) linking with other organisations and (5) feedback. PWA reported that feelings of communicative incompetence were minimised and social connectedness was increased through participation in the programme. In response to the secondary research objective, SL appears to be an appropriate pedagogical tool to underpin the CPP because it supports mutuality and reciprocity in university and community partnerships. However the inconsistency in terminology to describe SL internationally and the paucity of robust methodological studies to establish effectiveness warrant further research. Conclusion This study critically interrogated communication disability as a barrier to inclusion in research. Using participatory research methods, PWA and other key stakeholders meaningfully participated as co-researchers in the evaluation of a primary care conversation intervention and examined the impacts of SL. This novel collaborative work generated new empirical evidence about the lived experience of aphasia and resulted in agreed CPP evaluation criteria. This study also found that SL is a suitable pedagogical tool to embed the CPP in a University setting. These findings will directly impact the Galway CPP and may be transferable to other similar conversation interventions nationally and internationally. Findings and methods will be of interest to healthcare professionals; service users; educators and researchers seeking to involve marginalised groups, especially people with communication disabilities, in scholarship and research. 2021 - 12 - 1...|$|R

This study assesses different stakeholders' views on the acceptability of waiting lists in health care, their preferences for priority care of patients, and their judgements on acceptable waiting times for surgical patients. Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted among 257 former patients (82 with varicose veins, 86 with inguinal hernia, and 89 with gallstones), 101 surgeons, 95 occupational physicians, and 65 GPs. Judgements on acceptable waiting times were assessed using vignettes of patients with varicose veins, inguinal hernia, and gallstones.

40|$|Declarative process models {{define the}} {{behaviour}} of business processes {{as a set}} of constraints. Declarative process discovery aims at inferring such constraints from event logs. Existing discovery techniques verify the satisfaction of candidate constraints over the log, but completely neglect their interactions. As a result, the inferred constraints can be mutually contradicting and their interplay may lead to an inconsistent process model that does not accept any trace. In such a case, the output turns out to be unusable for enactment, simulation or verification purposes. In addition, the discovered model contains, in general, redundancies that are due to complex interactions of several constraints and that cannot be cured using existing pruning approaches. We address these problems by proposing a technique that automatically resolves conflicts within the discovered models and is more powerful than existing pruning techniques to eliminate redundancies. First, we formally define the problems of constraint redundancy and conflict resolution. Second, we introduce techniques based on the notion of automata-product monoid, which guarantees the consistency of the discovered models and, at the same time, keeps the most interesting constraints in the pruned set. The level of interestingness is dictated by user-specified <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria.</b> We evaluate the devised techniques on a set of real-world event logs...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, {{waiting time}} is a {{critical}} issue for out-patient specialist care and diagnostic services, and it is being tackled by national plans issued in the last decade. Most regions improved patients’ access through better information on waiting times, process re-engineering {{and the creation of}} unified booking centres. In addition, important <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria</b> have been piloted to manage waiting time based on clinical criteria and professional judgment (for example, the Homogenous Waiting Groups pilots). However, actual policies, including the implementation of national legislation, vary across the regions, with some of them very active and others often lagging behind. Policies on co-payments, intramoenia dual practice and voluntary insurance also have substantial effects on waiting time. National and regional co- payments have likely reduced waiting time via the reduction of demand for national health services, but rather broad exemption criteria have limited their effect on the more affluent and healthier part of the population. The expansion of intramoenia dual practice and the promotion of additional private health insurance could undermine access to the NHS basic health care package: the former may encourage doctors to build up long lists in their public practices so as to maintain demand for their private practice, whereas the latter may worsen equity of access to the NHS services...|$|E

We aimed to identify, select and apply guideline recommendations to develop a set of QIs to measure the implementation of evidence-based practice using routinely recorded clinical data in United Kingdom (UK) primary care. Methods We reviewed existing national clinical guidelines and QIs and used a four-stage consensus development process to derive a set of ‘high impact’ QIs relevant to primary care based upon explicit <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria.</b> We then field tested the QIs using remotely extracted, anonymised patient records from 89 randomly sampled primary care practices in the Yorkshire region of England. Results Out of 2365 recommendations and QIs originally reviewed, we derived a set of 18 QIs (5 single, 13 composites – comprising 2 - 9 individual recommendations) for field testing. QIs predominantly addressed chronic disease management, in particular diabetes, cardiovascular and renal disease, and included both processes and outcomes of care. Field testing proved to be critical for further refinement and final selection. Conclusions We have demonstrated a rigorous and transparent methodology to develop a set of high impact, evidence-based QIs for primary care from clinical guideline recommendations.

The identification of 24 / 185 topics for musculoskeletal, 43 / 174 for neurology, 30 / 120 for cardiorespiratory and medical rehabilitation, and 30 / 113 for mental and physical health and wellbeing as priorities demonstrated discrimination of the process. Consensus between participants was good for most topics. Measurement validity of the research topics was good. The involvement of multiple stakeholders as participants ensured the current context of the intended use of the priorities. Conclusions From a process of national consensus involving key stakeholders, including service users, physiotherapy research topics have been identified and prioritised. Setting priorities provides a vision of how research can contribute to the developing research base in physiotherapy to maximise focus...|$|E

There are between 1500 and 2000 SVHC on the European market; however, to date, the European Chemicals Agency has published only 29 substances as candidates for the authorisation procedure. This work aims to contribute to the practical implementation of REACH by proposing a list of SVHC which, from a union’s perspective, should have priority for inclusion in the authorisation procedure. Methods In a first stage, SVHC for prioritisation were identified, <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria</b> were established, and scores for each criterion were defined for finally developing the Trade Union List. Results Through previously presented criteria, the Trade Union List includes 305 high-production-volume chemicals that meet the requirements of the authorisation process under REACH. 190 of these substances are associated with recognised occupational diseases, and 22 have been included in the REACH Candidate List. Conclusions In this paper, we present a precautionary but scientifically aligned process for identifying, scoring and ranking SVHC, including categories of substances not currently considered in other approaches to the REACH Regulation.

40|$|Background The new EU REACH Regulation {{to control}} the trade and use of {{chemicals}} has a great potential to reduce worker exposure to hazardous substances and therefore reduce chemical related occupational diseases.

40|$|Background There is current {{interest}} in incorporating weights based on public preferences {{for health and}} healthcare into priority-setting decisions. Objective The aim of this systematic review was to explore {{the extent to which}} public preferences and trade-offs for priority-setting criteria have been quantified, and to describe the study contexts and preference elicitation methods employed. Methods A systematic review was performed in April 2013 to identify empirical studies eliciting the stated preferences of the public for the provision of healthcare in a priority-setting context. Studies are described in terms of (i) the stated preference approaches used, (ii) the priority-setting levels and contexts, and (iii) the criteria identified as important and their relative importance. Results Thirty-nine studies applying 40 elicitation methods reported in 41 papers met the inclusion criteria. The discrete choice experiment method was most commonly applied (n = 18, 45. 0 %), but other approaches, including contingent valuation and the person trade-off, were also used. Studies prioritised health systems (n = 4, 10. 2 %), policies/programmes/services/interventions (n = 16, 41. 0 %), or patient groups (n = 19, 48. 7 %). Studies generally confirmed the importance {{of a wide range of}} process, non-health and patient-related characteristics in priority setting in selected contexts, alongside health outcomes. However, inconsistencies were observed for the relative importance of some <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria,</b> suggesting context and/or elicitation approach matter. Conclusions Overall, findings suggest caution in directly incorporating public preferences as weights for priority setting unless the methods used to elicit the weights can be shown to be appropriate and robust in the priority-setting context.

40|$|Approaches that {{prioritise}} chemicals {{according to}} their importance as environmental contaminants have been developed by government agencies and private industries. However, it has been noticed that few approaches, such as one published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), {{address the needs of}} the drinking water industry. There is also no generic approach to the selection, prioritisation and monitoring of organic contaminants in the drinking water value chain. To safeguard drinking water industry customers, it was necessary to develop a generic protocol to assist with the identification of a list of organic contaminants for monitoring in the drinking water value chain. Once the protocol was developed, it was validated in a prototype drinking water value chain. This paper describes the implementation of such a generic protocol. The exercise comprised of testing each step of the protocol, from selection of the ‘pool of organic contaminants’ (Step I) to recommending the final priority list of organic contaminants (Step VII). Successful implementation of the protocol took place in the Rand Water (South Africa) drinking water value chain (from catchment to tap). Expert judgment was emphasized during the implementation as each step was validated and the opinion of key stakeholders used to shape the process. The tailor-made <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria,</b> reflecting the drinking water industry perspective, proved to be successful in selecting and prioritising organic contaminants for monitoring in the drinking water value chain. The organic contaminants were successfully prioritised in 3 classes: short-term priority for analysis, medium-term priority for analysis and long-term priority for analysis. This is a very important guide to assist water utilities in optimising their resources while not compromising the role of public health protection. Finally, a priority list of organic contaminants was identified for use by Rand Water and other water utilities. The Rand Water Board[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Anaemia {{develops}} in most patients undergoing cancer therapy and invariably induces fatigue, {{which is a}} major determinant of QOL. Blood transfusions are reserved for patients with severe anaemia, since blood is a scarce resource and provides a short-lived benefit. Epoetins are recombinant proteins capable of alleviating therapy-related anaemia in 40 - 60 % of cancer patients. The number of patients needed to be treated with epoetins to avoid the transfusion of one unit of blood ranges from 2. 6 to 5. 2; however, the absolute risk reduction depends on patients The ratio between acquisition costs of epoetins and blood transfusion requirement is very high; thus, many thousands of dollars needs to be spent on epoetins to save 1 blood unit. Despite this, epoetins have been widely adopted by industrialised countries, where cancer patients are about 2 % of the total population. The resulting budget impact of epoetins can be calculated at about 10 % of the overall direct cost for cancer care, and it is expected to continue growing by about 20 % each year, due to the expanding cancer population and the intensification of cancer therapies. The economic burden of epoetins needs to be weighed against the improvement of patients' QOL and society's willingness to pay for a non-life-saving therapy. All published economic evaluations of epoetins invariably report that this supportive therapy is not cost effective. Society should be made aware of the opportunity cost of treatments and should be allowed to elicit preferences for healthcare interventions and <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria.</b> In the near future we expect that a wider range of epoetins, drug patent expiry, a more appropriate patient selection criteria and an improved dosage schedule may help increase the efficiency of cancer-related anaemia management.

40|$|On 23 rd September 2010, the Patient Safety First {{initiative}} {{was launched in}} response to recommendations of the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance – Building a Culture of Patient Safety (2008). A key component of the Patient Safety First initiative is the National Framework for Clinical Effectiveness. The purpose of this framework is to provide formal structures and processes to support clinical effectiveness. Clinical effectiveness involves a number of processes, but primary among these are (i) the development or adaptation and use of clinical guidelines to support evidence-based practice and (ii) the use of clinical audit to improve patient care and outcomes. The oversight of the National Framework for Clinical Effectiveness {{is provided by the}} National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC). This Committee is a partnership between key stakeholders in patient safety. The NCEC provides guidance on how to develop clinical guidelines. The NCEC supports the development, implementation and on-going utilisation of clinical guidelines at national, regional and local level to ensure that evidence-based practice is supported and applied routinely in everyday practice. The NCEC considers that clinical guideline development and utilisation should continue at all levels and that not all clinical guidelines are required to be National Clinical Guidelines endorsed by the Minister for Health. The Minister for Health will endorse a small number of National Clinical Guidelines per year. Clinical guideline development groups will submit guidelines being proposed for national endorsement by the Minister for Health to the NCEC for screening, prioritisation and appraisal. The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed National Quality Assurance Criteria for Clinical Guidelines. The NCEC will appraise prioritised clinical guidelines against the National Quality Assurance Criteria for Clinical Guidelines and recommend guidelines, as appropriate, for endorsement as National Clinical Guidelines to the Minister for Health. The NCEC has developed these National Screening and <b>Prioritisation</b> <b>Criteria</b> for Clinical Guidelines to guide a process of prioritisation of clinical guidelines for national appraisal. The NCEC is not adopting or adapting international criteria. The criteria have been developed following review of international work and consideration of the context of Irish healthcare delivery. The criteria will address current NCEC requirements for screening and prioritisation of clinical guidelines for national appraisal. The criteria will be reviewed and are likely to evolve over time with experience and changing requirements of the healthcare system...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Primary {{open angle}} {{glaucoma}} (POAG) is a characteristic optic neuropathy which progresses to irreversible vision loss. Few genes {{have been detected}} that influence POAG susceptibility and other genes are therefore likely to be involved. We analyzed carefully characterized POAG cases in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). METHODS: We performed a GWAS in 387 POAG cases using public control data (WTCCC 2). We also investigated the quantitative phenotypes, cup:disc ratio (CDR), central corneal thickness (CCT), and intra-ocular pressure (IOP). Promising single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), based on various <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria,</b> were genotyped in a cohort of 294 further POAG cases and controls. RESULTS: We found 2 GWAS significant results in the discovery stage for association, one of which which had multiple evidence in the gene 'neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9 ' (NEDD 9; rs 11961171, p= 8. 55 E- 13) and the second on chromosome 16 with no supporting evidence. Taking into account all the evidence from risk and quantitative trait ocular phenotypes we chose 86 SNPs for replication in an independent sample. Our most significant SNP was not replicated (p= 0. 59). We found 4 nominally significant results in the replication cohort, but none passed correction for multiple testing. Two of these, for phenotypes CDR (rs 4385494, discovery p= 4. 51 x 10 - 5, replication p= 0. 029) and CCT (rs 17128941, discovery p= 5. 52 x 10 - 6, replication= 0. 027), show the consistent direction of effects between the discovery and replication data. We also assess evidence for previously associated known genes and find evidence for the genes 'transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 1 ' (TMCO 1) and 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 B' (CDKN 2 B). CONCLUSIONS: Although {{we were unable to}} replicate any novel results for POAG risk, we did replicate two SNPs with consistent effects for CDR and CCT, though they do not withstand correction for multiple testing. There has been a range of publications {{in the last couple of}} years identifying POAG risk genes and genes involved in POAG related ocular traits. We found evidence for 3 known genes (TMCO 1, CDKN 2 B, and S 1 RNA binding domain 1 [SRBD 1]) in this study. Novel rare variants, not detectable by GWAS, but by new methods such as exome sequencing may hold the key to unravelling the remaining contribution of genetics to complex diseases such as POAG...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{prioritise}} wetlands of the Rangitikei Catchment. The prioritisation {{will enable the}} Manawatu-Wanganui Regional Council to apply its limited resources in {{an effective way to}} preserve the biodiversity of the wetlands of the catchment. A process was designed to achieve the project aim. The first step in the process was the establishment of two conservation goals: 1) Maintain species diversity, 2) Eliminate threats within wetlands. Secondly, the wetlands of the Rangitikei Catchment were surveyed to collect state and pressure information. 25 wetland sites were surveyed using the REWA survey method. Data collected was then analysed, first using the complementarity programme Sites V 1. 0. However, complementarity analysis did not achieve a clarified prioritisation of wetland sites because extreme variability was found among sites. In particular, complementarity analysis did not respond well to having two very different conservation goals of pressure and state. Therefore, 13 <b>prioritisation</b> <b>criteria</b> were employed based on elements of pressure and state. A method was devised to overcome problems of weighting criteria. True scores were converted to adjusted scores of 1 to 4 using the box and whisker division method. This method also allowed for easier replication and manipulation of data as well as clear visual representation, unlike other methods. A unique prioritisation framework was then devised which allowed multiple criteria (in this study pressure and state) to be assessed simultaneously. The framework also allowed the large amounts of data involved in the prioritisation process to be presented as a single priority ranking. The prioritisation framework is a relatively simple, repeatable and highly adaptable method. The framework does not compromise the contribution of each criterion to the overall value of the wetland. This resulted in prioritisation of the surveyed wetland sites of the Rangitikei Catchment and allowed achievement of the study's conservation goals. The box and whisker division method and prioritisation framework presented in the study are two unique methods that may be applied in future prioritisation programmes. Both methods provide simple and visual representations of the complex processes involved in the prioritisation of wetland sites and respond to multiple and opposing conservation goals. The nature of the prioritisation framework allows information to be added as it becomes available as well as accommodating the addition and expansion of conservation goals...|$|E
