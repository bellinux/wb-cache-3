5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was {{displayed}} {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown. The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> restored in 2007.|$|E
5|$|After this rejection, the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{sold to a}} Swedish art {{collector}} {{who offered}} {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if the painting belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> both an unsurpassed masterpiece of Swedish art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ways that <b>paint</b> can <b>be</b> {{recycled}}. Most often, the highest quality of latex <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> sorted out and turned back into recycled <b>paint</b> that can <b>be</b> used. Recycled <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> environmentally preferable to new paint, while still maintaining comparable quality. In many cases, reusable paints of the same color are pumped into a tank where the material is mixed and tested. The <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> adjusted with additives and colorants as necessary. Finally, the <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> fine filtered and packaged for sale.|$|R
50|$|Metro {{receives}} post-consumer {{latex paint}} (PCLP) from garbage customers. Technicians inspect the paint for recyclability: recyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> sorted by color, and unrecyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> disposed in landfills. The recyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> then color-corrected. Additives are blended in, and the <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> then filtered, performance tested, packaged into pails and cans, and sold {{back to the}} public at a price intended to recover the program’s labor and material costs.|$|R
5|$|Matejko began {{collecting}} {{materials for the}} painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas some time in 1875 and finished it in 1878. Soon afterwards, he received a scepter from the council of Kraków in an official ceremony, in recognition of his work and his position {{as one of the}} most respected Polish artists. The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> sold that year to Dawid Rosenblum, a private individual in Warsaw. Displayed in numerous international exhibitions, in 1902 the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> bought from Rosenblum's heirs by the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych) and displayed in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{began work}} on the {{painting}} {{in the middle of}} January 1891, to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution. Although the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> not finished until October, by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Sukiennice, Kraków. On April 7, 1892, Matejko transferred the painting to Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko, marshal of Galician Sejm in Lwów, and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of the Lviv University). This <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> one of the last works by Matejko, who died in November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are unclear}} {{as to the}} painting's {{provenance}} after the Salon. According to the Met, the New York-based Philip (or Philippe) Ortiz, manager of the New York Branch of Braun and Company, purchased it in late 1912. According to a 1933 report in the Middletown Times Herald, he paid 12,000 francs ($2,400) for the work, but never brought the painting back to the United States. However, Brauer suggests that Ortiz sent it to his gallery in New York, where it caused a controversy. According to Time, the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> acquired by Leon Mantashev 1913, after the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> returned to Chabas.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} by Arthur George, Third Earl of Onslow, after Delaroche and George reportedly visited the Louvre in Paris, where they saw David's {{version of the}} famous event. It had only recently been re-hung in the museum after a resurgence of interest in Napoleon, nearly 40 years after he was exiled. Agreeing that the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> unrealistic, George, who owned a sizable collection of Napoleonic paraphernalia, commissioned Delaroche {{to create a more}} realistic depiction. Elizabeth Foucart-Walker asserts that in fact the painting that hangs in the Louvre was produced first as it was already in America by 1850, when the Liverpool <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> produced. Stephen Bann suggests that Arthur George's meeting with Delaroche may have occurred, but Delaroche chose to produce two works that are almost identical and send one to America. The Liverpool version of the painting is more refined.|$|E

The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> met with critical acclaim at the world's fair, and the fair's artistic committee awarded Jovanović a gold medal for his work. By way of this decision, the art historian Jelena Milojković-Djurić asserts, the Paris committee recognized that the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> on par with those of the world's best visual artists.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus is {{the only}} {{surviving}} female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively {{by members of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.|$|E

5|$|Whistler {{submitted}} {{the painting to}} the Academy, but according to Heffernan, he {{expected it to be}} rejected at this point. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert, a noted equestrienne of the period: however it was soon rumoured that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan. Whistler's <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it.
