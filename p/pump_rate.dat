40|$|This study {{develops}} a nudging data assimilation algorithm for estimating unknown pumping from private wells in an aquifer system using measured data of hydraulic head. The proposed algorithm treats the unknown pumping {{as an additional}} sink term in the governing equation of groundwater flow and provides a consistent physical interpretation for <b>pumping</b> <b>rate</b> identification. The algorithm identifies the unknown pumping and, at the same time, reduces the forecast error in hydraulic heads. We apply the proposed algorithm to the Las Posas Groundwater Basin in southern California. We consider the following three pumping scenarios: constant <b>pumping</b> <b>rates,</b> spatially varying <b>pumping</b> <b>rates,</b> and temporally varying <b>pumping</b> <b>rates.</b> We also study the impact of head measurement errors on the proposed algorithm. In the case study we seek to estimate the six unknown <b>pumping</b> <b>rates</b> from private wells using head measurements from four observation wells.

Woods had modified Belzer's perfusate by the addition of 250 mg of methyl prednisolone, increased the magnesium sulphate content to 16.2 mEq and the insulin to 320 units. Six of 6 kidneys produced life sustaining function when they were reimplanted after 72 hours storage despite immediate contralateral nephrectomies; 1 of 2 kidneys produced life sustaining function after 96 hours storage, 1 of 2 after 120 hours storage, and 1 of 2 after 168 hours storage.

Liu used well hydrated dogs undergoing a mannitol diuresis and stored the kidneys at 9 °C - 10 °C using a perfusate derived from human PPF. The PPF was further fractionated {{by using a}} highly water-soluble polymer (Pluronic F-38), and sodium acetyl tryptophanate and sodium caprylate {{were added to the}} PPF as stabilisers to permit pasteurisation. To this solution were added human albumin, heparin, mannitol, glucose, magnesium sulphate, potassium chloride, insulin, methyl prednisolone, carbenicillin, and water to adjust the osmolality to 300-310 mosmol/kg.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} {{technique}} to estimate the corneal endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> in human subjects. METHODS: Corneal hydration control {{is thought to be}} maintained by a pump-leak mechanism whereby the leak of solutes and fluid across the endothelial barrier into the stroma is, in the steady state, exactly balanced by the pumping of solutes and passive fluid transfer across the endothelium to the aqueous humor. Overall corneal hydration control can be measured from {{the rate at which the}} swollen cornea thins (deswells), and a measure of the leak can be obtained simultaneously from the endothelial permeability to fluorescein. From the pump-leak hypothesis, the deswelling rate is directly proportional to the <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> and inversely proportional to the leak rate. The relative endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> can be estimated as the product of the normalized deswelling rate and the normalized endothelial permeability. This procedure was used to obtain the relative endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> in 41 patients with diabetes mellitus, 12 patients with long-term corneal transplants, 20 long-term wearers of contact lenses, and 19 normal volunteer subjects after the short-term administration of topical dorzolamide. RESULTS: The relative endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> did not differ significantly from that of control subjects in diabetics, in contact lens wearers, and after dorzolamide administration, but was markedly decreased in the patients with corneal transplants, despite a reduction in permeability (reduced leak).

40|$|ABSTRACT The kinetic {{characteristics}} of the ouabain-sensitive (Na + K) transport system (pump) of high potassium (HK) and low potassium (LK) sheep red cells have been investigated. In sodium medium, the curve relating <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> to external K is sigmoid with half maximal stimulation (K / 2) occurring at 3 mM for both cell types, the maximum <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> in HK cells being about four times that in LK cells. In sodium-free media, both HK and LK pumps are adequately described by the Michaelis-Menten equation, but the K 1 / 2 for HK cells is 0. 6 4 0. 1 mM K, while that for LK is 0. 2 0. 05 mm K. When the internal Na and K content of the cells was varied by the PCMBS method, {{it was found that}} the <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> of HK cells showed a gradual increase from zero at very low internal Na to a maximum when internal K was reduced to nearly zero (100 % Na). In LK cells, on the other hand, no pump activity was detected if Na constituted less than 70 % of the total (Na + K) in the cell. Increasing Na from 70 to nearly 100 % of the internal cation composition, however, resulted in an exponential increase in <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> in these cells to about 6 the maximum rate observed in HK cells. While changes in internal composition altered the <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> at saturating concentrations of external K, it had no effect on the apparent affinity of the pumps for external K. These results lead us to conclude that the individual pump sites in the HK and LK sheep red cell membranes must be different.

In the present paper, the model is tested by determining the effects of antidiuretic hormone on the pools and fluxes. It is shown that this hormone affects only that sodium pool previously designated as the transport pool, and that the effects are on two separate sites. In the first place, the hormone stimulates entry at the mucosal side of the transport compartment, and by this means brings about {{an increase in the}} amount of sodium contained in the compartment.
