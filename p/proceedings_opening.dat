On 24 February, Wallenstein reached Eger where he was assassinated by a group of Scottish and Irish officers who were previously hired by Piccolomini. Schaffgotsch was arrested on the same day, later being transferred to the fortress of Glatz where he was held for eight weeks. On 1 March, the commander of the Troppau garrison (an officer under Schaffgotsch's command) declared his allegiance to Wallenstein, unaware of what had previously happened. An investigation into the incident proved that Schaffgotsch was not implicated the uprising. In the second half of April, he was sent to Vienna upon his request, where he continued to be interrogated. In July, he was again taken to Pilsen, on 20 June he was relocated to Budweis due to the risk posed by Johan Banér's invasion of Bohemia. On 18 February 1635, a military tribunal responsible for Schaffgotsch's case convened in Regensburg, with the <b>proceedings</b> <b>opening</b> in the middle of March. On 31 March 1635, Schaffgotsch was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and sentenced to death. Schaffgotsch pleaded not guilty citing the fact that Wallenstein was not officially relieved of his command and as such he was obliged to follow his orders. On 4 July, presiding judge Heinrich von Schlick ordered the use of torture which failed to produce a confession of guilt. A day later, the emperor confirmed the death sentence which was implemented on the morning of 24 July 1635. Schaffgotsch's execution was part of larger purge that included the execution of the Troppau garrison commander and the demotion and the temporary imprisonment of seven generals including , all of the convicted were signatories of the Pilsner Reverse. Schaffgotsch's estates at Trachenberg-Prausnitz and the Riesengebirge were confiscated in April 1634. On 31 August 1641, the former were granted to Melchior von Hatzfeldt while the latter were gradually returned to Hans Ulrich's sons following their conversion to Catholicism.|$|E

2500|$|Australia began <b>proceedings</b> with <b>opening</b> {{partners}} Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden reaching 50 runs {{before the}} end of the seventh over. This partnership was ended in spectacular fashion, with Hayden attempting a strong pull shot which looked to be heading straight for the boundary. However, Mathew Sinclair, at full sprint and diving to his left, pulled off a marvellous wrong-handed catch which has been heralded as one of the best of the decade (competing with Australian Glenn McGrath's catch in the 2002–03 Ashes against England). Gilchrist put in a typical performance, making a quick 68 runs off only 54 balls, before being dispatched by an impressive Chris Cairns delivery which bowled him (a feat Cairns was later to repeat twice more, taking both Michael Clarke's and Brett Lee's wicket in the same manner). Cairns' insertion into the bowling attack sparked a collapse in the Australian middle order, which in the space of 18 balls lost 4 wickets for just 10 runs. The bowling of Cairns and Daniel Vettori wreaked havoc with the Australian batsmen, with personal figures of 3/39 and 3/31 respectively. [...] Darren Lehmann second top-scored with 50 runs and he, together with the struggling efforts of the lower order batsmen, brought Australia to a respectable 9/246 after 50 overs.|$|R

The vegetation in which this species is usually (but not always) common {{is also known as}} ‘buttongrass’ or ‘buttongrass moorland’. Jarman et al. (1988) provide a definition of buttongrass moorland vegetation that is adopted for the purposes of these proceedings: • “any treeless vegetation containing Gymnoschoenus, except communities where only a few isolated obviously adventive Gymnoschoenus plants are present; • Vegetation in which Gymnoschoenus is common but which contains widely spaced emergent trees; • Small recurring islands (mostly areas less than about 50 by 50 m) of non-alpine, treeless vegetation which do not contain Gymnoschoenus but are surrounded by communities of the type described above; small strips of similar vegetation (about 20 – 30 m wide) which occur along creeks or in gullies, are also included as buttongrass vegetation providing that the above communities border them on either side. ” (Jarman et al. 1988).

50|$|However a dramatic, and {{seemingly}} unlikely, turnaround in fortunes began on 16 April, when the third Old Firm clash {{took place in}} Celtic Park. This was a highly charged affair from the kick-off, with a re-invigorated Celtic dominating the <b>opening</b> <b>proceedings</b> and making their dominance count when Shunsuke Nakamura scored a spectacular goal from around 35 yards, which later ended up as Celtic's 'Goal of the Season', on the 20 minute mark. Rangers hit {{back in the second}} half when Nacho Novo equalised but Celtic got a chance to retake the lead when Nakamura's curling shot was illegally handled off the line by Carlos Cuéllar, who was sent off. However, McDonald's penalty was struck poorly and Allan McGregor, despite having an injured ankle, was able to save it. Celtic pushed in vain for a winner against 10 men but it seemed like Rangers would get the draw they played for, and which would all but seem to secure them the title. However, in the 3rd minute of injury time, a quick throw in led to ball being played outside the box to Samaras who knocked it down to Gary Caldwell. Caldwell hit a diagonal ball into the box where McDonald squared the ball for Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink to nod the ball home inside the six-yard box past Neil Alexander, who replaced the injured McGregor. However spectacular Nakamura's first half goal was, Vennegoor of Hesselinks proved to be a hugely pivotal moment in the title race. There were jubilant scenes around all the Celtic fans. McDonald was visibly emotional after the final whistle. 2-1 was the final score and even with the small confrontations after the final whistle between the players, Celtic showed that they were not giving up their title without a fight.|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{examines}} the new group coordination proceedings {{established in the}} renewed EU Insolvency Regulation (the Recast Regulation). The theme of this thesis as such is not new, as coordination of insolvency proceedings has been studied both in national and international levels. However, {{for the first time}} it is possible to study an actual solution for coordination of insolvency proceedings of multinational groups of companies, as the European Union tries to solve the problems of group insolvency by establishing rules for coordination of insolvency proceedings. This thesis aims to answer the following ostensibly simple question: what are group coordination proceedings? Because the rules concerning group coordination proceedings are so new, this kind of basic research conducted in this thesis is in order, especially as there is no knowledge on how the group coordination proceedings work in real-life and there is no case law that would demonstrate how the rules concerning the group coordination proceedings should be interpreted. As for the relevant theoretical framework, this thesis provides analysis on the definition of a group of companies {{in the context of the}} Recast Regulation. Furthermore, the separate legal nature of group members shall be discussed and the opposing theories, the theory of legal separateness and the theory of unification shall be examined. In addition, the cross-border aspect of the thesis shall be investigated as well as different ways to coordinate insolvency proceedings opened in respect of different group members. In the thesis, these different ways are divided into three different categories: coordinated cooperation, joint administration and substantive consolidation. The chapters before the conclusions are dedicated to the specific rules concerning group coordination <b>proceedings.</b> Thus, <b>opening</b> of the group coordination proceedings as well as the tasks of the coordinator shall be discussed. Not all the problematics shall be introduced as the length of the thesis is quite limited. The aim has been to highlight the most important problematics. It is concluded that the theory of legal separateness presents itself extremely well in the group coordination proceedings, thus it is clear that the theory is followed almost to the letter. As for the group coordination proceedings as a whole, it is suitable only to large insolvency cases where to costs of the coordination can be taken care of. In addition, the choice of an outside coordinator is probably not the best solution, as it takes time for the coordinator to get to know all the relevant proceedings. On the other hand, interests of conflicts are avoided better by choosing an outsider to act as the coordinator. However, the group coordination proceedings do not necessarily lead to efficient and effective coordination of insolvency proceedings opened in respect of group members. In conclusion, the concept of the group coordination proceedings is a beautiful idea, but the situations where such coordination is used are more of an exception than a rule...|$|R
5000|$|As the 2007-08 season progressed, Celtic found {{themselves}} {{embroiled in a}} tight contest with Rangers for the SPL title. Celtic led for {{the early part of}} the season, but a series of poor results in the winter and early spring saw Rangers overtake them. A Kevin Thomson goal on 31 March 2008 gave Rangers a 1-0 win at Ibrox over Celtic, leaving Celtic trailing their rivals in the league by six points. [...] A few days later, Neil Lennon returned to Celtic as a coach, effectively replacing first-team coach Tommy Burns, who was being treated for cancer. A dramatic, and seemingly unlikely, turnaround in Celtic's fortunes then began on 16 April, when the Old Firm met again at Celtic Park. A re-invigorated Celtic dominated the <b>opening</b> <b>proceedings</b> and took the lead when Shunsuke Nakamura scored with a spectacular swerving shot from 30 yards. Nacho Novo equalised for Rangers early in the second half, but Celtic got a chance to retake the lead when Nakamura's curling shot was handled off the line by Rangers defender Carlos Cuéllar, who was sent off. Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, however, despite having an injured ankle, saved Scott McDonald's penalty kick. Rangers looked like holding on for a vital point until in the third minute of injury time Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink bundled the ball into the goal to clinch a 2-1 win for Celtic. [...] Celtic began to claw back on Rangers lead in the league, and by the time of the final league fixture of the season were league leaders. A Vennegoor of Hesselink headed goal gave Celtic a 1-0 win on the night away at Dundee United, clinching the title for Celtic. This ensured Strachan's place in the history books of Celtic, becoming only the third manager to win three successive league titles, behind Willie Maley and Jock Stein. The victory was also dedicated to the memory of Tommy Burns, former player, manager and coach, who had died earlier that week.|$|R
