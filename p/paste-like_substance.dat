50|$|Once cleaned of {{impurities}} and extracted, shilajit is {{a homogeneous}} brown-black <b>paste-like</b> <b>substance,</b> with a glossy surface, a peculiar smell and bitter taste. Dry shilajit density ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 g/cm3. It has a plastic-like behavior, at a temperature lower than 20°C (68°F) it will solidify and will soften when warmed. It easily dissolves in water without leaving any residue, {{and it will}} soften when worked between the fingers.|$|E
5000|$|Jaime {{dealt with}} a number of bizarre cases, such as a villain who {{operates}} a hair salon using a [...] "truth serum" [...] shampoo to extract information from OSI agents. In another episode, a convict named Lisa Galloway (also portrayed by Lindsay Wagner) is given plastic surgery and tries to replace Jaime. In a later episode, Lisa ingests a <b>paste-like</b> <b>substance</b> called Adrenalizine that gives her temporary super-strength, allowing her to fully replace Jaime at OSI while the real Jaime is imprisoned and led to question her own identity. Lisa, however, did not know of Jaime's bionic implants and believed her powers to have come from the Adrenalizine. After Jaime's eventual escape, Dr. Wells discovers that the Adrenalizine was breaking down and becoming toxic to Lisa's health. Further complicating the issue was Lisa's increasing belief that she was in fact, the real Jaime.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed to}} inject thermal filler material (a <b>paste-like</b> <b>substance)</b> inside the power wire bundle coming from solar arrays. This substance fills in voids between wires, which enhances the heat path and reduces wire temperature. This leads to a reduced amount of heat generated. This technique is especially helpful for current and future generation high-power spacecraft (1 kW or more), because the heat generated by the power wires is significant enough to cause unacceptable overheating to critical components that are {{in close contact with}} the bundle...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatigue and}} creep {{performance}} of two novel acrylic bone cement formulations (one bone cement without antibiotics, one with antibiotics) {{was compared to}} the performance of clinically used bone cements (Osteopal V, Palacos R, Simplex P, SmartSet GHV, Palacos R+G and CMW 1 with Gentamicin). The preparation of the novel bone cement formulations involves the mixing of two <b>paste-like</b> <b>substances</b> in a static mixer integrated into the cartridge which is used to apply the bone cement. The fatigue performance of the two novel bone cement formulations is comparable {{to the performance of}} the reference bone cements. The creep compliance of the bone cements is significantly influenced by the effects of physical ageing. The model parameters of Struik's creep law are used to compare the creep behavior of different bone cements. The novel 2 -component paste-like bone cement formulations are in the group of bone cements which exhibit a higher creep resistance...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the changes of surface color, texture, and gelatinization degree of starch of the rice which was heated in oil bath of 150 ± 1 ℃ for 40 min, and then the rice was divided into upper, middle and lower parts. The results were as follows: the water content of the cooked rice continued to change rapidly for 10 - 20 min. Although the water content of the lower part decreased, {{the contents of the}} middle and upper parts increased, because the water moved upward. The hardness of cooked rice increased in the upper, middle and lower part in order. The adhesiveness of the lower part indicated the lowest value. That of Koshihikari showed the higher value than Reimei. The hardness and adhesiveness of the cooked rice had relation with its water content. Sensory tests suggested that the rice was the most desirable which had been cooked for 20 - 30 min, and that Koshihikari was preferred to Reimei. Experiments with models which mixed <b>paste-like</b> <b>substances</b> (soluble atarch solution, dextrin solution and Oneba respectively) with glass beads were made. The size of the glass bead was {{the same as that of}} the rice grain. The higher the concentration of paste-like substancesbwas, the more the hardness and adhesiveness of t he cooked rice increased. Adhesiveness was recognized only in both the soluble starch and Oneba of Koshihikari. The Oneba consisted of more than 90 % of carbohydrate and 4 % of protein as anhydrous materials. The adhesiveness of Oneba played an important role in the texture of cooked rice as a mass...|$|R
40|$|PhDCeramic {{materials}} have considerable attraction {{for use in}} applications where the service temperatures are high and where fire performance and non-combustibility are important. Unfortunately most monolithic ceramic materials are extremely brittle which limits their use for structural applications. The development of fibre and particulate reinforced ceramic composites provides a route to achieving increased toughness in the materials, although this is often {{at the expense of}} ultimate strengths and/or the process-ability of the materials. Many reinforcing fibres used with ceramics are inherently expensive and manufacturing routes to produce fibre reinforced materials can involve high processing temperatures and are consequently expensive. A key goal of this research therefore is to develop a new type of ceramic matrix composites that combine toughness, strength and process-ability to provide a cost effective structural material. The research described in this thesis has been concerned with the development and characterisation of a series of ceramic compounds that can be moulded at modest temperatures(130 - 160 " C) and pressures in a manufacturing system that replicates dough moulding compounds (DMC) as used for polymeric matrix composites. The conventional polyester matrix of polymeric DMC {{has been replaced by a}} soluble inorganic system which is compounded with fibres, fillers and hardening agents to produce a <b>paste-like</b> or doughy <b>substance</b> The handle-ability of the material is determined by the viscosity of the matrix and the type or amount of fillers and additives present. The research has involved a careful set of experiments in which the formulation of the ceramic DMC has been systematically varied in order to achieve an optimum viscosity for storage and handling together with a further series of experiments studying the hardening and cure of the compounds. The mechanical properties of the compounds have been measured and additional formulation changes have been introduced to maintain desirable processing characteristics while improving mechanical properties, and in particular the impact resistance using instrumented falling weight impact machines. Finally the fire properties of the compounds have been studied using cone calorimetry and indicative furnace testing. The structure of the compound has been studied throughout the programme with various microscopic techniques and thermal analysis systems used to characterise the materials, their dispersion and changes that occurred during processing and after high temperature exposure. The final result of the programme has been the identification of a range of material formulations that can provide a tough moulding compound, capable of high temperature service use, that possesses useful structural properties and which can be processed cheaply at modest temperatures using low cost materials...|$|R
30|$|Ce 0.85 Tb 0.15 F 3 NPs (0.07  M water solution) were {{synthesized}} {{as described}} in [19]. Briefly, a mixture of 1.58  g of cerium(III) chloride heptahydrate (4.25  mmol, i.e., 85 %) and 0.293  g of terbium(III) chloride heptahydrate (0.75  mmol, i.e., 15 %) was dissolved in 15  mL of water and added to 150  mL of isopropyl alcohol. Hydrofluoric acid (20  mmol), dissolved in 50  mL of isopropyl alcohol, was added drop-wise to a cerium and terbium salt solution under vigorous stirring. The resulting white sediment was filtered and washed carefully by pure isopropyl alcohol several times. Then, the suspension was slightly dried to form a <b>paste-like</b> <b>substance</b> and dispersed in 110  ml of distilled water using an ultrasonic bath. The resulting transparent colloid solution was boiled for 5  min to remove residual alcohol.|$|E
40|$|Inulin is a {{polysaccharide}} frequency {{used as a}} {{sugar or}} fat replacer in the food industry, which offers {{the advantage of a}} functional effect similar to those of dietary fibers. By cooling or freezing ail inulin concentrated solution, a more concentrated solution precipitates as a <b>paste-like</b> <b>substance,</b> while the liquid phase forms a diluted solution. In this work, the effect of storage temperature Of inulin concentrated solution as well as temperature on the rheological behavior of liquid and precipitated phases obtained from a process of phase separation were evaluated. The precipitated phase Of inulin was evaluated Under two conditions: pure and formulated with encapsulating agents. It was observed that a reduction in storage temperature resulted in a higher inulin precipitation, which produced higher apparent viscosity values for the precipitated phase. All the samples analyzed had a shear-thinning rheological behavior...|$|E
