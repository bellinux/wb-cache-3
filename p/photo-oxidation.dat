50|$|<b>Photo-oxidation</b> is the {{degradation}} of a polymer surface {{in the presence of}} oxygen or ozone. The effect is facilitated by radiant energy such as UV or artificial light. This process is the most significant factor in weathering of polymers. <b>Photo-oxidation</b> is a chemical change that reduces the polymer's molecular weight. As a consequence of this change the material becomes more brittle, with a reduction in its tensile, impact and elongation strength. Discoloration and loss of surface smoothness accompany <b>photo-oxidation.</b> High temperature and localized stress concentrations are factors that significantly increase the effect of <b>photo-oxidation.</b>|$|E

UV-absorbers stabilizes against weathering by absorbing ultraviolet light and converting it into heat.

50|$|<b>Photo-oxidation</b> i.e. {{photochemical}} oxidation. Excited colourant molecule undergoes oxidation process. In {{the process}} the chromophoric {{system of the}} colourant molecule reacts with the atmospheric oxygen dorming nonchromophoric system which results in fading.

50|$|Anatoxin-a is {{unstable}} {{in water}} and other natural conditions, and {{in the presence of}} UV light undergoes photodegradation, being converted to the non-toxic products dihydroanatoxin-a and epoxyanatoxin-a. The photodegradation of anatoxin-a is dependent on pH and sunlight intensity but independent of oxygen, indicating that the degradation by light is not achieved through the process of <b>photo-oxidation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Photosensitization i.e. {{photochemical}} sensitization. Exposing cellulosic dyed {{material to}} sunlight allows dyes to abstract hydrogen from the cellulose which results photo reduction on the cellulosic substrate. Simultaneously colourant will undergo oxidation in {{presence of the}} atmospheric oxygen resulting <b>photo-oxidation</b> of the colourant. These processes result both in fading of the colourant and strength loss of the substrate.|$|E
50|$|Concerns {{associated}} with microfading techniques include: diffusion-limited <b>photo-oxidation</b> reaction rates, dehydration and heating of the sample, {{the variability of}} using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards, variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display and the lamp used in accelerated light aging, the small sampling area, the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested.|$|E
50|$|According to the {{photoprotection}} theory, anthocyanins {{protects the}} leaf against {{the harmful effects}} of light at low temperatures. Indeed, the leaves are about to fall, so protection is not of extreme importance for the tree. <b>Photo-oxidation</b> and photoinhibition, however, especially at low temperatures, make the process of reabsorbing nutrients less efficient. By shielding the leaf with anthocyanins, according to the photoprotection theory, the tree manages to reabsorb nutrients (especially nitrogen) more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Dyes and {{pigments}} {{are used}} in polymer materials to provide color changing properties. These additives can reduce the rate of polymer degradation. Cu-phthalocyanine dye can help stabilize against degradation, but in other situations such as photochemical aging can actually accelerate degradation. The excited Cu-phthalocyanine may abstract hydrogen atoms from methyl groups in the PC, which increase the formation of free radicals. This acts as the starting points for the sequential <b>photo-oxidation</b> reactions leading to the degradation of the PC.|$|E
50|$|Cytochrome b559, {{which forms}} {{part of the}} {{reaction}} centre core of PSII is a heterodimer composed of one alpha subunit (PsbE), one beta (PsbF) subunit, and a heme cofactor. Two histidine residues from each subunit coordinate the haem. Although cytochrome b559 is a redox-active protein, {{it is unlikely to}} be involved in the primary electron transport in PSII due to its very slow <b>photo-oxidation</b> and photo-reduction kinetics. Instead, cytochrome b559 could participate in a secondary electron transport pathway that helps protect PSII from photo-damage. Cytochrome b559 is essential for PSII assembly.|$|E
50|$|Stabilizers for {{polymers}} {{are used}} directly or by combinations {{to prevent the}} various effects such as oxidation, chain scission and uncontrolled recombinations and cross-linking reactions that are caused by <b>photo-oxidation</b> of polymers. Polymers are considered to get weathered due to the direct or indirect impact of heat and ultraviolet light. The effectiveness of the stabilizers against weathering depends on solubility, ability to stabilize in different polymer matrix, the distribution in matrix, evaporation loss during processing and use. The effect on the viscosity {{is also an important}} concern for processing.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of artemisinin {{is believed}} to involve the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FDP). It {{is not clear whether}} the non-mevalonate pathway can also contribute 5-carbon precursors (IPP or/and DMAPP), as occurs in other sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. The routes from artemisinic alcohol to artemisinin remain controversial, and they differ mainly in when the reduction step takes place. Both routes suggested dihydroartemisinic acid as the final precursor to artemisinin. Dihydroartemisinic acid then undergoes <b>photo-oxidation</b> to produce dihydroartemisinic acid hydroperoxide. Ring expansion by the cleavage of hydroperoxide and a second oxygen-mediated hydroperoxidation finish the biosynthesis of artemisinin.|$|E
50|$|The main {{challenge}} in using organic ligands for quantum dot surface trap passivation is {{the difficulty in}} simultaneously passivating both anionic and cationic surface traps. Steric hindrance between bulky organic ligands results in incomplete surface coverage and unpassivated dangling orbitals. Growing epitaxial inorganic semiconductor shells over quantum dots inhibits <b>photo-oxidation</b> and enables passivation of both anionic and cationic surface trap states. As photogenerated charge carriers {{are less likely to}} be trapped, the probability for excitons to decay through the radiative pathway increases. CdSe/CdS and ZnSe/CdSe nanocrystals have been synthesized that exhibit 85% and 80-90% quantum yield, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Asphalt is an {{aliphatic}} compound and {{in almost all}} cases a byproduct of the oil industry. Some asphalt is manufactured from oil as the intended purpose, and this is limited to high-quality asphalt produced for longer lasting asphalt built-up roofs (BUR). Asphalt ages through <b>photo-oxidation</b> accelerated by heat. As it ages, the asphalts melt point rises {{and there is a}} loss of plasticizers. As mass is lost, the asphalt shrinks and forms a surface similar to alligator skin. Asphalt breaks down slowly in water, and the more exposure the more rapid the degradation. Asphalt also dissolves readily when exposed to oils and some solvents.|$|E
50|$|The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), {{also known}} as the water-splitting complex, is a water-oxidizing enzyme {{involved}} in the <b>photo-oxidation</b> of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is surrounded by 4 core proteins of photosystem II at the membrane-lumen interface. Based on a widely accepted theory from 1970 by Kok, the complex can exist in 5 states: S0 to S4. Photons trapped by photosystem II move the system from state S0 to S4. S4 is unstable and reacts with water producing free oxygen. Currently, the mechanism of the complex is not completely understood. Much of what is known have been collected from flash experiments, EPR, and X-ray spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|The large {{chromophore}} {{system in}} the molecule means that it can cause photosensitivity when ingested beyond threshold amounts. Photosensitivity is often seen in animals that {{have been allowed to}} graze on St. John's Wort. Because hypericin accumulates preferentially in cancerous tissues, it is also used as an indicator of cancerous cells. In addition, hypericin is under research as an agent in photodynamic therapy, whereby a biochemical is absorbed by an organism to be later activated with spectrum-specific light from specialized lamps or laser sources, for therapeutic purposes. The antibacterial and antiviral effects of hypericin are also believed to arise from its ability for <b>photo-oxidation</b> of cells and viral particles.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{exciting}} and most studied uses of photo catalysis is the <b>photo-oxidation</b> of organics as it applies to environmental decontamination. In contrast to gas phase interactions with the solid surface, the vast number of variables associated with the liquid solid interface (i.e. solution pH, photocatalyst concentration, solvent effects, diffusion rate, etc.) calls for greater care to be taken to control these variables to produce consistent experimental results. A greater variety of reactions also become possible due to the ability of solutions to stabilize charged species, making it possible to add an electron from the metal to a neutral species producing an anion that can go on to further react, or a hole to remove an electron, producing a cation that goes on to further react in solution.|$|E
5000|$|Oxo-biodegradable {{plastic bags}} {{have the same}} {{strength}} as ordinary plastic and cost very little extra. They will degrade then biodegrade if {{they get into the}} open environment, but they can be recycled if collected during their useful life. They are designed so that they will not degrade deep in landfill and will not therefore generate methane. Oxo-biodegradable plastic does not degrade quickly in low temperature [...] "windrow" [...] composting, but it is suitable for [...] "in-vessel" [...] composting at the higher temperatures required by the animal by-products regulations. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is bio-assimilated by the same bacteria and fungi, which transform natural material such as twigs and leaves to cell biomass, like lignocellulosic materials. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is designed to degrade initially by a process which includes both <b>photo-oxidation</b> and thermo-oxidation, so it can degrade in the dark. Resin identification code 7 is applicable to biodegradable plastics.|$|E
50|$|The {{properties}} of phalloidin {{make it a}} useful tool for investigating the distribution of F-actin in cells by labeling phalloidin with fluorescent analogs and using them to stain actin filaments for light microscopy. Fluorescent derivatives of phalloidin {{have turned out to be}} enormously useful in localizing actin filaments in living or fixed cells as well as for visualizing individual actin filaments in vitro. A high-resolution technique was developed to detect F-actin at the light and electron microscopic levels by using phalloidin conjugated to the fluorophore eosin which acts as the fluorescent tag. In this method known as fluorescence <b>photo-oxidation,</b> fluorescent molecules can be utilized to drive the oxidation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) to create a reaction product that can be rendered electron dense and detectable by electron microscopy. The amount of fluorescence visualized can be used as a quantitative measure of the amount of filamentous actin there is in cells if saturating quantities of fluorescent phalloidin are used. Consequently, immunofluorescence microscopy along with microinjection of phalloidin can be used to evaluate the direct and indirect functions of cytoplasmic actin in its different stages of polymer formation. Therefore, fluorescent phalloidin can be used as an important tool in the study of actin networks at high resolution.|$|E
50|$|A {{recently}} developed OPV {{system based on}} tetrabenzoporphryin (BP) and either 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is explained in detail as follows. In this study, the precursor to BP (1,4:8,11:15,18:22,25-tetraethano-29H,31H-tetrabenzob,g,l,qporphyrin (CP) solution is applied as the starting film, and was thermally annealed which caused the CP to convert into BP. The BP:fullerene layer serves as the undoped layer within the device. For surface measurements, the undoped layer is rinsed with {{a few drops of}} chloroform and spin-dried until the BP network is exposed at the donor/acceptor interface. For bulk heterojunction characterization, an additional fullerene solution is spin-coated onto the undoped layer, a thin layer of lithium fluoride is then deposited followed by either an aluminum or gold cathode which is thermally annealed to the device. The thin layer of lithium fluoride is deposited to help prevent the oxidation of the device. Controlling the thickness of these layers plays {{a significant role in the}} generation of the efficiency of the PV cells. Typically, the thickness of the active layers is usually smaller than 100 nm to produce photocurrents. This dependence on layer thickness is due to the probability that an electron is able to travel distances on the order of exciton diffusion length within the applied electric field. It should be noted that many of the organic semiconductors used in the PV devices are sensitive to water and oxygen. This is due to the likelihood of <b>photo-oxidation</b> which can occur when exposed to these conditions. While the top metal contact can prevent some of this, many studies are either performed in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, or under ultra-high vacuum (UHV).|$|E
40|$|<b>Photo-oxidation</b> is a light-dependent reaction, catalysed by {{photo-sensitive}} dyes, {{which can}} result in the oxidation of a large variety of substances. The <b>photo-oxidation</b> of enzymes with the anionic dye rose bengal was shown to follow one of two types of pH dependence; {{with an increase in}} pH the rates of photo-inactivation either increased (conventional <b>photo-oxidation</b> pH profiles), or decreased (unconventional <b>photo-oxidation</b> pH profiles). <b>Photo-oxidation</b> of the same enzymes with the cationic dye methylene blue gave rise to conventional pH profiles, irrespective of the type of pH dependence obtained with rose bengal. The production of unconventional <b>photo-oxidation</b> pH profiles was found to be dependent on the anionic nature of the photo-sensitiser. Using visible absorption spectroscopy and enzyme kinetic studies, rose bengal, but not methylene blue, was found to be capable of binding to and inhibiting the activity of enzymes. However, amino acid analysis of pig heart citrate synthase demonstrated that the occurrence of unconventional <b>photo-oxidation</b> pH profiles and dye-enzyme interactions was not accompanied by increased specificity of residue destruction. Some restriction of dye-protein interactions was achieved by the immobilisation of rose bengal on Sepharose. The <b>photo-oxidation</b> of various enzymes with this immobilised form of the dye was found to result in the formation of unconventional pH profiles only, irrespective of the type of <b>photo-oxidation</b> pH profile originally observed with the free form of the dye. The total prevention of all contact between rose bengal and enzymes was attained by compartmentalising the immobilised dye within a dialysis sac, the protein remaining on the outside. <b>Photo-oxidation</b> of enzymes with this compartmentalised dye again resulted only in the formation of unconventional pH profiles. Both the free and immobilised states of rose bengal were shown to photo-oxidise the five known susceptible amino acids [...] -cysteine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine. The cysteine-containing peptide glutathione, and a glutathione-Sepharose complex, were also shown to be sensitive to <b>photo-oxidation</b> by free rose bengal, and the formation of conventional pH profiles only was observed. Although glutathione was shown to be similarly sensitive to <b>photo-oxidation</b> by the immobilised dye, no loss of cysteine occurred when the glutathione-Sepharose complex was irradiated in the presence of either immobilised or compartmentalised dye. Furthermore, the cysteine residues of mercaptalbumin proved insensitive to <b>photo-oxidation</b> by these two states of the dye. This demonstrated the necessity of direct interactions between rose bengal and cysteine residues as a prerequisite for their <b>photo-oxidation.</b> In the case of <b>photo-oxidation</b> of enzymes with free or immobilised rose bengal, the involvement of singlet oxygen was indicated by the enhanced rates of photo-inactivation obtained when H 2 O was replaced by D 2 O as solvent and also by the protective effects of sodium azide. It is therefore suggested that the pH profile obtained on <b>photo-oxidation</b> of enzymes by rose bengal consists of two components; a component at high pH which involves the <b>photo-oxidation</b> of cysteine residues by a direct contact mechanism and a component at low pH which involves the <b>photo-oxidation</b> of other susceptible residues by a singlet oxygen mechanism. This suggestion is supported by the demonstration of a correlation between the type of pH profile obtained on the <b>photo-oxidation</b> of various enzymes with free rose bengal and the presence of cysteine residues in their active sites, as indicated by inactivation experiments with the thiol-specific reagents DTNB and pHMB. The combined use of all the three forms of rose bengal may therefore both increase the specificity for residue destruction and provide information on the mechanisms involved in the <b>photo-oxidation</b> of biological macromolecules {{to a greater extent than}} is possible with the free dye alone. Immobilised rose bengal was found capable of photo-oxidising the active site of Acinetobacter citrate synthase yet, in contrast to free rose bengal, was incapable of desensitising the enzyme to NADH inhibition. The advantages and potential offered by the use of immobilised and compartmentalised rose bengal are discussed in this thesis and attention is drawn to the difficulties encountered and the caution required in the interpretation of <b>photo-oxidation</b> pH profiles...|$|E

In the present study mitotic preparations from Sarcophaga ruficornis and Sarcophaga argyrostoma were used to detect the visible light and fluorochrome interactions. Our results indicated that specific destruction of guanine residues is the main effect of <b>photo-oxidation</b> and LIB is a base-specific phenomenon. In addition, <b>photo-oxidation</b> may also cause DNA-protein cross-linking which affects the binding of some dyes, while prolonged <b>photo-oxidation</b> appears to cause more general damage to DNA...|$|E
