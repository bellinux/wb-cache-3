40|$|Numerous {{analytical}} {{studies for}} <b>power</b> <b>augmentation</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be found}} in the literature with the goal to improve the performance of wind turbines by increasing the energy density of the air at the rotor. All methods to date are only concerned with the effects of a diffuser as the power augmentation, and this work extends the semi-empirical shrouded wind turbine model introduced first by Foreman to incorporate a converging-diverging nozzle into the system. The analysis is based on assumptions and approximations of the conservation laws to calculate optimal power coefficients and power extraction, as well as augmentation ratios. It is revealed that the power enhancement is proportional to the mass stream rise produced by the nozzle diffuser-augmented wind turbine (NDAWT). Such mass flow rise can only be accomplished through two essential principles: the increase in the area ratios and/or by reducing the negative back pressure at the exit. The thrust coefficient for optimal power production of a conventional bare wind turbine is known to be 8 / 9, whereas the theoretical analysis of the NDAWT predicts an ideal thrust coefficient either lower or higher than 8 / 9 depending on the back pressure coefficient at which the shrouded turbine operates. Computed performance expectations demonstrate a good agreement with numerical and experimental results, and it is demonstrated that much larger power coefficients than for traditional wind turbines are achievable. Lastly, the developed model is very well suited for the preliminary design of a shrouded wind turbine where typically many trade-off studies need to be conducted inexpensively...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} using a wind {{acceleration}} device (wind lens) with vertical-axis wind turbines in wind tunnel experiments were examined. A wind lens consists of a diffuser and flanges, and this study investigated the optimum parameters of their configuration {{with regard to the}} <b>power</b> <b>augmentation</b> of the turbines. The wind lens with a flat-panel-type diffuser demonstrated <b>power</b> <b>augmentation</b> by a factor of 2. 0 compared with an open wind turbine. An increase from 5 ° to 20 ° in the semi-open angle of the diffuser made it possible to generate a 30 % high power output over a wide range of tip speed ratios. On that basis, an optimum semi-open angle was determined. For the flat-panel-type diffuser, a recommended diffuser length is the half of the throat width, and its semi-open angle is 20 °. The inlet enhanced <b>power</b> <b>augmentation</b> over a wide range of tip speed ratios. The optimum location for the wind lens in the streamwise direction was aligned with the center of the vertical-axis wind turbines.

30|$|Many {{enhanced}} {{positioning accuracy}} technologies have been proposed. The differential GPS and wide-area <b>augmentation</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been used}} to enhance the accuracy of GPS in recent years. The differential GPS technology uses a network of fixed, ground-based reference stations broadcasting the difference value between the positions indicated by the satellite systems and the known fixed positions [16]. The wide-area <b>augmentation</b> <b>systems</b> technology uses a network of ground-based reference stations to measure small variations in the GPS signals. These satellites broadcast correction information back to the Earth, where wide-area <b>augmentation</b> <b>system</b> receivers use the correction value while computing their positions to improve accuracy [17]. However, these differential GPS and wide-area <b>augmentation</b> <b>system</b> technologies are occasionally incorrect because of obstructions and multipath effects caused by buildings and vegetation. This paper's proposed system uses the relative position instead of the GPS position in order to enhance the positioning accuracy. The proposed system will not affect GPS operation but enhance the above research works.|$|R
