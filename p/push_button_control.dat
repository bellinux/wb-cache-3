40|$|Microsoft Kinect is an add-on {{component}} for the Xbox 360 console {{that enables the}} use of body gestures and voice commands to control the Xbox device. While majority of Kinect interfaces use full body motions, hand extension type user interfaces also exist. This thesis attempts to offer alternative means of performing activations in a cursor based hand extension user interface. For that purpose we developed a testing interface containing the two standard controls commonly employed on Kinect's cursor based user interfaces, as well as nine proposed variants of the interface controls, with two of the proposed variant controls being removed during pilot testing as redundant. The controls were tested on a 20 -participant usability study where they were evaluated based on the factors of speed, rate of false activations and user impression. Based on the test results, most of the proposed new controls enabled faster performance but at the cost of a considerable increase in the rate of false activations. While some controls showed promise with further development only the two-handed <b>push</b> <b>button</b> <b>control</b> could rival the low false activation rates of the standard Kinect controls, while simultaneously allowing for much faster activations and being selected by the majority of the test participants as their favourite interaction type...|$|E

The type of smart card is PHILIPS contactless card, Mifare Classic. In this system used photodioda censor to detect movement of objects in the way, and used LDR (Ligh Dependent Resistor) to detect the condition of night or day. The important thing to note is the application of smart cards in the main door, door, lights, and window curtains control are integrated one another, and the design of motor driver. From the experiment result, we can get a conclusion that overall smart home can work according with the algorithm, in manual mode and automatic mode. Smart card can respond properly if the serial number on the card matches with the serial number in microcntroller program, and system in automatic mode. Smart card can be read with maximum distance of 6 cm. The censors was used can also detect very well. Keywords : RFID, Mifare®, smart card, contactless card, automatic, smart hom...|$|E

40|$|Procedures for {{charging}} porous space-charge electrets {{by means}} of a corona discharge or in direct contact were developed. The high surface potentials obtained are stable over time and temperature, e. g. up to around 250 C for porous PTFE. By means of charging in direct contact, a structuring of the electrical properties within the transducer area is possible. Electroluminescence was observed during charging of various porous polymer films. This finding proves micro-discharge phenomena inside the voids of the porous polymer films. Procedures for coating the outer surfaces of porous PTFE films with non-porous polymer layers (such as Teflon "r"e"g"i"s"t"e"r"e"d AF) were developed. As a result, the polymer surfaces could be contacted electrically. High piezoelectric activity was observed in porous PTFE films (with coated outer surfaces), in porous PP films, in specially prepared porous Teflon "r"e"g"i"s"t"e"r"e"d AF films as well as in various layer systems. By means of optimal charging procedures (e. g. in ambient gas atmospheres), the piezoelectric activity can be increased to yield very high transducer coefficients. In cooperation with the SMEs, the transducer materials were successfully integrated in microphones, headphones, in <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> of <b>control</b> panels, in transducers for ultrasonic applications and in devices for blood-pressure determination.
