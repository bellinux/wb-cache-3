25|$|Among {{historical}} scientific {{achievements of}} Heidelberg researchers features prominently {{the invention of}} spectroscopy, and of the Bunsen burner; the discovery of chemical elements Caesium and Rubidium; {{the identification of the}} absolute point of ebullition; and the identification and isolation of nicotine as the main pharmacologically active component of tobacco. Modern scientific psychiatry; psychopharmacology; psychiatric genetics; environmental physics; and modern sociology were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Almost 800 dwarf planets, the North America Nebula, and the return of Halley's Comet have been discovered and documented at institutes of the Heidelberg Center for Astronomy. Moreover, Heidelberg researchers invented the process of <b>plastination</b> to preserve body tissue, conducted the first successful transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, and recently developed a new strategy for a vaccination against certain forms of cancer, which earned Professor Harald zur Hausen of the university the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{enlighten}} the dark labyrinth {{of the nasal}} cavity, a comparative examination of brachycephalic (short-headed or round shaped respectively) and mesocephalic (normal shaped or mesatocephalic respectively) cats was carried out. The study was based on 26 Persian and 18 domestic cats in total, with the chance of examining 13 animals (9 Persians and 4 domestic cats) under anaesthesia. Thus, computed tomography (CT) with concomitant intravenous contrast media application of six animals (4 Persians and 2 domestic cats) was possible. Because the animals displayed different stages of brachycephaly, {{and in order to}} adequately describe the functional-anatomical alterations, the 26 examined Persian cats were divided into four different categories by subjective criteria. The examination was carried out with regard to clinical and morphological aspects, therefore the following methods were chosen: computed tomography compared to corresponding sheet <b>plastinations,</b> respectively polyethylenglycol sections; as well as three-dimensional (3 D) reconstructions based on the CT data sets of the paranasal sinuses and the nasolacrimal drainage system (i. e., virtual casts) compared to conventional corrosion casts of the same animals. Additional methods employed in this study were anatomical drawings, maceration and anatomic preparation as well as exemplary anaglyph technology for demonstration of 3 D objects within a 2 D media. This study presents the first complete cross-sectional anatomic descriptions of the nasal and paranasal cavities in brachycephalic cats, and  at least regarding some areas  even in mesocephalic domestic cats. Because the nasolacrimal drainage system of the cat was hitherto not described using computed tomography, this gap regarding functional anatomy and clinical diagnosis was thus closed. CT-examination of the nasal and paranasal cavity region was standardised and, for the first time, a new scanning plane of 90 ° towards the nasal bone was suggested  adapted to the anatomic relations of the ethmoidal bone in cats. Creating 3 D models from the resulting CT data sets was established as an immense improvement for understanding the difficult spatial relations of the head. The main problems when looking at the feline nose regarding the complex alterations in brachycephaly arise from the highly shortened facial bones and the resulting dislocation of nasal structures caused by the dorso-rotation of the teeth. Concomitant with increased stages of brachycephaly, the nares and the nasal entry get narrower; the rostral ending of the respiratory duct, the nasal conchae and the whole ethmoidal bone are pushed into an increased upright position; and the nasolacrimal drainage system is characterized by an increased angle and a steeper course. Nasal conchae material is pushed into the respiratory duct in some animals of the stage III category and thus hinders respiratory air flow. Additional paranasal cavities (Sinus conchales of the ectoturbinals 2 and 3) are developed, while the upper ethmoidal conchae are pushed up towards the frontal sinuses by the compression processes within the lower aspects of the nasal cavity. The literature survey presents the nose as a functional system, and based on this the present study focuses on all important diagnostic cross-sectional anatomic problems in brachycephalic and mesocephalic cats. Besides the nasal conchae, the nasal ducts and the paranasal sinuses, even the mucous membranes, the vasculature, regional lymph nodes and the nasolacrimal drainage system are considered. Hence, this study presents a profound basis for all clinical problems of the nasal region. The results presented on the complex of brachycephaly in cats suggest that brachycephalic animals should be classified into four categories (I  V) regarding objectionable structural criteria and use this classification interpreting the law of animal welfare (pain breed in terms of paragraph 11 b). Cats of the category IV seem to fulfil the corpus delicti of pain breed. Breeders of brachycephalic breeds should refrain from breeding with animals even of category III. According to the present study, even animals of category I and II display alterations due to dorso-rotation (slight narrowing of the nasal entry, low grade angling of the respiratory duct and the nasolacrimal drainage system, development of additional paranasal sinuses). But - in the hands of conscientious breeders - the latter add to the variety of feline breeds and are not objectionable from the veterinary point of view...|$|R
2500|$|Foreign {{minister}} Elías Jaua decreed {{seven days}} of mourning for Chávez. Chávez's body {{was taken to the}} Military Academy in Caracas on 6 March 2013, accompanied by large numbers of supporters who joined the procession at the military parade grounds (the Heroes Avenue) and was left lying in state for the public to visit for three days [...] The state funeral was held in Caracas on 8 March 2013. Acting President Nicolás Maduro originally stated that Chávez's body would be embalmed and permanently displayed after the state funeral in a transparent sarcophagus at a military museum in the former site of the Military Academy in La Planicie Barracks at the 23 de Enero district west of the city proper. However, due to difficulties in finding an expert and the uncertainties of <b>plastination</b> in which the weather plays a substantial part, Maduro announced that the body would not be embalmed in time.|$|E

5000|$|Concern over {{consent of}} bodies {{being used in}} the <b>plastination</b> process has arisen. Over 20 years ago, von Hagens set up a body {{donation}} program in Germany and has signed over 9,000 donors into the plastinate program: 531 have already died. The program has reported an average of one body a day being released to the <b>plastination</b> process. Ninety percent of the donors registered are German. Although von Hagens says he follows strict consent procedures for whole-body specimens, he maintains that [...] "consent is not important for body parts". Von Hagens' body donations are now being managed by the Institute for <b>Plastination</b> (IfP) established in 1993.|$|E
50|$|With {{the success}} of his patents, von Hagens went on to form the Institute for <b>Plastination</b> in Heidelberg, Germany in 1993. The Institute for <b>Plastination,</b> along with von Hagens made their first showing of plastinated bodies in Japan in 1995, which drew more than three million visitors. The Institute {{maintains}} three international centres of plastination: in Germany, Kyrgyzstan and China.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plastination</b> {{is useful}} in anatomy as well as serving as models and {{teaching}} tools. <b>Plastination</b> is used at more than 40 medical and dental schools throughout the world {{as an adjunct to}} anatomical dissection.Students enrolled in introductory animal science courses at many universities learn animal science through collections of multi-species large-animal specimens. <b>Plastination</b> allows students to have hands on experience in this field, without exposure to chemicals such as formalin. For example, plastinated canine gastrointestinal tracts are used to help in the teaching of endoscopic technique and anatomy. The plastinated specimens retain their dilated conformation by a positive pressure air flow during the curing process, which allows them to be used to teach both endoscopic technique and gastrointestinal anatomy.|$|E

50|$|The North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine in Raleigh, North Carolina uses both PC (plastic coating) and PN (<b>plastination)</b> to {{investigate}} and compare {{the difference in the}} two methods. The PC method was simple and inexpensive, but the plastinated specimens (PN method) were more flexible, durable, and lifelike than those preserved by the PC method. The use of <b>plastination</b> allowed the use of many body parts such as muscle, nerves, bones, ligaments, and central nervous system to be preserved.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{methods used}} {{in modern times}} include the Silicone S 10 Standard Procedure, the Cor-Tech Room {{temperature}} procedure, the Epoxy E 12 procedure, and the Polyester P 35 (P 40) procedure.

Dow Corning Corporation's Cor-Tech Room Temperature Procedure is designed to allow <b>plastination</b> of specimen at room temperature to various degrees of flexibility using three combinations of polymer, crosslinker and catalyst. According to the International Society for <b>Plastination,</b> the Epoxy E 12 procedure is utilized [...] "for thin, transparent, and firm body and organ slices", while the Polyster P 35 (P 40) preserves [...] "semitransparent and firm brain slices". Samples are prepared for fixation through the first method by deep freezing, while the second method works best following 4-6 weeks of preparation in a formaldehyde mixture.|$|E
