5|$|The Due Process Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization.

5|$|The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 also {{introduced}} section8B(2), {{which is an}} ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> of the ISA. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal held {{that it was not}} necessary for it to decide if the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case. Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the effect of section8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.|$|E
5|$|Section 8B(2) {{contained}} an ouster clause that restricted {{the scope of}} judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that {{if the issue of}} whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments. Article 149(1) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against, and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments.|$|E

25|$|Procedural impropriety in Singapore {{administrative}} law {{is one of}} the three broad categories of judicial review, the other two being illegality and irrationality.

25|$|The Montana Supreme Court twice {{ruled on}} the Judicial Standards Commission's investigative procedures.

Beyond that, however, the legislature now required the JSC to obtain a verified, written complaint. In , the high court affirmed the JSC's power to subpoena documents.

25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} to exhaust any internal appeals procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|E
500|$|In Yong Vui Kong, the Court {{described}} the clemency power in Singapore as vested {{exclusively in the}} executive, and thus not justiciable on the merits. Despite this, {{it is not an}} [...] "extra-legal" [...] power that is beyond any legal constraints. Agreeing with Tan Guat Neo Phyllis, the Court held that the clemency power is subject to judicial review if it can be shown to have been exercised unconstitutionally, in bad faith or for extraneous purposes. In addition, the fact that Article22P(2) of the Constitution stipulates specific procedural safeguards in death penalty cases indicates that the clemency power must be reviewable to ensure that these safeguards have been complied with. Article22P(2) requires documents from the trial judge and the appellate court, and the Attorney-General's opinion on the case, to be sent to the Cabinet for consideration so that it can advise the President on the exercise of the clemency power. These <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> imply that Cabinet has a constitutional duty to consider the documents in good faith before advising the President. If evidence is adduced to show that the Cabinet did not consider the offender's case impartially and in good faith (for example, it never met to discuss the case, or tossed a coin instead of properly considering the materials transmitted to it), Cabinet would have breached Article22P(2). In such a situation, the courts must be able to review the clemency decision. This conclusion is also mandated by the guarantee in Article 9(1) of the Constitution that a person may not be deprived of either life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.|$|E
