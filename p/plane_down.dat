5|$|After losing {{contact with}} the DC-6 aircraft, National Airlines, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Navy began an {{intensive}} search along the southeastern coast of the United States.

5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small <b>plane</b> <b>down</b> safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their <b>plane</b> <b>down.</b> Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and beyond the call of duty, as a division leader in Marine Fighting Squadron TWO TWENTY-ONE in action against enemy Japanese aerial forces in the Solomon Islands Area, April 7, 1943. In a daring flight to intercept a wave of 150 Japanese planes, First Lieutenant Swett unhesitatingly hurled his four-plane division into action against a formation of fifteen enemy bombers and during his dive personally exploded three hostile planes in mid-air with accurate and deadly fire. Although separated from his division while clearing the heavy concentration of anti-aircraft fire, he boldly attacked six enemy bombers, engaged the first four in turn, and unaided, shot them down in flames. Exhausting his ammunition as he closed the fifth Japanese bomber, he relentlessly drove his attack against terrific opposition which partially disabled his engine, shattered the windscreen and slashed his face. In spite of this, he brought his battered <b>plane</b> <b>down</b> with skillful precision in the water off Tulagi without further injury. The superb airmanship and tenacious fighting spirit which enabled First Lieutenant Swett to destroy eight enemy bombers in a single flight were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} of the battle, torpedo bombers from the carrier [...] arrived on the scene, and their attack forced Vittorio Veneto to break off the {{engagement}} with the British cruisers to take evasive action. She evaded the torpedoes, but the attack convinced Iachino that the Mediterranean Fleet was at sea, which prompted him to end the operation and return to port. The British launched several air attacks against the Italian fleet {{in an attempt to}} slow down Vittorio Veneto, including land-based Blenheim bombers from Greece and Crete. Later in the afternoon Formidable launched a second strike, and at 15:10 one of her Swordfish hit Vittorio Veneto on her port side, aft. The Italian anti-aircraft gunners shot the <b>plane</b> <b>down</b> after it launched its torpedo. The hit sheared off the port side propeller, damaged the shaft, jammed the port rudder, and disabled the aft port pumps. It also caused severe floodingsome [...] of water entered the shipwhich gave her a 44.5degree list to port, and forced her to stop for about ten minutes.

2500|$|In {{the ensuing}} running fight, the PBY fared badly. On one pass, the fighter's cannon shells tore into the plane's {{gasoline}} tank; and the volatile fuel spilled from the ruptured area.

Christman headed for the water to land and abandon ship; two men, Radiomen 2 Class Landers and Bangust, bailed out at 300 feet while Christman and his second and third pilots rode the <b>plane</b> <b>down.</b> Waterman, after manning his single [...]30-caliber machine gun with great dexterity, had been mortally wounded, probably in the fighter's last pass.|$|E

[...] He then racked up two more victories—one of which he shared with Douglas Campbell—before being made commander of the 147th Pursuit Squadron in July.

2500|$|Brading {{joined the}} Royal Naval Air Service on 12 June 1917, {{just a month}} past his eighteenth birthday. He trained in an {{operational}} squadron, 12 Naval, before being posted to 1 Naval in April 1918 as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 2 May, he scored his first aerial victory when a squadron patrol caught a luckless German reconnaissance plane north of Albert and Brading, Samuel Kinkead, Hazel Wallace, and four other pilots sent it down out of control for a win apiece. On the 15th, Brading gained a second victory in similar fashion, teaming with Kinkead, Wallace, Charles Dawson Booker, Robert McLaughlin, Maxwell Findlay, James Henry Forman, and two other pilots to destroy an Albatros D.V to add to all their scores. Brading also received a second victory that day, for his solo win in driving a second Albatros D.V down out of control. His fourth triumph came on 9 June, when he drove a DFW reconnaissance <b>plane</b> <b>down</b> out of control. On 28 June, he became an ace by driving down another Albatros D.V. From there on, Brading's wins were always over the best German fighter planes, Fokker D.VIIs and a Pfalz D.XII. The only curiosity among them was the last pilot downed plummeted to his death {{in one of the}} pioneering uses of a parachute; that was on 16 September 1918.|$|E
