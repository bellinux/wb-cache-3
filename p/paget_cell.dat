40|$|Nodal lymphangiogenesis {{promotes}} distant {{lymph node}} (LN) metastasis in experimental cancer models. However, {{the role of}} nodal lymphangiogenesis in distant metastasis and in the overall survival of cancer patients remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated mechanisms that might facilitate regional and distant LN metastasis in extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD). We retrospectively analyzed the impact of tumor-induced lymphatic vessel activation on the survival of 116 patients, the largest cohort with EMPD studied to date. Nodal lymphangiogenesis was significantly increased in metastatic, compared with tumor-free, LNs (P = 0. 022). Increased lymphatic invasion within regional LNs {{was significantly associated with}} distant metastasis in LN (P = 0. 047) and organs (P = 0. 003). Thus, invasion within regional LNs is a powerful indicator of systemic tumor spread and reduced patient survival in EMPD (P = 0. 0004). Lymphatic vessels associated with tumors expressed stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1), whereas CXCR 4 was expressed on invasive Paget cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) -like process. A 431 cells overexpressing Snail expressed increased levels of CXCR 4 in the presence of transforming growth factor-β 1. Haptotactic migration assays confirmed that Snail-induced EMT-like process promotes tumor cell motility via the CXCR 4 -SDF- 1 axis. Sinusoidal lymphatic endothelial cells and macrophages expressed SDF- 1 in subcapsular sinuses of lymph nodes before <b>Paget</b> <b>cell</b> arrival. Our findings reveal that EMT-related features likely promote lymphatic metastasis of EMPD by activating the CXCR 4 -SDF- 1 axis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD) {{remains a}} rare {{condition}} {{with only a}} limited number of cases reported in the literature. EMPD is mainly composed of intraepidermal Paget cells, and possesses variable clinical behaviors and histological appearances, leading to difficulty in the diagnosis of this disease. Case presentation: We here report a case of primary EMPD with the appearance of a nodule on the background of erythema. Histological assessment showed <b>Paget</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration throughout the epidermis with dermal spread. Using immunohistochemistry, the expressions of CK 7, CK 19, CK 20, GCDFP- 15, CEA, S- 100 protein and bcl- 2 were examined to elucidate the cellular differentiation of the carcinoma. Conclusion: According to the histological assessment, this case was diagnosed as primary EMPD with carcinoma cells invading into the dermis, but without lymph node infiltration. Background EMPD of the vulva is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma which accounts for less than 1 % of carcinomas in vulva, while the majority of the patients are postmenopausal Caucasian females[1 - 3]. The cancer cells in the neoplasm usually stay “in situ ” and only rarely invade into the dermis to be metastatic via the lymphatic system [4, 5]. One has to differentiate neoplasms with Paget phenomenon from carcinomas metastasized from adjacent organs such as the urinary system and rectum [6]. Here, we present an unusual case of EMPD with carcinoma cells invading into the dermis without lymph node infiltration in a Chinese woman. Case presentation A 66 -year-old Chinese woman presented with a slowly growing vulvar mass with pruritus. Two years prior to presentation, she noted a painless red firm nodule on her vulva. Subsequently, erythema around the nodule appeared. The nodule and erythema had gradually enlarged during the 2 -year period. Physical examination revealed a 2 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm slightly erosive, nodular red firm mass on the centre of 5 cm × 7 cm area of irregular eczematoid erythema covering her mons pubi...|$|E

30|$|An 81 -year-old Japanese {{woman with}} a 2 -week history of {{abdominal}} distension presented to our hospital for assessment. Endoscopic examination revealed a mild elevated granular lesion, with a slightly depressed irregular mucosa, in the distal esophagus, with EMPD confirmed by biopsy. Thoracoscopic esophagectomy with lymph node dissection was performed, with <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> observed on microscopic examination in {{the lower part of}} the esophageal epithelium. Only a few <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> stained positively for PAS/Alcian blue. Immunohistochemically, negative staining for CK 5 and p 63 were identified in the <b>Paget</b> <b>cells,</b> with positive staining for CK 7. Furthermore, an intraepithelial squamous cell carcinoma, with squamous metaplasia and reserve cell hyperplasia, was observed in the gastric mucosa of the esophagogastric junction, adjacent to the <b>Paget</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{patterns}} of expression of cytokeratin polypeptides which are closely correlated to routes of differentiation of epithelial cells were studied in extramammary Paget's disease. Cytokeratins of uninvolved and involved epidermis {{were analyzed by}} two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of microdissected tissue preparations {{as well as by}} immunofluorescence microscopy using cytokeratin antibodies with different specificities. In uninvolved epidermis, cytokeratins Nos. 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, and 16, characteristic of keratinocytes, were found. Epidermis infiltrated by <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> contained the same components and in addition, cytokeratins Nos. 7, 8, 18 and 19, the latter being characteristic of simple and glandular epithelia, including apocrine and eccrine skin glands. By immunohistochemistry, broad-spectrum antibodies to cytokeratins decorated both keratinocytes and <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells.</b> Antibodies selective for cytokeratins Nos. 1, 10, and 11 stained suprabasal keratinocytes but not <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells.</b> In contrast, antibodies to cytokeratin No. 18 were negative on keratinocytes but the <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> were selectively stained, as were the secretory cells but not the ductal cells in apocrine and eccrine glands. The results show that the cytoskeleton of <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> is different from that of keratinocytes and ductal cells of skin glands and suggest that these tumor cells express the glandular type cytokeratins Nos. 7, 8, 18 and 19. This provides cell biologic support for a relationship of <b>cells</b> of <b>Paget's</b> disease to secretory cells of apocrine and eccrine glands. The histogenesis of extramammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> is discussed in relation to these findings...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} test used to {{diagnose}} Paget's disease is the biopsy, {{removal of a}} tissue sample from the affected area which is then examined under the microscope by a pathologist, who distinguishes <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> from other cell types by staining tissues to identify specific cells (immunohistochemistry). Samples of nipple discharge may also be examined under the microscope to determine whether <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> are present.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAims: We hypothesise that {{similarity}} of the molecular subtypes of <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> to molecular subtypes of underlying breast carcinomas would put in favour the epidermotropic theory of <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> origin. Methods and Results: We analysed immunohistochemical expression of markers that define particular molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas. The whole {{analysis was performed}} by means of tissue microarray in mammary Paget's disease and in the underlying breast carcinoma(s). We found that HER 2 -overexpression subtype (ER-; HER 2 +) was a dominant molecular subtype of <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> (37 out of 43 analyzed cases; 86 %). Luminal B (ER+; HER 2 +) and luminal A (ER+; HER-) subtypes were identified in 12 % and 2 % of cases, respectively. None of the analysed tumours presented basal-like subtype phenotype. Similar distribution of molecular subtypes was identified in the underlying in situ breast carcinomas (HER 2 subtype, 82 %; luminal A, 6 %; luminal B, 6 %; basal-like, 6 % of cases) and in the invasive component (HER 2 subtype, 84 %; luminal A, 8 %; luminal B, 8 %; basal-like, 0 % of cases). Conclusion: HER 2 molecular subtype was a dominant, but not the sole subtype presented by <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> of the nipple. Similar distribution of molecular subtypes in <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> and in the underlying carcinomas strongly suggest their common origin...|$|R
30|$|The {{treatment}} of Paget’s disease has been controversial and {{depends upon the}} origin of <b>Paget</b> <b>cells.</b> If the epidermotropic theory is believed, then there is an invasive component in the breast and the {{treatment of}} choice is mastectomy. The intraepidermal transformation theory, however, says that <b>Paget’s</b> <b>cells</b> form de novo in nipple epithelium, and hence, the treatment of choice in cases confined to the nipple areolar region is resection of nipple-areolar complex followed by local irradiation, making the role of mastectomy controversial.|$|R
30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of PD must be confirmed histologically. Armitage et al. [14] reported that <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> are usually positive for CK 7, GCDFP- 15, CEA, and human milk fat globule glycoproteins 1 and 2 by immunohistochemical staining. In contrast, pPD associated with rectal adenocarcinoma is usually positive for CK 20 but negative for GCDFP- 15 [15]. In the present case, histological findings {{revealed that the}} resected specimen contained <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> in the squamous epithelium as well as adenocarcinoma components in the submucosal layer. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that CK 7 and CK 20 expression was positive in <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> and adenocarcinoma tissues. However, GCDFP- 15 activity was not detected {{in any of the}} lesions. The patient had a history of intramucosal rectal cancer 17  years ago, and the tumor recurred on several occasions before the present episode. Therefore, we diagnosed the lesion as recurrent rectal cancer with pagetoid spread.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the histogenesis of <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> of mammary and extramammary Paget's disease. Accordingly, rabbit antibodies to two glycoproteins, purified from human milk-fat-globule membrane and designated MFGM-gp 70 and MFGM-gp 155, were used to study the presence and patterns of distribution of these glycoproteins in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections by an indirect immunoperoxidase staining method. Both antibodies recognized epitopes which are located on the protein domain of the molecules. MFGM-gp 70 as shown to be localized on the apical plasma membrane of luminal epithelial cells of all ducts and lobules of the mammary gland; it was also present in normal apocrine but not eccrine sweat glands coils and ducts in skin. MFGM-gp 155 was present on the apical plasma membrane of the cells of lobules and terminal ducts, but not larger ducts of mammary gland, normal apocrine and eccrine sweat glands coils and ducts, or sebaceous glands in skin. Neither of the antibodies reacted with keratinocytes or melanocytes. Under similar conditions, the antibodies to MFGM-gp 70 reacted with <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> of 8 of 8 cases of mammary disease and 6 of 8 cases of extramammary disease. By contrast, MFGM-gp 155 was localized in <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> of 7 of 8 cases of mammary disease but none of the 8 cases of extramammary disease. The underlying tumour cells of infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, where one was present, consistently showed reactivity with antibodies to MFGM-gp 70 and MFGM-gp 155. These findings lend additional support to the postulates that (a) <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> in the breast originate in most cases from neoplastic mammary epithelial cells and (b) mammary and extramammary <b>Paget</b> <b>cells,</b> although morphologically similar, differ in expressing MFGM-gp 155...|$|R
30|$|Esophageal Paget’s {{disease is}} quite rare, {{with only a}} few cases having been {{reported}} [9 – 13]. Yates and Koss [9] described esophageal Paget’s disease associated with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the distal esophagus, whereas Norihisa et al. [10] reported a case of adenosquamous carcinoma of the esophagus with pagetoid extension of the adenocarcinoma component. Therefore, both of these cases were diagnosed as a pagetoid growth of an advanced esophageal carcinoma. On the other hand, Nonomura et al. [11] and Matsukuma et al. [12] reported esophageal Paget’s disease associated with an early underlying carcinoma, one being an intraepithelial carcinoma and the other, a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Ishihara et al. [13] also reported a case of an early invasive carcinoma, which consisted of pagetoid squamous cell carcinoma in situ combined with early invasive components and choriocarcinoma at the metastatic site. Abraham et al. [5] reported a close relationship between <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> in the esophagus and an underlying poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the esophagus or esophagogastric junction. From these reports, all previously reported cases of Paget’s disease of the esophagus were thought to be secondary to an underlying carcinoma, although the malignant component varied in each case. In our case, we identified an SCC component, with squamous metaplasia and reserve cell hyperplasia, in the gastric mucosa of the esophagogastric junction, which was followed by <b>Paget</b> <b>cells.</b> However, unlike typical Paget’s disease, only few <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> were positive for PAS/Alcian blue staining and immunohistochemically positive for gastric gland mucin, whereas a strong p 53 overexpression was observed in both SCC component and <b>Paget</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R

In both cases, morphological and immunohistochemical investigation showed two heterogeneous but intimately admired neoplastic populations of vulvar epithelium. Atypical keratinocytes stained markedly and diffusely positive for high molecular weight cytokeratins, and moderately for p 53 protein and c-erbB- 2 immunostainings. <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> were diffusely positive for CEA, EMA, and low molecular weight cytokeratins, moderately and focally for c-erbB- 2 and (in one case) for S- 100.

40|$|Paget {{disease of}} the nipple is a rare disease {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} malignant glandular cells within the squamous epithelium of the nipple. The most common hypothesis to explain the development of Paget disease is an intraepithelial epidermotropic migration of malignant epithelial cells originating from an underlying intraductal carcinoma. If the immunohistochemical properties of the <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> in the nipple have been extensively studied, their proliferating characteristics remain paradoxically poorly studied. In the present study we have investigated the proliferating activity of <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> in the nipple by using double stain immunohistochemistry with both Ki 67 (a protein which is expressed in all active parts of the cell cycle) and cytokeratin 7 (a highly sensitive marker of <b>Paget</b> <b>cells).</b> Ten cases of Paget disease and in their associated intraductal carcinomas (n = 10) and/or invasive carcinomas (n = 4) were tested. The mean Ki 67 index was in Paget disease (26 % ± 10), in intraductal carcinomas (23 % ± 8) and/or in invasive carcinomas (20 % ± 8) (p > 0, 05). This is the first report to convincingly demonstrate by specific double stain immunohistochemistry that Paget disease and underlying intraductal carcinomas share a close proliferating activity. © 2009 Arányi Lajos Foundation.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{metastasis}} of many cancers {{is due in}} part to loss of cell–cell adhesion. E-cadherin, plakoglobin and β-catenin are important in cell adhesion. Our aim was to examine the presence of these molecules in Paget's disease of the vulva and Paget's disease of the breast, and to correlate any differences in their expression with the presence of invasive disease or an underlying carcinoma. Sixty-three archival cases of Paget's disease of the vulva, including eight associated with invasive disease, and 23 archival cases of Paget's disease of breast, which included 10 cases with ductal carcinoma in situ alone, four cases with both ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma, and five cases with underlying invasive carcinoma alone, were analysed immunohistochemically for expression of E-cadherin, plakoglobin and β-catenin proteins. The respective mRNAs were also detected by in situ hybridisation using digoxigenin-labelled cRNA probes. Seventy-six percent (41 / 54) of Paget's disease of vulva cases had > 50 % of <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> expressing the E-cadherin protein, compared with 28 % (2 / 7) of Paget's disease vulva with invasive disease. This result was significant, with a P-value of 0. 039. Twenty-five percent (14 / 55) of the intraepidermal Paget's disease of the vulva cases had > 50 % of <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> expressing the plakoglobin protein, compared with 12 % (1 / 8) of cases of Paget's disease of vulva with invasive disease, and for β-catenin, 9 % (5 / 55) of the non-invasive Paget's disease of the vulva had > 50 % of <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> expressing β-catenin, compared with 12 % (1 / 8) of Paget's disease of the vulva cases with invasive disease.

30|$|The {{patient was}} a 91 -year-old man with change in nipple appearance, itching and redness, and a palpable breast mass. At presentation, mammary Paget’s disease (PD) was {{clinically}} suspected. Skin biopsy was performed and showed epidermis invaded by <b>Paget</b> <b>cells,</b> characterized by hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant pale-staining cytoplasm. Computed tomography and mammary ultrasonography confirmed {{the absence of}} an underlying invasive carcinoma, and the patient underwent right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Both sentinel lymph nodes were found to be negative perioperatively, and further axillary dissection was not performed. Pathological results revealed no malignancy under the nipple, yet the <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> were more widely spread than expected. The patient was followed up without the need of postoperative chemotherapy. Male mammary PD is an extremely rare breast cancer, and there is no standard preoperative assessment or operative procedure. Mammography is many times unable to detect possible underlying breast carcinoma in female patients with mammary PD, and previous studies have reported that the detection rate was less than 50  %. However, some researchers reported that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be more detectable to confirm the extent of the cancer. The extent of the skin change around the nipple is often different from the actual perimeter of <b>Paget</b> <b>cells.</b> In extra-mammary PD, mapping biopsy is known to be useful to determine areas free of cancer. The benefits of SLNB have also been demonstrated for the management of less invasive breast cancers, and previous reports have shown that the use of SLNB is reasonable for treatment of mammary PD without underlying invasive cancer. MRI, mapping biopsy, and SLNB are all less invasive procedures and thus may be suitable for treatment of male mammary PD.|$|R

40|$|Background Extramammary Paget {{disease is}} an {{uncommon}} skin tumour occurring {{mostly in the}} genitoperineal region. Previous reports have shown frequent expression of androgen receptor, suggesting a tumour-proliferative effect of androgens on <b>Paget</b> <b>cells.</b> Androgen-converting enzymes such as 5 α-reductase, which locally produces a bioactive androgen, have recently gained attention in studies of the intratumoral actions of androgens. Objectives We investigated correlations between the androgenic microenvironment and invasiveness in extramammary Paget disease, particularly in terms of sex differences. Methods We examined 58 cases of extramammary Paget disease (32 men, 26 women; 42 noninvasive, 16 invasive) using immunohistochemistry for androgen receptor and 5 α-reductase. Results In all 58 cases, expression rates were 57 % for androgen receptor and 55 % for 5 α-reductase, with 38 % double-positivity for androgen receptor and 5 α-reductase. Only 5 α-reductase expression rate was significantly higher in invasive cases (81 %) than in noninvasive cases (45 %; P = 0 · 042). For invasive cases, numbers of double-positive results for androgen receptor and 5 α-reductase were significantly higher in men (70 %) than in women (17 %; P = 0 · 039).

In most cases, Paget’s disease is associated with an underlying breast malignancy. Mastectomy has been considered the treatment of choice, but breast conservation is also being explored, in properly selected patients, depending on the underlying malignancy. We report a case of Paget’s disease occurring in the contralateral breast 11 years after mastectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma but with no underlying breast malignancy...|$|R
40|$|A 99 m Tc MIBI prone scintimammography (PSM) was {{performed}} {{in a case of}} underlying Pager's disease of the breast. 99 m Tc MIBI PSM showed a diffuse scintigraphic image like a spl ead of uptake fr om the deeply located zones of the breast toward epidermis. In vivo, 99 m Tc MIBI PSM represents the spread of neoplastic <b>Paget's</b> <b>cells</b> probably due to attracs induced by chemotactic factors released by keratinocytes. This spread in Paget's disease is correlated to neu oncogene overexpression which increases the metastatic activity as a consequence of motility enhancement and growth stimulation effect. These scintigraphic images suggest that 99 m Te MIBI PSM could be relevant in management of Paget's disease of the breast...|$|R
30|$|Physical {{examination}} in a 75 -year-old woman {{revealed an}} erythematous, inflamed, perianal skin lesion. Neither colposcopy, cystoscopy, colonoscopy, computed tomography, nor {{magnetic resonance imaging}} showed evidence of malignant genitourinary or gastrointestinal lesions. Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen showed many <b>Paget’s</b> <b>cells</b> in the perianal skin lesion and no malignant cells in the rectal or vaginal mucosa. Therefore, primary extramammary Paget’s disease of the anogenital region was suspected, and we performed anus-preserving wide local excision. However, immunohistochemistry revealed a diagnosis of secondary extramammary Paget’s disease due to adenocarcinoma arising from the anal gland. We therefore proceeded with a radical operation. Histopathological examination showed no residual cancer cells. The final diagnosis was anal gland adenocarcinoma in situ with pagetoid spread in the perianal skin.|$|R
40|$|Paget's {{disease is}} a special variety of breast cancer. It is a rare disease that {{represents}} 1 to 3 % of all breast cancers and is clinically characterized as an eczematous lesion on the nipple, later progressing to the areola surface and terminal lactiferous ducts. We present {{the case of a}} 48 years old female patient who attended consultation because of discoloration, eczema and depression of the nipple. Skin retraction and retroareolar palpable tumour were found. Through mammography, asymmetry was observed in the density of right mammary parenchyma in respect to the left retroarelar. It had a tumoural appearance. The biopsy was positive for <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> and invasive ductal carcinoma. As rare as this case is, we decided to have it published...|$|R
40|$|An 81 -year-old man had {{undergone}} total cystectomy and bilateral ureterocutaneostomy {{at the age}} of 66 years. Furthermore, no recurrence or metastasis was observed; but {{at the age of}} 80 years he observed a painless rash around the external urethral orifice. As urothelial cancer was suspected, the urethra and glans were biopsied. Through immunohistochemical staining (cytokeratin 7 and 20), the glans biopsy indicated secondary Paget's disease of transitional epithelial origin. A urethrectomy was performed as progression from the urethra was suspected. The pathological examination revealed <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> at the glans, but the tumor was not observed permeating into the corpus cavernosum. This presents a rare case of secondary Paget's disease originating from a bladder tumor, and appearing in the glans without intraurethral progression...|$|R
50|$|Vulvar Paget disease {{presents}} as {{a variety}} of clinical lesions that may occur over a protracted course. Initially it is velvety, soft, and red or bright pink with scattered white islands of hyperkeratosis. (a strawberry and cream appearance) The lesions become erythematous, plaque like, and desquamating especially when located in dry areas. Rarely the appearance is ulcerated. The borders appear irregular, slightly elevated, and sharply demarcated. The visible borders of vulvar Paget disease are often misleading as <b>Paget</b> <b>cells</b> may spread along the basal layers of normal appearing skin with multicentric foci. Involvement may be extensive including the perianal region, genitocrural, and inguinal folds. Clinical examination should determine the presence of periurethral and perianal lesions. In these cases an involvement of the skin by a noncutaneous internal neoplasm may occur.|$|R
