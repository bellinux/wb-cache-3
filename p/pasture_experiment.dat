30|$|Chapter 1 {{presents}} a fascinating {{exploration of the}} US government’s pest eradication and fencing programmes during the early 1900 s (the Progressive Era). Pests were considered as either animals that were seen as reducing the quality of forage for domestic livestock (prairie dogs, jack rabbits, etc.) or livestock predators (coyotes, wolves). Eradication efforts had long-term ecological effects with some foci of eradication now seen as keystone species. Fencing {{was seen as a}} means to protect livestock from predators without the labour costs of herders. The book describes the Coyote-Proof <b>Pasture</b> <b>Experiment</b> conducted in eastern Oregon between 1907 and 1909. Sayre describes this experiment as a key event in the eventual fencing of public rangelands in the USA. Given the interests in reducing labour costs, regularizing and measuring grazing charge, this experiment eventually led to the widespread use of less expensive fencing that was far from predator-proof on the rangelands of US public land. Overlapping grazing orbits managed by herders did not fit within the management vision of the Forest Service. In this way, bureaucratic and economic prerogatives, more than scientific evidence, led to the decline of herding in the USA.|$|E

These basic concepts will not be repeated in this bulletin. Since more hogs are farrowed in spring than in fall, the research reported {{in this study was}} conducted for growing and fattening hogs raised on pasture. Like the drylot study, the objectives of the <b>pasture</b> <b>experiment</b> were to estimate: (1) the production function, (2) the substitution rate between corn and soybean oilmeal at different points on the production surface, (3) the least-cost ration for different soybean oilmeal/corn price ratios, (4) the relationship between the rate of hog gains and the input of corn and soybean oilmeal and (5) the proportion of the years in which a least-cost feeding system results in greater profits than a least-time feeding system. Substitution between major classes of feed such as corn and soybean oilmeal is possible mainly where the rations are fortified with appropriate quantities of trace minerals (as well as antibiotics in the case of drylot feeding).

40|$|Big {{bluestem}} (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) has a {{rapid growth}} phase that begins in early to mid-June in eastern Nebraska. During this rapid growth phase, rate of biomass accumulation exceeds intake rate of grazing livestock, {{resulting in low}} levels of harvest efficiency. To delay the rapid growth phase, big bluestem pasture can be grazed in mid- to late May without affecting herbage yields {{for the remainder of}} the growing season. A <b>pasture</b> <b>experiment</b> was conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2001 near Mead, NE. The objective was to determine the effect of timing and frequency of grazing big bluestem pasture, following a May grazing period, on cumulative pregrazing yields, cumulative herbage disappearance, resulting harvest efficiency, leaf/stem ratio, and stand persistence. Yield and morphological characteristics were obtained immediately before and after each grazing period, and basal cover of big bluestem was estimated annually. May grazing had no effect (P 3 ̆c 0. 1) on cumulative pregrazing yields and resulted in an increase of cumulative herbage disappearance (3638 vs. 2673 kg ha- 1) and leaf/stem ratio (2. 02 vs. 2. 83) compared with paddocks with no May grazing. Grazing at the vegetative stage in June compared with Study Site the elongation stage resulted in an increase in cumulative pregrazing yields (10774 vs. 9510 kg ha- 1), cumulative herbage disappearance (4116 vs. 3194 kg ha- 1), and leaf/stem ratios (2. 57 vs. 1. 98).

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of a high white clover (Trifolium repens) content in temperate pastoral systems in terms of livestock performance and nitrogen fixation, the proportion of white clover in grass-clover pastures is often low (< 20 %). This thesis examined in two experiments whether the white clover content of pastures could be improved by sowing white clover with alternative grass species to diploid perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). In a <b>pasture</b> <b>experiment,</b> DM production, pasture composition and morphology of grass-clover mixtures was measured over the establishment year (January 2007 to January 2008) where white clover was sown in fine mixtures with diploid perennial ryegrass, tetraploid perennial ryegrass, timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.). Pastures were irrigated and rotationally grazed with on-off grazing with Coopworth ewe hoggets. Total annual DM production of pasture was more than 20 % higher in tetraploid (12521 kg DM ha- 1) and diploid (11733 kg DM ha- 1) perennial ryegrass than timothy (9751 kg DM ha- 1) and cocksfoot (9654 kg DM ha- 1). However, timothy (5936 kg DM ha- 1) and cocksfoot (5311 kg DM ha- 1) had more than four times higher white clover annual DM production than tetraploid (1310 kg DM ha- 1) and diploid (818 kg DM ha- 1) ryegrass. Pasture growth rate at the first three harvests in autumn was significantly greater in tetraploid and diploid ryegrass than timothy and cocksfoot. Timothy and cocksfoot had a higher proportion of white clover than tetraploid and diploid perennial ryegrass throughout the entire year. This was due to more and larger white clover plants in timothy and cocksfoot plots. In a grazing preference experiment, the partial preference of sheep for white clover offered in combination with the same grass species as in the <b>pasture</b> <b>experiment</b> was measured in five grazing tests in May, September, October, November and December 2007. Pastures were sown in January 2007. Paired plots (grass and clover both 4. 2 m x 10 m) were grazed by three Coopworth ewe hoggets between 9 am and 5 pm, and preference was recorded by decline in pasture mass and visual scan sampling for grazing time. Grazing preference for clover was generally low throughout these tests (e. g. average apparent DM intake from clover = 47 %; average grazing time from clover = 44 %). Several explanations are proposed for this low preference including a high N content and intake rate of the grass relative to the clover. No significant differences were found among the grass treatments in total grass grazing time, total clover grazing time, ruminating time, the proportion of grazing time on clover, selective coefficient for clover and DM intake percentage from clover at any date. There was no significant change in overall sward surface height (SSH) decline among grass treatments throughout all the tests except December 2007 when the overall SSH decline for cocksfoot was significantly lower than the other species. The study indicated that the rapid growth rate of perennial ryegrass in the early phase of pasture establishment, rather than differences in partial preference, was the key factor limiting white clover content in the mixed swards relative to cocksfoot and timothy pastures. It is concluded that high clover-containing pastures capable of delivering high per head performance can be established through the use of slow establishing pasture species such as timothy and cocksfoot...|$|E

The contribution of each pathway to driver–productivity relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species. We used data from three experiments in Texas, USA, to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) response of C 4 grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly: atmospheric CO 2 enrichment and augmented summer precipitation. The ANPPdriver response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed. ANPP increased by 80 – 120 g m– 2 per 100 μl l– 1 rise in CO 2 in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages. Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128 mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment. The community effect accounted for 21 – 38 % of the ANPP CO 2 response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the <b>pasture</b> <b>experiment.</b> The community response to CO 2 was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration (e. g. greater height). Community effects on the ANPP CO 2 response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency. These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced ANPP-driver responses. However, the species traits that regulated community effects on ANPP differed from the traits that determined how communities responded to drivers...|$|E

Two long-term <b>pasture</b> <b>experiments</b> with different grass and legume species and with different stocking rates were used. Measurements were made of bulk density, penetrometer resistance, water retention characteristics, total porosity, pore-size distribution and water infiltration rate. The bulk density of the 0 – 5 cm and 6 – 11 cm layers was not affected {{by any of the}} treatments. Penetrometer resistance was affected by presence of a legume and stocking rate, but differences were small and of little practical importance. There was no difference in water retention curves between the pure grass and grass-legume treatments. The decline in water content with increasing pF occurred more gradually in the low-stocking-rate treatments than in the high-stocking-rate treatments or the native savanna. Consequently, the amount of plant-available water was smaller in the former treatments. The water infiltration rate was higher under grass–legume than under pure grass pastures and decreased with increasing stocking rate under both types of pastures. Differences in soil physical properties are explained by differences in root systems between the two types of pastures, and by differences in biomass, composition and distribution of soil fauna, especially earthworms.

Rich) Stapf] intercropped in the same furrow at different depths, in a no-till system, as well as dry matter production and protein concentration of palisadegrass <b>pasture.</b> <b>Experiments</b> were performed during two growing seasons, on a Typic Haplorthox, at Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block, arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial scheme, with six replications.

Life cycle duration of the soybean had a marked effect, and only early cycle soybean were successful intercrops. Intercropping palisadegrass with super-early or early soybean cultivars were viable options to crop-livestock integration, because they did not affect both soybean or palisadegrass yield. In addition, with these cultivars, it was possible to cultivate grain and then afterward more time for cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) grazing in the same area, providing greater revenue compared to sole soybean cropped or in the intercropping with longer cycle cultivars...|$|R

40|$|Evapotranspiration is a {{critical}} factor for local and regional planning, {{in terms of both}} water quality and quantity, to inform decisions around water catchment management, irrigation, water storage, and resource sustainability. Despite its importance, understanding of evapotranspiration from irrigated dairy pasture in Canterbury has to date been relatively limited. The focus of this research was, therefore, to improve understanding of evapotranspiration from ryegrass-based irrigated pastures under grazing. This was achieved through quantifying relationships between actual evapotranspiration and canopy development and evaluation and validation of methods commonly applied in the estimation of potential canopy evapotranspiration (PETc) for grazed perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) pasture. A network of nine lysimeters located at three sites across the mid to north Canterbury Plains was used. Pasture canopy measurements were taken throughout the study at one of the sites, and the biophysical model ‘DairyMod’ used to simulate pasture growth at all three sites. The ‘DairyMod’ and ‘HYDRUS- 1 D’ models were used to simulate soil water flow, and used to support lysimeter-based estimates of actual evapotranspiration. Methods examined for modelling PETc included the use of a crop coefficient time series and a number of commonly applied single-layer models including Penman-Monteith (PM), FAO-modified Penman-Monteith (PMFAO) and Priestley-Taylor (PT), and the dual-layer dual crop coefficient (DCC) and Shuttleworth-Wallace (SWW) models. ‘DairyMod’ and ‘HYDRUS’ and selected PETc models were validated with data collected under a controlled, perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) <b>pasture</b> <b>experiment</b> at Lincoln University, with two levels each of irrigation and nitrogen fertiliser. At all three lysimeter sites, the pasture production was nitrogen-limited, with herbage yields of 10. 8 - 14. 9 t DM/ha/y, below optimum yields achievable for Canterbury. The results suggested under-fertilisation of pasture to be prevalent across the region. ‘DairyMod’ was successful in accurately simulating pasture growth under a commercial dairy operation when compared with the measured lysimeter data. However, limitations within the model were identified. Specifically, the calibrated model failed to account for the mechanistic relationship between nitrogen and leaf extension at the temperature stress parameter values required to achieve a reasonable fit with the observed data. Accordingly, within the model, temperature became more limiting than nitrogen. However, this was able to be overcome through the reliance on the empirical relationship between temperature stress and photosynthesis whereby temperature stress functions in the model could be manipulated to achieve the ‘correct’ yields. ‘HYDRUS- 1 D’ was found to be superior to ‘DairyMod’ in the simulation of soil water flow. This was due to the closer predictions of drainage and soil moisture content with that observed compared with DairyMod. The simulated drainage highlighted issues in the lysimeter design. Where lysimeters were installed without rubber rims around the top of lysimeter casings, there was the potential for surface redistribution of water to occur. This ultimately led to discrepancies in the lysimeter data through unaccounted for water losses and therefore a reduction in drainage. A crop coefficient time series was developed from the lysimeter water use data. The time step over which water use measurements were made was the dominant contributing factor to variation in monthly crop coefficient values between lysimeter sites. When daily estimates of water use are used rather than weekly or greater, which were calculated with the SWW model, the spatial variability was largely eliminated. Temporal variations were found to be seasonally driven. When a mean crop coefficient time series from the three lysimeter sites was used to predict PETc, estimates were within 1 - 11 % of the actual evapotranspiration (AET), determined using the observed lysimeter data. When used to predict PETc in the Lincoln experiment, estimates were within 3 - 13 % of AET when water was not limiting. The results highlighted that, due to temporal variations, use of a single crop coefficient value could not be supported, which led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. However, the site averaged time series could be used for water allocation management purposes over the irrigation season months. The single layer PM, PMFAO and PT models over predicted water use. There was a strong systematic error to the daily PM estimates. When the canopy was small PM under-estimated AET but at a leaf area index greater than approximately 1. 3, PM over-estimated AET. This led to total over-estimations of 8 - 29 %. However, this was an improvement on the climate-based PMFAO predictions, which over-estimated AET by 31 - 58 %, and the PT model, which over-estimated AET by 17 - 30 %. The failure of these methods to accurately predict water use was due to their inherent assumptions of the canopy that are not representative of a typical grazed ryegrass pasture in Canterbury. The dual crop coefficient model provided estimates of water use within 1 - 24 % of the observed AET. However, the SWW model predicted water use within 9 % of AET. This was largely owing to the separation of soil evaporation from canopy transpiration, enabling the influence of the canopy on the potential soil evaporation to be adequately accounted for. These results highlighted the benefit of using the SWW model for irrigation management purposes over other PETc models and the need to actively account for the canopy, being the primary factor controlling water use. The method of estimation was also found to be significant, whereby under a grazed system the process of canopy transpiration needs to be separated from the soil evaporation. Finally, irrigation schedule scenario testing across the three lysimeter sites indicated ~ 35 % of drainage losses could be avoided through optimising irrigation scheduling. Doing so involved applying 10 - 20 mm per irrigation event, with a minimum return interval of 2 - 4 days, and delaying irrigation by 10 - 14 days following grazing of the paddock. Through optimising irrigation, the total irrigation applied was reduced by up to 64 % without compromising herbage accumulation. However, while less irrigation was required, more nitrogen was necessary for optimum yields to be achieved. It is likely that this finding is applicable to many commercial dairy farms region wide...|$|E

However, total annual liveweight production from lucerne was higher than any grass based pasture mainly due to superior animal production during summer when lucerne provided 42 - 85 % higher animal production {{than any of the}} grass based <b>pastures.</b> In <b>Experiment</b> 2, the effect of stocking rate (8. 3 (low) and 13. 9 (high) ewes + twin lambs/ha) and time of closing in spring on lamb liveweight gain, pasture production and subterranean clover seedling populations was monitored over 2 years for a dryland cocksfoot-subterranean clover and ryegrass-subterranean clover pasture in Canterbury. In both years, twin lambs grew faster (g/head/d) in spring at low (327; 385) than high (253; 285) stocking rate but total liveweight gain/ha (kg/ha/d) was greater at high (7. 26; 7. 91) than low (5. 43; 6. 38) stocking rate. Ewes also gained 0. 5 and 1. 5 kg/head at the low stocking rate in 2006 and 2007 respectively but lost 0. 2 kg/head in 2006 and gained 0. 3 kg/head at high stocking rate in 2007. Mean subterranean clover seedling populations (per m²) measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the first spring were similar at both low (2850) and high (2500) stocking rate but declined with later closing dates in spring (3850, 2950, 2100 and 1700 at 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks after first visible flower). Seedling populations measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the second spring were also unaffected by stocking rate (low 1290, high 1190) but declined with later closing dates in spring (1470, 1320 and 940 at 3, 5 and 8 weeks after first flowering, respectively). The effect of stocking rate and closing dates in spring on pasture and clover production in the following autumn was similar to the effects on seedling numbers in both years. However, clover production in the following spring was unaffected by stocking rate or closing date in the previous year at the relatively high seedling populations generated by the treatments. This was presumably due to runner growth compensating for lower plant populations in pastures that were closed later in spring. Subterranean clover runner growth in spring may not compensate in a similar manner if seedling numbers in autumn fall below 500 /m². Mean annual dry matter production from cocksfoot and ryegrass pastures grown with and without annual clovers pasture production ranged from 6. 4 to 12. 4 t DM/ha/y but stocking rate (8. 3 vs. 13. 9 ewes/ha) during spring did not affect annual pasture production. Pastures overdrilled with annual clovers yielded 23 - 45 % more dry matter production than pastures grown without annual clovers. The study confirms the important role of subterranean clover in improving pasture production and liveweight gains of sheep in dryland cocksfoot and ryegrass pastures. Lowering stocking rate from 13. 9 to 8. 3 ewes/ha was a less effective method of increasing seed production of subterranean clover in dryland pastures although it did lead to increased liveweight gain per head...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen ruminally {{cannulated}} beef steers {{were used}} in a <b>pasture</b> supplementation <b>experiment</b> {{to determine the effects}} of frequency of energy supplementation on intake and digestion of tallgrass prairie forage during early to mid-summer. Steers grazed a common pasture and were assigned to the following treatments: no supplement (control); 4 lb rolled sorghum grain/head/day; 9. 3 lb grain/head/ 3 times weekly. Steers in the two supplemented groups consumed the same amount of sorghum grain/head/week. In general, supplementation was not harmful (P =. 17) to forage intake. However, providing supplement 3 times weekly tended (P =. 11) to depress forage intake compared with daily supplementation. Although supplementation tended (P =. 07) to cause selection of less fiber in the diet, total forage digestion tended (P<. 07) to be depressed by supplementation. However, total diet organic matter digestibility was not significantly altered by treatment, probably because of the impact of the highly digestible supplement. Based on trends in intake and grazed forage selection, achieving optimal benefit from supplementation of cattle grazing relatively high-quality forage appears more likely when its provided daily rather than 3 times weekly...|$|R

It was applied different doses of waste {{compared to the use}} of mineral fertilizers and organic mineral and evaluated the effect on soil parameters (pH, organic matter, phosphorus and potassium) and leaf of Brachiariadecumbens (crude protein, phosphorus and dry mass production). It was observed that application of organic waste did not increase the level of soil organic matter and pH in the surface layer, and the application of turkey litter caused acidification at depths of 0. 20 - 0. 40 m and 0. 40 - 0. 60 m. There was an increase in P and K in the soil with the application of poultry litter and swine manure. All organic wastes increased the productivity of dry matter and crude protein and phosphorus.

A phytosociological assessment of the weed community was carried {{out at the end}} of the coexistence periods, and weeds were eliminated from the appropriate treatment using herbicide. Key morphogenic parameters of the forages were assessed at the end of the experimental period and dry matter production was determined. Results indicated that the presence of weeds had negative impacts on the main morphogenic components, such as plant height, number of tillers and production of leaf and stem dry matter. The presence of weeds reduced productivity in Marandu, with 15 days competition being sufficient to reduce forage production by approximately 50 %, suggesting that weed control measures should be adopted within 15 days following emergence of seedlings of Marandu and weeds.

Intake, digestibility of nutritional fractions, and the metabolic profile, as determined from blood parameters, were analyzed for grazing cattle with a dietary supplement containing 0, 25, 50, and 75 % of palm kernel cake. Intake of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, nonfibrous carbohydrates, total carbohydrates, and total digestible nutrients within the supplement, as well as the intake of total crude protein, total ether extract, and total nonfibrous carbohydrates, were negatively influenced by level of Palm kernel cake supplementation. The digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, nonfibrous carbohydrate, and total carbohydrates was significantly reduced with an increased percentage of Palm kernel cake in the supplement. The concentration of blood glucose was not affected by the amount of Palm kernel cake (P> 0. 05). However, these averages of ureic nitrogen are still considered to be physiological norms.

Transformations and immobilisation/mineralization turnover of N are high due to short term ley conditions. When the management changes almost yearly, the soil N is in constant state of change and equilibrium is never achieved. Nitrogen is accumulated in soil during grass cover years and mineralized during the renewal year. Thus, N fertilization for newly sown sward and cover crop after pasture renewal is not needed.

40|$|Pasture land {{represents}} an important {{portion of the}} total land in southern Iowa. One opportunity for increasing resource productivity and farm incomes {{in this part of}} the state is to invest capital in <b>pasture</b> improvement. <b>Experiments</b> show that capital invested in pasture improvement and renovation, and the livestock to utilize the increased forage production, can greatly increase the value of products produced on land unadapted to continuous cropping; yields of forage and livestock products can be increased as much as threefold. However, the practices of improving and renovating pastures are proceeding at a slow rate. One reason suggested is capital limitations. Most farmers operate with limited funds. Accordingly, if they are to make greatest profits, they must use each dollar, acre and labor hour where it will bring the greatest return. The question is not so much whether pasture improvement and renovation is profitable; but whether it is more profitable than alternative uses of scarce capital and labor. For example, pasture improvement may cost $ 5 per year and return $ 8 In the same period. It is profitable in this sense: Each $ 1 In costs returns $ 1. 60 in sales. However, if the same $ 1 invested in fertilizer for crops or in hogs returns $ 1. 80, pasture improvement should not be included in the farming plan until these more profitable opportunities have been fully exploited. It should, of course, be included before other investments which return less than $ 1. 60...|$|R
