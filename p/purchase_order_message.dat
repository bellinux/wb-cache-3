40|$|This study {{concentrates}} {{on how well}} RosettaNet {{can be used to}} integrate a non-SAP partner and a SAP partner. Background information of SAP and RosettaNet is given, and possible mapping is discussed. An implementation prototype is also constructed, to test how the situation could be implemented in practice. It proves that the basic concept of the implementation is correct, although it lacks many of the qualities commonly associated with business integration systems. The message mapping and prototype implementation between the frameworks are restricted to <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> <b>messages.</b> The PIP used is PIP 3 A 4 Request <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> for both <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> request and confirmation. The IDoc message types used are ORDERS and ORDRSP, which correspond to the aforementioned PIP business messages. We try to generalize {{the results of the study}} also to other messages. The message types of both standards are well documented and understandable. There were no major differences at least in the case of <b>purchase</b> <b>order.</b> However, an IDoc contains much in-house data that a PIP cannot deliver, which the SAP system has t...|$|R

5000|$|Creating a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is {{typically}} {{the first step}} of the purchase to pay process in an ERP system. <b>Purchase</b> <b>orders</b> may require a SKU code. Within an ERP system, a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> can be created manually, and may require confirmation or changes via editing. Within an ERP system (such as in SAP), manually creating a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> within the system may look something like [...] "Logistics -> Materials Management -> <b>Purchasing</b> -> <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Order</b> -> Create" [...] and providing a Transaction Code. This document type will be chosen from the screen. A vendor code lookup may need to be selected for a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> steps, as well as things like organization group and company code.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this paper was done in CV. Rooesman, a small scale shoes and bag manufacturer company located in Yogyakarta Indonesia. Their strategy to response the demand is make-to-order. This company receives many <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from several countries such as Japan, South Korea, and USA. Each <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is unique for example in term of design, complexity of the production process and raw material needed. Currently CV. Rooesman has difficulty to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted. Ideally, all <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from the customers have to be accepted. However due to the some factors such as limitation of resources that the company have i. e. human resources (number of workers and skill of workers needed) and other factor such as characteristic of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> the company have to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted. It {{happened in the past}} that the company accepted the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> without considering those factors then the order was not be able to deliver on time {{and the quality of the}} products did not meet the expectation of the customer. As a result, the company paid the penalty and the products were rejected by the customer. The {{research in}} this paper therefore tries to model <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> selection problem using Analytic Network Process. There are four clusters considered in the model which are: Characteristic of the <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> (Design of the Product, Quantity Order, Characteristic of the Customer, and Expected Quality), Complexity of the Production Process (Number of Workers Needed, Ability to Make the Prototype, Manufacturing Lead Time, Skill of the Worker), Economical Value (Production Cost, Selling Price and Price of Raw Material), and Alternative <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> (<b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 1, <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 2, <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 3) ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{a typical}} <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> may not contain {{contract}} language (in fact most contain {{little more than}} a list of the goods or services the buyer desires to purchase, along with price, payment terms, and shipping instructions), the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is a specially regarded instrument regulated by the Uniform Commercial Code or other similar law which establishes a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> as a contract by its nature. Yet despite the nature of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> as a contract, it is common to accompany the acceptance of a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> with a legal document such as the terms & conditions of sale, which establish specific or additional legal conditions of the contract.|$|R

50|$|A master-detail {{relationship}} is a one-to-many type relationship. Examples of a master-detail relationship are: {{a set of}} <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> {{and a set of}} line items belonging to each <b>purchase</b> <b>order,</b> an expense report with a set of expense line items or a department with a list of employees belonging to it.

50|$|For example, {{consider}} a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> that moves through various departments for authorization and eventual <b>purchase.</b> The <b>order</b> may be moved from department to department for approval automatically. When all authorizations are obtained, the requester of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is notified {{and given the}} authorization. A workflow process may involve constant change and update. For example, the normal approver of <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> may be on vacation, in which case, the application will request approval from alternate approvers.|$|R
