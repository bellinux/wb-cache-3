5|$|At about 2:00p.m., the American {{military}} authorities, who {{had arrived}} in the city, ordered that the bodies be taken down and delivered to the city morgue for autopsies to be carried out.

5|$|Beato's <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Opium War are {{the first}} to {{document}} a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E
5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, {{and for a time}} in the 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic career is anchored to her studio in Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho, where she took <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. Perhaps her most famous work remains her documentary <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and in the same year ended her career as a photographer. Many of her Native American images are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution and National Archives.|$|E

5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|Documentary {{photography}} {{has also}} flourished outside the press. As an example, Jette Bang (1914–1964) {{was fascinated by}} Greenland and the Greenlanders.

5|$|In the 1970s, Jacob Holdt (b. 1947) spent {{a number}} of years in the United States where he photographed scenes of the {{socially}} disadvantaged across the country.
