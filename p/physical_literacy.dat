50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> has been {{developed}} over many years. It is seen, by {{a growing number of}} people, as the goal of the school subject, physical education. However, whilst this is extremely relevant, it is important to recognise that <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> is not restricted to the school years - it is relevant throughout the lifecourse. In this respect, six phases of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> have been identified: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood and older adulthood.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there have}} been a number of interpretations of the concept that have moved away from the central tenets of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy.</b> For example, in some {{instances}} <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> has been the name given to a programme of fundamental movement skills, implying that the concept is solely about the acquisition of physical competence. Other interpretations have focused on knowledge and understanding, particularly in the games context. Both these scenarios include elements of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy,</b> but do not represent the whole story.|$|E
50|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>literacy</b> is the {{mastering}} {{of fundamental}} movement skills and fundamental sport skills that permit {{a child to}} read their environment and make appropriate decisions, allowing them to move confidently and with control {{in a wide range}} of physical activity situations. It is the foundation of long-term participation and performance to the best of one’s ability. <b>Physical</b> <b>Literacy</b> is the cornerstone of both participation and excellence in physical activity and sport. Ideally, <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> is developed prior to the adolescent growth spurt.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a multi-method {{analysis}} of a recently emergent, though still understudied, trend: the use of exercise-themed video games (i. e., ‘exergames’) in retirement centres. The study in question specifically featured participant observation and interviews with residents and members of staff at retirement centres in Ontario, Canada. Data collection was aimed at understanding how games such as Wii Bowling are being put to use in retirement centre contexts {{and the implications of}} such activity. Findings on the one hand suggest that exergames are deemed valuable in the process of promoting both social engagement and physical activity. ‘Virtual’ bowling can bring people together in communal spaces while also ‘getting them up’ and active. On the other hand, however, exergaming presents challenges. For retirement centre residents, it engenders health risks while also demanding the deft synchronization of media and <b>physical</b> <b>literacies.</b> For activities coordinators and other members of staff responsible for residents' care, it means they too must stay abreast of the technology sector's latest innovations; they must develop media and <b>physical</b> <b>literacies</b> of their own. These findings are used as a platform for a broader discussion of aging, embodiment, and media in the paper's final section. Against the backdrop of existing conceptualizations of the third age, the use of exergames in retirement centres is deemed conducive not to independence and consumerism fully-fledged, but rather to the manifestation of ‘quasi-consumerism’ and ‘quasi-independence’ instead. Third age logic is thus both reinforced and subtly undermined...|$|R

50|$|Outside of school, {{children}} {{often fail to}} engage in physical activity {{due to lack of}} <b>physical</b> <b>literacy,</b> inadequate sleep, and the increasing attractiveness of rival pastimes such as video games. Also, in achievement-oriented populations such as those seen in China, there is an increased emphasis on academic results which also detracts from physical activity time.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Canadian children aged 5 to 17 years old (91%) {{do not meet}} the daily physical activity recommendations. Although Canadian physical education programs are improving significantly, with 61-80% of schools offering a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education classes per week in 2016, and participation levels in organized sport are on the rise, Canadian school programs are ineffective in encouraging healthy habits. In fact, most Canadian children (56%) lack <b>physical</b> <b>literacy.</b> Consequently, they face many issues related to lifestyle. These include sedentary behaviours such as increased screen time averaging 176 minutes a day from TVs and video games to the detriment of active play. There is also the inevitable decrease in active transportation, more sleep deprivation, and a poor quality of diet.|$|E
40|$|Publications of {{articles}} with <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> as a topic have increased dramatically {{since the beginning}} of 2000 s.

Furthermore ICSSPE Bulletin's special issue on <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> has been included in the overview. The findings have resulted in three key themes: assumptions of the concept <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> and its educative role, sports development and <b>physical</b> <b>literacy,</b> and assessment and <b>physical</b> <b>literacy.</b> Future studies are needed to examine if the advocated pedagogical strategies based on the concept <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> have led to a re-organized and revitalized school subject. There is also an existing critique towards making <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> an idealistic neutral concept or synonym with fundamental movement skills or sports talent identification. The role of higher education emerges as crucial for the next step of the development of the scientific framework as this involves how <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> will be socially configured, nurtured, and embodied in practice...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} examines an emergent, {{though to}} date understudied, trend in media culture: {{the promotion of}} video games as viable entertainment and fitness devices for older persons. This is a trend perhaps best represented in Nintendo’s recent enlistment of actress Helen Mirren – now aged 68 – in the marketing of the Nintendo ‘Wii Fit’ gaming console, though {{it is one that}} is shown thrown the selling of many other games for bodily and cognitive fitness as well. Video games like ‘Wii Bowling’ have also been incorporated into activity programming in retirement centres in recent years. The presentation is specifically aimed at explaining these developments. In doing so, it draws from a range of scholarly influences and from studies into both video game marketing campaigns and consumer experiences. In one sense, the ‘sudden’ presence of seniors in video game marketing is deemed a product of political economic forces: the intensely competitive gaming industry demands that companies secure new markets in order to survive financially. In another, closely related sense, this trend is attributed to the changing meanings that surround the ‘third age’ (i. e., post-retirement) in a time of population ageing. The presentation concludes with empirically-based reflections on the benefits and challenges accompanying the use of fitness-themed video games among older persons. A noteworthy challenge – and one peculiar to ‘newer’ media like the Wii – lies in the need for seniors and in some circumstances their caretakers to develop both digital and <b>physical</b> <b>literacies</b> at one and the same time...|$|R

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>literacy</b> is {{developing}} as a contested concept with definitional blurring across international contexts, confusing both practitioners and researchers. This paper serves the dual purpose of reporting on an interrogation of concepts associated with <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> {{in academic writing}} and exploring {{the use of a}} text mining data analysis tool. The Leximancer text mining software was applied to 49 research papers relating to <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> from 2001 – 2016, sourced from academic repositories and scholarly search engines. The findings from the text mining analysis revealed that the concept of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> is used in a variety of contexts, specifically in connection with ‘education’, ‘activity’, ‘fitness’, ‘health’, ‘concept’, ‘competence’, ‘understanding’, ‘roles’, ‘curriculum’ and ‘assessment’. The concept with the most relevance connected to <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> is ‘education’, the very term that is commonly being replaced by ‘literacy’. A number of concepts were identified from the text mining analysis that were not explicitly mentioned within the definitions of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy,</b> including educational components such as ‘curriculum’, ‘teaching’ and ‘assessment’. It was also revealed that many of the strongest relational concepts from the text mining of the <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> literature were of a physical domain, with less relevance and connection to concepts of cognitive, social and emotional domains. The study fills an important gap in the literature by showing that while a multiplicity of conceptions of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> exists, the concept gives dominance to the physical domain and the marginalisation of cognitive and affective domains in various constructions of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>literacy</b> is {{a concept}} that is gaining greater {{acceptance}} around the world with the United Nations Educational, Cultural, and Scientific Organization (2013) recognizing it as one of several central tenets in a quality physical education framework. However, previous attempts to understand progression in <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> learning have been limited to preexisting knowledge and psychosocial and physical assessment instruments and have been proved to be less than complete in the understanding of this construct. The aim of this article was to present a unique conceptual model of observed <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> and establish an assessment rubric on which future assessment protocols may be based. Seminal definitions of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy</b> and numerous models of physical education instruction were reviewed to establish common core elements of <b>physical</b> <b>literacy.</b> These core elements were then viewed through a Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy lens to establish an assessment rubric that may be applied to extend understanding of student learning within this construct.
