50|$|Karnal bunt attacks durum wheat, rye, and triticale, {{a hybrid}} of wheat and rye. Despite its {{preference}} for a common crop, Karnal bunt can be extremely difficult to diagnose {{in the field for}} many reasons. First, not all kernels on a plant head will be infected, and thus infected plants are not as readily identifiable. This distribution is the reason for Karnal bunt's being referred to as <b>partial</b> <b>bunt.</b> Another factor which makes Karnal bunt difficult to readily diagnose in the field is the fact that most infected kernels do not show symptoms prior to maturity.|$|E
50|$|Karnal bunt (also {{known as}} <b>partial</b> <b>bunt)</b> is a fungal disease of wheat, durum wheat, and triticale. The smut fungus Tilletia indica, a basidiomycete, invades the kernels and obtains {{nutrients}} from the endosperm, leaving behind waste products with a disagreeable odor that makes bunted kernels too unpalatable {{for use in}} flour or pasta. While Karnal bunt generally {{does not lead to}} devastating crop losses, {{it has the potential to}} dramatically decrease yield and poses additional economic concerns through quarantines which limit the export of suspected infectious wheat products from certain areas, including the U.S. Several chemical control methods exist for Karnal bunt of wheat, but much work remains to be done in identifying resistant host varieties.|$|E
40|$|Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{the main}} staple food crop and major source of {{nutrition}} {{for the people of}} Pakistan. Many factors contribute to low yield in Pakistan, diseases being one of them. Karnal bunt (<b>partial</b> <b>bunt)</b> of wheat caused by Tilletia indica (Mitra) Mundkur, causes considerable losses in the yield of wheat. The disease not only reduces the weight of grains, but also deteriorates its quality and makes it unacceptable for human and animal consumption. The pathogen infects the ovaries in the emerging wheat heads and converts the grains partially or completely into dark colored powdery masses of teliospores. The diseased fields emit a foul smell like that of rotten fish due to production of trimethylamine. Karnal bunt can reduce wheat yields. Karnal bunt differs from other diseases of wheat in that the pathogen infects plants during anthesis and it sporulates on the same generation of the host which it infects. Neither all spikes of plant nor all grains in spike are affected by the disease and usually a few irregularly distributed kernels are bunted. Its spores remain viable in soil for a long period. Teliospores are very resistant to adverse environmental conditions. Although many control strategies have been suggested for the management of karnal bunt disease and the strategies include seed treatment with hot water and solar energy, seed treatment with fungicides and soil drenching with fungicides, however, the results were not convincing. The cheapest and the most feasible method of Karnal bunt control is the use of host resistance and breeding for varieties resistant to karnal bunt disease. Control of karnal bunt has now become a major concern in Pakistan due to scarcity or non-availability of resistance in commercial wheat varieties unde...|$|E
40|$|Wheat {{and rice}} fields of Pakistan were {{extensively}} surveyed during 1986 - 89 for important seed-borne diseases. Of the major seed-borne diseases, {{loose smut of wheat}} (Ustilago tritic) and flag smut of wheat (Urocystis tritic) were widely prevalent {{in all the}} four provinces of Pakistan; <b>partial</b> <b>bunt</b> or karnal bunt (Neovossia indica) in the central, northern Punjab and NWFP whereas complete bunt or stinking smut (Ti 11 etia foetida) was confined in the uplands of Balochistan and hilly areas of Punjab and NWFP. In the non-irrigated areas Fusarium spp., and in irrigated areas Alternaria sp., and Drechs 1 era spp., were associated with seed rot, foot rot and seedling blight of wheat. Of the seed-borne diseases of rice, blast disease of rice (Pyricu 1 aria oryzae) was a major disease in the central the arts of Punjab and a minor disease in Sindh, brown leaf spot of rice (Drechs 1 era oryzae) and kernel bunt of rice and barc 1 ayana) were prevalent in all the rice growing areas of Pakistan Using standard blotter, agar plate and deep freezing methods, 17 genera and 40 species of fungi Were isolated and identified from 450 seed samples of wheat and 26 genera and 54 species of fungi from 200 seed samples of rice. The occurrence 01 23 species of fungi viz., A 1 ternariagodetide A. raphani, Aspergillus candidus 6 A. sulphureus, A. tamarii, A. terreus, Cephalosporium graminearum, Chaetomium crispatum. c. funicola, Cladosporium spherospermum, Curvularia clavata, c. robusta, Drechslera rostrata, Epicoccum purpurascens, Fusarium equiseti F. graminearum, F. nivale, Melanospora zamiae, Hemnoniella echinata, Myrothecoum roridum, Pencillium purpurogenum, Sporotrichum purinosporum and Stachybotrys atra on wheat seeds and 31 species of fungi viz., Alternaria lonqipes, A. raphani, Aspergillus candidus, A. sulphureus, R. terreus, Botrytis atra, Cephaliophora irregularis, Chlalaropsis thielavioides, Curvularia clavata, c. eragrdstidis, C. in termedia, C. penniseti, C. tuberculata, Drechslera australiensis, D. biseptata,D. ha I odes,D. rostrata, D. specifera, Fusarium avenaceum, F nivale F. semitectum, Helicodendron paradoxum, Memnoniella ecninata, Myrothecium roridum, Penicillium purpurogenum, Pithomyces graminicola, Stachybotrys atra, S. dichora, Staphylotrichum cocosporum, Tetraploa ellisii and Trichothecium rosem On rice seeds are being reported for the first time from Pakistan. Of the different isolation techniques used, blotter method proved better for quantitative analysis and agar plate method for qualitative analysis of seed-borne fungi. Alternaria spp., and Fusarium spp., were conveniently isolated by blotter method and species of Curvularia and Drechslera by agar plate method. The deep freezing method was found more effective for the isolation of deep seated seed-borne fungi like Drechslera oryzae, Gerlachia aryzae, Fusarium moniliforme, Trichoconis padwickii and Drechslera soroliniana...|$|E
