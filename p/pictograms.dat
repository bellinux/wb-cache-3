5|$|The {{design of}} the <b>pictograms</b> was {{inspired}} by the museum’s architecture, and particularly by the abstract shapes created by the rain of light filtering through the gigantic dome's mashrabiyas. Each pictogram is a combination of several of these shapes, creating silhouettes and objects.|$|E
5|$|Figeac honors {{him with}} La place des Écritures, a monumental {{reproduction}} of the Rosetta Stone by American artist Joseph Kosuth (pictured to the right). And a museum devoted to Jean-François Champollion was created in his birthplace at Figeac in Lot. It was inaugurated on 19 December 1986 {{in the presence of}} President François Mitterrand and Jean Leclant, Permanent Secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions and Letters. After two years of building work and extension, the museum re-opened in 2007. Besides Champollion's life and discoveries, the museum also recounts the history of writing. The whole façade is covered in <b>pictograms,</b> from the original ideograms of the whole world.|$|E
5|$|The anime's {{first season}} focuses on Tenma, Harima, and Karasuma, and Harima's {{relationships}} with other females including Sawachika and Yakumo. Its second season involves more of the secondary cast. The Extra Class OVAs are compiled from various first season storylines. Both the Third Semester synopses and episodes return to the main cast. The anime's structure {{has been compared to}} Azumanga Daioh, with thematic influences from Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu. In places it makes deliberate use of unconventional nomenclature; the title of episode25 of season one is a set of <b>pictograms,</b> while episode26's title has 187 characters in the Japanese original. In season two, the Japanese title for episode26 consists of just a period.|$|E
40|$|Class of 2011 AbstractOBJECTIVES: To {{design and}} {{evaluate}} a dosing schedule <b>pictogram</b> in an elderly population. To identify possible reasons for misunderstanding of a dosing schedule <b>pictogram</b> and, if appropriate, redesign the <b>pictogram</b> to reflect reasons for misunderstanding. METHODS: Through a modified focus group analysis involving {{residents of a}} retirement community in Tucson, Arizona, the understandability of a morning-noon-night color <b>pictogram</b> was assessed. Residents’ interpretation of the <b>pictogram</b> as correct or incorrect was assessed using a decision-tree analysis. The percentage of correct responses was calculated and compared to established <b>pictogram</b> criteria for acceptability. Lastly, potential reasons for misunderstanding were assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen residents, six males and seven females, participated in the study. The rate of correct interpretation was 84. 6...|$|R
50|$|Most exit {{signs in}} the world, except in {{countries}} such as the US, Australia, Hong Kong, Philippines, and Singapore are of <b>pictogram</b> type. Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong have made changes to their respective life safety codes to encourage <b>pictogram</b> use. In the US, New York City has endorsed a new code requiring high rises to have glow-in-the-dark exit signs with an ISO-standard <b>pictogram.</b> In Thailand, most exit signs use a running man <b>pictogram</b> (ISO).|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{designed}} {{this study to}} assess the validity and reliability of <b>pictogram</b> for estimating body mass index (BMI). Study Design and Setting: Participants of Golestan cohort study during 2000 - 2004 were recruited in this study. Demographic and anthropometric information (weight, height, and BMI) were collected on all participants. A set of drawings (<b>pictogram)</b> ranging from very lean to obese {{were used to assess}} the individual's perception of their body size. Sensitivity and specificity of each <b>pictogram</b> score were calculated and cutoff points were determined using sensitivity/specificity plots. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to assess the validity of <b>pictogram</b> scores. Results: Of the 15, 437 subjects enrolled in the study, 6, 574 (42. 6) were males and 8, 863 (57. 4) were females. Their mean±standard deviation age was 52. 58 ± 9. 28 years. <b>Pictogram</b> scores 1, 2, and 3 were assigned to normal participants; <b>pictogram</b> score 4 was selected by overweight subjects, and finally, <b>pictogram</b> scores equal or higher than 5 were selected by obese ones (area under curve: 0. 83 - 0. 85). Conclusion: According to our results, <b>pictogram</b> is a valid measure for discriminating obese or overweight from normal individuals, and for distinguishing obese from overweight or normal individuals. So it can be concluded that body image <b>pictogram</b> is valid for discriminating normal and obese individuals. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|Aztec codices (singular codex) are {{books written}} by pre-Columbian and colonial-era Aztecs. These codices provide {{some of the}} best primary sources for Aztec culture. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives. The colonial era codices contain not only Aztec <b>pictograms,</b> but also Classical Nahuatl (in the Latin alphabet), Spanish, and {{occasionally}} Latin.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{characters}} represent {{words of}} the language using several strategies. A few characters, {{including some of the}} most commonly used, were originally <b>pictograms,</b> which depicted the objects denoted, or ideograms, in which meaning was expressed iconically. The vast majority were written using the rebus principle, in which a character for a similarly sounding word was either simply borrowed or (more commonly) extended with a disambiguating semantic marker to form a phono-semantic compound character.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} improve {{legibility}} or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using <b>pictograms</b> to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is Lance Wyman's early plans for the Mexico City Metro, on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the Washington Metro, though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are Fukuoka, Guadalajara and Monterrey.|$|E

25|$|Cuneiform {{script is}} one of the {{earliest}} systems of writing distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. Emerging in Sumer c. 3500 BC, cuneiform writing began as a system of <b>pictograms.</b> Around 3000 BC, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite languages.|$|E
25|$|The tablets are {{generally}} {{believed to have}} belonged to the Vinča-Turdaș culture, which was originally thought to have originated around 2700 BC by Serbian and Romanian archaeologists. Vlassa interpreted the Tărtăria tablets as a hunting scene {{and the other two}} with signs as a kind of primitive writing similar to the early <b>pictograms</b> of the Sumerians. The discovery caused great interest in the archeological world as it predated the first Minoan writing, the oldest known writing in Europe.|$|E
25|$|According to Christoph Baumer, the {{earliest}} discoveries of wheels in Mesopotamia {{come from the}} first half of the third millennium BCE – more than half a millennium later than the first finds from the Kuban region. At the same time, in Mesopotamia, some intriguing early <b>pictograms</b> of a sled that rests on wooden rollers or wheels have been found. They date from about the same time as the early wheel discoveries in Europe and may indicate knowledge of the wheel.|$|E

We have evaluated patients’ comprehension, change in driving frequency {{and the perceived}} usefulness, information, comprehensibility, and simplicity of this <b>pictogram</b> on 1385 Spaniards users of the National Health Service (pharmacies, primary care and hospital centres). Most, 85. 7 %, correctly related the symbol with the possible effects of the medicine on driving and the 83. 9 % of the drivers would reduce {{the frequency with which}} they drive when prescribed a medicine with such <b>pictogram.</b> The <b>pictogram</b> was found, in a 10 - point Likert, useful (8. 3 ± 1. 7), informative (7. 7 ± 1. 9), comprehensible (7. 8 ± 1. 9) and simple (7. 8 ± 1. 9). The Spanish <b>pictogram</b> on {{medicines and}} driving is understood by the great majority of those interviewed; is well considered by the users of the National Health Service; and offers good prospects for reinforce the awareness of health care professionals and patients on the effects of medicines on driving...|$|R

25|$|The Jewish {{outreach}} group Aish-HaTorah employs Bible Codes {{in their}} Discovery Seminars to persuade secular Jews of the divinity of the Torah, {{and to encourage}} them to trust in its traditional Orthodox teachings. Use of Bible code techniques also spread into certain Christian circles, especially in the United States. The main early proponents were Yakov Rambsel, who is a Messianic Jew, and Grant Jeffrey. Another Bible code technique was developed in 1997 by Dean Coombs (also Christian). Various <b>pictograms</b> are claimed to be formed by words and sentences using ELS.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{official}} {{standard in the}} United States for the color of fire extinguishers, though they are typically red, except for class D extinguishers which are usually yellow, water and Class K wet chemical extinguishers which are usually silver, and water mist extinguishers which are usually white. Extinguishers are marked with <b>pictograms</b> depicting the types of fires that the extinguisher is approved to fight. In the past, extinguishers were marked with colored geometric symbols, and some extinguishers still use both symbols. The types of fires and additional standards are described in NFPA 10: Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers, 2013 edition.|$|E
25|$|Writing {{systems were}} preceded by proto-writing, which used <b>pictograms,</b> ideograms and other {{mnemonic}} symbols. Proto-writing lacked {{the ability to}} capture and express {{a full range of}} thoughts and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates {{back to the beginning of}} the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic Era of the late 4th millennium BC, enabled the accurate durable recording of human history in a manner that was not prone to the same types of error to which oral history is vulnerable. Soon after, writing provided a reliable form of long distance communication. With the advent of publishing, it provided the medium for an early form of mass communication.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Tărtăria tablets in Romania by Nicolae Vlassa in 1961 reignited the debate. Vlassa believed the inscriptions to be <b>pictograms</b> and other items found {{at the same place}} were subsequently carbon-dated to before 4000 BC (the tablets themselves cannot be dated by physical or chemical methods), thirteen hundred years earlier than the date he expected, and earlier even than the writing systems of the Sumerians and Minoans. However, the authenticity of these tablets is disputed. To date, more than a thousand fragments with similar inscriptions have been found on various archaeological sites throughout south-eastern Europe, notably in Greece (Dispilio Tablet), Bulgaria, Romania, eastern Hungary, Moldova, and southern Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|During the {{preceding}} Uruk period, {{there was a}} wide variety in scenes engraved on cylinder seals. This variety disappeared {{at the start of}} the third millennium, to be replaced by an almost exclusive focus on mythological and cultural scenes in Lower Mesopotamia and the Diyala region. During the ED I period, seal designs included geometric motifs and stylized <b>pictograms.</b> Later on, combat scenes between real and mythological animals became the dominant theme, together with scenes of heroes fighting animals. Their exact meaning is unclear. Common mythological creatures include anthropomorphic bulls and scorpion-men. Real creatures include lions and eagles. Some anthropomorphic creatures are probably deities, as they wear a horned tiara, which was a symbol of divinity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pictograms</b> or glyphs of {{this writing}} system were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were {{considered}} mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events. Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more {{is known about the}} Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures. Important Aztec codices include the Borgia Group of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the Codex Borbonicus, Codex Mendoza, and the late Florentine Codex, which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost.|$|E
