40|$|Abstract. 3 -D {{stereoscopic}} PIV {{is capable}} of measuring 3 -dimensional velocity components. It involves a very sophisticated routine during setup, calibration, measurement and data processing phases. This paper aims to verify the 3 -D stereoscopic PIV measurement procedures and {{to prove that the}} flow entering the diffuser is a fully developed flow. A diffuser inlet of rectangular cross-section, 130 mm x 50 mm is presently considered. For verification, the velocities from PIV are compared with the velocities from <b>pitot</b> <b>static</b> probe and theory. The mean velocity obtained using <b>pitot</b> <b>static</b> probe is 2. 44 m/s, whereas using PIV is 2. 46 m/s. It thus gives the discrepancy of 0. 8 %. There is also a good agreement between the mean velocity measured by PIV and theoretical value with the discrepancy of 1. 2 %. This minor discrepancy is mainly due to uncertainties in the experiments such as imperfect matching of coordinates between the probe and laser sheet, unsteadiness of flow, variation in density and less precision in calibration. Basically, the operating procedures of 3 -D stereoscopic PIV have successfully been verified. Nevertheless, the flow entering diffuser is not perfectly developed due to the imperfect joining duct and the abrupt change of inlet cross-section introduced. Therefore, improvement to the existing rig is proposed by means of installing settling chamber with multiple screens arrangement and contraction cone...|$|R

A laboratory setup with a cyclic flow of water was used. The flow cross section was divided into ten equal sections with nine verticals in between. <b>Pitot</b> <b>static</b> tube was used to measure static and stagnation pressure heads at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 point on the verticals. These measurements were conducted at a depth corresponding to 0. 1 h, 0. 2 h, 0. 4 h, 0. 6 h 0. 8 h and 0. 9 h from the free surface of the water in the canal. The different between stagnation head and static head was used to compute the local instantaneous velocity at each measured point. Three different discharges ware used 3. 5, 9. 5, and 11. 4 l/s. The results of the study reaffirms the non equal to unity of energy and momentum correction factors and that for regular canal the value of α range from 1. 10 to 1. 20 and β from 1. 03 to 1. 07. It is recommended that the energy and momentum correction factors be taken into consideration even for simple hydraulic analysis in open channel flow.
