Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small gigs in the American South. He later {{performed at the}} popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Sings Soul Ballads was {{released}} on March 1965, with four of the songs from the album chosen to be released as singles. Unlike Redding's first studio album, <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart, the album {{was released}} both on Atlantic's subsidiary Atco Records and Stax's Volt Records. A remastered CD and CS version was released by Atco on the Elektra label in 1991. On March 8, 2002, 4 Men With Beards released a vinyl version. Rhino/Atlantic issued a digital download release in the MP3 format on July 29, 2008.|$|E
500|$|... "These Arms of Mine" [...] {{and other}} {{songs from the}} 1962–1963 {{sessions}} were included on Redding's debut album, <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart. [...] "That's What My Heart Needs" [...] and [...] "Mary's Little Lamb" [...] were recorded in June 1963. The latter is the only Redding track with both background singing and brass. It became his worst-selling single. The title track, recorded in September 1963, sparked copyright issues, as it sounded like Irma Thomas's [...] "Ruler of My Heart". Despite this, <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart was released on January 1, 1964, and peaked at number 20 on the R chart and at number 85 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{freedom of}} speech was {{guaranteed}} by the 1997 constitution, it was limited by several laws. The king may not be spoken ill of and lèse majesté laws are enforced. In 1986, Deputy Interior Minister Veera Musikapong was convicted, imprisoned, and banned from politics for a campaign speech in which he noted {{that if he were}} born the crown prince, he [...] "would be drinking whiskey instead of standing here getting <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> knees." ...|$|R
500|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart {{includes}} {{songs from}} Redding's 1962–1963 sessions. Stewart signed Redding for Stax and released Redding's debut single, [...] "These Arms of Mine", with [...] "Hey Hey Baby" [...] on the B-side. [...] "These Arms of Mine" [...] {{was released by}} Volt, a subsidiary of Stax, in October 1962, and charted in March the following year. It {{was one of his}} most successful songs, selling more than 800,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|Stax Records {{president}} Jim Stewart had released Otis Redding's [...] "These Arms of Mine" [...] {{after hearing}} him sing it at an audition in 1962; {{and when it}} charted, he signed Redding to Stax. [...] Following the moderately successful <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart and The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads, both of which performed well in the newly established Billboard R LP chart {{but not in the}} Billboard 200, preparations for the third studio album followed soon after. The album would be Redding's third studio album and second on Stax's sister label Volt.|$|E

Unfortunately in later life he suffered badly from arthritis. Sadly he reflected: [...] "The conditions we played in were terrible at times. You couldn't get a proper bath and often in cold water. There are times when I wished I had never played the game".|$|R
5000|$|I {{remember}} a great pain {{caused by the}} weight of my body. <b>My</b> spirits were <b>in</b> a great uproar, pushing upwards; when they got into my head I saw a great blaze of glaring light that seemed to go out of <b>my</b> head <b>in</b> a flash. Then the pain went. When I was cut down I got such pins-and-needles <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head that I could have hanged the people who set me free.|$|R

500|$|The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads, simply {{referred}} to as Soul Ballads or Sings Soul Ballads, is the second studio album by American soul singer-songwriter Otis Redding, released in 1965. The album {{was one of the}} first issued by Volt Records, a sub-label [...] of Stax Records, and Redding's first on the new label. [...] Like Redding's debut <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart, Soul Ballads features both soul classics and originals written by Redding and other Stax Records recording artists. The recording sessions took place at the Stax studios in Memphis. The album features a stereo mixer made by engineer Tom Dowd, replacing the early mono mixer.|$|E
500|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart {{received}} positive critical reception. Bruce Eder of Allmusic {{gave the}} album 4 out of 5 stars, reckoning that the album [...] "was practically {{a road map}} to Mick Jagger {{and any number of}} other would-be white soul shouters in the UK", and finding elements of hard rock in [...] "Hey Hey Baby". He praised Redding's version of [...] "You Send Me", considering it [...] "the least stylized of any of his renditions of [...] Cooke's songs", but criticized Redding's restraint, compared to future recordings, and the [...] "somewhat less than memorable" [...] writing, except on [...] "Security", [...] "These Arms of Mine" [...] and [...] "That's What My Heart Needs". The reviewer concluded by saying [...] "Redding exudes astonishing power, energy and boldness".|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E
60|$|But {{a little}} {{attention}} {{will show that}} this state of consciousness is accompanied by another, which can by no effort be got rid of. I not only have the feeling, but the feeling is localized. I am just as certain that the <b>pain</b> is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> finger, as I am that I have it at all.

2500|$|In 2005, Watson began having headaches, {{which he}} {{described}} as [...] "like a knife being pressed into the bridge of my nose". He consulted a specialist, who told him {{there was nothing to}} worry about as he was suffering from stress and should find ways of relaxing. When his peripheral vision began to be affected in late 2006, he visited another specialist, who also said he was suffering from stress. Watson told him, [...] "The only thing that's stressing me is this <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Miniature Killer was {{discovered}} to be Natalie Davis, Grissom {{was the first}} to talk to her in the interrogation room after Brass suggested dripping bleach on himself until she spoke. Grissom went in alone, and attempted to get her to tell him where Sara was by complimenting her work and asking what she thought of his miniature. When Sara's name was brought up following her kidnapping, Natalie became very angry, to the point that she had a hallucination of her slitting Grissom's throat with a razor, while she was actually falling into an unresponsive state in which she sang [...] "I've Got a <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Sawdust" [...] to herself, leaving Sara's whereabouts unknown.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent. At that moment, I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E
5000|$|... 8 May 1866 - I was awfully {{bad when}} I {{got up in}} the morning, {{suffering}} chiefly from fearful shooting pains down the right side of my head. We luckily had a fair wind up the river. I laid on and under blankets {{at the bottom of the}} boat. The <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head came so quick and sharp sometimes as to take away my breath, and for the life of me I could no help crying out. I clenched my teeth and did all I could but had no power to help it.|$|R
60|$|The bath {{was a great}} comfort. For I {{began to}} be {{sensible}} of acute <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> limbs from lying out in the fields, and was now so tired and low that I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together. When I had bathed, they (I mean my aunt and Janet) enrobed me in a shirt {{and a pair of}} trousers belonging to Mr. Dick, and tied me up in two or three great shawls. What sort of bundle I looked like, I don't know, but I felt a very hot one. Feeling also very faint and drowsy, I soon lay down on the sofa again and fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, if these sharp pains be excepted, I felt quite well. My {{appetite}} {{was as good}} as it is now, and I worked as cheerfully and certainly harder. To some slight extent, I believe, I experienced the same <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> boyhood, before I smoked, and I am not an absolute stranger to them yet. They were most frequent <b>in</b> <b>my</b> smoking days, but I have no other reason for charging them to tobacco. Possibly a doctor who was himself a smoker would have pooh-poohed them. Nevertheless, I have lighted my pipe, and then, as I may say, hearkened for them. At the first intimation that they were coming I laid the pipe down and ceased to smoke--until they had passed.|$|R
2500|$|Lacking {{an offer}} for a {{competitive}} drive in 1980, Regazzoni re-joined Ensign. His season {{came to an}} abrupt end only four races into the year. He crashed during the 1980 United States Grand Prix West, held at Long Beach, when the brake pedal of his Ensign failed {{at the end of a}} long, high-speed straight travelling at approximately 280km/h. Ricardo Zunino's retired Brabham was parked in the escape road. Regazzoni later recalled, [...] "I hit Zunino's car, then bounced into the barrier. For about 10 minutes I lost consciousness. Then I remember terrible <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hips...". The crash left Regazzoni paralyzed from the waist down, ending his competitive career. On recovery, Regazzoni sued the race organisers, claiming their safety procedures were sub-standard. [...] The race organisers won the case.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|The Cilician Catastrophe {{received}} wide acclaim and {{is considered}} an important study of the events in Adana. The Catholicos of Cilicia Sahak II praised Terzian by stating that he [...] "has created an indelible impression upon everyone as a serious and trustworthy chronicler. It is a laborious, inquisitive, vivid picture of the Great Calamity, brought to white light from under the ruins and ashes by a native son of Cilicia, which will remain an everlasting stain upon the glorified civilization and unquenchable humanism of the twentieth century." [...] Archbishop Yeghishe Tourian {{wrote in a letter}} to Terzian, [...] "I have read your Giligio Aghedu [...] with great <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart. It is not a red thread that runs through the white pages of your book, but a wide, black band that stands out defiantly against the bloody pages." [...] Malachia Ormanian, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, described the narrative as [...] "the most complete and perfect work" [...] on the events in Adana.|$|E
