5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold {{than of the}} round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E

500|$|Robert Zajonc, {{a social}} psychologist, {{published}} research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of words (e.g. [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off"): in {{the overwhelming majority}} of trials the preferred word was also the most common. Zajonc also tested preferences for nonsense words and found that <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> them the more they heard them. He interpreted these results as evidence that mere repeated exposure to a stimulus is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.|$|E

500|$|Minogue thought <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> Charlene {{because she}} was portrayed as an average Australian teenager, {{experiencing}} a difficult relationship with her mother. She continued, [...] "She {{is a bit of}} a rebel and they probably relate to that, and while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often said what she thought, but joked that if she were in trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, she would probably get [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E

They also expressed preference in going on tour and releasing an album than having a [...] "throw-away hit" [...] on the charts." [...] To NME, Buchanan reiterated those sentiments and denied rumours floating {{at the time that}} speculated that the group had been dropped by Polydor.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the debut}} show were mixed.

Of the initial ratings, Johns said in a press statement, [...] "We’re humbled by the support for our show... Our aim was to produce a great fun footy show {{for the whole family}} and we’re glad <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> it." [...] Reporters Amanda Meade from The Australian and Michael Idato from The Sydney Morning Herald suggested after the first episode that the earlier timeslot gives The Matty Johns Show a ratings advantage over The Footy Show.

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in his {{volume on}} American coinage, {{pointed out that}} some <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> the Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar as it depicted historic figures who affected the course of American history, rather than a bust intended to be Liberty, and that Barber's coin presaged the 1909 Lincoln cent and the 1932 Washington quarter. Nevertheless, Vermeule deprecated the piece, {{as well as the}} earlier American gold commemorative, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar. [...] "The lack of spark in these coins, as in so many designs by Barber or Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) Morgan, {{stems from the fact that}} the faces, hair and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even." [...] According to Vermeule, when the two engravers collaborated on a design, such as the 1916 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, [...] "the results were almost oppressive".|$|E

Saturday Morning Fever praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough {{to be part of the}} action. He considered Jessie [...] "cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action." [...] He did not enjoy the [...] "toned down" [...] portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a [...] "man of action, not thought—though perfectly capable of deep thought", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.|$|E

500|$|Chandler's {{strategy}} in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one. He claimed Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $20,000 rug in his office. (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire {{first floor of the}} capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said [...] "didn't hurt anybody, and <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> to hear it".) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone [...] "clear to Africa" [...] to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.|$|E

The game was extremely popular in Japan and became {{the first in a series}} that in 2016 includes eleven games with several spin-off series and stand-alone titles. More than 2million copies were sold of the Japanese version. The Dragon QuestI&II remake for the SNES yielded 1.2million copies sold in Japan. The 1989 [...] "All Soft Catalog" [...] issue of Famicom Tsūshin (now Famitsu) included Dragon Quest in its list of the best games of all time, receiving the Best RPG and Best Character Design awards, but losing to Dragon Quest III for the overall Grand Prize for best game of all time.|$|E
500|$|One reader was Sam Simon, a {{producer}} of the animated sitcom The Simpsons. He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded {{the development of the}} series. Meyer turned down the job initially, but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989, which he accepted. Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played {{an active role in the}} show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the [...] "rewrite room", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes. A. O. Scott described him as the [...] "guru" [...] of the room. In the room, according to Mike Reiss, writers would [...] "involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own". By 1995, Meyer became tired of the show's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script. He soon returned, however, as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer. In 2004 he noted: [...] "It's hard to leave The Simpsons. Every once in a while I get romantic notions that I should be doing something much more subterranean. Something like Army Man, or maybe guerrilla filmmaking." [...] He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up. He left the show in 2006, and received his final credits in season 17. Meyer returned to co-write the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, which he later had mixed feelings about: [...] "We worked so hard, and <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> it, but it still feels slapdash to me.” ...|$|E
