40|$|The West {{has lost}} up to 60 % of its {{historic}} aspen stands {{over the last}} century, probably {{as a result of}} the successional tendency of aspen to be replaced by <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> in the absence of periodic fires.

30|$|Classification {{results may}} be {{improved}} using hyperspectral data with {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) data (Alonzo et al. 2014). For the temperate and sub-tropical (Hainzel and Koch 2012; Dalponte et al. 2008; Caiyun and Fang 2012) zones, the accuracies were over 80 %. Passive optical systems, particularly hyperspectral ones, generally showed higher potential for tree species classification than active synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or LIDAR sensor systems. However, LIDAR data have proven suitable for regions with a low number of species (Fassnacht et al. 2016). Forest stands classified with the highest accuracy in the European temperate zone include mostly homogenous ones, dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.). Of the broadleaved species, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and oak (Quercus spp. L.) are classified with the highest accuracy, but these classifications have lower accuracies than those <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> (Wietecha et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Microsatellites or SSR (simple {{sequence}} repeats) {{are usually}} single locus, highly polymorphic and robust markers. Microsatellites are increasingly the marker {{of choice for}} genome analysis, mapping and diversity studies in plants (Gupta et al. 1996, Westman and Kresovicch 1997) and forest trees (for example Bradshaw et al. 1994, Brondani et al. 1998, Devey et al. 1996). The isolation and development of microsatellite markers, however, is often costly and problematic, especially in organisms with large genomes (Fisher and Bachmann 1998), such as conifers. For example, from our own experience, enriched microsatellite libraries for seven angiosperms (Eucalyptus pilularus, E. globulus, E. grandis, E. cloeziana, Grevillia robusta, Corymbia variegata, Toona ciliata) and three gymnosperm (Araucaria cunninghamii, Pinus elliottii, P. caribaea), using the method of Edwards et al. 1996, yielded enrichment of up to 50 % in the angiosperm species but below 10 % for all the gymnosperm species.

Chi-square test indicated that in each of studied subpopulations frequencies of alleles at some loci (2 - 5) differed significantly from frequencies expected for a homogeneous population. Heterozygosity values and also a genotypic polymorphism in studied population confirmed the existence of large genetic variation. Wright's fixation indices (F) showed some excess of homozygotes in majority studied groups of individuals, notably higher in some subpopulations. Gene diversity coefficient for 8 subpopulations was high (G ST = 9. 4 %). However, when MDH C locus was excluded from the calculation, its value decreased to 2. 8 %.

40|$|The {{storm of}} 31 st January 1953 caused the wind-throw of over 45 million cubic feet in {{forests in the}} {{north-east}} of Scotland, mainly <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>species.</b> Some general features of the wind climate {{of the country are}} discussed and it appears that, although gale risk is a serious factor in forestry in the region, very few gales during the last 250 years have attained a violence compar-able with the recent storm. The local distribution of extreme gusts modified by topographical features is considered to be the principal cause of the varying degree of damage. There was a marked correlation between height of the trees and wind-throw; few stands under 40 feet in height have been damaged. Different species have also reacted differently and this is discussed. Of the edaphic factors the effect of compacted soil horizons on depth of rooting has clearly been important. Finally the influence of layout and tending are discussed, and it is concluded that wind-resistant margins are important in the prevention of gale damage. In the less-extreme cases of damage, the effect of different factors influencing gale damage accords with previous European experience which is reviewed...|$|R

40|$|Experiments of culturing the {{immature}} isolated embryos and megagamethophytes <b>of</b> Siberian <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> {{were carried}} out on different modified media: ½ LV medium for Pinus sibirica and Pinus pumila, MSG and AI media (patent № 2431651) for Larix sibirica and Larix gmelinii, DCR medium for Picea ajanensis. For induction of embryogenic callus every species needs the optimized medium supplemented with L-glutamine, casein hydrolysate, ascorbic acid and hormones with different concentrations and their different proportions. The active proliferation of embryonal masses is observed on the same medium with reduced concentration of cytokinins. The proliferation of embryonal masses was significantly improved when they were subcultured after dispersing in liquid medium. The somatic embryos from embryonal masses are matured on basal medium with ABA (60 - 120 mM) and PEG. In spite of species specificity the embryogenesis of morphogenic structures had the same scheme: elongation and asymmetric division of somatic cells, formation of initial cells and embryonal tubes, development of globular, torpedo and bipolar somatic embryos, embryos maturation and germination. However, not all donor-plants <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> can form the embryogenic cell lines and somatic embryos. The active development of embryonal masses and formation of somatic embryos are observed from zygotic embryo of hybrid seeds of P. sibirica and L. sibirica. The obtained embryogenic lines were characterized by different proliferative activity. During 10 months cultivation the value of embryonal masses in different lines was 140 - 570 g. The number of somatic embryos varies from 210 to 410 per 100 mg of callus fresh weight. Decreasing proliferation activity did not observed during 24 - 45 months cultivation. However, development of somatic embryos in long cultivated lines decreased. Maturation of somatic embryos and development of plantlets were established in L. sibirica and P. pumila 50 - 60 somatic embryos were matured per 1 g of callus fresh weight. Somatic embryogenesis passes over the strong genetic control. Only donor tree genotypes with high reproductive potential form embryogenic cell lines and somatic embryos. The maternal affect was very strong relative to paternal and other effects.

40|$|Climate and {{longleaf}} pine (Pinus palustris P. Mill.) radial growth {{relationships have}} been documented within its southern and western distribution. However, knowledge of this relationship is lacking along its northern latitudinal range margin (NLRM). Based {{on the principles of}} ecological amplitude, limiting factors, and studies <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> in eastern temperate forests of the U. S., we hypothesized that the radial growth of longleaf pine in mixed pine-hardwood forests is responding to winter temperatures in southeastern Virginia. Two longleaf pine chronologies were developed to determine the relationship between radial growth and monthly temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) via response function analysis (RFA). Results at the 0. 05 level yielded significant response function coefficients with a positive response to current winter temperature and precipitation and a negative response to prior August PDSI. In studies of climate and longleaf pine radial growth in other parts of its range, winter temperature and precipitation have not shared a significant positive association with radial growth. Instead current spring and summer precipitation usually share this positive association. These findings add more evidence to an emerging pattern suggesting that winter temperatures contribute to limiting the radial growth of temperate conifers at northern range margins in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} form {{a dominant}} landscape in many alpine environments where natural populations <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> are found across steep environmental gradients. Such populations {{are supposed to}} be tightly genetically adapted to these diverse environments; however the genetic basis of these adaptations is poorly understood. A preliminary investigation was conducted on five ecologically and economically important conifer species for the Italian Alps and Apennines: Abies alba, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo. To understand genetic patterns of adaptive variation, natural populations of these species were sampled along an altitudinal gradient and genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers. Population structure was estimated using Bayesian clustering analyses and a multivariate method, revealing the presence of 3 genetic clusters for A. alba and L. decidua, and 4 for P. abies, P. cembra and P. mugo. Inferred genetic structure was tested for correlation with latitude, longitude and the altitudinal gradient using multivariate analysis. Genetic variation resulted significantly correlated with geographic location in all five species: latitude was highly significant for A. alba and longitude for the other species. Further analysis on a local scale are needed to deeply investigate the altitudinal gradient effect and possibly detect outlier loci associated to climatic and environmental parameter...|$|R

40|$|Many {{related species}} {{share the same}} {{environment}} and utilize similar resources. This is surprising because {{based on the principle}} of competitive exclusion one would predict that the superior competitor would drive the other species to extinction; coexistence is only predicted if interspecific competition is weaker than intraspecific competition. Interspecific competition is frequently reduced by differential resource use, resulting in habitat segregation. In this paper, we use the closely related collared and pied flycatcher to assess the potential of habitat differences to affect interspecific competition through a different mechanism, namely by generating temporal differences in availability of similar food resources between the two species. We found that the tree species composition of the breeding territories of the two species differed, mainly by a higher abundance <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> around nest-boxes occupied by pied flycatchers. The temporal availability of caterpillars was measured using frass traps under four deciduous and two <b>coniferous</b> tree <b>species.</b> Deciduous tree species showed an early and narrow peak in abundance, which contrasted with the steady increase in caterpillar abundance in the <b>coniferous</b> tree <b>species</b> through the season. We subsequently calculated the predicted total caterpillar biomass available in each flycatcher territory. This differed between the species, with biomass decreasing more slowly in pied flycatcher territories. Caterpillar biomass is strongly correlated with the reproductive success of collared flycatchers, but much less so with pied flycatchers. However, caterpillar availability can only partly explain the differences in seasonal decline of reproductive success between the two species; we discuss additional factors that may contribute to this species difference. Overall, our results are consistent with the suggestion that minor habitat differences between these two species may contribute to promoting their coexistence. ...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (i) determine the patterns of maximum stem number per ha (MSN) over dominant tree height from 5 -year remeasurements of the permanent sample plots for temperate forests [Red pine (Pinus densiflora), Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis), Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis), and Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica) ] using Sterba’s theory and Korean National Forest Inventory (NFI) data, (ii) develop a stand-level mortality (self-thinning) model using the MSN curve, and (iii) assess the impact of temperature on tree mortality in semi-variogram and linear regression models. The MSN curve represents the upper boundary of observed stem numbers per ha. The developed mortality model with our results showed a high degree of reliability (R 2 = 0. 55 – 0. 81) and no obvious dependencies or patterns in residuals. However, spatial autocorrelation was detected from residuals <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> (Red pine, Japanese larch and Korean pine), but not for oak species (Chinese cork oak and Mongolian oak). Based on the linear regression analysis of residuals, we found that the mortality <b>of</b> <b>coniferous</b> forests tended to increase with the rising seasonal temperature.
