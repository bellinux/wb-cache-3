5|$|Most {{people with}} dengue recover without any ongoing problems. The {{fatality}} rate is 1–5%, {{and less than}} 1% with adequate treatment; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatality rate of up to 26%. Dengue is common in more than 110 countries. In 2013 it causes about 60 million symptomatic infections worldwide, with 18% admitted to hospital and about 13,600 deaths. The worldwide cost of dengue case is estimated US$9 billion. For {{the decade of the}} 2000s, 12 countries in Southeast Asia were estimated to have about 3million infections and 6,000 deaths annually. It is reported in at least 22 countries in Africa; but is likely present in all of them with 20% of the <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> This makes {{it one of the most}} common vector-borne diseases worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Although the Americas {{contribute}} 22% of {{the global}} area at risk, high endemic areas are generally sparsely populated and the region contributes only 6% to the total <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> In Africa, the widespread lack of the Duffy antigen in the population has ensured that stable transmission is constrained to Madagascar {{and parts of the}} Horn of Africa. It contributes 3.5% of global <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Central Asia is responsible for 82% of global <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> with high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations particularly in India and Myanmar.

Epidemic disease, in the 1804 case, yellow fever, put the military <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> and by extension Britain's ability to control the area. It was feared that civilian population had to be controlled to prevent pestilence. It is estimated that three fifths of the population was wiped out by the 1804 epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{population}} of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that {{the rapid growth of}} the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (river herring, shad, and blueback herring).

25|$|Prevention {{of severe}} disease {{involves}} screening the <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when {{the disease is}} detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or suramin. Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine {{or a combination of}} nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E
25|$|A {{population}} bottleneck {{occurs when}} the population of a species is reduced drastically over {{a short period of}} time due to external forces. In a true population bottleneck, the reduction does not favor any combination of alleles; it is totally random chance which individuals survive. A bottleneck can reduce or eliminate genetic variation from a population. Further drift events after the bottleneck event can also reduce the population's genetic diversity. The lack of diversity created can make the <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> to other selective pressures.|$|E
25|$|Case-control {{studies are}} usually {{faster and more}} cost {{effective}} than cohort studies, but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should {{be representative of the}} distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.|$|E

25|$|The disease occurs {{regularly}} {{in some regions}} of sub-Saharan Africa with the <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> being about 70 million in 36 countries. An estimated 11,000 people are currently infected with 2,800 new infections in 2015. In 2015 it caused around 3,500 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990. More than 80% of these cases are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Three major outbreaks have occurred in recent history: one from 1896 to 1906 primarily in Uganda and the Congo Basin and two in 1920 and 1970 in several African countries. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Other animals, such as cows, may carry the disease and become infected in which case it is known as animal trypanosomiasis.|$|E
500|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, {{a century}} of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the {{riparian}} vegetation along stream banks in the Trout Creek Mountains {{and elsewhere in the}} Great Basin. [...] As a result, stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones. Aspen populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees, decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures. These conditions put the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout <b>population</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> [...] Since the Lahontan was officially designated as a threatened species, environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the Trout Creek Mountains.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGiven reports {{showing a}} high {{prevalence}} of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus, alternatives to azole therapy are discussed when a threshold of 10 % of azole-resistant environmental isolates is reached. This raises {{the issue of}} calculation of this threshold, either on the prevalence of azole-resistant isolates as a whole or on the prevalence of azole-resistant cases in <b>populations</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of invasive aspergillosis (IA). For isolate evaluation, there are high disparities in routine microbiological procedures for the isolation of A. fumigatus and azole resistance detection. There are also huge differences between the microbiological work-up for diagnosing IA. Some centres rely on galactomannan detection alone without actively trying to culture appropriate samples, which affects reliability of the figures on the prevalence of resistance and thus the threshold of resistance. Moreover, reports from the laboratory could mix up figures from completely different patient populations: frequent azole-resistant isolates from pneumology patients and rare azole-resistant isolates from haematology patients. Therefore, to sum isolates from different specimens and different wards can lead to erroneous calculations for the restricted <b>populations</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of developing IA. In conclusion, assessing the incidence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus {{should be based on}} harmonized consensual microbiological methods and reports should be restricted to IA episodes in identified <b>populations</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of IA when the issue is to define an operational threshold for modifying recommendations...|$|R
