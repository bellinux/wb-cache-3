25|$|To Freud {{sexuality}} {{is composed of}} <b>partial</b> <b>drives</b> (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these <b>partial</b> <b>drives</b> function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), {{it is only in}} puberty that they become organized {{under the aegis of the}} genital organs. Lacan accepts the <b>partial</b> nature of <b>drives,</b> but 1) rejects the notion that <b>partial</b> <b>drives</b> can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that <b>drives</b> are <b>partial</b> in that they only represent sexuality partially not in the sense that they are a part of the whole. Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of jouissance.|$|R

5000|$|Lacan {{rejects the}} notion that <b>partial</b> <b>drives</b> can attain any {{complete}} organization since {{the primacy of the}} genital zone is always precarious. The <b>drives</b> are <b>partial,</b> not {{in the sense that they}} are a part of a whole (a genital drive), but in that they only represent sexuality partially: they convey the dimension of jouissance. [...] "The reality of the unconscious is sexual reality - an untenable truth," [...] much as it cannot be separated from death. Objet petit a is something from which the subject, in order to constitute itself, has separated itself off as organ. This serves as symbol of the lack, of the phallus, not as such, but in so far as it is lacking. It must be an object that is separable and that has some rapport to the lack. At the oral level, it is the nothing; at the anal level, it is the locus of the metaphor - one object for another, give the feces in place of the phallus - the anal drive is the domain of the gift; at the scopic level, we are no longer at the level of demand, but of desire, of the desire of the Other; it is the same at the level of the invocatory drive, which is the closest to the experience of the unconscious." [...] The first two relate to demand, the second pair to desire. Under the form of objet a, Lacan groups all the <b>partial</b> <b>drives</b> linked to part objects: the breast, feces, the penis, and he adds the gaze and the voice. Here, he asserts the split between the eye and the gaze when he analyzes Holbein's painting The Ambassadors as a [...] "trap for the gaze" [...] (piège à regards), but also as a dompte-regard (the gaze is tamed by an object) and a trompe-l'oeil. In the foreground, a floating object, a phallic ghost object gives presence to the - Φ of castration. This object is the heart of the organization of desire through the framework of the drives.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{stochastic}} <b>partial</b> differential equations <b>driven</b> by fractional noises. In this work, {{problems related to}} this topics are tackled and solved from two fairly different points of view. On one side we prove existence, uniqueness and regularity for mild solutions to a parabolic transport diffusion type equation that involves a non-smooth coefficient. We investigate related Cauchy problems on bounded smooth domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions by means of semigroup theory and fixed point arguments. Main ingredients are {{the definition of a}} product of a function and a (not too irregular) distribution as well as a corresponding norm estimate. As an application, transport stochastic <b>partial</b> differential equations <b>driven</b> by fractional Brownian noises are considered in the pathwise sense. On the other side we deal with stochastic differential equations driven by fractal noises in Banach spaces. More precisely, we deal with abstract Cauchy problems driven by fractional Brownian processes in Banach spaces and look for weak and mild solutions. To this aim, a fractional Brownian motion in separable Banach spaces is introduced by means of cylindrical processes. The related stochastic integral is then defined as cylindrical stochastic process and its properties are investigated. When the Banach space is a function space then the equation becomes a stochastic <b>partial</b> differential equation <b>driven</b> by a fractional noise...|$|R
