Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus, vulva, or scrotum and cause scarring in 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> Additionally, patients may present with erythema nodosum, cutaneous pustular vasculitis, and lesions similar to pyoderma gangrenosum.|$|E

Hydrotherapy and all types of shock treatment were halted. Meprobamate was found {{to help in the}} treatment of alcoholics by 1956. By 1957, over 36 million prescriptions had been filled for meprobamate in the US alone, a billion pills had been manufactured, and it accounted for fully a third of all prescriptions written.|$|E

2500|$|After Iraqi {{chemical}} {{attacks against}} Iranian soldiers and civilians, from 1983 to 1988, {{the number of}} people suffering injuries, including respiratory (42%), ocular (39%) and skin complications (25%) was more than 3,400 – a number which increased to at least 45,000 twenty years later, [...] "due to the occurrence of late respiratory complications of mustard gas exposure." [...] "The latency period can be as much as 40 years" [...] and [...] "So almost every day there are new cases — 30 years after the war," [...] said Shahriar Khateri, the co-founder of the Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support. According to Farhad Hashemnezhad in 2002, at least 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> were [...] "civilians who didn’t think they were close enough to be exposed." [...] This large number of chemically affected veterans has made Iran the world’s largest laboratory {{for the study of the}} effects of chemical weapons. According to a declassified CIA report, as a result of Iraq’s repeated use of nerve agents and toxic gases in the 1980s, Iran suffered more than 50,000 casualties mostly by mustard gas used in dusty, liquid and vapor forms packed into bombs and artillery shells which were then fired at the front lines and beyond, at targets such as hospitals. The number of registered chemically affected veterans was 70,000 by 2014, according to Shahriar Khateri, Iran’s leading expert on chemical weapons victims. [...] "awareness could have saved lives," [...] Khateri said.

40|$|To {{identify}} the prevalence and preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{in an emergency}} ward setting in a tertiary hospital in Sweden {{and to what extent}} the detected ADRs were reported to the Medical Product Agency (MPA).
