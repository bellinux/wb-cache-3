Anthropology of wheelchairs users locally is identified comprehensively. The investigation takes into consideration the needs and difficulties of wheelchairs users to access <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> as well as fundamental facilities required by wheelchair user in <b>public</b> <b>parks.</b> An inclusive study on Malaysian legislation, The Persons with Disabilities Act 2008, Australian legislation, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Malaysian Standard MS 1184 : 2002, Australia Standard AS 1428. 1 - 2001 and policies and guidelines used by Majlis Perbandaran Kuantan (MPK) and Adelaide City Council (ACC) when planning {{for people with disabilities}} specifically wheelchair users is undertaken.

Decision support system software called Expert choice 11. 5 was used to calculate the weights based on three alternative scenarios.

Hence, based on the analysis and findings made in this research, finding suitable locations using the land suitability model for future park development is highly helpful.
