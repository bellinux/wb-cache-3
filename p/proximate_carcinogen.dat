The animals were sacrificed 5 days after the pretreatment. These induction experiments showed that 7 a-hydroxylation of both progesterone and testosterone in liver microsomes was selectively increased to a great extent, but hydroxylations at the 2 a-, 6 f- and 16 a-positions were depressed, together with 5 a-reduction. From the same microsomes, three of the strongly induced P 450 isozymes, i. e., high- and low-spin P- 448 s and P 452, were purified. The last isozyme was most responsible for 7 a-hydroxylation of testosterone. The pretreatment, also increased activity of DT-diaphorase and reduction of 4 -NQO about 10 -fold in liver 9000 g supernatants. This reduction of 4 -NQO was solely catalyzed by DT-diaphorase and the only product was 4 -hydroxylaminoquinoline N-oxide, a <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen,</b> indicating that the pretreatment strongly increased production of a <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> from 4 -NQO. Such an enhancement of the metabolic activation of 4 -NQO by the pretreatment was also observed to some extent in the lung and the skin.

40|$|In {{a search}} for {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} threshold levels below which chemical carcinogens do not induce cancer, it is essential to consider all aspects of the carcinogenic process. We should not confine our thoughts solely to the generally ac-cepted stages of carcinogenesis: initiation, promo-tion, and progression. Several factors may influence thresholds even before the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> reaches the target tissue. Important is the number of molecules that can react with the target tissue. Apart from the level of exposure, this number depends on several condi-tions. First, not all molecules with carcinogenic potential are equally well absorbed, and the degree of absorption will affect the number available. Sec-ond, not all of the molecules which enter the or-ganism reach the target tissue. For many molecules, metabolic change may produce noncarcinogenic de-rivatives, while others will be activated to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen.</b> The ultimate number of molecules in this group is dependent upon the metabolic capability of the organism to perform the necessary conversions. This may be a function of the state of enzyme induction or tissue damage. Once in the active state, {{a large proportion of the}} carcinogenic molecules may be lost to the car-cinogenic process by interaction with molecules other than DNA, that is, with any molecules that can be alkylated, such as a diversity of small molecules, with macromolecules, such as protein or RNA. While damage may result from these reac-tions, no heritable changes are produced. From the foregoing, it is evident that several pro-cesses which have no relationship to car...|$|E

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are widespread environmental carcinogens {{implicated in the}} causation of human lung cancer. PAH require metabolic activation by epoxide hydrolase (EH) and CYPIA 1 to form non-K-region trans-dihydrodiols that can be further activated by CYP 1 A 1 to form diol-epoxides. Previously we have shown that a cytosolic aldo-keto reductase (AYR) from rat liver 3 α-HSD/DD (AKR 1 C 9) can divert these traps-dihydrodiols to yield reactive and redox active o-quinones, raising the possibility that this pathway could contribute to PAH carcinogenesis. However, whether this pathway occurs in humans was unknown. In this study we determined whether this pathway can be catalyzed in vitro by human AKR 1 C isoforms. Furthermore, we investigated whether the isoforms are highly over-expressed in lung cells, and whether the activity is sufficient to generate PAH o-quinones. ^ We now demonstrate that four homogenous recombinant human AKRs (AKR 1 C 1 -AKR 1 C 4) oxidized {{a wide variety of}} PAH trans-dihydrodiols with regio-selectivity. Of the PAH trans-dihydrodiols tested DMBA- 3, 4 -diol, one of the most potent <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogens</b> known, was often preferred. Using DMBA- 3, 4 -diol the product of the reaction was shown to be DMBA- 3, 4 -dione which was trapped as a thioether conjugate with 2 -mercaptoethanol. DMBA- 3, 4 -dione was shown to form mono- and bis-thioether conjugates via a novel mechanism of sequential 1, 6 - and 1, 4 -Michael addition. ^ Using multiple tissue expression array analysis, AKR 1 C isoforms were shown to be highly expressed in several PAH exposed tissues and in the human lung carcinoma cell line A 549. Isoform specific RT-PCR identified AKR 1 C 1 -AKR 1 C 3 transcripts in this cell line. Western blot analysis and functional assays showed the presence of active AKR 1 C isoforms in A 549 cells. ^ A 549 cell lysates were shown to oxidize DMBA- 3, 4 -diol to DMBA- 3, 4 -dione. The ability to measure DMBA- 3, 4 -dione formation in human cells implicates AKR 1 C isoforms in the metabolic activation of potent <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogens</b> in lung cancer. DMBA- 3, 4 -dione is the most electrophilic o-quinone produced by AKRs and its unique ability to form bis-thioether conjugates suggests that bis-conjugates may form with other cellular nucleophiles with toxicological consequences. ^ The constitutively and widely expressed AKR, aldehyde reductase (AKR 1 A 1) was also shown to oxidize PAH trans-dihydrodiols to their corresponding o-quinones. Aldehyde reductase displayed regio- and stereoselectivity in oxidizing PAH trans dihydrodiols of varying ring number and arrangement. Aldehyde reductase preferentially oxidized the metabolically relevant (−) -R,R isomer of BP- 7, 8 -diol to yield BP- 7, 8 -dione implicating the importance of this enzyme in PAH activation in humans. Moreover, AKR 1 A 1 was shown to be co-expressed with EH and CYP 1 A 1. The ability of these human AKR enzymes to divert trans-dihydrodiols to o-quinones suggests that this pathway occurs in site of PAH carcinogenesis in humans. ...|$|R
40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed The metabolic activation in mouse skin of benzo[g]chrysene (B[g]C), a moderately carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) present in coal tar, was investigated.

Seven major adduct spots were detected, at a maximum level of 6. 55 fmol adducts/jig DNA. Mouse skin treated with the PAH benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph) gave a total of 0. 24 fmol adducts/(ig DNA. B[g]C-DNA adducts persisted in skin for at least 3 weeks. Treatment of mice with 0. 5 pjnol of the optically pure putative <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> the (+) - and (-) -trans benzo[g]chrysene-ll, 12 -dihydrodiols, {{led to the formation}} of adducts which co-migrated on TLC and HPLC with those formed in B[g]C-treated mice, which suggested that the detected adducts were formed by the fjord region B[g]C-ll, 12 -dihydrodiol- 13, 14 -epoxides (Bfe]CDEs).

In a second species, the spectrum of tumors induced either before of after birth may be quite different. For bioassay of suspected carcinogens, the significance of perinatal carcinogenesis lies in the facts that the fetal and preweaning rodent is an extremely sensitive indicator of carcinogenic activity, and that the facile adaptibility of fetal cells to tissue culture and their rapid expression in vitro of properties of neoplastic transformation make possible a rapid in vivo/in vitro screening system for chemical carcinogens...|$|R

Papillomas and transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder occurred in about 90 % of the neonatal group, with {{no significant difference between}} thesexes. The presence of thesetumors was positively correlated with the presence of severe 2 ·AAF-induced multi· cystic disease of the liver. Probably the high incidence of neoplasia in-duced in the neonatal group isdue to critical quantitative relations between the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen(s)</b> and thesusceptible tissues during their period of most rapid growth. -J Nat Cancer Inst 40 : 377 - 388, 1968. FOR SEVERAL years we have noted a variable incidence of urinary bladder tumors in young male rats ingesting 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF). The incidence ranged from 0 - 77 % in Wistar rats and 5 - 39 % in Sprague-Dawley rats (both from the Charles River Breeding Co.) kept on carcinogenic diets for over 45 weeks. The age of the animals at initial exposure to the cancer-inducing chemical and the length of exposure seemed to influence inci-dence. The importance of the second factor was confirmed by studies (1, 2) demonstrating that bladder tumors usually did not appear until about 10 months after continuous exposure to the car-cinogen. To keep the animals alive longer than 10 months on a diet containing 0. 06 % 2 -AAF, 1. 6 or 3. 2 % indole was added.

40|$|A novel pathway of {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) activation is catalyzed by the cytosolic aldo-keto reductase (AKR) isoform (AKR 1 C 9) from rat liver, 3 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (3 αHSD/DD). Rat 3 αHSD/DD oxidizes PAH trans-dihydrodiol <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogens</b> to reactive and redox-active PAH ortho-quinones. However, the relevance of this metabolic pathway to PAH carcinogenesis in humans, was unknown. ^ Cloning and expression of four human AKRs revealed that multiple human homologs of AKR 1 C 9 also catalyze the oxidation of the trans-dihydrodiol of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), trans -dihydrodiol 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P-diol). Importantly, the redox-cycling o-quinone benzo[a]pyrene- 7, 8 -dione (BPQ) was identified {{as the product of}} these reactions. These studies demonstrate that oxidation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols to o-quinones can occur in human cells. ^ An AKR is overexpressed in human cells exposed to the electrophilic Michael acceptor ethacrynic acid. Since the human AKRs possess high nucleotide sequence similarity, the identity of the inducible AKR isoform was unknown. Development of an isoform-discriminating ribonuclease protection assay demonstrated that AKR 1 C 1 is both the constitutive and inducible AKR isoform in multiple human cell types following exposure to electrophiles, ROS, and PAH. The mechanism of AKR 1 C 1 induction by PAH appears to be via an antioxidant response element (ARE) -like pathway rather than the xenobiotic response element (XRE) pathway which regulates CYP 1 A 1 BPQ, the product of the AKR 1 C 1 reaction, also feedback stimulates AKR 1 C 1 expression. Thus PAH o-quinone formation by AKR 1 C 1 sets up both a chemical (redox-cycling) and genetic (AKR 1 C 1 induction) amplification of ROS in human cells. ^ Additional studies revealed that BPQ not only induces AKR 1 C 1 via the ARE, but also induces CYP 1 A 1 via the XRE pathway. Thus PAH o-quinones represent a novel class of bifunctional inducers capable of inducing phase I and phase II enzymes without a requirement for further metabolism. Importantly BPQ induces CYP 1 A 1 via the AhR. Thus it appears that the cytosolic colocalization of AKRs and the AhR ultimately results in the deleterious targeting of genotoxic PAH o-quinones into the nucleus. These studies demonstrate that redox-cycling PAH o-quinones are formed in human cells by AKR members, and provide a foundation for investigating these metabolites as carcinogens in future in vivo studies. ...|$|R

In this investigation, the effects of control fatty acids (oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA)) and n- 3 PUFA, e. g., docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the uptake and metabolism of the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was investigated in A 549 cells, a human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cell line. A 549 cells activate BaP through the cytochrome P 450 enzyme system to form reactive metabolites, a few of which covalently bind to DNA and proteins. Therefore, multiphoton microscopy spectral analysis combined with linear unmixing was used to identify the parent compound and BaP metabolites formed in cells, in the presence and absence of fatty acids. The relative abundance of select metabolites was associated with altered P 450 activity as determined using ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity in cells cultured in the presence of BSA-conjugated fatty acids. In addition, the parent compound within cellular membranes increases significantly in the presence of each of the fatty acids, with the greatest accumulation observed following DHA treatment. DHA treated cells exhibit significantly lower pyrene-like metabolites indicative of lower adducts including DNA adducts compared to control BSA, OA or LA treated cells.

40|$|Methyleugenol is a {{component}} of essential oils and is found in many foods and consumer products. Structurally similar to safrole, a known rodent carcinogen, methyleugenol {{has been shown to}} be a potent rodent hepatocarcinogen in a National Toxicology Program two-year bioassay. The mechanism by which methyleugenol causes tumors is suspected to mimic that of safrole. However, it is unknown if methyleugenol produces metabolites analogous to the proximate carcinogens of safrole. The hypothesis of this study is that methyleugenol is a genotoxicant after metabolic activation. The data presented show that methyleugenol is rapidly excreted from the body of rodents after oral and IV dose, primarily in the urine. Metabolites found in the urine include hydroxylated derivatives that are subsequently conjugated. The same basic pattern of metabolites is produced in isolated hepatocytes and microsomes from both rodents and humans. Mice produce more of these metabolites and at a faster rate than do rat or human derived systems. Among the metabolites identified in microsomes is 1 '-hydroxymethyleugenol, the analogous metabolite to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> of safrole. Results of the Unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in hepatocytes show that methyleugenol is positive (genotoxic) in both rats and mice but possibly much less so in human derived hepatocytes, and that genotoxicity can be blocked by preventing sulfation in rodent hepatoctyes. Thus methyleugenol is capable of forming the proximate carcinogenic molecule (1 ' - hydroxymethyleugenol) and the subsequent sulfation of that molecule may lead to the moiety responsible for DNA damage and potentially eventual tumorigenesis...|$|E
40|$|Estragole is {{a natural}} {{constituent}} of several herbs and spices including sweet basil. In rodent bioassays, estragole induces hepatomas, an effect ascribed to estragole bioactivation to 1 '-sulfooxyestragole resulting in DNA adduct formation. The present paper identifies nevadensin as a basil constituent able to inhibit DNA adduct formation in rat hepatocytes exposed to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 1 '-hydroxyestragole and nevadensin. This inhibition occurs {{at the level of}} sulfotransferase (SULT) -mediated bioactivation of 1 '-hydroxyestragole. The Ki for SULT inhibition by nevadensin was 4 nM in male rat and human liver fractions. Furthermore, nevadensin up to 20 µM did not inhibit 1 '-hydroxyestragole detoxification by glucuronidation and oxidation. The inhibition of SULT by nevadensin was incorporated into the recently developed physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) rat and human models for estragole bioactivation and detoxification. The results predict that co-administration of estragole at a level inducing hepatic tumors in vivo (50 mg/kg bw) with nevadensin at a molar ratio of 0. 06, representing the ratio of their occurrence in basil, results in almost 100 % inhibition of the ultimate carcinogen 1 '-sulfooxyestragole when assuming 100 % uptake of nevadensin. Assuming 1 % uptake, inhibition would still amount to more than 83 %. Altogether these data point at a nevadensin-mediated inhibition of the formation of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of estragole, without reducing the capacity to detoxify 1 '-hydroxyestragole via glucuronidation or oxidation. These data also point at a potential reduction of the cancer risk when estragole exposure occurs within a food matrix containing SULT inhibitors compared to what is observed upon exposure to pure estragol...|$|E

Cells from the sister of the male proband (strain 3437 T), mother (strain 3703 T), two of his paternal aunts (3701 T and 3704 T) and one paternal uncle (3702 T) displayed marked resistance (1. 8 to 4. 3 {{times greater than the}} normal mean) to 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO), a procarcinogen whose DNA-damaging properties encompass those of both far (254 nm) ultraviolet (UV) light and ionising radiation. These same 4 NQO-resistant cells, however, responded normally to reproductive inactivation by UV light, 60 Co gamma radiation or the alkylating agent methylnitrosourea, signifying that the abnormal resistance of these cells to 4 NQO is not associated with aberrant DNA metabolism. In keeping with this conclusion, exposure to a given dose of 4 NQO produced decreased amounts of DNA damage and stimulated lower levels of repair DNA synthesis in all five 4 NQO-resistant strains than in normal controls. Moreover, exogenous radiolabelled 4 NQO accumulated to a lesser extent in the 4 NQO-resistant than in the normal fibroblasts. Cell sonicates of strains 3437 T, 3701 T and 3702 T exhibited reduced capacities (40 - 60 % of normal) to catalise the conversion of 4 NQO to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 4 -hydroxyaminoquinoline 1 -oxide. However, the 4 NQO-resistant strains 3703 T and 3704 T carried out 4 NQO bioreduction at normal rates. Our data therefore indicate that enhanced resistance to 4 NQO cytotoxicity in 3437 T, 3701 T and 3702 T is a consequence of anomalies in both intracellular accumulation and enzymatic reduction of 4 NQO, whereas 4 NQO resistance in 3703 T and 3704 T appears to result solely from reduced intracellular drug accumulation...|$|E

Incubations with Supersomes revealed that all enzymes tested, except P 450 2 C 8, are intrinsically able to 1 ′-hydroxylate estragole. Experiments with Gentest microsomes, expressing P 450 enzymes to roughly average liver levels, indicated that P 450 1 A 2, 2 A 6, 2 C 19, 2 D 6, and 2 E 1 might contribute to estragole 1 ′-hydroxylation in the human liver. Especially P 450 1 A 2 is an important enzyme based on the correlation between P 450 1 A 2 activity and estragole 1 ′-hydroxylation in human liver microsomal samples and inhibition of estragole 1 ′-hydroxylation by the P 450 1 A 2 inhibitor α-naphthoflavone. Kinetic studies revealed that, at physiologically relevant concentrations of estragole, P 450 1 A 2 and 2 A 6 {{are the most important}} enzymes for bioactivation in the human liver showing enzyme efficiencies (kcat/Km) of, respectively, 59 and 341 min- 1 mM- 1. Only at relatively high estragole concentrations, P 450 2 C 19, 2 D 6, and 2 E 1 might contribute to some extent. Comparison to results from similar studies for safrole and methyleugenol revealed that competitive interactions between estragole and methyleugenol 1 ′-hydroxylation and between estragole and safrole 1 ′-hydroxylation are to be expected because of the involvement of, respectively, P 450 1 A 2 and P 450 2 A 6 in the bioactivation of these compounds. Furthermore, poor metabolizer phenotypes in P 450 2 A 6 might diminish the chances on bioactivation of estragole and safrole, whereas lifestyle factors increasing P 450 1 A 2 activities such as cigarette smoking and consumption of charbroiled food might increase those chances for estragole and methyleugenol. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|E

The regioselectivity of the reactions was determined, {{as well as}} the associated stereoselectivity in the production of dihydrodiol metabolites and K-region oxides. Metabolite distributions were also examined {{in the presence of the}} epoxide hydrolase inhibitor 1, 1, 1 -trichloropropylene- 2, 3 -oxide and the P 450 modulator Lu-naphthoflavone. P 4501 A 2 was most regioselective for the production of the proximate carcinogen; the 3, 4 -dihydrodiol of 7 -methylbenz(c) acridine and P 4503 A 4 showed the highest regioselectivity for K-region oxidation. In contrast, the analogous putative <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> of dibenz(a,j) acridine was formed with the highest relative abundance by P 4503 A 4, while P 4501 A 2 was most regioselective for K-region oxidation. For both compounds the proximate carcinogens possessed predominantly the 3 R, 4 R-absolute configuration, independent of the P 450 catalyzing the reaction. The K-region dihydrodiols of 7 -methylbenz (c) acridine were formed with no stereoselectivity, except with P 1501 A 2 which favored production of the S,S isomer. In contrast the K-region dihydrodiol of dibenz(n,j) acridine was formed by P 4501 A 1 and P 4501 A 2 as the R,R isomer with almost 100 % optical purity. P 4501 A 2 and 3 A 4 showed no stereoselectivity in the formation of the K-region oxide of 7 -methylbenz(c) acridine, while P 4501 A 1 produced the 5 R, 6 S-oxide with low optical purity. For dibenz(a,j) acridine 5, 6 -oxide, P 4501 A 1 predominantly formed 5 S, 6 R-oxide (80 % pure).

Incubations with Supersomes, expressing individual P 450 enzymes to a high level, revealed that P 450 1 A 2, 2 A 6, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, and 2 D 6 are intrinsically able to 1 ′-hydroxylate methyleugenol. An additional experiment with Gentest microsomes, expressing the same individual enzymes to roughly average liver levels, indicated that P 450 1 A 2, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, and 2 D 6 contribute to methyleugenol 1 ′-hydroxylation in the human liver. A study, in which correlations between methyleugenol 1 ′-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes from 15 individuals and the conversion of enzyme specific substrates by the same microsomes were investigated, showed that P 450 1 A 2 and P 450 2 C 9 are important enzymes in the bioactivation of methyleugenol. This was confirmed in an inhibition study in which pooled human liver microsomes were incubated with methyleugenol in the presence and absence of enzyme specific inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed that at physiologically relevant concentrations of methyleugenol P 450 1 A 2 {{is the most important}} enzyme for bioactivation of methyleugenol in the human liver showing an enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) that is ∼ 30, 50, and > 50 times higher than the enzyme efficiencies of, respectively, P 450 2 C 9, 2 C 19, and 2 D 6. Only when relatively higher methyleugenol concentrations are present P 450 2 C 9 and P 450 2 C 19 might contribute as well to the bioactivation of methyleugenol in the human liver. A 5 -fold difference in activities was found between the 15 human liver microsomes of the correlation study (range, 0. 89 - 4. 30 nmol min- 1 nmol P 450 - 1). Therefore, interindividual differences might cause variation in sensitivity toward methyleugenol.

40|$|Alkenylbenzenes such as estragole and {{methyleugenol}} {{are common}} components of spices and herbs such as tarragon, basil, fennel, mace, allspice, star anise and anise and their essential oils (Smithet al., 2002). There is {{an interest in}} the safety evaluation of alkenylbenzenes because these compounds can induce hepatic tumours in rodents when dosed orally at high dose levels (Milleret al., 1983; NTP, 2000). Based on the rodent studies with estragole, methyleugenoland structurally related alkenylbenzenes like safrole the hepatocarcinogenicity of alkenylbenzenes is ascribed to their bioactivation by cytochrome P 450 enzymes leading to the formation of the proximate carcinogenen, the 1 ′-hydroxy metabolite, which is further bioactivated to the ultimate carcinogenen, the 1 ′-sulfooxy metabolite (Milleret al., 1983; Phillipset al., 1984; Randerathet al., 1984; Smithet al., 2010). The 1 ′-sulfooxy metabolite is unstable and binds via a presumed reactive carbocation intermediate covalently to different endogenous nucleophiles including DNA (Phillipset al., 1981; Boberget al., 1983; Milleret al., 1983; Phillipset al., 1984; Randerathet al., 1984; Fennellet al., 1985; Wisemanet al., 1987; Smithet al., 2002). Because of their genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, the addition of estragole and methyleugenolas pure substances to foodstuffs has been prohibited within the European Union since September 2008 (European Commission, 2008). In 2008, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) re-evaluated the safety of alkenylbenzenes and indicated that although evidence of carcinogenicity to rodents given high doses of alkenylbenzenes exists, {{further research is needed to}} assess the potential risk to human health at relevant dietary exposure levels (JECFA, 2008). A significant difficulty in evaluating the toxicological data for alkenylbenzenes is that human exposure to these substances results from exposure to a complex mixture of food, spice, and spice oil constituents which may influence the biochemical fate and toxicological risk of the alkenylbenzenes. In this regard, it was shown that a methanolic extract of basil inhibited the formation of estragole DNA adducts in human HepG 2 cells exposed to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 1 ′-hydroxyestragole (Jeurissenet al., 2008). This inhibition occurred at the level of sulfotransferase (SULT) -mediated bioactivation of 1 ′-hydroxyestragole into 1 ′-sulfooxyestragole (Jeurissenet al., 2008). The objective of this PhD research was to study the inhibitory action of components in alkenylbenzene-containing herbs and spices on SULT-mediated alkenylbenzene DNA adduct formation and the consequences of this combination effect for risk assessment using estragole and methyleugenol as the model alkenylbenzenes. To achieve this objective, an integrated approach of in vitro, in vivo and physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) models was applied to investigate how the SULT inhibition influences the bioactivation and thus potentially also the toxicity and risk assessment of estragole and methyleugenol. Chapter 1 of the thesis presents an introduction to the bioactivation, detoxification, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of the alkenylbenzenes estragole and methyleugenol as well as a short introduction to PBBK modeling and the state-of-the-art knowledge on risk assessment strategies and regulatory status for alkenylbenzenes. Chapter 2 of the thesis identifies nevadensin as a basil constituent able to inhibit SULT-mediated DNA adduct formation in rat hepatocytes exposed to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 1 ′-hydroxyestragole and nevadensin. The type of inhibition by nevadensin was shown to be non-competitive with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 4 nM. Furthermore, nevadensin up to 20 μM did not inhibit 1 ′-hydroxyestragole detoxification by glucuronidation and oxidation. The inhibition of SULT by nevadensin was incorporated into the PBBK models describing bioactivation and detoxification of estragole in male rat and human. The models thus obtained predict that co-administration of estragole at a level inducing hepatic tumours in vivo (50 mg/kg bw) with nevadensin at a molar ratio to estragole representing the molar ratio of their occurrence in basil, results in more than 83 % inhibition of the formation of the carcinogenic metabolite, 1 ʹ-sulfooxyestragole, inthe liver of male rat and human even at 1 % uptake of nevadensin. To extend the work to other alkenylbenzene-containing herbs and spices than basil chapter 3   presents data showing that methanolic extracts from different alkenylbenzene-containing herbs and spices such as nutmeg, mace, anise and others are able to inhibit the SULT enzyme activity. Flavonoids including nevadensin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, luteolin and apigenin were the major constituents responsible for this inhibition of SULT activity with Kivalues in the nano to sub-micromolar range. Also, the various flavonoids individually or in mixtures were able to inhibit estragole DNA adduct formation in human HepG 2 cells exposed to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 1 ʹ-hydroxyestragole, and to shift metabolism in favour of detoxification (e. g. glucuronidation) at the cost of bioactivation (e. g. sulfonation). In a next step, the kinetics for SULT inhibition were incorporated in PBBK models for estragole in rat and human to predict the effect of co-exposure to estragole and (mixtures of) the different flavonoids on the bioactivation in vivo. The PBBK-model-based predictions indicate that the reduction of estragole bioactivation in rat and human by co-administration of the flavonoids is dependent on whether the intracellular liver concentrations of the flavonoids can reach their Ki values. Finally, we concluded that it is expected that this is most easily achieved for nevadensin which has a Kivalue in the nanomolar range and is, due to its methylation, more metabolically stable and bioavailable than the other flavonoids. Chapter 4 of the thesis investigates whether the previous observation that nevadensin is able to inhibit SULT-mediated estragole DNA adduct formation in primary rat hepatocytes could be validated in vivo. Moreover, the previously developed PBBK models to study this inhibition in rat and in human liver was refined by including a sub-model describing nevadensin kinetics. Nevadensin resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of estragole DNA adducts formed in the liver of Sprague–Dawley rats orally dosed with estragole and nevadensin simultaneously at a ratio reflecting their presence in basil. Moreover, the refined PBBK model predicted the formation of estragole DNA adducts in the liver of rat with less than 2 -fold difference compared to in vivo data and suggests more potent inhibition in the liver of human compared to rat due to less efficient metabolism of nevadensin in human liver and intestine. Also, an updated risk assessment for estragole was presented taking into account the matrix effect and this revealed that the BMDL 10 and the resulting MOE for estragole increase substantially when they would be derived from rodent bioassays in which the animals would be exposed to estragole in the presence of nevadensin instead of to pure estragole. To extend the work to other alkenylbenzenes than estragole chapter 5 of the thesis investigates the potential of nevadensin to inhibit the SULT-mediated bioactivation and subsequent DNA adduct formation of methyleugenolusing human HepG 2 cells as an in vitro model. Nevadensin was able to inhibit SULT-mediated DNA adduct formation in HepG 2 cells exposed to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol in the presence of nevadensin. To investigate possible in vivo implications for SULT inhibition by nevadensin on methyleugenolbioactivation, the rat PBBK model developed in our previous work to describe the dose-dependent bioactivation and detoxification of methyleugenolin male rat was combined with the recently developed PBBK model describing the dose-dependent kinetics of nevadensin in male rat. Similar to what was presented for estragole in chapter 4, chapter 5 presents an updated risk assessment for methyleugenoltaking the matrix effect into account. This revealed that the BMDL 10 and the resulting MOE for methyleugenolincrease substantially when they would be derived from rodent bioassays in which the animals would be exposed to methyleugenolin the presence of nevadensin instead of to pure methyleugenol. In a next step, we aimed at moving one step forward towards endpoints that are closer to initiation of carcinogenesis than DNA adduct formation, namely, formation of hepatocellular altered foci (HAF). Chapter 6 presents data showing that the potent in vivo inhibitory activity of nevadensin on SULT enzyme activity and on alkenylbenzene DNA adduct formation is accompanied by a potent in vivo reduction in early markers of carcinogenesis such as HAF. This also suggests that a reduction in the incidence of hepatocarcinogenicity is expected in liver of rodents when alkenylbenzenes would be dosed simultaneously with nevadensin. Chapter 7 presents a discussion on the in vitro and in vivo activity of dietary SULT inhibitors and their potential in reducing the cancer risk associated with alkenylbenzene consumption. This chapter also presents some future perspectives based on the major issues raised by our research.   Altogether, the results of the present thesis indicate that the likelihood of bioactivation and subsequent adverse effects may be lower when alkenylbenzenes are consumed in a matrix containing SULT inhibitors such as nevadensincompared to experiments using pure alkenylbenzenes as single compounds. Also,the consequences of the in vivo matrix effect were shown to be significant when estragole or methyleugenolwas tested in rodent bioassays in the presence of nevadensin at ratios detected in basil, thereby likely increasing BMDL 10 and resulting  MOE values substantially in a subsequent risk assessment. However, the results also indicate that matrix effects may be lower at daily human dietary exposure levels of estragole or methyleugenoland nevadensin resulting from basil consumption. Also, matrix effects seem to be limited in the presence of other SULT inhibiting dietary flavonoids even at high exposure levels of these flavonoids coming from supplements. This indicates that the importance of a matrix effect for risk assessment of individual compounds requires analysis of dose dependent effects on the interactions detected, an objective that can be achieved by using PBBK modeling. Overall, the present study provides an example of an approach that can be used to characterise dose- species- and inter-individual differences as well as matrix effects in the risk assessment of food-borne toxicants present (e. g. alkenylbenzenes). In this approach the most important toxicokinetic interactions are addressed using an integrated strategy of in vitro, in vivo and PBBK modeling approaches.   ...|$|E

Cigarette smoke, {{considered the most}} important risk factor for lung cancer, contains a variety of PAH. PAH require metabolic activation to exert their deleterious effects. Aldo-keto reductases (AKR) oxidize <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> PAH trans-dihydrodiols to catechols, which auto-oxidize forming reactive oxygen species (ROS) and o-quinones. ^ Fjord-region PAH are more mutagenic and carcinogenic versus unsubstituted PAH. In this study, rat AKR 1 C 9 oxidized fjord -region benzo[g]chrysene- 11, 12 -dihydrodiol with a kcat/Km 100 -times greater than unsubstituted bay-region benzo[a]pyrene- 7, 8 -dihydrodiol. During oxidation, only one stereoisomer was used. Alanine-scanning mutants of active site residues revealed that several active site residues enabled oxidation of both stereoisomers of benzo[g]chrysene- 11, 12 -dihydrodiol. This suggests that AKRs {{may contribute to the}} carcinogenicity of fjord-region PAH. ^ One deleterious consequence of o-quinone formation is ROS generation during futile redox cycling. Consequently, ROS inflict oxidative damage to DNA. However, the identity of quinone reductases, which enhance ROS formation by reducing PAH quinones to catechols in cells, is unknown. In this study, human recombinant AKR 1 A 1, 1 B 1, 1 B 10, 1 C 1 - 4, 7 A 2, 7 A 3, NAD(P) H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQ 01), and carbonyl reductase (CBR) isoforms were tested as quinone reductases. Structural series of PAH o-quinones, benzo[a]pyrene diones, and estrogen replacement therapy metabolite 4 -hydroxyequilenin-o-quinone were tested as substrates with each enzyme. NQO 1 and the AKRs reduced all types of quinones. The specific activities with AKRs exceeded those observed for trans-dihydrodiol oxidation. CBRs reduced few PAH quinones, implying CBRs are not the major cellular quinone reductases. NQO 1 had higher specific activities than AKRs. However, the Km for NADPH with NQO 1 is higher than the AKRs, which could limit quinone reduction by NQO 1 in cells. Contributions of AKRs and NQO 1 to ROS formation in human lung adenocarcinoma A 549 cells treated with PAH o-quinones with AKR 1 C or NQO 1 inhibitors was tested. No change in ROS formation occurred with these inhibitors, suggesting that NQO 1 does not reduce quinones in A 549 cells. However, AKRs not blocked by the AKR 1 C inhibitor may play roles in quinone reduction of PAH quinones in A 549 cells. This could lead to increased oxidative stress following o-quinone formation and ultimately contribute to chemical and hormonal carcinogenesis. ...|$|E
40|$|The kidneys {{have many}} clearly defined {{physiologic}} functions. Although {{their role as}} an excretory organ for drugs and chemicals and their polar metabolites is well described, their involvement in the biotransformation of xenobiotics is relatively poorly understood. It is accurate to state that our present understanding of the metabolic processes of drugs is based largely on studies {{carried out in the}} liver. Only recently have detailed investigations into drug metabolism in the kidney been carried out. These {{studies have shown that the}} kidney is meta-bolically very active in effecting the biotransformation of a variety of chemicals and drugs and, in some cases, surpasses the liver. It is important to understand the role of the kidney in drug and chemical biotransformation for a variety of reasons. Because the kidney receives a substantial portion of the cardiac output, it is reasonable to expect that it may make a significant contribution to the total metabolic alteration of drugs in the body. Furthermore, it is now known that the toxic effects of many drugs and chemicals are attributable to their metabolic conversion to reactive electrophilic intermediates, which, on reaction with cellular nucleophiles, lead to a variety of deleterious effects. Perhaps most important is the appreciation that this interaction between reactive intermediates and critical cellular macromolecules is intimately involved in mutagenic and carcinogenic changes. In addition, necrotic changes may also be associated with cellular alkylation. Thus, a complete perspective on the role of the kidney in pharmacologic and toxicologic processes is dependent on a thorough understanding of the drug and chemical metabolic capabilities of this organ. The biotransformation of organic compounds can be conveniently divided into oxidative, reductive, hydrolytic, and synthetic or conjugation reactions. The first three reactions are based on the type of chemical change produced. Synthetic or conjugation reactions usually involve the enzyme-catalyzed combination of a chemical or a metabolite and a carbohydrate or an amino acid, and they yield highly polar, readily excretable metabolites. Furthermore, multiple metabolic alterations are very common. Williams, in his classic book, Detoxication Mechanisms, suggests that the metabolism of many xenobiotics occurs in two steps [1]. The first, termed “phase I reactions,” includes oxidative, reductive, and hydrolytic reactions; the second, termed “phase II reactions,” consists of conjugative reactions and includes, for example, glucuronide, sulfate, and hippuric acid formation. It should be noted that although the metabolites produced in phase I reactions are frequently less toxic or less active pharmacologically than the parent compound is, abundant examples can be cited where the metabolites are more toxic and more active pharmacologically. By the same token, although the conjugates produced in phase II reactions are usually very polar and less toxic, notable exceptions exist; for example, the sulfate conjugate of N-hydroxyacetyl-aminofluorene is thought to be the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> in the case of this compound [5]...|$|E

In addition, methyleugenol has been reported to be DNA reactive and carcinogenic, inducing malignant tumors in multiple tissues of rats and mice as well as inducing unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver (Ding et al., 2011; NTP, 2000; Smith et al., 2002). The safety of human exposure to methyleugenol at low dietary intake levels has been assessed several times (Hall and Oser, 1965; NTP, 2000; SCF, 2001; Smith et al., 2002) without reaching a scientific agreement on how to translate the carcinogenicity data of rodent animal experiments obtained at high levels of exposure to the relevant human situation. A recent evaluation, performed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2008, has indicated that although evidence of carcinogenicity to rodents given high doses of methyleugenol exists, {{further research is needed to}} assess the potential risk to human health at relevant dietary exposure resulting from the presence of methyleugenol in foods and essential oils and its use as flavoring agent (JECFA, 2008). Predicting the cancer risk in humans at relevant dietary intake levels requires extrapolation of the animal carcinogenicity data taking in consideration dose, species, and interindividual variation. Furthermore, it implies extrapolation from rat or mouse studies with high dose levels of the pure compound to the human situation in which exposure at low dose levels occurs within the context of a complex food matrix. The aim of the present PhD project was to obtain quantitative insight into the consequences of dose- and species-dependent effects and of interindividual differences and matrix effects for the bioactivation and detoxification of methyleugenol by using physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modeling. The first chapter of this thesis presents background information to the topic. In chapter 2, a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for the alkenylbenzene methyleugenol in rat was defined based on in vitro metabolic parameters determined using relevant tissue fractions, in silico derived partition coefficients (Payne and Kenny, 2002 and reference therin), and physiological parameters (Brown et al., 1997) derived from the literature. The model was based on the model previously developed for the related alkenylbenzene estragole and consists of eight compartments including liver, lung, and kidney as metabolizing compartments, and separate compartments for fat, arterial blood, venous blood, richly perfused and slowly perfused tissues (Punt et al., 2008). Evaluation of the model was performed by comparing the PBK predicted concentration of methyleugenol in the venous compartment to methyleugenol plasma levels reported in the literature, by comparing the PBK predicted dose-dependent % of formation of 2 -hydroxy- 4, 5 -dimethoxyallylbenzene, 3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxyallylbenzene, and 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol glucuronide to the corresponding % of metabolites excreted in urine reported in the literature, which were demonstrated to be in the same order of magnitude (Solheim and Scheline, 1976). With the model obtained the relative extent of bioactivation and detoxification of methyleugenol at different oral doses was examined. At low doses, formation of 3 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) - 2 -propen- 1 -olandmethyleugenol- 2 ′, 3 ′-oxideleadingto detoxification appear to be the major metabolic pathways, occurring in the liver. At high doses, the model reveals a relative increase in the formation of the proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol, occurring in the liver. This relative increase in formation of 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol leads to a relative increase in formation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol glucuronide, 1 ′-oxomethyleugenol, and 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol the latter being the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of methyleugenol. These results indicate that the relative importance of different metabolic pathways of methyleugenol may vary in a dose-dependent way, leading to a relative increase in bioactiviation of methyleugenol at higher doses. In subsequent studies described in chapter 3 a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for methyleugenol in human based on in vitro and in silico derived parameters was identified based on the model previously developed for the related alkenylbenzene estragole. The model consists of six compartments including liver as metabolizing compartment, and separate compartments for fat, arterial blood, venous blood, richly perfused and slowly perfused tissues (Punt et al., 2009). With the model obtained, bioactivation and detoxification of methyleugenol at different dose levels could be investigated. The outcomes of this human model were compared with those of the PBK model for methyleugenol in male rat. The results obtained reveal that formation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol glucuronide, a major metabolic pathway in male rat liver, appears to represent a minor metabolic pathway in human liver whereas in human liver a significantly higher formation of 1 ′-oxomethyleugenol compared with male rat liver is observed. Furthermore, formation of 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol, which readily undergoes desulfonation to a reactive carbo-cation that can form DNA or protein adducts, is predicted to be the same in the liver of both human and male rat at oral doses of 0. 0034 up to 300 mg/(kg bw). Altogether it was concluded that despite a significant difference in especially the metabolic pathways of the proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol between human and male rat, the influence of species differences on the ultimate overall bioactivation of methyleugenol to 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol appears to be negligible. Moreover, the PBK model predicted the formation of 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol in the liver of human and rat to be linear from doses as high as the benchmark dose (BMD 10) down to as low as the virtual safe dose (VSD). This shows that kinetic data do not provide a reason to argue against linear extrapolation from the rat tumor data to the human situation. Another aim of the present PhD study was to study the effect of the basil constituent nevadensin on the bioactivation and genotoxicity of herb based methyleugenol. The results presented in chapter 4 show that nevadensin is able to inhibit DNA adduct formation in HepG 2 cells exposed to the <b>proximate</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol in the presence of this flavonoid. This inhibition occurs at the level of sulfotransferase (SULT) -mediated bioactivation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol. In order to investigate possible in vivo implications the SULT inhibition by nevadensin was integrated into the male rat and human PBK models for bioactivation and detoxification of methyleugenol. The results thus obtained reveal that coadministration of methyleugenol with nevadensin may reduce the levels of bioactivation of 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol to the DNA reactive metabolite, without reducing its detoxification via glucuronidation or oxidation. This effect may be significant even at realistic low dose human exposure levels. The results obtained point at a potential reduction of the cancer risk when methyleugenol exposure occurs by oral intake within a relevant food matrix containing SULT inhibitors compared to what is observed in rodent bioassays upon exposure to pure methyleugenol dosed by gavage. Besides dose-dependent effects, species differences effects, and matrix effects on the bioactivation of methyleugenol the effect of interindividual variation on methyleugenol detoxification and bioactivation was investigated in chapter 5. To this end we predicted the level of formation of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol in the human population by taking the variability in key bioactivation and detoxification reactions into account using Monte Carlo simulations. Insight in the variation in relevant metabolic routes was obtained by determining kinetic constants for the metabolic reactions by specific isoenzymes or by measuring the kinetic constants in incubations with a range of individual human liver fractions. The results of the study indicate that formation of 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol is predominantly affected by i) P 450 1 A 2 catalyzed bioactivation of methyleugenol to 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol ii) P 450 2 B 6 catalyzed epoxidation of methyleugenol and iii) the apparent kinetic constants for detoxification of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol via oxidation and iv) the apparent kinetic constants for bioactivation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol to 1 ′- sulfooxymethyleugenol. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation a chemical-specific adjustment factor (CSAF) for intraspecies variation could be derived which is defined as the 95 th or 99 th percentile divided by the 50 th percentile of the predicted distribution of the formation of 1 ′- sulfooxymethyleugenol in the liver. The obtained CSAF value at the 95 th percentile was 3. 7 indicating that the default uncertainty factor of 3. 16 for human variability in kinetics (WHO, 1999) may adequately protect 95 % of the population. While protecting 99 % of the population requires a larger uncertainty factor of 5. 8. Altogether, the results shown in this thesis reveal that integrating in vitro metabolic parameters within a framework of a PBK model provides a good method to evaluate the occurrence of dose-dependent effects, species differences, and human variability in detoxification and bioactivation of a genotoxic carcinogen. Moreover, the results presented in this thesis show the possible protective effect of the basil constituent nevadensin on SULT catalysed bioactivation and DNA adduct formation of methyleugenol in vitro. Upon validation of these effects in vivo, it may turn out that rodent carcinogenicity data on methyleugenol substantially overestimate the risks posed when humans are exposed to methyleugenol within a nevadensin containing food matrix...|$|E
