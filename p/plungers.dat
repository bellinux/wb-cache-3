5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot <b>plungers,</b> popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} <b>plungers</b> which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with <b>plungers),</b> and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E

50|$|A common {{tractive}} electromagnet is a uniformly-wound solenoid and <b>plunger.</b> The solenoid is a coil of wire, and the <b>plunger</b> {{is made of}} {{a material}} such as soft iron. Applying a current to the solenoid applies a force to the <b>plunger</b> and may make it move. The <b>plunger</b> stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the <b>plunger</b> is centered in the solenoid.|$|R

500|$|Smith kept few {{horses in}} 1902 and {{consequently}} allowed James R. Keene to employ Willie Shaw {{for much of}} the season. While his overall percentage of wins was still high, Shaw lost some races {{in a way that the}} general public thought was suspicious and he was accused of not trying to win. Shaw's poor performance was soon linked to some action on Smith's part and he was accused of paying the jockey to lose, a claim which Smith vehemently denied. In May 1903, Shaw was suspended by The Jockey Club for presumed [...] "listless" [...] riding on Illyria at a May 6 race at the Jamaica Racetrack. [...] On June 24, 1903, Smith was also banned from entering his horses in races overseen by The Jockey Club. He admitted to no wrongdoing, and he suspected the ban was a hold-over from Willie Shaw's suspension and resulted from The Jockey Club's increased efforts to remove <b>plungers</b> from their tracks. Smith continued to make bets, notably securing $60,000 when Africander won the 1903 Suburban Handicap, but had sold his stable to E.E Smatters by the end of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Plastic {{materials}} {{played a}} very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until [...] "monoblocks" [...] came along, GE's [...] "self-lubricating" [...] Delrin was the only plastic material for keyboard switch <b>plungers</b> that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling switch <b>plungers</b> was undesirable because it would attract dirt over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key <b>plungers</b> and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But Delrin was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use ABS plastic. [...] However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75mm to 2.79mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monolocks also made of ABS.|$|E
50|$|As {{the screw}} is turned and the <b>plunger</b> retracted, flow between {{the seat and}} the <b>plunger</b> is possible; however, until the <b>plunger</b> is {{completely}} retracted, the fluid flow is significantly impeded. Since it takes many turns of the fine-threaded screw to retract the <b>plunger,</b> precise regulation of the flow rate is possible.|$|R

Daleks {{have been known to}} use their <b>plungers</b> to interface with technology, crush a man's skull by suction, measure the intelligence of a subject, and extract information from a man's mind.

[...] "You've got to remember, we are working with humans here and we are prone to human error. We do the best we can, and we learn from our mistakes." [...] Kerrick noted that the team would be taking extra precautions to avoid any further problems with the grease guns, by attaching them to the outside of the bags instead of inside to prevent the <b>plungers</b> from being inadvertently activated.|$|E

For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with <b>plungers</b> wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an air compressor for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with puma screams. Bird squawks {{were used for the}} Pteranodon. Spivak also {{provided the}} numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.|$|E

50|$|These {{consist of}} a {{cylinder}} with a reciprocating <b>plunger.</b> The suction and discharge valves are mounted in {{the head of the}} cylinder. In the suction stroke the <b>plunger</b> retracts and the suction valves open causing suction of fluid into the cylinder. In the forward stroke the <b>plunger</b> pushes the liquid out of the discharge valve.Efficiency and common problems: With only one cylinder in <b>plunger</b> pumps, the fluid flow varies between maximum flow when the <b>plunger</b> moves through the middle positions, and zero flow when the <b>plunger</b> is at the end positions. A lot of energy is wasted when the fluid is accelerated in the piping system. Vibration and water hammer may be a serious problem. In general the problems are compensated for by using two or more cylinders not working in phase with each other.|$|R

60|$|The {{peculiarities of}} the pump {{referred}} to were, first, and most obvious, {{that it had}} no outer wooden case or box, and the parts were exceedingly few and simple. It was on the lever principle, the cylinders, instead of the pistons, being movable. The pistons were fixed to a bed-plate and pointed upwards, so that the pump was, as it were, turned upside down, a position which, among other advantages, allowed of the <b>plungers</b> being covered with water, through which the air was forced and partially cooled. Another and important peculiarity was an air-reservoir which received air from the pump direct, and then passed it on to the diver, so that even if the pumps should stop working there would still be a supply of air flowing down to the diver for several minutes. The lamp referred to was also a novelty, inasmuch as it was supplied with air by a separate tube from the reservoir {{in the same way as}} if it were a separate human diver. The Henkie and Davis lamp burns, on the other hand, entirely without air, by means of certain acids. That of Siebe and Gorman is an electric-lamp. Both are said to be effective and economical.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the making}} of very rich men {{there is always a}} factor of good fortune and a factor of design and will.

Others, again, strike one as {{exceptionally}} lucky half-knaves. But there are others of a growth more deliberate and of an altogether higher personal quality. One takes such men as Mr. J.D.

To address this issue, the ordinary failure forms of <b>plunger</b> unit are summarized from the factory. Manufacturing stress is chosen as the key factor influencing the reliability of components existing in the surface of the <b>plunger</b> seat. And combining with physics of failure, the relation between manufacturing stress and other defect is discussed. After that, Ion implantation technology is used to change surface structure to optimize manufacturing defects. FEM is used to simulate pull-off force and residual stress.
