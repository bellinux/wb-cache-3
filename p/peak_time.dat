5|$|On 11 June 1928 the {{suburban}} line Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner was fully equipped with DC third rail gear. Five trains {{of the new}} DRG Class ET 165 – the type appropriately named Stadtbahn – went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Grünau {{as well as the}} Berlin Ringbahn, were fully electrified. Therefore, suburban services to Spandau could be moved from the long-distance tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when the ring became fully operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as <b>peak</b> <b>time</b> services.|$|E

25|$|Holders of Travelcards can add pay {{as you go}} credit {{on their}} Oyster cards. This credit is used as '{{extension}} fare' when the Oyster user travels beyond the zones in which their Travelcard is valid. This extension fare equals the regular Oyster fare for a journey from/to the respective station outside of the validity area of the Travelcard to/from the closest zone still covered by the Travelcard. To distinguish between Peak and Off-Peak fares, however, {{the start of the}} journey is taken into account. That means a traveller might be charged the (more expensive) peak fare as extension fare even if they had not yet left the area of validity of their Travelcard by the end of <b>peak</b> <b>time.</b> Conversely, however, a journey starting in the covered zones shortly {{before the start of the}} <b>peak</b> <b>time</b> will be charged as off-peak.|$|E

For example, a journey {{within a single}} zone cost €1.25 with the card, compared to €1.50 (€1.60 during <b>peak</b> <b>time)</b> single with a paper ticket, or €2.80 return. Daily, 7-day and 30-day tickets generally worked out cheaper, unless used only rarely.

The <b>peak</b> <b>time</b> of year for this is {{generally}} in October when {{it is not unusual for}} several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far flung islands first.|$|E
