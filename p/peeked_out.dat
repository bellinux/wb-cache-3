500|$|In France, {{clothing}} brands started {{creating the}} thong or le string in styles that encourage a projection above low-hung jeans, such as designs that had little jewels or luminous stars sewn into the rear. In India, thongs <b>peeked</b> <b>out</b> of low-rise jeans in page three parties and university bashes. Indian model Shefali Zariwala displayed a whale tail in the MTV Immies-winning music video [...] "Kaanta Lagaa" [...] and shot to fame and public debate in 2003. In Japan, clothing company Sanna's brought forward an extreme low-rise hip-hugging jeans design with built-in thong whale tails. R artist Sisqó rhapsodized about whale tails in his [...] "Thong Song" [...] "I {{like it when}} the beat goes da na da na/Baby make your booty go da na da na/Girl I know you wanna show da na da na/That thong th thong thong thong." [...] Pornographic film director Mike Metropolis made three films based on whale tails — Whale Tail (2005), Whale Tail I (2005) and Whale Tail II (2006) — with Mark Ashley in the lead. Another movie titled Whale Tail: Thong Dreams was released in 2005 featuring Sunny Lane and Kirsten Price. In 2003, web content developer Gavin Hamilton created the site whale-tail.com with content featuring whale tail display. Since then the domain has commanded a fair fetching price. The website has been quoted by ABC Radio, NY Times, FHM (UK) and Fuel Magazine (Australia), and has been nominated as a Best Adult Web Site by Australian Adult Industry Awards in 2008.|$|E

60|$|At {{that very}} instant Blacky's sharp eyes {{caught a glimpse}} of a gray form with broad wings, and in a perfect panic of fear Blacky began to fly as fast as he knew how for a thick spruce-tree not far away. He plunged in among the {{branches}} and hid in the thickest part he could find. With little shivers of fear running all over him, he <b>peeked</b> <b>out</b> and watched that big gray form. On broad wings it sailed over to that hollow stump. Two long legs with great curving claws reached down in, and a moment later that fat hen was disappearing over the tree tops. Blacky sighed with relief.|$|E

'Now,' says he, 'I'll barber you up, but if you say one word {{to me about the}} Grits getting in while I'm doing it I'll cut your throat with this razor,' says he. You wouldn't have thought mild little Gus could be so bloodthirsty, would you? Shows what party {{politics}} will do for a man. Marshall kept quiet and got his hair and beard disposed of and went home. When his old housekeeper heard him come upstairs she <b>peeked</b> <b>out</b> of her bedroom door to see whether 'twas him or the hired boy. And when she saw a strange man striding down the hall with a candle in his hand she screamed blue murder and fainted dead away. They had to send for the doctor before they could bring her to, and it was several days before she could look at Marshall without shaking all over." ...|$|E

For hours, he stumbled through the brush, bleeding, his clothes torn, until he made it to Hemet, where he pounded on the door of a bowling alley.

The Lords of Xibalba were dismayed at the twins success, until the twins were placed in Bat House.

50|$|In {{order to}} get Amaterasu {{out of the cave}} the other gods called Yao-yorozu-no-kami threw a party outside with wisdom of Omoikane. The goddess Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto {{performed}} a lewd dance, eliciting laughter. Amaterasu grew curious about the source of amusement and <b>peeked</b> <b>out</b> of the cave entrance. She became fascinated by her own reflection in the Yata no Kagami mirror which the other gods had crafted and hung before the cave for that purpose, and stood transfixed. Ame-no-tajikarao then forced the cave open and the world was bathed in light once again. As Amaterasu stepped out of the cave a holy seal was applied to it so that she could never go back into hiding.|$|E

5000|$|The {{windows in}} all the family's rooms were sealed shut and covered with {{newspapers}} (later painted with whitewash on 15 May). The family's only source of ventilation was a fortochka in the grand duchesses' bedroom, but peeking out of it was strictly forbidden; in May a sentry fired a shot at Anastasia when she <b>peeked</b> <b>out.</b> After repeated requests, {{one of the two}} windows in the tsar and tsarina's corner bedroom was unsealed on 23 June 1918. However, the guards were ordered to increase their surveillance accordingly and the prisoners were warned not {{to look out the window}} or attempt to signal anyone outside, on pain of being shot. From this window, they could only see the spire of the Voznesensky Cathedral located across the road from the house. [...] An iron grille was installed on 11 July after Alexandra ignored repeated warnings from Yurovsky not to stand too close to the open window.|$|E
50|$|According to the legend, {{the wealthy}} Hintersteiner farmers {{had a huge}} {{argument}} about a spring. Even on the solemn festival of Corpus Christi they argued the entire day, which then ended in an unseemly scuffle. Bright and early the very next day, the dairymaid for the farmers, a very proper, sober woman who had long found the argument quite absurd, set off across the meadow to milk the cows and saw a small puddle of water {{in front of the}} house, which had never been there before. She shook her head as she saw it, but went on her way. It took her a long time to find the cows and she was surprised to find them huddling together in a dip in the landscape. She milked them quickly so as {{to get back to the}} farm and get on with her work, but when she walked up out of the dip, she was confronted with a lake where only the tip of just one house <b>peeked</b> <b>out</b> of the water.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a string}} of counterattacks by Egyptian ground forces during the Israeli {{offensive}} in the Yom-Kippur War, Israeli Defense Forces were ambitious {{to put an end}} to the said counterattacks. On October 17, 1973, Israeli forces conducted an ambush against Egyptian tank divisions commanded by Ahmad Halalmi Hassan, whose force consisted of 94 Soviet made T-62's and 40 other armored APC's, as they were advancing towards Israeli occupied territories in the Sinai. The Israeli forces consisted of 14 M60 Patton Tanks, they conducted the ambush by creating an [...] "L" [...] formation and attacking from a location in which the Egyptian Tank Brigade had not anticipated an hostile presence. Because the Israeli forces were outnumbered in the battle, they used tactics wherein their tanks <b>peeked</b> <b>out</b> over the hill, fired one shot, then descended to take cover from enemy fire, this process would be repeated by every tank in Avraham's contingent. In the end the Egyptian advance was halted suffering heavy losses, whilst the Israeli forces only withstood the loss of three tanks.|$|E
