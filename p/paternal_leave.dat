50|$|One idea is {{that women}} are given {{educational}} and working opportunities meaning {{that they will be}} able to make their mark in society as a whole and as individuals.

30|$|Among such {{programs}} are paid maternity leave, where many countries have programs providing extensive programs—frequently of a duration longer even than in many advanced Western economies. As {{has also been}} noted elsewhere (Kuddo 2009 : 78 - 79), these extensive programs may adversely affect women’s labor market participation, as well as lead to actual or perceived erosion of skills, and, perhaps even more importantly, act to create reluctance {{on the part of}} employers to hire women of childbearing age, to avoid the associated indirect costs such as replacement workers. And the longer the leave, the greater the perceived disincentive from the employers’ point of view. As also noted earlier, the parental leaves prevalent in some transition countries—since they frequently can be expected to be taken by the mother—may effectively act as an additional maternity leave. To counter this cycle, therefore, one possibility is to bring the leave durations more in line with those in Western economies—though, as also suggested by Kuddo (2009 : 78), so as to continually help support women’s access to the labor market, this should be combined with better access to child care facilities. Alternatively, extension of <b>paternal</b> <b>leaves</b> may be an option. In many transition countries, these are either absent or of an extremely short duration, sometimes only 1  week (Kuddo 2009 : Table A 10). Introducing (or extending) <b>paternal</b> <b>leaves</b> of a much longer duration would help level the playing field for men and women more in the labor market, since employers now would have to expect a potential leave of any employee of childbearing age (or for the males, with a wife of childbearing age), regardless of gender. As a possible side effect, such institutionalized gender equality in terms of child-birth related leaves may also help bring about more tolerance and openness to childbearing as a reason for detaching from the labor market for a shorter or longer period, regardless of the gender of the worker.|$|R

50|$|Stoltenberg {{government}} (majority government {{consisting of}} the Labour Party, the Centre Party and the Socialist Left Party) declared in the first Soria Moria declaration in 2005 {{that they wanted to}} expand the paternal quota to ten weeks, and in the Soria Moria 2 Declaration in 2009 extended <b>paternal</b> <b>leave</b> to 14 weeks. The expansion occurred in several stages, again against the Conservatives and the Progress Party votes. Furthermore, the parental leave consisted of three parts- following a pattern from Sweden and Iceland. This division meant that 9 weeks were reserved for the mother, 14 weeks were reserved for the father, and the remaining weeks could be freely shared between the parents. Parents can choose to extend their leave to 26-36 weeks, and then receive either 80-100% pay during the benefit period. If the mother or father chooses not to take out their part of the leave, their part cannot be transferred or used by the other part.|$|E
5000|$|Parental leave is an {{employee}} benefit that provides paid or unpaid time off work {{to care for}} a child. [...] This includes maternity, paternity, and adoption leave. Extending the leave for fathers as well as mothers helps close the motherhood penalty because it helps to reduce the responsibility of care work on mothers. According to Motherhood Manifesto, family leave will also help out the company by saving money on training and recruitment because this leads to higher job satisfaction and in return will lead to better work productivity. A criticism of <b>paternal</b> <b>leave</b> is that even with the options available more mothers take the leave than fathers due to social norms and economic reasoning. Men are typically paid more than women, so if the leave is unpaid then it makes economical sense to have the woman take the leave. Therefore, primary responsibility of care work still typically falls on the woman. One potential solution to this problem is to cover a greater proportion of earnings during paternity leave. Men appear to be more responsive than women to the coverage of earnings during leave and so paying them more during their leave is one way to encourage fathers to actually take advantage of paternity leave. Giving men incentives to take on more care duties at home attempts to change the norms around care work.|$|E

40|$|It was {{believed}} that adolescents delay more and more the emancipation from home and this became an updated topic for the social results that it has today. Our objective is to measure the relationship children- parents to know if, {{at the end of}} the century, adolescents consider it part of their process of growth or, as it was before, a necessity to be free from them. Hypothesis : do current adolescents cohabit in a climate that takes them to be less urged to achieve their independence from parents home? Method : free interviews and semi directed ones with standardized protocol. Results : during 1994 - 1999 - two hundred and eighty Argentine (18 - 20 years, both sexes) said to be conformed with the relationship (84 % with their mothers and 72 % with their fathers), that the family climate was pleasant(85 %) and that they were respected in their decisions (88 % mother and 85 % father). They thought in becoming independent (64 %), not to get rid of their parents (85 %) but because they will feel happy (71 %),or to make their own experience (65 %), to achieve independence (57 %) or because they felt already mature (52 %). Most of them (53 %) neither cared get rid of their parents nor felt fear doing that (56 %) and did not feel (85 %) to be loosing their parents.   It was confirmed that there is a delay to live independently. Such a postponement is not only owed to the economic situation, mostly the harmonic family climate predisposes to continue living with parents that embody new <b>paternal</b> models.. <b>Leaving</b> home is associated more to the pleasure of managering the own life than to getting rid of oppresor parents.   </div...|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} discovered B chromosome in the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma kaykai {{was found to}} be transmitted through males only. Shortly after fertilization, this chromosome eliminates the <b>paternal</b> chromosome set <b>leaving</b> the maternal chromosomes and itself intact. Consequently, the sex ratio in these wasps is changed in favour of males by modifying fertilized diploid eggs into male haploid offspring. In this study, we show that in fertilized eggs at the first mitosis the paternal sex ratio (PSR) chromosome condenses the paternal chromosomes into a so-called paternal chromatin mass (PCM). During this process, the PSR chromosome is morphologically unaffected and is incorporated into the nucleus containing the maternal chromosomes. In the first five mitotic divisions, 67 % of the PCMs are associated with one of the nuclei in the embryo. Furthermore, in embryos with an unassociated PCM, all nuclei are at the same mitotic stage, whereas 68 % of the PCM-associated nuclei are at a different mitotic phase than the other nuclei in the embryo. Our observations reveal an obvious similarity of the mode of action of the PSR chromosome in T kaykai with that of the PSR-induced paternal genome loss in the unrelated wasp Nasonia vitripennis...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the problem}} of {{anorexia}} is taken up by giving preference, as {{the high point of}} observation, to the area of the so-called relationship with the Other, with particular reference to the unconscious vicissitudes of the Self, mother and father triangulation, in the context of two original psychoanalytical concepts: namely, A. Ferrari's oedipal constellation, and J. Lacan's oedipal significance of the “Name of the Father”. The deepening of these concepts, together with their relation to {{the problem of}} the space (or its lack) between the self and the Other, leads to the conclusion that a “deficit” of the <b>paternal,</b> oedipal function-which <b>leaves</b> the individual exposed to the unbearable anguish of being fused with a dangerous, absorbing maternal Other-may lead this individual to save him/herself from the danger of being nullified in the Other by making an extreme attempt to flee into the withdrawal of the “anorexic choice”. From this viewpoint, one crucial moment in the analytical process is referred to recovering the paternal oedipal function in order to redress the previously destabilized oedipal order. The crucial stages in the treatment of a female patient are gone over again in order to visualize how the dynamics of the space between the self and the Other are reflected on the anorexic person„s experience of her body. </p...|$|R

The very hour which some damsels of the present day, as well of her own as of higher degree, would consider as the natural period of commencing an evening of pleasure, brought, in her opinion, awe and solemnity in it; and the resolution she had taken had a strange, daring, and adventurous character, to which she could hardly reconcile herself when the moment approached for putting it into execution. Her hands trembled as she snooded her fair hair beneath the riband, then the only ornament or cover which young unmarried women wore on their head, and as she adjusted the scarlet tartan screen or muffler made of plaid, which the Scottish women wore, much in the fashion of the black silk veils still a part of female dress in the Netherlands.

40|$|U luneti kapele bl. Ivana Trogirskog koju je Nikola Firentinac klesao oko 1480., jedan od anđela uz tron na kojemu Krist kruni Bogorodicu ima preko lica veo kroz koji mu se provide oči, nos i usta. Ta kiparska bravura upućuje, po mišljenju autora, na poznatu pathos-formulu koju donosi Albertijev opis jedne slike Cipranina Timanta s prikazom Ifigenijina žrtvovanja. Mnogo toga se u Kapeli može opisati terminima i sintagmama iz De pictura. Retorike frizura Firentinčevih figura, kao i svilene tunike i perizome njegovih spiritella slijede Albertijeve preporuke, a analizira se još nekoliko djela Nikole Firentinca izrazitih pathosformula, koja bi se mogla interpretirati kao idealni primjeri onoga što Alberti traži od dobro komponirane historiae. Članak na koncu razlaže kako je bilo moguće da Firentinčeve historiae budu u Trogiru i Dalmaciji prihvaćene s mnogo empatije. The Chapel of the Blessed John of Trogir is {{the most}} graceful {{architectural}} and sculptural unit in the Croatian early Renaissance, and the most elegant space of the time outside Tuscany. We still have in our possession its baptismal certificate, as it were, an uncommonly detailed contract concerning the beginning of its construction entered into on January 4, 1468, in Trogir, between {{the master of the}} fabric of the cathedral, Niccolò Ciprianus, the stone mason Andrija Aleši and Coriolanus Cipiko, who had a power of attorney from Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino. From {{the point of view of}} sculpture, however, the chapel is primarily the work of Niccolò di Giovanni (recorded for the first time in 1464, in Šibenik). The formation of the liquidly folded clothing, often not at all accounted for by the movements of the limbs themselves, and the lithe and bony arms with the quivering vivacity of the fingers are characteristic of Niccolò. In the inventory of the sculpture of the time in Dalmatia, we will not easily find anyone carving “sculture togate” with such an auto-mannerism. Still, in contrast to the formalism of most of Donatello’s heirs, among whom he has to be counted, Niccolò had enough talent to reach the ultimate borders of Renaissance naturalism in the rendering of human expression. The iconography of the chapel is entirely medieval, but is transposed into the architectural vocabulary of the Renaissance. The model for it was the chapel of the patron saint of Zadar, St Simeon, incorporated in the Church of St Mary the Great, which disappeared as early as the 16 th century. It might be said that the programme of the chapel in Trogir is an iconographic amalgam of elements of the Last Judgement cycle. It is brought to a close by the Coronation of the Virgin (completed not earlier than the late 1470 s). Nine concerned angels (coro de anzeli) alongside the broad throne, shown in high relief (de più che mezo relevo), clearly counting on the view from the chapel from below, are representatives of the nine choirs of angels. It is worth keeping in mind at least the figure of the eyes, nose and mouth of which are visible beneath the billowing veil of stone. In this piece of bravura sculpture Niccolò seems to be anticipating Antonio Corradini (1688 - 1752) who patented and developed this theme, “a far trasparire il modellatodei corpi sotto le vesti”. It seems that, at that time, there were no equivalent attempts to try in the facture of the stone to depict in a painterly way the transparency of the material, except in the case of two works of Mino da Fiesole – Madonna and Child in the Cleveland Museum of Art from the Ciborio della neve once on the papal altar in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and the Madonna from the Kress Collection in the National Gallery in Washington – where the sculptor attempted to depict an ear pushing through the folds of the silken maphorion. All in all this solution suggests the familiar pathos-formula that is given by Alberti’s description of an ancient picture with a depiction of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia: “They praise Timanthes of Cyprus for the painting in which he sur passed Colotes, because, when he had made Calchas [a priest] sad and Ulysseseven sadder at the sacrifice of Iphigenia, and employed all his art and skill on the grief-stricken Menelaus, he could find no suitable way to represent the expression of her disconsolate father [Agamemnon]; so he covered his head with a veil, and thus left more for the onlooker to meditate on about his grief than he could see with the eye. ” (De pictura, 42). In my judgement, this representation in Trogir, previously unnoticed, should be added to the proofs of the way Niccolò resorted to the suggestions given in De pictura, particularly those related to Alberti’s theory of expression. Alberti’s resources were – as is known – primarily Quintillian (Inst. Orat. 2. 13), Cicero (De Oratore, 22 : 74) and Pliny, as well as Valerius Maximus (Memorabilia, VIII, 11, 6). Pliny says that a painter had curtained the father’s face “which he was unable to depict in an appropriate way” but adds: “Indeed Timanthes is the only artist in whose works more is always implied than is depicted, and whose execution, through consummate, is always surpassed by his genius” (Hist. Nat. 35 : 73 - 74). Cicero thought that the painter was masterly, like a consummate orator, in choosing decorous restraint instead of indecorous expression of the emotions. And Quintillian too concluded that Timanthes had settled the insoluble problem of the direct portrayal of over-powerful <b>paternal</b> feelings, <b>leaving</b> them to the observer’s imagination. Alberti goes a step further, saying that Timanthes did not leave the viewer just to conjecture about the paternal feelings, rather than he contemplated them – meditaretur – the verb used in the 15 th century for a kind of thought and feeling that a religious painting should evoke. According to Alberti, then, the artist did not hide Agamemnon’s head because it would be inappropriate to show the great pain that he was, as father, going through, rather in order to intensify the emotional content of the picture and its effect on the observer. Expressions of sorrow, pain, despair and resignation on the faces of the angels around the synthronos in the Trogir scene are sequenced in an expressive crescendo, with the intention of the sculptor in the face hidden in the billowing pleat of Christ’s robe to show the emotional climax of the scene that bears all the features of what Alberti calls a historia. Instead of the standard choir of angel choristers and musicians – dead silence. Much in the chapel can be described in the terms and phrases from De pictura. One of the chief preoccupations of Alberti was the physical expression of mental states related, for example, to the depicting of laughter and the movements of inanimate things like the hair. Some of Niccolò’s spiritelli, putti and seraphs, and the statues in the chapel are as if they were intended to respond to the challenge that Alberti’s writing poses. One could, for example, make a whole gallery of faces on the topic of the rhetoric of hairstyles of the Fiorentino’s figures. They often seem like wigs, and, one would say, literally follow Alberti’s proposal: “I should like all the seven movements I spoke of to appear in hair. Let it twist around as if to tie itself in a knot, and wave upwards in the air like flames, let it wave beneath other hair and sometimes lift on one side and another. “ (De pictura, 45). I believe we will not go far wrong if we assume that Niccolò had Alberti’s remark in mind when he carved silken tunics and loincloths for his spiritelli: „The pleasing result will be that those sides of the bodies the wind strikes will appear under covering of the clothes almost as if they were naked, since the clothes are made to adhere to the body by the force of the wind; on the other sides the clothing blown about by the wind will wave appropriately up in the air. But in this motion caused by the wind one should be careful that movements of clothing do not take place against wind, and that they are neither too irregular nor excessive in their extent. “ (De pictura, 45) There are several other works of Niccolò di Giovanni of marked pathosformulae that might be interpreted as ideal specimens of what Albert seeks from a well composed historia. Indeed, Samo Štefanac has already written of the Lamentation Over The Dead Christ (1469) in the lunette of the Sobota Tomb in the Church of St. Dominic at Trogir in which Christ is shown according to the Alberti description of a Roman sarcophagus with a depiction of Meleager’s death, underlining in particularly the function of the figure of John the Evangelist, with his frontally fixed gaze, in the role of the figure that leads the viewer into the historia, suggesting the conclusion that Niccolò knew De pictura, as well as Donatello’s later works. The composition of the relief is without doubt Niccolò’s invention, of vibrant and genuinely touching emotions, and is indeed along the lines laid down by Donatello, but in the execution a much larger part of Aleši’s chisel has to be assumed. So great is the difference in the quality that divides this Lamentation from that which Niccolò only a year or two later carved on the Altar over the tomb of Petar Cippico in the Church of St. John the Baptist at Trogir. Štefanac sees in the readability of the composition of the Cippico Lamentation, also a possible confirmation of the assumption that Niccolò knew Alberti’s treatise, especially the locus classicus that says that for more exalted emotion it is better to show fewer figures (De pictura, 40). This is a relief that was ascribed to Niccolò by Folnesics, who stated that it would surely have been ascribed to Donatello himself had it lain in Tuscany. In the whole and in all the details it would seem that it is a literal and consistent illustration of Alberti’s requirements, illustrated with the picture of an ancient sarcophagus: “They praise a ‘historia’ in Rome, in which the dead Meleager is being carried away, because those who are bearing the burden appear to be distressed and to strain with every limb, while in the dead man there is no member that does not seem completely lifeless; they all hang loose; hands, fingers, neck, all droop inertly down, all combine together to represent death. This {{is the most}} difficult thing of all to do, for to represent the limbs of a body entirely at rest is as much the sign of an excellent artist as to render them all alive and in action. So in every painting the principle should be observed that all members should fulfil their function according to the action performed, in such a way that not even the smallest limb fails to play its appropriate part, that the members of the dead appear dead down to the smallest detail, and those of the living completely alive. ” (De pictura, 37). Or, as Dante would say: Morti li morti, vivi parean vivi. (Purg. XI, 66 - 67). In Trogir and Dalmatia it was very possible that Niccolò’s historia would be received with a great deal of empathy. It is enough to call to mind the heritage of the Laments. The anonymous “makers” from the 13 th century on were dramati sing the theme of Mater Dolorosa, the gestures of her pain and the rhetoric of her dirge. The highly ritualised Planctus was subjected to the rules set by a centurieslong tradition of fixed rhythmical gestures, in fact, in a paradoxical way, impersonal gestures, excluding any conduct that might cross the line behind which it would be dangerous for the physical integrity of the person performing them. It is very clear: the lamentations funeraticiae that were performed by these wailers were subject to a whole forest of ritual conventions related to “this is the way one weeps”, in spite of the constant demand that the planctus should be constantly stylistically renewed and thematically varied. The central topic – so characteristic of the ancient world of Mediterranean religions – was: to know how to weep (saper piangere) over death. With the high tide of Christianity this specific cultural institute came under fierce and lasting attack, for of course all these pagan customs were a direct antithesis to the Christian ideology concerning death, which did not accept that people should behave, to use Paul’s phrase “like the others, who have no hope”. The Catholic Church, then, for centuries, endeavoured to modify these rituals and to replace them with its own funeral rite, giving it a Christian meaning. Among the oldest items of information about Dalmatian wailers is a mention of them in a description of Dubrovnik, written in 1444 by a teacher of the school in Dubrovnik, Filip de Diversis of Lucca. At the end of the 15 th century, the Dubrovnik Republic banned them. The Šibenik Humanist Juraj Šižgorić describes the wailing of women that were more moving than the keening of Thetis. Historian Krsto Stošić says that in his time, in the 1930 s, on the island of Krapanj, there was still a “wailing school” where the women were taught how to “cry nice”. This custom, which for centuries there had been efforts to stamp out, and which has impressive reflections in Croatian Renaissance sculpting, only recently died out. There is no wonder then that there should have been such a highly expressive motif of the Lamentation on the altar over the tomb of Petar Cippico (“one of the first archaeologists of Humanist Europe” – says Mommsen), commissioned by his son Coriolanus, a Humanist of the highest calibre, or that Niccolò di Giovanni and his workshop should have carved a whole series of reliefs on the same theme in Trogir, on Čiovo, in Split, Hvar and Jelsa. There are of course a number of other equally convincing signals that confirm Niccolò’s great familiarity with Alberti’s writing, as well as his sure mastery of it, particularly with respect to one of the key problems that he raised – the concept of the composition (compositio), as a whole hierarchy of forms and elements that in concinnity (concinnitas) made up the whole of the picture. We are sure that he understood more than well that the greatest value of the historia was in the invention itself. What a pity it was that Niccolò did not make historiae with depictions of the four miracles of the saint on the three sides of the marble sarcophagus that, according to the contract, should have stood in the altar in the chapel...|$|R

S. do not support long periods of family leave after childbirth, although some states are starting to change this. As such, it is vital to understand how length of family leave during the first year after childbirth affects families' health and wellbeing. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the association between family leave length, which includes leave taking by mothers and fathers, and behavioral and physical health outcomes among new mothers. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Birth Cohort, we examine measures of depression, overall health status, and substance use. We use a standard OLS as well as an instrumental variables approach with county-level employment conditions and state-level maternity leave policies as identifying instruments. The results suggest that longer maternity leave from work, both paid and un-paid, is associated with declines in depressive symptoms, a reduction in the likelihood of severe depression, and an improvement in overall maternal health. We also find that having a spouse that did not take any <b>paternal</b> <b>leave</b> after childbirth is associated with higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms. We do not find, however, that length of <b>paternal</b> <b>leave</b> is associated with overall maternal health, and we find only mixed evidence that leave length after childbirth affects maternal alcohol use and smoking. ...|$|E

In this preliminary step, I conducted an inductive data analysis, identifying the recurring themes across the articles and grouping them accordingly (e.g., <b>paternal</b> <b>leave,</b> technology and child development, early schooling). Then, I performed a more in-depth reading of the 43 news reports that addressed, at a national level 2, the topic of early schooling. For each article, I conducted a first round of coding, according to three main codes: (a) arguments for expanding preschool, (b) arguments against expanding preschool and (c) spokesmen (i.e., whose voices were cited in the articles).|$|E

But despite a relatively good day care provision Icelandic parents still need to bridge a care gap between the parental leave and available day care. Using a sample of qualitative interviews with 14 Icelandic couples this paper shows that the bridging of the care gap results in gendered patterns where mothers takes a longer leave with reduced income, and fathers make use of their ear marked <b>paternal</b> <b>leave.</b> I apply the concept of strategies when presenting the way these parents arrange {{for the care of}} their small children. </span...|$|E
