Using polarization-dependent time-domain THz spectroscopy, we have studied the anisotropic conduction properties of free carriers in a thin film of highly aligned SWNTs. When the THz <b>polarization</b> <b>was</b> <b>parallel</b> to the nanotube alignment direction, there was strong absorption, while virtually no absorption was observed when the THz <b>polarization</b> <b>was</b> perpendicular to the nanotube axis. Through a proper model, the THz complex dynamic conductivity of the SWNTs was extracted and showed a non-Drude-like frequency dependence, with the real part monotonically increasing with increasing frequency and exhibiting a peak around 4. 5 THz. Furthermore, the reduced linear dichroism was calculated to be 3, which demonstrates the nematic order parameter to be 1.

30|$|Shear wave {{splitting}} is {{a phenomenon}} in which an S-wave propagating through anisotropic media splits into two quasi S-waves. Each quasi S-wave polarizes into orthogonal directions with different velocities. In the case of shear wave splitting caused by the preferred orientation of cracks, the quasi S-wave polarized parallel to crack orientation travels faster than the other quasi S-wave. The orientation of faster S-wave polarization is therefore parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal compressional stress (e.g., Crampin, 1987; Kaneshima et al., 1987). In contrast, the anisotropic behavior near faults {{is different from that}} around the fault just after the earthquake occurrence. The orientation of faster S-wave <b>polarization</b> <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> to the fault strike (e.g., Zhang and Schwartz, 1994). Tadokoro et al.
