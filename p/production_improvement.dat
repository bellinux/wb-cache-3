50|$|Although the {{government}} was criticized for focusing on exports rather than on food crops under the ERP, by the early 1990s the Provisional National Defence Council had begun to address the need to increase local production of food. In early 1991, {{the government}} announced that one goal of the Medium Term agricultural Development Program 1991-2000 was to attain food self-sufficiency and security by the year 2000. To this end, the government sought to improve extension services for farmers and to improve crop-disease research. Despite the statements concerning the importance of food crops, however, the plan was still heavily oriented toward market <b>production,</b> <b>improvement</b> of Ghana's balance-of-payments position, and provision of materials for local industrial production. Furthermore, the government planned to rely more heavily on the private sector for needed services and to reduce {{the role of the}} public sector, a clear disadvantage for subsistence producers. In particular, industrial tree crops such as cocoa, coffee, and oil palm seedlings were singled out for assistance. Clearly, agricultural sectors that could not produce foreign exchange earnings were assigned a lower priority under the ERP.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which <b>Production</b> <b>Improvement</b> Function, had {{affected}} the Corporate Operational Efficiency of the Nigerian manufacturing industry. Three hypotheses were formulated and questionnaire were distributed to eighty respondents in the eighty sampled manufacturing firms from the one hundred in the industry, quoted in the Stock Exchange(Fact Book 2009). Sixty two copies of the questionnaire were retrieved. These with the financial statements of the firms were used for the analysis. From its findings, the study revealed that production planning and control have significant impacts on operational efficiency of Nigerian manufacturing industry; while production scheduling has an insignificant and weak influence on operational efficiency alone. This finding implies that <b>production</b> <b>improvement</b> function significantly affects the operational efficiency of firms. Based on these, the study recommends among others, that the Nigerian manufacturing industry should efficiently and effectively operationalize the all embracing <b>production</b> <b>improvement</b> function, especially in the area of production scheduling, in order to restore the industry as the base of all development...|$|E

40|$|The global {{speed of}} change within the {{manufacturing}} industry forces companies to constantly improve production performance. In that effort, performance measures {{are critical for}} driving and managing <b>production</b> <b>improvements.</b> Two {{of the most commonly}} used measures in operations are productivity and overall equipment efficiency (OEE). However, the potential of using these measures as improvement drivers is not fully utilized in industry today due, for example, to ambiguities in definitions and their interpretation. A study of available theory indicates a gap between these implications from a theoretical perspective vs. the industrial perspective. Bridging this theory-practice gap implies great potential for competitiveness and growth in manufacturing, since the latent production capacity that could be utilized is tremendous. Even if a high degree of complexity in definition and calculation when applied in operational conditions might be perceived, this paper will show that a systematically used combined set of OEE and productivity measures can successfully drive <b>production</b> <b>improvements.</b> Also, two new productivity measures for driving improvements at the shop floor level are proposed. The empirical findings are based on a two-year case study within a manufacturing company in the automotive industry using an interactive research approach.
