25|$|High-resistance {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the fault current to 25A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault <b>protection</b> <b>relay</b> must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|E

25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital <b>protection</b> <b>relay</b> {{can replace}} {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|E

50|$|The Flexible Plug and Play project, {{according}} to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network {{in order to improve}} its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement.1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a lineâs capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak.2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system.3) Modern <b>Protection</b> <b>Relay.</b> The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) protection relays which cannot handle reverse power flows. Itâs said the modern <b>protection</b> <b>relay</b> will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations.4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses isolator switches at Normally Open Points (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used.5) Quadrature Booster transformer. Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three incoming 33kV circuits. The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid.|$|E
