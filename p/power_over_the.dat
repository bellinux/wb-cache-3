5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; {{they were used to}} project Spanish <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E
5|$|Following Santer, Romano Prodi took office. The Amsterdam Treaty had {{increased}} the Commission's powers and Prodi was dubbed {{by the press}} as something akin to a Prime Minister.

5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Iazyges. There were offers from the princes of the Iazyges to supply troops, but these were denied based on the fear that they might revolt or desert in a war.|$|E

5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Raja of Panagal {{introduced}} the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill. As per this bill, trusts were established to maintain temple funds and given complete <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> administration of temples. This act evoked severe protests from some {{sections of the}} assembly which {{felt that this was}} an intrusion in the religious affairs of the populace. However, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi gave his support to the bill even while expressing his concern over some of its provisions.|$|E

5|$|Since the Romans used a form {{of direct}} democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each {{assembly}}. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate's <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power {{came in the form}} of vetoes handed down by other magistrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority with powers gained through the Budgetary Treaties of the 1970s and the Lisbon Treaty. The EU budget {{is subject to}} a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.|$|E
5|$|The {{partitioning}} powers (in particular, Russia) {{demanded that}} the Sejm pass further reforms, {{with the intent of}} strengthening their <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth. The original commission was allowed to work till January 1774, extending the Sejm, which was adjourned again. The commission was unable to carry out its changes in that period, and thus it was allowed to extend its deliberations once more; there were ultimately seven such extensions.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} English Church {{had been}} a matter for great debate in the {{years prior to the}} 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had {{traditionally}} exercised a great deal of <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.|$|E

In the end, <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Church and education was ceded to the Russian Party, while the King maintained a veto over the decision of the Synod of Bishops. This was to keep balance and avoid discrediting Greece in the eyes of Western Europe as a backward, religiously intolerant society.|$|E
5|$|When {{war began}} in April 1861, Stevens {{argued that the}} Confederates were revolutionaries, to be crushed by force.

Speaker Galusha Grow, whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republican (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or Moderate Republicans), appointed him as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

He controlled ten thousands of men with arrow and bow, establishing his <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western region. He occupied the land of Wusun and moved his tent to Qianquan north of Tashkent. All of the princes of western region assumed the Turk office of Jielifa. Tong Yehu Kaghan also sent a Tutun to monitor them for imposition. The power of Western Turks had never reached such a state before".|$|E

Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result of Austria's defeat, Kaiser Franz Joseph was forced to accede to Hungarian demands for greater autonomy, and the country became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867. The two halves of the Dual Monarchy held veto <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other, and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet.
