40|$|The article {{deals with}} the word {{formative}} structure of Polish dialectal <b>plant</b> <b>names.</b> The author presents simple and compound dialectal <b>plant</b> <b>names</b> and discusses their structure. What is emphasized is {{the richness of the}} affixes in the formation of dialectal <b>plant</b> <b>names,</b> including affixes untypical of particular categories, and the bi- and multipartite structure of the names.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{perception}} {{and use of}} plants correspond with common <b>plant</b> <b>names.</b> The study of <b>plant</b> <b>names</b> may give insight into historical and recent use of <b>plants.</b> Methods <b>Plant</b> <b>names</b> in dictionaries and folklore have been evaluated. A etymological analysis of the names is provided. Onomasiological and semasiological aspects have been considered. Therefore, species named with names {{related to each other}} have been selected. Results <b>Plant</b> <b>names</b> containing the stem dag - or deg - may belong to either of two categories: incenses or thorny <b>plants.</b> <b>Plants</b> <b>named</b> in durn - have been in use as psychopharmaca. The name rymo points not to Rome but to the use of plants as anodyne or psychopharmaca. </p...|$|R

2500|$|A {{major change}} in the {{approach}} to writing about botanical pharmacology is signalled in the De Medicamentis. As texts associated with Mediterranean medicine traveled west and north with the expanding borders of the Roman empire, the plants required by drug recipes were no longer familiar, and the descriptions or illustrations provided by earlier herbals failed to correspond to indigenous flora. Marcellus’s practice of offering synonyms is one attempt to bridge this gap. He often provides a string of correspondences: the Greek <b>plant</b> <b>name</b> polygonos is first glossed as sanguinaria in Latin (1.2), then as [...] "what we [...] call rubia" [...] (1.44); in the same chapter polygonos is given as another name for millefolium (1.28), and identified elsewhere as equivalent to verbena (10.5). Of {{the dozen or so}} Celtic plant names, ten are provided with or as synonyms for Greek or Latin names. A preoccupation with naming rather than description is a characteristic also of medieval herbals. The problems of identifying plants may have been an intellectual attraction for Marcellus’s Renaissance editor Cornarius, whose botanical work emphasized the value of words over illustration.|$|E
2500|$|Waley {{suggests}} that Theravadins would take suukaramaddava (the {{contents of the}} Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as pig-soft, to mean [...] "soft flesh of a pig" [...] or [...] "pig's soft-food", that is, after Neumann, a soft food favoured by pigs, {{assumed to be a}} truffle. He argues (also after Neumann) that as [...] "(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical", as there are several plants known to have suukara- (pig) as part of their names, and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, suukaramaddava could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator Buddhaghosa who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that {{it may have been a}} local <b>plant</b> <b>name</b> and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.|$|E
