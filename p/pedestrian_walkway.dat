5|$|After the disincorporation, the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} former village was revitalized by artists and entrepreneurs, who purchased and restored Main Street buildings that had fallen into disrepair. Since the 1990s, Rosendale has hosted many street festivals. The former village has {{had a number of}} notable buildings, including four churches. Two notable bridges span the Rondout Creek in the village: a road bridge that carries Route32, and the Rosendale trestle, a former railroad bridge currently being renovated as a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>walkway.</b> Joppenbergh Mountain, named after Rosendale's founder, borders the village and has been the site of numerous ski jumping competitions and mine collapses.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania {{released}} $700,000 {{to design}} repairs {{on the remaining}} towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005. In late 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) put forward an $8million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors' center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers. The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Sky Walk consists of a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>walkway</b> to an observation deck with a glass floor {{at the end of}} the bridge that allows views of the bridge and the valley directly below. The walkway cost $4.3million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5million in tourism revenue for the region.|$|E

5|$|Five bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across the Indian River Inlet. The first was a creosote timber trestle bridge built in 1934; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the inlet. It {{was replaced by a}} concrete-and-steel swing bridge, the first to be named for Cullen, construction of which began in 1938. This swing bridge, which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) <b>pedestrian</b> <b>walkway</b> and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the inlet, killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel swing bridge completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} bicycling {{included}} a suspension ramp {{that would allow}} bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without dismounting their bikes. Due {{to the length of}} time any new downtown bridge would take to be built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, which happens yearly during Thunder Over Louisville, bicyclists preferred the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge. By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>walkway.</b> With the approach ramps, the bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side with construction still continuing on the Indiana ramp. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled lights that can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties.|$|E
