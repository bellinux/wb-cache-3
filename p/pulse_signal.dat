2500|$|The Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), the {{outermost}} {{component of the}} inner detector, {{is a combination of}} a straw tracker and a transition radiation detector. The detecting elements are drift tubes (straws), each four millimetres in diameter and up to 144 centimetres long. [...] The uncertainty of track position measurements (position resolution) is about 200micrometres. This is not as precise as those for the other two detectors, but it was necessary to reduce the cost of covering a larger volume and to have transition radiation detection capability. [...] Each straw is filled with gas that becomes ionized when a charged particle passes through. [...] The straws are held at about −1,500V, driving the negative ions to a fine wire down the centre of each straw, producing a current <b>pulse</b> (<b>signal)</b> in the wire. [...] The wires with signals create a pattern of 'hit' straws that allow the path of the particle to be determined. [...] Between the straws, materials with widely varying indices of refraction cause ultra-relativistic charged particles to produce transition radiation and leave much stronger signals in some straws. [...] Xenon and argon gas is used {{to increase the number of}} straws with strong signals. [...] Since the amount of transition radiation is greatest for highly relativistic particles (those with a speed very near the speed of light), and because particles of a particular energy have a higher speed the lighter they are, particle paths with many very strong signals can be identified as belonging to the lightest charged particles: electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. The TRT has about 298,000 straws in total.|$|E

In this paper the efficacy of signal processing techniques in extracting useful information from wrist <b>pulse</b> <b>signals</b> has been demonstrated by using signals recorded before lunch and after lunch conditions. We have used correlation between probabilities of recurrence which is a recent nonlinear measure of synchronization, as well as Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is a traditionally used measure of synchronization. Statistical analysis using two-sample t-test is performed, which shows that there is significantly different synchronizations between signals acquired before lunch and those acquired after lunch. Moreover, upon performing RCE-SVM classification, the nonlinear synchronization measure showed a classification accuracy of 91. 6 % against the accuracy of 80. 5 % for correlation. These results show that the new nonlinear synchronization measure is effective in distinguishing the changes taking place after having lunch.
