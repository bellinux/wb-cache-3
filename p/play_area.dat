The area includes many attractions such as a ball pit, slides, climbing nets, and a suspension bridge. Added in 2008, Bigfoot's Mudslide gets its name from Westmoreland County's reputation for the most sightings in Pennsylvania of Bigfoot, an alleged ape-like creature said to inhabit remote forests.|$|E

50|$|Behind the {{transparent}} front panel {{there is a}} vertical <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> that {{is less than a}} meter wide and approximately twenty centimeters high (for machines with a single row of winning slots). The thickness of the <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> is slightly more than the thickness of the coin. In the <b>playing</b> <b>area,</b> there are the winning slots, typically nine in modern models, in one row (two rows in some models). The row spans horizontally {{the entire length of the}} <b>playing</b> <b>area,</b> and it is slightly below the point where the coin enters the <b>playing</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} rising and this rise {{has been linked}} to a {{decrease}} in physical activity. Access to appropriate facilities for physical activity is a key determinant of participation. This paper investigates the provision of outdoor <b>play</b> <b>areas</b> for children in relation to area deprivation in Glasgow, Scotland. Analysis of the distribution of outdoor <b>play</b> <b>areas</b> showed significantly higher mean number of <b>play</b> <b>areas</b> per 1000 child population in more deprived areas. However, despite the apparent advantage of deprived areas in terms of actual number of <b>play</b> <b>areas,</b> the quality of <b>play</b> <b>areas</b> in different types of areas may warrant further exploration...|$|R
5|$|Didsbury Park {{was also}} a winner of the Green Flag Award in 2008. It is a {{community}} park in Didsbury village centre that comprises a bowls area, crèche, football pitch and <b>play</b> <b>area.</b> Once a year, at the Didsbury Festival, pupils from local schools dress up to a theme and meet in the playground of St. Catherine's Primary School, in East Didsbury, from where they parade to Didsbury Park.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a beehive metal {{sculpture}} by Thompson Dagnall in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was {{criticized by the}} council for installment adjacent to the children’s <b>play</b> <b>area</b> in Hyde park for looking too rude and phallic. Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and moved it {{to another part of}} the park.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Woods {{provides}} habitats for a {{wide range}} of species. It also has a number of natural springs that feed a duck pond and a kingfisher pond. Recent housing developments between the reserve and the railway line have added complementary public open space with picnic areas and a children's <b>play</b> <b>area.</b> Since 1986 all maintenance and development of the reserve has been carried out by a volunteer group known as The Friends of Radyr Woods.|$|E

The park has a monument and an 'Avenue of Remembrance' as memorials to the town's residents killed during the two world wars.|$|E
5|$|The grounds {{included}} The Bishop's Barn {{which was}} built as a tithe barn in the 15th century, and the area next to it which is now a public park and <b>play</b> <b>area.</b> The barn was built of local stone roughly squared, with Doulting ashlar dressings and a Westmorland slate roof. Royalist troops were quartered in the barn during the Bloody Assizes.|$|E
5|$|The ruined {{tower of}} St Mary-le-Port church stands {{to the west}} of the park, {{surrounded}} by derelict financial office buildings. Adjoining the ruins of St Peter's church in the middle of the park is a sensory herb garden, and five silver birch trees as a memorial to the beaches of the D-Day landings. To the east is a grassy arena, and the partially excavated remains of Bristol Castle with a preserved vaulted chamber. There is also a bandstand and a children's <b>play</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|As is usual with games, the {{particular}} rules applied vary from location to location, {{but with the}} same principle. The <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> consists of a main <b>playing</b> <b>area,</b> with two 'home' areas on opposing sides (similar to the touchdown areas used in rugby or American football). The home areas are {{the width of the}} <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> and are usually marked by a line or some other marker.|$|R

5|$|The second park is Carr Hill Reservoir Park, which {{occupies}} {{the site of}} the covered reservoir at Carr Hill and Ruskin Roads. This is a larger park containing a <b>play</b> <b>area</b> and contained sports area paid for by fundraising by local residents. There is also a full-size football pitch, which is the base of Sheriff Hill Football Club; a mixed-sex club of around 125 players which is substantially funded by Gateshead Council.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main public parks in Shaw and Crompton. Dunwood Park lies {{alongside}} the Oldham and Rochdale Metrolink Line {{and has a}} children's <b>play</b> <b>area,</b> bowling green, and over a mile of wooded pathways along {{the base of a}} forested hillside. The land that forms Dunwood Park was presented to Crompton Urban District Council by Captain Abram Crompton JP on 22 June 1911, and opened as a park by him on 14 September 1912. It was redeveloped with a new park and bowling green for its 2012 centenary after winning a £1 million grant from the National Lottery. High Crompton Park is in High Crompton and is home to a tennis court, bowling green, children's <b>play</b> <b>area,</b> and gardens.

50|$|After the Detour, {{teams had}} to find a marked location, where they would play the local game of Đẩy gậy against two strong opponents. Players would stand on a {{slippery}} <b>playing</b> <b>area,</b> and each party would hold onto a stick. They had to try to pull or push the stick in order to get their opponents to leave the <b>playing</b> <b>area.</b> If teams would remain in the <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> for three minutes, they would receive their next clue.|$|R
50|$|An {{area where}} a single pétanque {{game is played}} is called a terrain. A <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> {{is an area where}} one or more petanque games are being played. At any given time a <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> may be hosting one or more terrains.|$|R
5|$|If a ball travels {{outside of}} the <b>playing</b> <b>area,</b> <b>play</b> is {{restarted}} by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the <b>playing</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each <b>play</b> <b>area</b> {{is split}} {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E
5|$|Duke's Meadows {{stands on}} land {{formerly}} {{owned by the}} Duke of Devonshire. In the 1920s, it was purchased by the local council, who developed it as a recreational centre. A promenade and bandstand were built, and the meadows are still used for sport with a rugby club, football pitches, hockey club, several rowing clubs and a golf club. In recent years a local conservation charity, the Dukes Meadows Trust has undertaken extensive restoration work, which saw a long term project of a children's water <b>play</b> <b>area</b> opened in August 2006.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for {{control over the}} playground. They confront {{each other in the}} playground with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the <b>play</b> <b>area.</b> Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E

5000|$|Distinctive from [...] "goal games" [...] such as {{football}} and basketball, which have fixed-size <b>playing</b> <b>areas,</b> the infield {{is the only}} rigidly laid-out part of the field.

50|$|Suicide {{requires}} {{at least}} two players, and can {{have as many as}} can be accommodated by the <b>playing</b> <b>area.</b> The <b>playing</b> <b>area</b> comprises a hard surface, such as concrete, and a large, flat wall, and is usually outdoors. The game also requires a rubber ball or a tennis ball.|$|R
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} main building {{is a combination of}} Southern German and local Arabic. The tile roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for doors and windows reflect the latter. A lightning rod extends from the onion dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water cistern, garden and <b>play</b> <b>area.</b> The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors {{to the design of}} George Washington University and American University in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land {{in the style of the}} Prairie School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts (or American Craftsman) style. The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor <b>play</b> <b>area</b> are among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II.|$|E
5|$|While {{the bulk}} of Post Oak Mall's 125 stores are {{clothing}} and accessory shops, as of 2009 {{it is home to}} several hair salons and cosmetic stores, two video game stores, two optical shops, a Dallas Cowboys Pro Shop, a store featuring Texas A merchandise (Aggieland Outfitters), and a pet store that primarily sells puppies imported from Canada. In addition to six food vendors in the central food court, the mall houses full-size Casa Olé and Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants, and kiosk versions of Auntie Anne's and Dippin' Dots. There is a small indoor children's <b>play</b> <b>area</b> located in the food court, a night club, and recruitment centers for the United States Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marines.|$|E
