Prior to this, limited diagnostic procedures were done using variations on the cystoscope since 1910. Advances in direct optical visualization were quickly surpassed when video cameras were attached to the endoscopes. The advent of endoscopic stapling was also a major advance so that complicated procedures such as pulmonary lobectomy could be performed safely.

Pleural biopsy using flex-rigid <b>pleuroscopy</b> and pleural effusion cell block analysis are both useful for diagnosis of malignancy and obtaining adequate samples. The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic utility between the two methods among patients with malignant pleural disease with effusion. Data from patients who underwent flex-rigid <b>pleuroscopy</b> for diagnosis of pleural effusion suspicious for malignancy at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan between April 2011 and June 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia. At least 150 mL of pleural fluid was collected by <b>pleuroscopy,</b> followed by pleural biopsies from the abnormal site. Thirty-five patients who were finally diagnosed as malignant pleural disease were included in this study. Final diagnoses of malignancy were 24 adenocarcinoma, 1 combined adeno-small cell carcinoma, and 7 malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), and 3 metastatic breast cancer. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher by pleural biopsy than by cell block [94. 2 % (33 / 35) vs. 71. 4 % (25 / 35); p = 0. 008].

The diagnosis of MPE can be sometimes difficult to make because of the inconclusive ‎result of pleural biopsy report. We studied the clinical features of MPEs as well as diagnostic ‎procedures. ‎OBJECTIVEOur research goal and the objective of the study are to review the natural history of patients with ‎a malignant pleural effusion but without obvious evidence of a primary lesion and to assess the ‎value of diagnostic investigations to confirm the malignant pleural effusion. To follow the ‎objectives, we collect the information on the disease characteristics such as age, gender, clinical ‎features, nature and microscopic examination of pleural fluid, positivity rate of blind pleural ‎biopsy results in patients diagnosed with bronchogenic carcinoma in the Chest Medical ‎Department in Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar. ‎METHODSThis study was a hospital based descriptive cross sectional study, performed at Chest Medical ‎Department, Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar, from January 2004 through January 2005. ‎Thorough history taking and physical examinations, radiological findings, hematological and ‎serum biochemical profiles were recorded. Pleural aspiration and biopsy were also performed. ‎RESULTS‎ 43 males and 30 females presenting with malignant pleural effusion were included in this study. ‎The commonest age group lies between 61 to 70 years old with mean ± SD age of 63. 45. 60 ‎patients (82. 2 %) of malignant pleural effusions are heavy smokers or ex-smokers. 65 patients ‎‎(88. 9 %) were diagnosed by identification of malignant pleural tissue in blind pleural biopsy, 8 ‎patients (11. 1 %) were diagnosed by identification of malignant cells in the pleural fluid cytology ‎because biopsies revealed chronic nonspecific pleuritis. Among histologically identified cell ‎types most patients (33) had metastatic large cell carcinoma. Pleural fluid cytology for malignant ‎cells was positive in 47 patients (64. 4 %). Common symptoms of malignant pleural effusions ‎were breathlessness, cough, chest pain, weight loss and loss of appetite. Common physical signs ‎were cachexia, fever on admission, palpable lymph node. Clinical features of consolidation and ‎collapse were also noted in chest examinations. 45 patients had left sided effusion (61. 6 %) and ‎‎ 28 had right sided (38. 4 %). 47. 9 % of pleural aspirate were blood stained. Mean ADA activity ‎‎(SD) in malignant pleural effusion was 23. 83 U/L. Mean protein concentration was 41. 02 g/l, ‎mean pleural fluid serum protein ratio was 0. 61, LDH was 599. 56 U/L, mean pleural fluid / ‎serum LDH ratio was 1. 18. Mean total and differential white cell counts of peripheral blood ‎were within normal limits. Mean ESR was 62. 23. ‎CONCLUSIONPleural fluid biochemical analysis can have an important contribution for investigation of ‎patients with pleural effusion.

Although the radiographic detection of pleural abnormalities may be obvious, determination {{of a specific}} diagnosis can present a challenge.

Aim of the study: This study was carried out to analyze our six years experience of medical thoracoscopy in the management of undiagnosed pleural effusion at Al Hussein University Hospital. Methods: The study conducted on 170 patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion, 100  males and 70  females with age ranging between 22 and 85 (mean age 56  ±  12. 48). The thoracoscopic findings of the pleura were nodules in 109 patients (64. 12 %), adhesions in 32 patients (18. 82 %), masses in 7 patients (4. 12 %), collections of pus in 3 patients (1. 76 %), foreign body (central veinous line in 1 patient (0. 59 %) and nonspecific findings in 18 (10. 59 %). In this study thoracoscopy was successful for giving final diagnosis in 161 patients (94. 7 %) from total 170 patients. Results: The thoracoscopic findings of the pleura were nodules in 109 patients (64. 12 %), adhesions in 32 patients (18. 82 %), masses in 7 patients (4. 12 %), collections of pus in 3 patients (1. 76 %), foreign body (central veinous line in 1 patient (0. 59 %) and nonspecific findings in 18 (10. 59 %). Thoracoscopy was successful for giving final diagnosis in 161 patients (94. 7 %) from total 170 patients. malignancies reported in 83. 53 % of patients, benign lesions reported in 11. 18 % of patients, non specific pleurisy in 9 patients (5. 29 %) TB in 16 patients (9. 41 %) and empyema in 3 patients (1. 77 %). The most common pathological malignant type was malignant pleural mesothelioma in 84 patients (49. 41 %) followed by adenocarcinoma in 44 patients (25. 88 %), squamous cell carcinoma in 2 patients (1. 18 %), small cell carcinoma 1 patient (0. 59 %), malignant melanoma in 1 patient (0. 59 %) and thymoma in 1 patient (0. 59 %). we found no post-thoracoscopic complications in 159 out of 170 patients (93. 52 %), whereas minor complications occurred only in 11 out of 170 patients (6. 48 %); 5 / 170 patients (2. 94 %) developed surgical emphysema, 3 / 170 patients (1. 77 %) developed empyema, and 3 / 170 patient (1. 77 %) developed air leak. Conclusion: Medical thoracoscopy is an easy procedure and an excellent diagnostic procedure for pleural effusion of uncertain etiology. It has low complication rate even in settings where the procedure is just started. It {{should be included in the}} armamentarium of procedures for management of pleural effusion...|$|E
