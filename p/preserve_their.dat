5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, {{in which the}} French were repulsed suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E
5|$|Parry's opera, Blodwen, {{was first}} {{performed}} in Aberystwyth's Temperance Hall on 21 May 1878, although Parry did not publish it until 1888, while at Swansea. This {{was the first}} opera written by a Welsh composer and also the first opera to be performed in Welsh. The opera, with its libretto written by Richard Davies, is set {{during the time of}} the Welsh Revolt—the last attempt by the Welsh to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> independence.|$|E

While this was being argued the ships were overhauled with a small maintenance crew aboard to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> value. The Allied Tripartite Commission allocated Steinbrinck to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945 and she sailed for Libau on 2 January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Fraternity {{growth was}} {{interrupted}} by the Civil War, as men from many Southern colleges halted their studies to join the Confederate army. Many fraternity chapters ceased to exist during this time, but some students made efforts to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> fraternities as the war continued. Harry St. John Dixon, a member of Sigma Chi from the University of Virginia, joined with four other Sigma Chi brothers from other universities to form the Constantine Chapter of the fraternity. Created in 1864, this chapter was meant to preserve the bonds of the fraternity during the war, promote ties between the North and South, and ensure the fraternity's continued existence.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{rights for}} Indians {{have also been}} aimed at {{overturning}} the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination {{on the grounds of}} religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of Indian constitution.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, {{the party}} was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} First Republic of Armenia, which fell to the Soviet communists in 1920. After its leadership was exiled by the communists, the ARF established itself within Armenian diaspora communities, where it helped Armenians <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> cultural identity. After the fall of the USSR, it returned to Armenia, where it now again has a presence as a minor party in Armenia's parliament. Prior to Serzh Sargsyan's election as president of Armenia and for a short time thereafter, the ARF was a member of the governing coalition, even though it nominated its own candidate in the presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, key {{elements}} of the park, including the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, were grade II listed to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> character. Following the 2004 film Closer, based on the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber, Postman's Park experienced a resurgence of interest; key scenes of both were set in the park itself. In June 2009, a city worker, Jane Shaka (née Michele), via the Diocese of London added a new tablet to the Memorial, the first new addition for 78 years. In November 2013 a free mobile app, The Everyday Heroes of Postman’s Park, was launched which documents the lives and deaths of those commemorated on the memorial.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> integrity.|$|E

5|$|Mutukumbo {{festival is}} the major festival celebrated in the {{province}} in Luapala Valley. It is held annually during July and attracts around 20,000 people, including the President of Zambia. The event involves enacting the migration of Luba Lunda and conquest of the valley by the chiefs of the tribe during historic times. Kwanga festival is held in the October by the Njumba tribe in Samfya. It {{is seen as a}} cultural reunion of the tribe to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> rituals and traditions. Other festivals celebrated in the province are the Malaila Ceremony, the festival of death of evil lion, the Musubilwa Mpemba Ceremony, and the Ubwilile traditional ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{east coast}} of the U.S. also began to consume more ice, {{particularly}} as more industrial and private customers found uses for refrigeration. Ice became increasingly used in the northeast of the U.S. to preserve dairy products and fresh fruit for market, the chilled goods being transported over the growing railroad lines. By the 1840s, ice was being used to transfer small quantities of goods further west across the continent. Eastern U.S. fishermen began to use ice to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> catches. Fewer businesses or individuals in the east harvested their own ice independently in winter, most preferring to rely on commercial providers.|$|E

5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their Umayyad predecessors, the Abbasid caliphs did {{not pursue}} active expansion: in general terms, they were {{content with the}} {{territorial}} limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or preemptive, meant to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours. At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular remained important for domestic consumption. The annual raids, which had almost lapsed in the turmoil following the Abbasid Revolution, were undertaken with renewed vigour from ca. 780 on, and were the only expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person.|$|E

At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E

5|$|Brugge {{needed to}} score again {{to keep the}} tie alive, and pushed their players forward {{in search of an}} equaliser. This forced Liverpool to pull all their players, except Keegan, into {{defensive}} positions to try to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> lead. Despite this Liverpool had a chance {{to take the lead in}} the 34th minute. Smith's volley from a Kennedy free-kick went wide of the Brugge goal. Brugge's pressure almost paid off five minutes into the second half. Ulrik le Fevre and Roger van Gool combined to split the Liverpool defence, leaving Lambert with the ball. His subsequent shot beat Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence but hit the post. Brugge kept attacking in an effort to find the goal they needed; their best chance came four minutes from the end. Brugge breached the Liverpool defence, but Cools' shot was denied by a diving save from Clemence. No more goals were scored; the final score was 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Charles won {{his first}} decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15June 1312. After that his troops seized most fortresses of the {{powerful}} Aba family. During the next decade, Charles restored royal power primarily {{with the assistance of}} the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Csák, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Záh who had attempted to slaughter the royal family.|$|E
5|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Morales had {{supported}} calls for regional autonomy for Bolivia's departments. As president, {{he changed his}} position, viewing the calls for autonomy – which came from Bolivia's four eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija – as {{an attempt by the}} wealthy bourgeoisie living in these regions to <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> economic position. He nevertheless agreed to a referendum on regional autonomy, held in July 2006; the four eastern departments voted in favor of autonomy, but Bolivia as a whole voted against it by 57.6%. In September, autonomy activists launched strikes and blockades across eastern Bolivia, resulting in violent clashes with MAS activists. In January 2007, clashes in Cochabamba between activist groups led to fatalities, with Morales' government sending in troops to maintain the peace. The left-indigenous activists formed a Revolutionary Departmental Government, but Morales denounced it as illegal and continued to recognise the legitimacy of right-wing departmental head Manfred Reyes Villa.|$|E
