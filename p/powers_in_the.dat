5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E

50|$|In United States {{constitutional}} law, the Vesting Clauses are {{provisions in}} Article I, Section 1; Article II, Section 1, Clause 1; and Article III, Section 1 of the United States Constitution that vest the United States' legislative <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Congress, <b>the</b> executive <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> President, and judicial <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> federal judiciary.

5|$|In 1878, {{as part of}} {{the review}} of the defences of Singapore against threats from European <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, it was decided that forts be built {{on either side of the}} {{entrance}} to New Harbour. Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). It was found that the steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders.|$|E
5|$|Sargsyan, {{along with}} Demirchyan and several others, {{was assassinated in}} the Armenian {{parliament}} shooting of 27 October 1999. The perpetrators were {{sentenced to life in}} prison. However, the distrust toward the trial process gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories. Some experts and politicians argue that their assassination was masterminded by Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. Others have suspected the possible involvement of foreign <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shooting.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} the first Allied victory over the Central <b>Powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First World War. Serbia's triumph on the {{battlefield}} drew worldwide attention {{to the country and}} won the Serbs sympathy from both neutral and Allied countries. A number of foreigners flocked to Serbia in late 1914, offering financial, political, humanitarian and military aid. Articles in defence of Serbia became more frequent in the British press. Certain cultural circles in Italy advocated entering the war on the Allied side, citing Serbian and Montenegrin battlefield successes.|$|E

5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened {{by the fact that}} the United States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the end of the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 3rd century, Rome had established itself in 282 BC as a major power on the Italian Peninsula, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean at the time: Carthage and the Greek kingdoms. Rome had all but completely defeated the Samnites, mastered its fellow Latin towns, and greatly reduced Etruscan power in the region. However, the south of Italy was controlled by the Greek colonies of Magna Grecia who had been allied to the Samnites, and continued Roman expansion brought the two into inevitable conflict.|$|E
5|$|Captain Scarlet also {{formed the}} basis of three comic strips drawn for the weekly children's comic, TV Century 21. Spanning 17 issues (numbers 141–157) from September 1967 to January 1968, the strip adventures were written by Angus P. Allan with artwork by Ron Embleton, and were titled We Will Destroy Unity City, We Will Destroy the Observatory Network and We Shall Make Earth a Planet of Silence. Following the end of the TV series, the comic {{continued}} the story of the Captain Scarlet universe, with later strips revealing that the Mysterons deactivate their Martian complex and relinquish their control over Captain Black, while Scarlet himself leaves Spectrum to make use of his <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fight against Earth-bound criminals and threats. The Mysterons ultimately re-awaken, prompting Scarlet and Spectrum to resume their struggle. Keith Watson also worked on these comic book adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new territory, {{including}} {{authority to}} appoint territorial {{officials and the}} legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated {{an agreement with the}} Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} that followed, parts of {{northern}} Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maratha Empire, the British, and other <b>powers.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> south, the Mysore Kingdom, a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent. With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haidar Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tipu Sultan. To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tipu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj in 1799. The Kingdom of Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars and Mysore remained a princely state under the British Raj.|$|E

5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue {{on the walls of}} the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts {{on the walls of the}} pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E

5|$|The Third Perso-Turkic War was {{the third}} and final {{conflict}} between the Sassanian Empire and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Unlike the previous two wars, it was not fought in Central Asia, but in Transcaucasia. Hostilities were initiated in 627 AD by Khagan Tong Yabghu of the Western Göktürks and Emperor Heraclius of the Eastern Roman Empire. Opposing them were the Sassanid Persians, allied with the Pannonian Avars. The war was fought against the background of the last Byzantine-Sassanid War and served as a prelude to the dramatic events that changed the balance of <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East for centuries to come (Battle of Nineveh, Islamic conquest of Persia).|$|E
