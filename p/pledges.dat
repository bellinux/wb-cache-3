The second chapter called creation of a <b>pledge</b> provides the overview of individual titles based on which and modes in which a <b>pledge</b> may be created.

5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental <b>pledges</b> spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E

5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity <b>pledges</b> were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E

50|$|For a <b>pledge</b> to {{come into}} {{existence}} as a real security right, {{it is essential that}} delivery occur. Delivery can be actual or constructive, but the pledgee must retain possession of the <b>pledged</b> object. The transfer of possession is intended to publicise the fact that a real security right, {{in the form of a}} <b>pledge,</b> has been established over the <b>pledged</b> object. The transfer serves to protect the pledgee's real security right by preventing the pledgor from alienating the <b>pledged</b> object or <b>pledging</b> it to some other person. This is why constitutum possessorium is not permitted.|$|R
