5|$|After 1898, {{there was}} a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> admitting new members. Four were {{admitted}} between 1906 and 1908, followed by {{only one in the}} 1915, three in 1924, and two in 1935. In 1940 the average member age was 69.|$|E
5|$|By 16:00, {{with the}} Franco-Bavarian troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been {{transferred}} from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There {{was now a}} <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> the battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganize.|$|E
5|$|DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down {{the rate of}} S phase progression when DNA is damaged.

40|$|<b>Pauses</b> <b>in</b> {{spontaneous}} speech have a freer distribution than <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> read texts; however, {{they are not}} distributed haphazardly. The {{results of the present}} study show that the majority of the perceived <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> the {{spontaneous speech}} material, 73 %, occur in one of the following three positions: between sentences, after discourse markers and conjunctions and before accented content words. This is a short version of an unpublished paper on <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> spontaneous speech...|$|R
40|$|Pause is {{not only}} one of the cues of {{prosodic}} structure for running speech, but also one of the strategies used by speakers to express their emotions. In this paper, we investigated the silent <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> read and spontaneous speech, neutral and expressive speech, as well as synthesized speech, trying to find the difference of silent <b>pause</b> patterns <b>in</b> different speech styles. It was observed that all silent <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> synthesized speech were regular, 2. 5 % <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> neutral read speech were irregular, 10 % in expressive read speech were irregular and 28 % <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> spontaneous expressive speech were irregular. A comparative study was carried out for the duration and frequency of occurrence of irregular silent <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> different speech styles, as well as the valence and activation features of their acoustic contexts. A perceptual experiment showed that the removing of irregular silent pauses from spontaneous speech resulted in an obvious decrease of expressiveness, while inserting irregular silent pauses into synthesized speech improves substantially the expressiveness of such synthesized speech. 1...|$|R

5|$|The most {{frequent}} modification is {{expansion of the}} original material. The expansions frequently repeat preceding measures or consist of rests or left-hand figurations without the melody, providing a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> the motion. This is especially noticeable in the Adagio, minuet and finale of the C minor Sonata, the middle section of the Andantino in the A major Sonata, and the first movement of the B-flat Sonata.|$|E

5|$|In mid-February, Wellington's army {{broke out}} of its small area of conquered {{territory}} near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. After a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse.|$|E

5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest that key members of the War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the {{military}} leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front {{to send them to}} the Grisons as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's death {{there was}} a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> the {{conflict}} with France, during which {{many of the new}} fortifications were alllowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense of maintaining the fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to inflicting significant casualties on Indonesian forces, the successful Australian ambushes on the Sungei Koemba, and later at Kindau, in May and June allowed 3 RAR {{to dominate the}} border area, while also providing early warning of Indonesian incursions into Sarawak. Following these actions Major General George Lea, the British Director of Operations, ordered a short <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> offensive operations in order to observe the effects. Indonesian mortar attacks on company bases in the 3 RAR area of operation, which had been heavy throughout May and June, ceased soon afterwards. Following the resumption of Claret operations the Australian battalion later followed this up with another profitable mission at Babang on 12 July, contributing to the wider success of the British-Commonwealth forces in slowly asserting control on the war.|$|E
5|$|The Passion of Martin Luther King was {{composed}} in 1968 following King's assassination. The Passion was first recorded in London in 1969, with Ezio Flagello, the composer's brother, as the bass baritone soloist. This performance was eventually released by Naxos American Classics in 2012. DePreist conducted the National Symphony Orchestra's first {{performance of the}} work at the Kennedy Center on February 19, 1974. Music critics drew comparisons to Johann Sebastian Bach's Passions, which recounts Jesus' death. The Oregon Symphony album was the first published recording of the work. Bazemore provided bass vocals, with additional vocals by the Portland Symphonic Choir, directed by Bruce Browne. The nine sections of the work are performed with a brief <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> between.|$|E
5|$|The Second Sino-Japanese War {{caused a}} <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> the {{conflict}} between the CPC and the KMT. The Second United Front was established between the CPC and the KMT to tackle the invasion. While the front formally existed until 1945, all collaboration between the two parties had ended by 1940. Despite their formal alliance, the CPC used the opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for the coming war with the KMT. In 1939 the KMT began to restrict CPC expansion within China. This led to frequent clashes between CPC and KMT forces but which subsided rapidly on the realisation on both sides that civil war was not an option. Yet, by 1943, the CPC was again actively expanding its territory {{at the expense of the}} KMT.|$|E

5|$|The Umayyad Caliphate however was {{increasingly}} distracted by conflicts elsewhere, especially its {{confrontation with the}} Khazars, with whom Leo III had concluded an alliance, marrying his son and heir, Constantine V (r. 741–775) to the Khazar princess Tzitzak. Only in the late 730s did the Muslim raids again become a threat, but the great Byzantine victory at Akroinon and the turmoil of the Abbasid Revolution led to a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> Arab attacks against the Empire. It also opened up {{the way for a}} more aggressive stance by Constantine V (r. 741–775), who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene, and continued scoring further victories. These successes were also interpreted by Leo III and his son Constantine as evidence of God's renewed favour, and strengthened the position of Iconoclasm within the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> new discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E

5|$|The 25,400-strong Allied {{left flank}} corps under William Beresford began its advance on 16 February, {{aiming for the}} village of Bidache. Beresford's corps {{was made up of}} the 4th, 6th, 7th and Light Division as well as Somerset's and Vivian's cavalry. Altogether, Wellington had 42,000 foot {{soldiers}} and 3,000 horsemen marching to the east. Reacting to the Allied pressure, Soult joined two of the three divisions north of the Adour to the four divisions farther east. This action created a field army of 32,000 infantry and 3,800 cavalry. The French divisions were directed to form a new line behind the Gave d'Oloron River, along a line from Peyrehorade to Sauveterre-de-Béarn to Navarrenx. On 17 February, Hill's corps forded the Saison River, breaching yet another French defensive line. The French marshal sent Abbé's division to help defend Bayonne, a questionable move which left his army with fewer troops to fight Wellington. By 18 February, Soult had his troops in position on the Gave d'Oloron. That day the weather broke again, causing another <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> operations.|$|E
