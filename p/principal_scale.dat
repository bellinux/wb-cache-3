50|$|Foams are {{examples}} of dispersed media.

When the <b>principal</b> <b>scale</b> is small, i.e., for a very fine foam, this dispersed medium can be considered a type of colloid.|$|E

Dorian is a minor mode with a major sixth, and Phrygian mode is a minor mode with a minor second. The Locrian mode contains the minor third but not the perfect fifth, so its root chord is diminished.|$|E

50|$|The {{ratio of}} the Earth's size to the {{generating}} globe's size is called the nominal scale (= <b>principal</b> <b>scale</b> = representative fraction). Many maps state the nominal scale and may even display a bar scale (sometimes merely called a 'scale') to represent it. The second distinct concept of scale applies to the variation in scale across a map. It is the {{ratio of the}} mapped point's scale to the nominal scale. In this case 'scale' means the scale factor (= point scale = particular scale).|$|E
50|$|The {{diameter}} of a flue pipe directly affects its tone. When comparing pipes of otherwise identical shape and size, a wide pipe {{will tend to}} produce a flute tone, a medium pipe a diapason tone, and a narrow pipe a string tone. These relationships {{are referred to as}} the scale of the pipe: i.e., wide-scaled, normal-scaled, or narrow-scaled. As a pipe's scale increases, more fundamental will be present, and fewer partials will be present in the tone. Thus, the tone becomes richer and fuller as the pipe's diameter widens from string scale to <b>principal</b> <b>scale</b> to flute scale.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the pointer}} of the meter {{is usually a}} small {{distance}} above {{the scale of the}} meter, parallax error can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that [...] "lines up" [...] with the pointer. To counter this, some meters include a mirror along the markings of the <b>principal</b> <b>scale.</b> The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by positioning one's head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator's eye must be directly above the pointer and any parallax error has been minimized.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new proof mass actuator {{for the implementation}} of decentralised velocity feedback control loops to reduce the flexural vibration of a thin plate structure at low audio frequencies. Classical proof mass actuators are formed by coil–magnet linear motors. These actuators can generate constant force at frequencies above the fundamental resonance frequency of the spring–magnet system, which can be used to efficiently implement point velocity feedback control loops. However, the dynamics of the spring–magnet system limits the stability and control performance of the loops when the actuators are exposed to shocks This paper introduces the proof mass actuator with an additional flywheel element that improves the stability of the velocity feedback loop both by increasing the feedback gain margin and by reducing the actuator static displacement. This paper is focused on the stability and control performance of multiple feedback loops. Secondly, the <b>principal</b> <b>scaling</b> laws that characterise the actuator and thus the feedback loops...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Posttraumatic {{growth is}} one of the most {{commonly}} used concepts to evaluate positive changes after trauma. The <b>principal</b> <b>scales</b> used internationally to evaluate this phenomenon have not yet a Brazilian Portuguese version. Objectives This study aimed to translate and adapt to the Brazilian context the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), the Core Beliefs Inventory (CBI), and the Event Related Rumination Inventory (ERRI). Methods The procedures included translation, back translation, expert committee&# 8217;s evaluation, and pilot testing in the target population. Results All items of all three instruments had a good content validity index after evaluation by four experts and three reformulations. The back translation of the final version also demonstrated that all Brazilian Portuguese versions convey the same meaning as the original English version. The final version was pilot tested with 30 undergraduate students, and all the items were above the cut-off point. Discussion This study was able to produce Brazilian versions of the PTGI, CBI, and ERRI. Further studies are underway to determine the reliability, factorial validity, and convergent validity of the subscales of the instruments...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{instructive}} {{to consider the}} use of bar scales that might appear on a printed version of this projection. The scale is true (k=1) on the equator so that multiplying its length on a printed map by the inverse of the RF (or <b>principal</b> <b>scale)</b> gives the actual circumference of the Earth. The bar scale on the map is also drawn at the true scale so that transferring a separation between two points on the equator to the bar scale will give the correct distance between those points. The same is true on the meridians. On a parallel other than the equator the scale is [...] so when we transfer a separation from a parallel to the bar scale we must divide the bar scale distance by this factor to obtain {{the distance between the}} points when measured along the parallel (which is not the true distance along a great circle). On a line at a bearing of say 45 degrees (...) the scale is continuously varying with latitude and transferring a separation along the line to the bar scale does not give a distance related to the true distance in any simple way. (But see addendum). Even if we could work out a distance along this line of constant bearing its relevance is questionable since such a line on the projection corresponds to a complicated curve on the sphere. For these reasons bar scales on small-scale maps must be used with extreme caution.|$|E
5000|$|The spherical {{approximation}} of Earth with radius a can be modelled by a smaller sphere of radius R, called {{the globe in}} this section. The globe determines {{the scale of the}} map. The various cylindrical projections specify how the geographic detail is transferred from the globe to a cylinder tangential to it at the equator. The cylinder is then unrolled to give the planar map. The fraction [...] is called the representative fraction (RF) or the <b>principal</b> <b>scale</b> of the projection. For example, a Mercator map printed in a book might have an equatorial width of 13.4 cm corresponding to a globe radius of 2.13 cm and an RF of approximately [...] (M is used as an abbreviation for 1,000,000 in writing an RF) whereas Mercator's original 1569 map has a width of 198 cm corresponding to a globe radius of 31.5 cm and an RF of about [...]A cylindrical map projection is specified by formulæ linking the geographic coordinates of latitude φ and longitude λ to Cartesian coordinates on the map with origin on the equator and x-axis along the equator. By construction, all points on the same meridian lie on the same generator of the cylinder at a constant value of x, but the distance y along the generator (measured from the equator) is an arbitrary function of latitude, y(φ). In general this function does not describe the geometrical projection (as of light rays onto a screen) from the centre of the globe to the cylinder, which is only one of an unlimited number of ways to conceptually project a cylindrical map.|$|E

40|$|A fused lithium {{chloride}} salt system's constitutive properties were evaluated and {{compared to a}} number of fluid properties, and water was shown to be an excellent simulant of {{lithium chloride}} salt. With a simple flow model, the <b>principal</b> <b>scaling</b> term was shown to be a function of the kinematic viscosity. A water mock-up of the molten salt was also shown to be within a {+-} 3 % error in the scaling analysis. This made it possible to consider developing water scaled tests of the molten salt system. Accurate flow velocity and pressure measurements were acquired by developing a directional velocity probe. The device was constructed and calibrated with a repeatable accuracy of {+-} 15 %. This was verified by a detailed evaluation of the probe. Extensive flow measurements of the engineering scale mockup were conducted, and the results were carefully compared to radial flow patterns of a straight blade stirrer.

The basket design was shown to prevent fluid penetration into the fuel baskets when external stirring was the flow mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of antiferromagnetic (AF) {{correlations}} in the three-band Emery model, {{with respect to the}} experimental situation in weakly underdoped and optimally doped BSCCO. In the vicinity of the vH singularity of the conduction band there appears a central peak {{in the middle of a}} pseudogap, which is in an antiadiabatic regime, insensitive to the time scale of the mechanism responsible for the pseudogap. We find a quantum low-temperature regime corresponding to experiment, in which the pseudogap is created by zero-point motion of the magnons, as opposed to the usual semiclassical derivation, where it is due to a divergence of the magnon occupation number. Detailed analysis of the spectral functions along the (pi, 0) -(pi,pi) line show significant agreement with experiment, both qualitative and, in the <b>principal</b> <b>scales,</b> quantitative. The observed slight approaching-then-receding of both the wide and narrow peaks with respect to the Fermi energy is also reproduced. We conclude that optimally doped BSCCO has a well-developed pseudogap of the order of 1000 K. This is only masked by the narrow antiadiabatic peak, which provides a small energy scale, unrelated to the AF scale, and primarily controlled by the position of the chemical potential.

40|$|The authors {{examined}} three specific {{methods for}} using the wavelet transform to derive information on the turbulence structure in the atmospheric boundary layer from raw data. The scale-time cross section method yields a qualitative picture of turbulence structures occurring at different times and different scales, the wavelet variance method provides a relatively objective estimate of principal scales associated with organized structures, and the wavelet cross correlation helps in identifying motions that are most important in turbulent transport and spatial coherence. The wavelet analysis {{can also be used}} to decompose the data for different scales and to detect coherent structures objectively by using the transform coefficient at the <b>principal</b> <b>scale</b> detected by the variance method (Collineau and Brunet, 1993; Coulter and Li, 1995).

40|$|AbstractThe {{relevance}} of a multilevel consideration of deformation and fracture {{is caused by}} the variety of deformation processes, their interaction and change of their defining role at various loading stages. From the experimental research viewpoint the multilevel consideration can be achieved only through the use of gauges of various type and operation principle. We combine Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method for strain estimation and acoustic emission (AE) for investigating strain and fracture patterns at various scale levels. Quantitative analysis of experimental data was performed by constructing diagrams (dependencies) of shear strain intensity as functions of the deformation degree (loading time). It is shown that the increase of strain intensity happens at the moment when a macro shear-band is formed. Also, patterns of localized deformation were simulated with use of the ANSYS finite element package. A good qualitative correlation is observed between numerical data and surface strain mapping. For the characterization of localized strain processes, the dependencies of rate of AE events versus loading time were analyzed, since they appear to be the most sensitive to the change of the <b>principal</b> <b>scale</b> of plastic deformation...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are employed}} {{to study the}} hydrodynamics of self-propelled thunniform swimming. The swimmer is modeled as a tuna-like flexible body undulating with kinematics of thunniform type. The wake evolution follows the vortex structures arranged nearly vertical to the forward direction, vortex dipole formation resulting in the propulsion motion, and finally a reverse Kármán vortex street. We also carry out a systematic parametric study of {{various aspects of the}} fluid dynamics behind the freely swimming behavior, including the swimming speed, hydrodynamic forces, power requirement and wake vortices. The present results show that the fin thrust as well as swimming velocity is an increasing function of both tail undulating amplitude Ap and oscillating amplitude of the caudal fin θm. Whereas change on the propulsive performance with Ap is associated with the strength of wake vortices and the area of suction region on the fin, the swimming performance improves with θm due to the favorable tilting of the fin that make the pressure difference force more oriented toward the thrust direction. Moreover, the energy loss in the transverse direction and the power requirement increase with Ap but decrease with θm, and this indicates that for achieving a desired swimming speed increasing θm seems more efficiently than increasing Ap. Furthermore, we have compared the current simulations with the published experimental studies on undulatory swimming. Comparisons show that our work tackles the flow regime of natural thunniform swimmers and follows the <b>principal</b> <b>scaling</b> law of undulatory locomotion reported. Finally, this study enables a detailed quantitative analysis, which is difficult to obtain by experiments, of the force production of the thunniform mode as well as its connection to the self-propelled swimming kinematics and vortex wake structure. The current findings help provide insights into the swimming performance and mechanisms of self-propelled thunniform locomotion...|$|R
