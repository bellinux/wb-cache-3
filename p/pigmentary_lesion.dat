40|$|Objective: To {{know the}} most common types of skin {{diseases}} in Hail region and compare it with similar studies in other previous study in Hail region. Methods: A 10 month retrospective study of the common skin diseases, which was recorded in King Khalid Hospital, Hail, Saudi Arabia, within the period started from 1 – 1 – 2008 to 31 – 12 – 2014 with missing two years during this period 2010 – 2011 for totally 5 years, from registration record of outpatient clinic. Results: We recorded manually from registration record 13778 patients, comprising 5473 (40 %) male and 8305 (60 %) female within the study period. Eczema is {{the most common}} dermatological disease (37 %) with atopic dermatitis forming (12 %) among all eczema patients, followed by acne (20 %), alopecia (8 %),other pigmentary (7 %) with vitiligo comprising (7 %) which {{is the most common}} <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesion</b> of the total, viral wart (7 %), psoriasis (4 %), leishmania (4 %),Tinea (2 %), other pilosebaceous (1 %) and the other (3 %). Conclusion: Dermatitis, acne, vitiligo, alopecia, viral wart and psoriasis are the most common top six skin diseases in hail region compared to other previous study in Hail region. The prevalence of skin disease in any community depends upon various factors, namely the genetic, racial constitution, the social and hygienic standards, customs and occupations, the nutritional status, age structure of the community, climatic factors and state of industrialization...|$|E
40|$|A 2 -day- old male newborn was {{consulted}} to our {{clinic for}} cutaneous vascular and <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions.</b> The pregnancy {{of his mother}} and family history were unremarkable. Physi-cal examination showed bilateral nevus flammeus involving the scalp, face, neck, trunk, upper part of the back, scrotum and the flexor sides of arms and thighs. Large, bluish-grey pigmentation was observed on the abdominal area, back, but-tocks, legs and the extensor sides of the arms (Figure 1 a, b). Laboratory examination, abdominal ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal. Sys-temic involvement was not detected. Phacomatosis pigmento-vascularis (PPV) type IIa was diagnosed. Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis is a rare disorder char-acterized by the coexistence of vascular malformations and <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> of skin.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To use {{a digital}} dermoscopy {{analyzer}} {{with a series}} of "borderline" <b>pigmentary</b> skin <b>lesions</b> (ie, clinically atypical nevi and early melanoma) to find correlation between the studied variables and to determine their discriminating power with respect to histological diagnosis. DESIGN: A total of 147 <b>pigmentary</b> skin <b>lesions</b> were histologically examined by 3 experienced dermatopathologists and identified as nevi (n = 90) and melanomas (n = 57). The system evaluated 36 variables to be studied as possible discriminant variables, grouped into 4 categories: geometries, colors, textures, and islands of color. SETTING: University medical department. PATIENTS: A sample of patients with excised <b>pigmentary</b> skin <b>lesions</b> (nevi and melanomas). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the model for evaluating "borderline" <b>pigmentary</b> skin <b>lesions.</b> RESULTS: After multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis, only 13 variables were selected to compute the canonical discriminant function.

40|$|Background and Objectives : Epidemiological {{studies to}} {{determine}} the burden of skin diseases are important for proper health care planning. The {{purpose of this study}} was to find the pattern of skin diseases in our patients attending university-affiliated dermatologic clinics in the Qassim region. Methods : We conducted a prospective study of all Saudi patients attending the Qassim University Medical College-affiliated dermatology clinics of the Ministry of Health for a period of 12 months from 1 March 2008 to 28 February 2009. Results : The study included 3051 patients comprising 1786 (58. 5 &#x 0025;) males and 1265 (41. 5 &#x 0025;) females. Males outnumbered females (P <. 05) (male-to-female ratio, 1. 4 : 1). The mean age (standard error of the mean) of the patients was 25. 3 (0. 27) years. About 71 &#x 0025; of the patients were between 5 and 34 years of age. The top five skin diseases were eczema/ dermatitis (19. 5 &#x 0025;), viral infections (16. 6 &#x 0025;), pilosebaceous disorders (14. 4 &#x 0025;), <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> (11. 2 &#x 0025;) and hair disorders (7. 6 &#x 0025;). The major disorder in males was viral skin infections (20. 0 &#x 0025;), while eczema/dermatitis (20. 7 &#x 0025;) constituted the most prevalent skin disease in females. Seasonal variations were recorded in cases of <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions,</b> papulosquamous disorders and protozoal infections. Conclusion : Infectious skin diseases, eczema/dermatitis, pilosebaceous disorders, <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> and hair disorders ranked as the top five skin diseases. Appropriate training programs for diagnosing and managing common skin diseases should be initiated for primary health care physicians and other general practitioners so as to decrease referrals to dermatology clinics...|$|R
40|$|Segmental {{neurofibromatosis}} 1 (SNF 1) {{is a rare}} genodermatosis {{caused by}} somatic mutations in the NF 1 gene. It consists of localized characteristic <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> (i. e. café-au-lait spots and freckling) and/or neurofibromas intermingled with areas of unaffected skin, often configuring specific mosaic patterns. Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a developmental field defect primarily affecting the 1 st and 2 nd branchial arch derivatives. This condition recognizes {{a wide range of}} environmental and genetic causes, including postzygotic mutations. We report on a 24 -year-old female presenting with a constellation of features fitting both with SNF 1 and OAVS. Neurofibromatosis 1 <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> are confined to the left arm and adjacent trunk skin surface with sharp midline demarcation. OAVS characteristic craniofacial anomalies, including neurosensorial hearing loss, hemimandibular and tongue underdevelopment, are homolateral to the SNF 1 features. Additional findings, such as prearicular tags and multiple costo-vertebral segmentation defects, mainly involving the cervical and upper thoracic metameres, support the diagnosis of OAVS. To our knowledge, this is the first published patient who presents with an association of SNF 1 and OAVS.

40|$|Purpose: to {{describe}} a case of probable bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) with scleral involvement, free from systemic malignancies and cataract. Methods: fifty months of follow up with recurrent complete ophthalmological examinations, including fundus photography, fluorescein/indocyanine green angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Investigations also included an electroretinography (ERG) and histological examination of scleral biopsy. Extraocular malignancies were repeatedly searched. Results: the patient was a 61 year-old Italian man with chronic hepatitis type C. At first visit his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20 / 32 in OS and 20 / 25 in OD. Funduscopy showed multiple patch-shaped pigmented alterations involving macular region and mid retinal periphery. FA showed corresponding areas of late-phase hyperfluorescent pinpoints (figure 1 a, OS) and intemediate-phase hypocyanescence (figure 1 b, OS), with subtle serous neurosensory retinal detachment confirmed by OCT. Photopic and scotopic ERG tested normal. Systemic prednisone was administered for one month without any improvement. After ten months round <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> appeared also in superior scleral surface of both eyes. Biopsy allowed to disclose slightly pigmented spindle cells. BCVA worsened for further 10 months, with enlargement of FA alteration areas but lenses still clear. After 30 months spontaneous coalescence and atrophy of retinal lesions started, paralleled by progressive visual recovery. At {{the end of our}} follow up BCVA was 20 / 25 in OU while scleral <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> remained unchanged. Conclusions: we report the case of a patient with main features of BDUMP and some unusual findings.

40|$|Partial {{unilateral}} lentiginosis (PUL) is {{an unusual}} pigmentary disorder characterized by numerous lentigines grouped within an area of normal skin. Although treatment is not necessary, many patients with facial PUL seek medical help for cosmetic reasons. There is no established standard treatment for PUL. Conventional lasers may cause postinflammatory hyperpigmentation because keratinocytes are injured during the process. Also, scarring, long downtime, and pain are important issues. A 19 -year-old patient with facial PUL was successfully treated with low-fluence 1, 064 -nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (QS Nd:YAG) laser. Although the exact mechanism by which low-fluence 1, 064 -nm QS Nd:YAG laser improves <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> is unclear, the terms “subcellular selective photothermolysis” and “melanocyte apoptosis and replacement” have been proposed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} a probable case of bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) with unusual manifestations and prognosis. DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: Clinical follow-up {{of the patient}} lasting 50 months with recurrent fundus examination using color photographs, angiography, ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography. Serological and radiological investigations were performed to assess possible extraocular alterations. RESULTS: In both eyes patch-shaped pigmented alterations of the fundus were revealed. Fluorescein and indocyanine angiography evidenced corresponding areas of hyperfluorescent pinpoints and subtle serous detachment of the neurosensory retina, respectively. Ten months after the initial evaluation, flat <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> appeared in the superior scleral surface of the right eye and underwent histological examination. After an initial decrease in visual acuity, the patient experienced a spontaneous recovery. He did not develop cataracts or any systemic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Although not all the criteria for the diagnosis were fulfilled, clinical findings were compatible with BDUMP.

40|$|Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is an {{autosomal}} dominant neurocutaneous disorder, affecting approximately 1 in 3500 individuals. The most commonly seen tumors in NF 1 patients are the (sub) cutaneous neurofibromas. However, individuals with NF 1 typically present in childhood with well-defined pigmentary defects, including cafe-au-lait macules (CALMs), intertriginous freckling and iris Lisch nodules. NF 1 {{is considered a}} neurocristopathy, primarily affecting tissues derived from the neural crest. Since the pigment producing melanocyte originates in the neural crest, the presence of (hyper) <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> in the NF 1 phenotype because of changes in melanocyte cell growth and differentiation is to be expected. We want to discuss the pigmentary cutaneous manifestations of NF 1 represented by CALMs and intertriginous freckles and the pigmentary non-cutaneous manifestations represented by iris Lisch nodules. Several hypotheses have been suggested in explaining the poorly understood etiopathogenesis of CALMs. Whether other pigmentary manifestations might share similar etiopathogenic mechanisms remains obscure. Additional attention will be drawn to a readily seen phenomenon in NF 1 : hyperpigmentation overlying (plexiform) neurofibromas, which could suggest common etiopathogenetic-environmental cues or mechanisms underlying CALMs and neurofibromas. Finally, we want to address the relationship between malignant melanoma and NF 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} and histopathological characteristics of acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules in men are poorly documented {{due to its}} rarity. Aims: To compare the {{clinical and}} histopathological characteristics of acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules in men with the condition in women. Methods: We studied 11 men and 62 women, all with a clinical diagnosis of acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules. Biopsies were taken from 5 men and 10 women and their clinical and histopathological features were compared. Results: The most frequently affected site in men was the forehead [8 (73 %) out of 11 patients]. Lesions on the forehead were more common in men than women (P = 0. 001). In contrast to women, there was no apparent tendency of the lesions to become more blue with age in men. Concurrent melasma was observed in 14 (23 %) out of 62 women, but not in men. Extra-facial acquired dermal melanocytosis was noted in 2 (18 %) out of 11 men and in none of the 62 women.

30|$|Melanocyte {{functions}} and cell cycle are modulated {{by the rich}} dermal vascular and neural net works. A study of dendritic melanocytes at the margin of vitiligo, show a high enzyme activity which extends along the dendrites (Iyengar 1992 b). These cells show biphasic melanogenic/adrenergic differentiation as is also observed in the amelanotic melanoma cell line HT- 18 (Whimster 1965). The enzymes include tyrosine hydroxylase/dopa oxidase, dopamine oxidase along with the catecholamines, dopamine and noradrenaline activity. It was observed that the substrates of catecholamine metabolism modulate tyrosine metabolism, melanogenesis is enhanced by DOPA and tyrosine[*]+[*]DOPA, adrenalin and dopamine while cupric ions enhance catecholamine production as an autocrine feedback (Iyengar and Misra 1987). Melanocytes show membrane bound acetyl choline esterase (AChE) activity (Iyengar 1989). Acetylcholine (ACh) modulates pigmentation by inhibiting dopa oxidase activity in vitiligo during depigmentation, due to a decrease in melanocyte AChE, while during repigmentation esterase activity increases blocking thls inhibitory effect (Iyengar 1989). Skin biopsies from <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> including melanocytic nevi and neurofibromas were also studied to assess neural dependence of epidermal melanocytes. Thus melanocyte functions are modulated by Ach, DA and NA in close association with dermal innervation as well as autocrine feedback by neurotransmitter substances produced by the melanocytes themselves, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes expressed in human skin melanocytes (Buchli et al. 2001; Plonka et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Aim: Gorlin {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cutaneous basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts and skeletal anomalies. Predisposition to {{certain types of}} cancers is among the main features of the disease. Chromosome instability was suspected as a mechanism for cancer predisposition. However, previous studies failed to prove the presence of chromosome instability. Materials and Methods: We present 11 patients with Gorlin syndrome. Results: Six of the patients were checked for increased sister chromatid exchange and were found normal. Two other patients had concurrent chromosome anomalies. Conclusion: Evidence for chromosome instability was not found in our patients. Occurrence of chromosome instability in a subgroup of patients and mechanisms underlying cancer predisposition requires further studies for full elucidation.

40|$|Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is an {{autosomal}} dominant cancer predisposition syndrome that affects about 1 in 3500 individuals worldwide. NF 1 {{is caused by}} mutations in the NF 1 gene that encodes the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, an inactivator of the Ras oncogene. The hallmarks of NF 1 include <b>pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> of the skin, Lisch nodules of the iris and cutaneous neurofibromas. Cutaneous neurofibromas are benign tumors composed of all the cell types of normal peripheral nerve. The traditional view of neurofibroma development has been that cutaneous neurofibromas arise from the disruption of the small nerve tributaries of the skin and subsequent proliferation of the resident cells. The second hit mutation in the NF 1 gene has been considered as a prerequisite for neurofibroma development. The second hit is detectable in a subpopulation of primary Schwann cells cultured from neurofibromas. This thesis challenges the traditional concept of neurofibroma development. The results show that cutaneous neurofibromas are intimately associated with hair follicular structures and contain multipotent precursor cells (NFPs), suggesting that neurofibromas may arise from the multipotent cells which reside in hair follicles. Furthermore, this study presents that neurofibroma-derived Schwann cells that harbor bi-allelic inactivation in the NF 1 gene express HLA class II genes and may act as nonprofessional antigen presenting cells. The CD 4 - and FoxP 3 -positive cells detected in cutaneous neurofibromas suggest that these cells may represent regulatory T cells (Tregs) which interact with HLA II –positive cells and aid the tumor cells in hiding from {{the immune system and}} are thus mediators of immune tolerance. This thesis also investigated neurofibroma development in the oral cavity and the use of different biomarkers to characterize cellular differentiation in neurofibromas. The results revealed that oral neurofibromas are not rare, but they usually appear as solitary lesions contrary to multiple cutaneous neurofibromas and present high heterogeneity within and between tumors. The use of class III beta-tubulin as a marker for neuronal differentiation led to an unexpected finding showing that multiple cell types express class III beta-tubulin during mitosis. The increased understanding of the multipotency of tumor cells, cellular differentiation and ability to hide from immune system will aid in the development of future treatments. Specifically, targeting Tregs in NF 1 patients could provide a novel therapeutic approach to interfere with the development of neurofibromas...|$|R
40|$|The {{neonatal}} skin lesions in Sudan had {{not been}} studied before. This is a cross – sectional descriptive hospital based study. A total of 602 Newborns (NB) delivered at Omdurman Maternity Hospital were examined {{for the presence of}} skin and oral lesions within 96 hours of birth to study the clinical spectrum of neonatal cutaneous lesions, from August 2007 to January 2008. Precoded questionnaire regarding perinatal, maternal, and family medical history was administered to the mother of each child, clinical examinations were recorded and laboratory investigations were used to confirm the diagnoses of certain lesions. The data were collected, stored and analyzed using x 2 and Fishers exact test for statistical association. The commonest types of skin lesions in NBs were: Mongolian spots in 471 (79. 5 %) NBs, linea nigra in 421 (70 %), epithelial pearls in 285 (47 %), sebaceous hyperplasia in 197 (32. 7 %), milia in 107 (17. 7 %), salmon patch in 106 (17. 6 %), desquamation in 98 (16. 3 %), café-au-lait spots in 91 (15 %), erythema toxicum neonatorum in 82 (13. 6 %), Lanugo in 63 (10. 5 %), lcterus in 42 (7 %), congenital melanocytic nevi in 37 (6 %), transient viii neonatal pustular melanosis in 30 (5 %), supernumerary nipple in 28 (4. 6 %) and miliaria in 22 (3. 6 %) newborns. <b>Pigmentary</b> <b>lesions</b> comprised mainly birthmarks; melanocytic brown lesions (MS, CMN, CALS and LN) were the most frequently encountered clinically, this is influenced by the racial background of the study population. Desquamation was more frequent among those less than 24 hours age and post term neonates. Salmon patch was more frequent in female (24 %). Pustular eruptions in the neonate can have many clinical presentations and significance. Erythema toxicum and transient neonatal pustular melanosis (18. 6 %) were among the frequent, benign and temporary dermatoses of NBs. Both lesions were more frequent among full term babies who were appropriate for gestational age. Skin infections were seen in 15 (2. 5 %) newborns, omphalitis in 11 of NBs, impetigo bullosa manifested in 2 NBs, and skin abscess in 2 newborns.

Advanced maternal age {{is believed to be}} a risk factor for PKS. Ultrasound is a useful tool in the prenatal detection of characteristic findings associated with PKS. This article provides an overview of the prenatal sonographic features of PKS, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia, polyhydramnios, abnormal extremities, increased nuchal translucency or nuchal edema, cardiovascular anomalies, central nervous system anomalies, an abnormal facial profile, and other rare anomalies. Appropriate tissue samples and laboratory analytic techniques should be selected for an accurate prenatal diagnosis because of the instability of isochromosome 12 p and the potentially incorrect interpretation as tetrasomy 21 q on the traditional G-banded technique. Fryns syndrome, which has phenotypic overlap with PKS, is also discussed. Increasing awareness and knowledge of various anomalies of PKS on prenatal ultrasound would be helpful for the early detection of PKS.
