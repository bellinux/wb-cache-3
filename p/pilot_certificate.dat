5|$|Jessica {{was born}} in Falmouth, Massachusetts to Lisa Blair Hathaway and Lloyd Dubroff {{and moved to the}} San Francisco Bay Area in California when she was four. Although billed by the media as a pilot, Dubroff did not possess a medical {{certificate}} or a student <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate,</b> since they require a minimum age of 16, or a <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate</b> that requires a minimum age of 17, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. There was also no record-keeping body {{at the time of her}} trip recognizing any feats by underage pilots. Nevertheless, local, national, and international news media picked up and publicized her story, and closely followed her attempt until its tragic ending.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of December 9, 2016, Sherman died when his Zenair CH 601 Zodiac crashed outside of Marengo, Illinois. He was 63. He was flying {{from his home in}} Poplar Grove to Schaumburg Regional Airport to attend a holiday party. The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that Sherman's plane lost control soon after taking off, and that it crashed around 6:19 p.m. on December 9. Federal Aviation Administration records also showed that Sherman had a sport <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate,</b> meaning that by flying at night, he was violating the restrictions on his license.|$|E

25|$|An early {{interest}} in flying led Stewart to gain his private <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate</b> in 1935 and commercial pilot license in 1938.

25|$|In 1968, she was {{contacted}} by Learjet {{to see if}} she was interested in getting a type rating in one of their jets with the intent to set record flights for them.

25|$|Because the MU-2 offers {{very high}} {{performance}} {{at a relatively}} low cost, some of its operators lack sufficient training and experience for such an advanced aircraft. The MU-2 has performance similar to a small jet, yet early pilot certification required only a simple endorsement from pilot certificates for much slower twin piston-engine aircraft. The fact that numerous MU-2 pilots were inexperienced at high speeds and high altitudes seems to {{have resulted in the}} high crash rate. Once a type certification was required for an MU-2 <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate,</b> the accident rate dropped to normal levels.|$|E

While attending school there, he taught student observers while also undergoing flight training. He qualified as a pilot on 30 December 1916, and received Austrian <b>Pilot</b> <b>Certificate</b> No. 596 on 30 January 1917. The new pilot was posted to Flugegeschwader I on the Isonzo line. Here he and Julius Arigi flew as fighter escort to the unit's bombers and Strohschneider scored his first two victories despite a certain lack of finesse at the controls, as on 17 April 1917, he wrecked Hansa-Brandenburg D.I serial number 28.08. However, this assignment saw him awarded the Silver Military Merit Medal with Swords, {{as well as the}} Military Merit Medal Third Class.|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} requesting a transfer to the Signal Corps and on April 21, 1911, received Special Order 95, detailing him and 2nd Lt. Thomas DeWitt Milling of the 15th Cavalry, to Dayton, Ohio, for a course in flight instruction at the Wright brothers' aviation school at Simms Station, Ohio. While individually instructed, {{they were part of}} the school's May 1911 class that included three civilians and Lt. John Rodgers of the United States Navy. Beginning instruction on May 3 with Arthur L. Welsh, Arnold made his first solo flight May 13 after three hours and forty-eight minutes of flight in 28 lessons. On May 14, he and Milling completed their instruction. Arnold received Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate</b> No. 29 on July 6, 1911, and Military Aviator Certificate No. 2 a year later. He also was recognized by a general order in 1913 as one of the first 24 rated military aviators, authorized to wear the newly designed Military Aviator badge.|$|E
500|$|Since {{a medical}} {{certificate}} {{and a private}} pilot's license have a minimum age requirement of 16 and 17 respectively, the new rule prohibits [...] "child pilots" [...] such as Jessica Dubroff and Vicki Van Meter from manipulating the flight controls if they are pursuing a record, and the pilot in command's <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate</b> may be revoked for allowing such activity.|$|E

500|$|She {{began taking}} flight lessons from flight {{instructor}} Joe Reid on her sixth birthday, and became enthusiastic about flying. Her father suggested {{the idea of}} a coast-to-coast flight, which Jessica readily accepted, and Reid agreed to provide flight instruction and his aircraft for the endeavor. They decided to name their flight [...] "Sea to Shining Sea"; Lloyd ordered custom-made caps and T-shirts with that logo to distribute as souvenirs during their stops. Although she had received over 33 hours of flight training, seven-year-old Jessica did not hold an FAA medical certificate, nor any pilot or student certificate. In the U.S., a person must be at least 16 years of age to be eligible for a student <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate,</b> and 17 for a <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate.</b> Since Dubroff was not certified to fly the plane, a rated pilot (normally her flight instructor Reid) had to be at the controls during all flight operations. While the coast-to-coast flight was promoted as a [...] "record" [...] attempt because of Dubroff's young age, there was no known body recognizing record flights by underage [...] "pilots" [...] {{at the time of her}} flight (The Guinness Book of Records had officially discontinued its [...] "youngest pilot" [...] categories seven years earlier, because of the risk of accidents).|$|E
500|$|The {{accident}} {{and its associated}} publicity led to federal legislation to prevent similar [...] "record" [...] attempts by underage pilots from {{taking place in the}} future. The legislation passed the House on September 11, 1996, and the Senate on September 18, 1996. On September 27, 1996, differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill were resolved. On October 9, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, including the Child Pilot Safety Act, into law. The statute prohibits anyone who does not hold at least a private <b>pilot</b> <b>certificate</b> and a current medical certificate from manipulating the controls of an aircraft, if that individual [...] "is attempting to set a record or engage in an aeronautical competition or aeronautical feat." ...|$|E
