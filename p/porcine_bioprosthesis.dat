40|$|BackgroundThe St Jude Medical Epic {{heart valve}} (St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn) is a tricomposite glutaraldehyde-preserved <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis.</b> The St Jude Medical Biocor <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> is the {{precursor}} valve to the St Jude Medical Epic valve. The Epic valve {{is identical to}} the Biocor valve except that it is treated with Linx AC ethanol-based calcium mitigation therapy. MethodsThe St Jude Medical Epic valve was implanted in 761 patients (mean age 73. 9  ± 9. 2 years) between 2003 and 2006 in the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory study in 22 investigational centers. The position distribution was 557 aortic valve replacements, 175 mitral valve replacements, and 29 double valve replacements. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 50. 8 % of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and 36. 6 % of those undergoing mitral valve replacement. ResultsThe early mortality was 3. 6 % in aortic and 2. 3 % in mitral valve replacement. The follow-up was 1675. 5 patient-years with a mean of 2. 2  ± 1. 2 years/patient. Late mortality was 5. 2 %/patient-year in aortic and 6. 6 %/patient-year in mitral valve replacement. The late major thromboembolism rate was 0. 98 %/patient-year for aortic and 2. 6 %/patient-year for mitral valve replacement. There were 19 reoperations, including 2 for structural valve deterioration, 1 for thrombosis, 9 for nonstructural dysfunction, and 7 for prosthetic valve endocarditis. The actuarial freedom from reoperation owing to structural valve deterioration for aortic valve replacement at 4 years for age 60 years or less was 93. 3 % ± 6. 4 %; for ages 61 to 70 years, 98. 1 % ± 1. 9 %; and for older than 70 years, 100 % (P = . 0006  > 70 vs ≤ 60 years). There were no events of structural deterioration with mitral valve replacement. The actuarial freedom from major thromboembolism for all patients at 4 years was 93. 6 % ± 1. 0 %. The 2 cases of structural valve deterioration occurred in aortic valves that became perforated without calcification causing aortic regurgitation.

However, {{the data of}} long-term performance of Carpentier-Edwards standard porcine valve in areas with a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease are still lacking. In this study, we assessed the clinical performance of Carpentier-Edwards standard <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> in a patient group with high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease. MethodsA total of 872 patients underwent valvular heart surgery with Carpentier-Edwards standard <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> replacement between 1975 and 1999 {{and the results were}} analyzed. Rheumatic etiology counts for 95 % of the patients. Mean age of operation was 40 ± 14 years (mitral valve), 43 ± 19 years (aortic valve), and 45 ± 13 years (double valve). Follow-up was 95. 6 % complete and continued up to 24 years (total 7017 patient-years) with mean of 8. 9 ± 5. 1 years. ResultsThe operative mortality rate was 5. 85 %. Actuarial patient survival rates after discharge at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were 92. 5 %, 83. 8 %, 72. 3 %, and 35. 8 %, respectively. A total of 442 cases received reoperation due to failure of bioprostheses. The mean duration to valve failure is 12. 2 ± 0. 4 years.

40|$|ObjectivesDurability {{remains the}} main problem of all bioprosthetic valves, and {{calcification}} is the major cause of failure. New tissue treatment processes are expected to reduce mineralization. A comparative animal study was undertaken to evaluate {{the behavior of a}} new-generation <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> in contrast with a first-generation <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis.</b> The primary goal was to evaluate the efficacy of α-amino-oleic acid as an anticalcification treatment. MethodsSeventeen Targhee sheep (aged 4. 5 - 7 months) had a mitral valve replacement with a Mosaic or Hancock Standard. The animals were followed up to 20 weeks (144. 1 ± 4. 0 days vs 144. 3 ± 8. 2 days) and then euthanized as scheduled. After gross examination, the explants were radiographed for the presence of calcification. The central portions were preserved for histologic examination, and the remainder of the sample was analyzed for quantitative calcium content by atomic absorption spectroscopy. ResultsFour Mosaic sheep were excluded because of perioperative surgical mortality. The remaining 13 were enrolled in the study (9 Mosaic and 4 Hancock Standard). The mean calcium content was 1. 97 ± 2. 21 μg/mg tissue weight for Mosaic versus 8. 36 ± 4. 12 μg/mg for Hancock Standard valves (P <. 01). Mild fibrous tissue overgrowth and fibrinous lining were observed regardless the xenograft type.

BackgroundWith new bioprostheses on the horizon, there is renewed interest in how the long-term durability of current pericardial bioprostheses compares with the traditional <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis.</b> MethodsWe reviewed 518 AVR with CE porcine valves from 1974 to 1996 and 1, 021 AVR with CE pericardial valves from 1991 to 2002. The age distribution and clinical profiles were similar for both groups. The total (mean) follow-up was 3, 322 (6. 4) years for porcine and 2, 556 (2. 5) years for pericardial. ResultsLong-term mortality was similar (p = 0. 29) for porcine and pericardial, with 10 -year survival rates of 34 ± 2 % and 38 ± 6 %, respectively. Ten-year freedom from major adverse cardiac events was also similar for both (respectively) : thromboembolism (80 ± 2 % and 87 ± 2 %; p = 0. 24); endocarditis (98 ± 1 % and 99 ± 1 %; p = 0. 30). However, 10 -year freedom from explant was lower for porcine (90 ± 2 %) than for pericardial (97 ± 1 %, p = 0. 04). Reasons for explant for porcine were structural valve deterioration (SVD) (n = 25), endocarditis (n = 4), and periprosthetic leak (n = 2). The reasons for explant for pericardial were SVD (n = 4), endocarditis (n = 4) and periprosthetic leak (n = 1).

A significant stent deformity (reduction of the triangular area greater than 40 %) was observed only in 6 PBs explanted because of tissue failure after a mean function time of 69. 6 +/- 28 months. In these PBs, scanning electron microscopy of the bare surface of the stent at the point of maximal flexion showed cracks 0. 7 - 1 microns large, which represent the morphological substrate of the so-called "creep" of polypropylene.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different antimineralization {{treatments}} of stented <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> were evaluated: ethanol (Epic), alpha-amino-oleic acid (AOA) (Mosaic), and {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) (Hancock II). A nontreated, glutaraldehyde-fixed valve (Labcor) served as control. METHODS: For each treatment, six valves were implanted in juvenile sheep in the pulmonary position. Valves were explanted after 3 and 6 months and examined macroscopically, by roentgenogram and light and transmission electron microscopy. Calcium content (microg/mg) was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: The Labcor valves revealed small calcium deposits in the cusps, although calcium content remained low (median value 0. 4 +/- 0. 8 microg/mg). SDS did not prevent cusp calcification as assessed by histology and calcium content measurement, which was higher than in all other valves: 1. 9 +/- 4. 6 microg/mg (p < 0. 05). Cusp retraction and rupture were occasionally found in the Hancock. The Mosaic and Epic valves showed no cusp calcification and had low calcium contents (0. 3 +/- 2. 4 microg/mg and 0. 7 +/- 0. 6 microg/mg, respectively). Epic showed less pannus formation, but had hematoma or iron staining in the cusps. CONCLUSIONS: SDS is inefficient as an antimineralization treatment, in contrast to ethanol or AOA.

40|$|AbstractPorcine bioprostheses {{are often}} used for tricuspid valve replacement, yet the {{long-term}} outcome after this procedure is not well documented. Therefore, the records of 129 patients undergoing tricuspid valve replacement with Carpentier-Edwards (n = 88) or Hancock (n = 41) prostheses between 1975 and 1993 were reviewed. The operation required a repeat median sternotomy in 66 of 129 (51 %) patients, whereas 67 of 129 (52 %) underwent double or triple valve replacement. Operative mortality was 14 % (2 / 14) in patients undergoing first-time isolated tricuspid valve replacement and 27 % (35 / 129) overall. Survival at 5, 10, and 14 years was 56 % ± 5 %, 48 % ± 5 %, and 31 % ± 9 %, and freedom from tricuspid reoperation at 5, 10, and 14 years was 96 % ± 3 %, 93 % ± 4 %, and 49 % ± 17 %.

40|$|AbstractValve {{replacement}} {{has been}} one of the most important advances in the management of patients with valvular heart disease. The 10 and 15 year survival rate after isolated aortic and mitral valve replacement with the Starr-Edwards valve is 56 and 44 %, respectively. At 5 and 7 years, survival with the Björk-Shiley, porcine bio-prosthesis and the Starr-Edwards valve is similar. Patients operated on during the last 5 to 10 years have a much better survival rate than those operated on in the 1960 s; therefore, the 10 and 15 year survival of those operated on recently should improve. All patients with a mechanical prosthesis need long term anticoagulant therapy with drugs of the Coumadin type. <b>Porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> have a low failure rate up to 5 years after valve replacement; after this, valve failure occurs at an increasing rate, but the incidence at 10 and 15 years is not known.

40|$|The present {{series of}} {{investigations}} {{was designed to}} supply information on in vivo pressureflow relationships and to analyse the incidence of regurgitation in different heart valve prostheses in the aortic position. Patients and methods: The study population comprised 185 patients with mechanical Björk-Shiley Monostrut prostheses, 54 patients with Biocor stented <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses,</b> 50 patients with extended Biocor stentless bioprostheses and 59 patients with cryopreserved aortic homografts. Transvalvular pressure differences and volume flow estimates were derived noninvasively from Doppler measurement of blood velocity across the prosthesis and in the left ventricular outflow tract. Measurements were performed at rest and during supine symptom-limited bicycle exercise. Aortic regurgitation was evaluated semi-quantitatively using colour flow Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler. Patients were investigated after surgery, prior to hospital discharge (baseline) and approximately every year postoperatively. Results: Reference values for baseline Doppler echocardiographic variables for normally functioning prostheses in the aortic position were established. The newly-developed extended Biocor stentless bioprosthesis showed low pressure differences associated with a significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy {{during the first six}} months after aortic valve replacement, and low incidence of aortic regurgitation. A decrease of 40 % in pressure differences from baseline to six-month examination was observed in patients with stentless prostheses, partly depending on different haemodynamic states of patients early after the operation. Subcoronarily implanted cryopreserved aortic homografts. demonstrated excellent haemodynamic performance with low pressure differences and large effective orifice areas. Timerelated increasing risk of progression of aortic regurgitation observed during follow-up justifies more frequent echocardiographic monitoring in patients with homograft valves, especially when aortic regurgitation is detected on baseline examination. Different types of prosthesis of similar size were compared at rest and during exercise. The lowest pressure differences and the largest effective orifice areas were demonstrated in homograft valves, followed by extended Biocor stentless bioprostheses. With a 65 - 70 % increase in cardiac output induced by exercise, pressure differences and valve resistance increased significantly while effective orifice area remained unchanged in all four prosthesis types studied. Doppler-derived haemodynamic variables can be obtained at rest and during supine symptom- limited exercise with low variability. The exercise performed in this study was interrupted at a high level of subjective exertion; thus the exercise pressure differences obtained are likely to represent maximal values for pressure differences occurring in the patients' daily activities. Conclusions: In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, Doppler echocardiography at rest provides basic information on prosthetic valve function. In addition, exercise Doppler echocardiography provides further valuable insight into valve haemodynamics during physiologically increased volume flow. These results can be obtained with low variability. The stentless <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> and cryopreserved aortic homograft valves exhibit low valve resistance to flow at rest and exercise, reflecting the low haemodynamic load imposed by these valves on the left ventricle...|$|R

MethodsFrom 1981 through 1999, 1823 patients (mean age, 68. 9 ± 10. 9 years; range, 19 - 89 years) underwent 1847 procedures. Concomitant {{coronary artery bypass}} was performed in 788 (42. 7 %) patients. Previous valve procedures were performed in 107 (5. 8 %) patients, and other cardiac procedures were performed in 87 (4. 7 %) patients. ResultsThe overall valve-related complication rate was 4. 36 % per patient-year (630 patients), with a fatality rate of 0. 96 % per patient-year (139 patients). Patient survival at 18 years was 15. 8 % ± 1. 6 %. Overall late mortality rate was 6. 3 % per patient-year. Overall actual cumulative freedom at 18 years from reoperation was 85. 0 % ± 1. 2 %, valve-related mortality was 88. 7 % ± 1. 1 %, and valve-related residual morbidity was 96. 3 % ± 5. 0 %. Actual freedom from structural valve deterioration at 18 years was 86. 4 % ± 1. 2 % overall, 90. 5 % ± 1. 8 % for age 61 to 70 years, and 98. 2 % ± 0. 6 % for age greater than 70 years. Structural valve deterioration presented with pathologic evidence consistent with stenosis in 27. 6 % and insufficiency in 72. 4 %. Hemodynamic performance at 1 year revealed normal effective orifice area indexes for sizes 23 to 27 mm and mild-to-moderate reduction for size 21 mm. ConclusionsThe Carpentier-Edwards supra-annular aortic <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> continues to provide excellent freedom from structural valve deterioration and overall freedom from valve-related residual morbidity, mortality, and reoperation up to 18 years. Hemodynamic performance is satisfactory. The prosthesis remains recommended for patients older than 70 years and for patients 61 to 70 years of age, especially when comorbid risk factors are not anticipated to provide extended survival...|$|E
40|$|A 44 -year-old man {{underwent}} {{aortic valve}} replacementwith a <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> 21 {{years ago for}} infective endocarditis complicated by a cerebral mycotic aneurysm and intracranial bleeding. Nine years ago, he had a second aortic valve replacement with a mechanical bileaflet tilting-disk prosthesis because of porcine prosthesis degeneration. No pseudoaneurysm was noted on the operative report. Six months ago, he developed angina and had a positive stress test for ischemia. Angiography showed severe left main coronary artery (LM) stenosis, which was treated with intravascular ultrasound – guided percutaneous coronary intervention with a zotarolimus-eluting stent. Two months ago, he again developed angina. Follow-up angiography and intravascular ultrasound revealed severe Figure 1. Coronary angiography (A, systole; B, diastole) reveals severe in-stent restenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia in the proximal third (black arrow) of the LM but also extrinsic systolic compression of the middle and distal thirds (white arrows). C, Intravascular ultrasound of the middle third confirms systolic compression. D, The final result of the percutaneous coronary intervention was excellent...|$|E
40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that in a healthy heart, there exist a large {{asymmetric}} vortex structure that aids in establishing a steady flow field in the left ventricle. However, the implantation of existing artificial heart valves at the mitral position is found to {{have a negative effect on}} this physiological flow pattern. In light of this, a novel D-shaped bileaflet <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> (GD valve) has been designed based on the native geometry mitral valve, with the hypothesis that biomimicry in valve design can restore physiological left ventricle flow patterns after valve implantation. An in-vitro experiment using two dimensional particle velocimetry imaging was carried out to determine the hemodynamic performance of the new bileaflet design and then compared to that of the well-established St. Jude Epic valve which functioned as a control in the experiment. Although both valves were found to have similar Reynolds shear stress and Turbulent Kinetic Energy levels, the novel D-shape valve was found to have lower turbulence intensity and greater mean kinetic energy conservation...|$|E
40|$|A {{pathological}} {{study has}} been performed on 10 infected Hancock bioprostheses removed from nine patients who died of prosthetic endocarditis. The devices had been in place from 2 to 87 months (average 37. 5), the interval between operation and onset of infection averaging 30 months. The offending organisms were Gram negative bacteria in three patients (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens), Gram positive bacteria in two (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans), and fungi in four (Candida species in three and Aspergillus species in one). Gross examination of the explants revealed in most cases a vegetative endocarditis of one porcine valve leaflets. Septic embolization occurred in five cases owing to the high friability of the vegetations. Prosthetic valve incompetence was the commonest type to dysfunction observed because of tears, perforations, and even complete destruction of the cusps. Prosthetic valve stenosis following obstruction of the valve orifice by infected polypous masses was noted in two cases. Clumps of infective organisms were detected deep in the cusp tissue in most cases on histologic examination. Infection located on the paraprosthetic tissues, associated with ring abscess, valve detachment, and insufficiency, was observed only once. According {{to the results of}} investigation, endocarditis on <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> is associated with a better preserved native valvular ring as viewed at reoperation. Therefore surgical intervention appears appropriate in the presence of severe hemodynamic complications after adequate antibiotic treatment. However, infection of these particular prostheses still carries an extremely high mortality. In the present series, this poor outcome might be explained by the frequently associated septic and thromboembolic events...|$|R
50|$|Macro and {{microscopic}} pathology {{studies of}} failed <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> by Schoen and Cohn showed {{in detail the}} process of tissue degeneration in valves with tears, calcification, or both. They consider that patients with porcine aortic bioprosthetic valves follow a clinically satisfactory course for around five years after operation. Late deterioration of these valves frequently necessitates re-operation. They estimate the rate of failure at approximately 15 to 25%, 7 to 10 years after valve implantation. Gallo and his associates describe in detail the rate of occurrence and timing of primary tissue failure with the Hancock porcine valve, and show a similar percentage of failures. The actuarial freedom from valve failure in the mitral position at 10 years is 69%, and in the aortic position only 53%. The rate of tissue valve failure accelerated from the third post-operative year in the mitral position, and from the fifth year in the aortic position with a precipitous fall during the 8th and 9th years of follow-up. They believe that the patient can be told {{that he or she}} has a 30% chance of requiring re-operation because of the porcine valve degeneration within the next 10 years. This general calculation {{does not take into account}} the other causes of valve 'problems' which may lead to re-operation or some other morbidity during that period of time. Goffin showed in a comparative histological study of explanted porcine and pericardial valves that the microscopic pathologic changes were similar in these two types of tissue. Grabenwoger found similar pathologic changes in the failed Sorin Pericarbon pericardial valve.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Mechanical {{valves and}} bioprostheses are the {{commonly}} used devices in aortic valve replacement (AVR). Many patients with valvular disease also require concomitant {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG). We used a microsimulation model to {{provide insight into the}} outcomes of patients after AVR with mechanical valves and stented bioprostheses, with and without CABG, and to determine the age-thresholds or age crossover points in outcomes between the two valve types. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of published results after primary AVR with mechanical prostheses (nine reports, 4274 patients, 25, 726 patient-years) and stented <b>porcine</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> (13 reports, 9007 patients, 54, 151 patient-years) to estimate risks of valve-related events. A hazard ratio of 1. 3 was used to incorporate the effect of CABG on long-term survival. Estimates were entered into a microsimulation model, which was then used to predict the outcomes of patients after AVR, with and without CABG. The model calculations were validated using a large data set from Portland, USA. Results: For a 65 -year-old male without CABG, the life expectancy (LE) was 11. 2 and 11. 6 years and the event-free life expectancy (EFLE) was 8. 2 and 8. 9 years, respectively, after implantation with mechanical valves and bioprostheses. The lifetime risk of at least one valve-related event was 51 and 47 %, respectively. The age crossover point between the two valve types, considering the above outcome parameters, was 59, 60 and 63 years, respectively. CABG reduced LE and consequently EFLE and lifetime risk of an event, but only minimally influenced the patient age crossover points. The model calculations showed good agreement with the Portland data. Conclusions: The currently recommende...|$|R
