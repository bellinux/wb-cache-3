40|$|The first-order system least-squares {{methodology}} {{represents an}} alternative to standard mixed finite element methods. Among its advantages {{is the fact that}} the finite element spaces approximating the pressure and flux variables are not restricted by the inf-sup condition and that the least-squares functional itself serves as an appropiate error measure. This paper studies the first-order system least-squares approach for scalar second-order elliptic boundary value problems with discontinuous coefficients. Ellipticity of an appropriately scaled least-squares bilinear form is shown independently of the size of the jumps in the coefficients leading to adequate finite element approximation results. The occurrence of singularities at interface corners and cross-points is discussed, and a weighted least-squares functional is introduced to handle such cases. Numerical experiments are presented for two test problems to illustrate the performance of this approach. Introduction The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>th</b> [...] ...|$|E

The purpose of this effort was to test the accuracy of Delphi vs the conference method in making long-range forecasts. College students were used to form Delphi and conference groups that predicted the point spreads of college football games far in advance of play. The results substantiate the claim that Delphi outperforms conference methods on the basis of accuracy for long-range forecasting. For several decades organizations have attempted to amass the talents of groups of individuals in an effort to combine their individual skills and improve decision making. Group decisions are necessary when the scope of a problem is such that no one individual has sufficient expertise and knowledge to effect a solution. However, the traditional process of grouping these “experts ” together has caused a number of counterproductive side effects.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{equations}} of state which most accurately reproduce ther-modynamic data over wide ranges of mn-ditions are usually nonlinear functions of the equation of state parameters. The in-creasing use of computers in process design has made the task of using these complex equations of state much less formidable. Consequently, there exists a real need for a means to determine equation of state parameters which best represent the avail-able thermodynamic data. Starling (1) presented convincing evi-dence that the simultaneous use of multi-property thermodynamic data,;. ~., DOC: only pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data. but also enthalpy, vapor pressure and vapor-liquid equilibrium data, allows de-termination of equation of state parameters which predict all properties well. Non-linear regression methods have been ap-plied in several multiproperty equation of state studies at the University of Oklahoma (2, 3, 4) with good success. The primary difficulty in using nonlinear regression methods in multiproperty equation of state development is that for each additional property considered, the number of re-quired calculations is increased dramatic-ally. Leung and Quon (5) and Qare (6) used dual linear programming to determine optimal equation of state parameters for a linear (Chebyshev) objective function with and without constraints upon the enthalpy departure.

40|$|The term “social capital ” is {{ubiquitous}} incontemporary sociology. Its appeal rests, in part, on {{its capacity}} to stir in sociologists {{a renewed sense of}} the significance for collective action of social relations as distinct from the economic utilities of individuals or the power of public bureaucracies (Coleman 1990). In addi-tion, as Lin, Cook, and Burt (2001 :vii) observe, the various meanings of social capital “capture the essence ” of concepts that are central to the sociological heritage, such as social integra-tion, social cohesion, solidarity, and social dis-organization. The richness of the concept of social capital is not universally applauded. Critics accuse social capital of “becoming all things to all peo-ple, and hence nothing to anyone ” (Woolcock 2000 : 7; see also Woolcock 1998). Nevertheless, the varied, murky, elusive, and even circular meanings of the concept give it great analytical flexibility and multiply its empirical applica-tions. In an astute review of conceptual contro-versies surrounding social capital, Portes (1998 : 21 – 22) calls for assessments of the caus-es and effects of social capital “as manifold processes. |. |. to be studied in all their com-plexity. ” We follow Portes ’ (1998) advice in this report by partitioning the several dimensions of social capital and estimating their interrelationships with criminal homicide.
