40|$|Baicalin has a {{protective}} effect on hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats, but {{the mechanism of}} this effect remains unclear. Thus, investigating the potential mechanism of this effect was {{the aim of the}} present study. Model rats that display hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale under control conditions were successfully generated. We measured a series of indicators to observe the levels of pulmonary arterial hypertension, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> remodeling, and right ventricular remodeling. We assessed the activation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> walls and pulmonary tissue homogenates using immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses, respectively. The matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 9 protein and mRNA levels in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> walls were measured using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Our results demonstrated that baicalin not only reduced p 38 MAPK activation in both the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> walls and tissue homogenates but also downregulated the protein and mRNA expression levels of MMP- 9 in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> walls. This downregulation was accompanied by the attenuation of pulmonary hypertension, arteriole remodeling, and right ventricular remodeling. These results suggest that baicalin may attenuate pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, which are induced by chronic hypoxia, by downregulating the p 38 MAPK/MMP- 9 pathway...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPulmonary {{hypertension}} {{in chronic}} mitral valve disease has been related most commonly to {{left ventricular dysfunction}} or mitral stenosis; its association with chronic, isolated mitral regurgitation and preserved left ventricular systolic function is unclear. In 41 catheterized patients with chronic mitral regurgitation (known history of mitral regurgitation for > 18 months) and preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction > 0. 55), historic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables were analyzed. Ten patients (Group 1) had normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure (> 30 mm Hg), whereas 31 patients had pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was mildly increased (30 to 49 mm Hg) in 13 patients (Group II) and was > 50 mm Hg in 18 patients (Group III). Univariate analysis showed the more frequent occurrence of male gender and ruptured chordae tendineae in the groups with pulmonary hypertension. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, size of the V wave in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> resistance were higher, whereas cardiac index was lower in the hypertension groups. Multivariate stepwise analysis revealed higher mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> resistance as the only variables independently differing among groups. In conclusion, pulmonary hypertension occurs frequently (76 % of cases) in patients with chronic, isolated mitral regurgitation with preserved left ventricular systolic function. In these patients, a severe increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is associated with elevation in pulmonary artery resistance, a finding {{similar to that in}} mitral stenosis...|$|E

The response of the pulmonary vessels to angiotensin was usually passive. Cardiac output declined in the normal subject after angiotensin administration. Right to left shunts decreased after angiotensin administration in some patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, thus decreasing cyanosis. This finding has possible therapeutic applications.

40|$|A {{heritable}} {{basis to}} {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} (PAH) was initially observed by Dresdale in 1954. Familial clustering has since been recorded in approximately 10 % of the patient population although, due to the complex features of inheritance in PAH, it is widely acknowledged {{that the proportion of}} patients with one or more affected relatives is likely to be higher. Indeed, familial PAH has since been reclassified as heritable or HPAH {{in light of the fact}} that a germline genetic defect may be transmissible to future generations in as many as a third of all cases. In the majority of cases, PAH is idiopathic arising spontaneously without familial sharing and without a detectable underlying genetic cause. PAH may occur in association with known risk factors, for example, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine derived appetite suppressant drugs, or other disorders including thromboembolic disease, connective tissue disease, congenital heart disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Aberrant signaling via TGF-β receptor I/activin receptor-like kinase 5 may be important for both the development and progression of PAH. We investigated the therapeutic potential of a well-characterized and potent activin receptor-like kinase 5 inhibitor, SB 525334 [6 -(2 -tert-butyl- 5 -{ 6 -methyl-pyridin- 2 -yl}- 1 H-imidazol- 4 -yl) -quinoxaline] {{for the treatment of}} PAH. In this study, we demonstrate that pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells from patients with familial forms of idiopathic PAH exhibit heightened sensitivity to TGF-β 1 in vitro, which can be attenuated after the administration of SB 525334.

40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) {{is a rare}} and fatal disease caused by excessive remodelling of small <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles.</b> Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR 2) have recently been identified in {{a large portion of}} patients with familial and idiopathic PAH. However, how mutations in this ubiquitously expressed receptor result in such a specific abnormality of the lung microcirculation is unknown. We hypothesized that loss-of-function mutations in BMPR 2 lead to PAH by increasing the susceptibility of ECs to apoptosis, particularly within fragile <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles.</b> To examine the consequences of BMPR 2 mutations on the development of PAH, we generated mice that ubiquitously over-express an arginine to stop mutation in the receptor's C-terminal domain (BMPR 2 R 899 X) Characterization of these mice revealed a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, an indicator of pulmonary pressure, which was associated with muscularization of small <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles,</b> alveolar septal thickening and pulmonary macrophage infiltration. In addition, a modest increase in apoptosis was detected in these mice. These data suggest that BMPR 2 loss-of-function mutations increase the susceptibility of ECs to apoptosis and set the stage for excessive inflammation, possibly leading to spontaneous PAH.

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived MVs (MSC-MVs) on pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in rats. Methods: MSC-MVs were isolated from rat bone marrow MSCs that were cultured in a serum-free conditioned medium. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), flow cytometry and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) were used to characterize the MVs. Adult SD rats were injected with monocrotaline (50 mg/kg, sc) to induce PAH. Three weeks later, the rats were intravenously injected with MSCs, MSC-MVs or saline for 2 weeks. At the end of treatments, the hemodynamic parameters and pathological right ventricular and pulmonary arterial remodeling were analyzed in each group. Results: The MSC-MVs showed general morphologic characteristics of MVs and expressed annexin V and CD 29 markers under TEM, and their size ranged from 40 to 300 nm. Intravenous injection of MSC-MVs or MSCs significantly ameliorated the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and mean right ventricle pressure (mRVP) in PAH rats.

The microvessels of the lung were studied 7 - 10 days after allografting by anesthetizing the hamster with pentobarbital (6. 0 mg/ 100 g body weight i. p.) and then preparing the lung tissue for observation.

40|$|We have {{recently}} reported that transgenic (mRen 2) 27 rats (Ren 2 rats) exhibit {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} (PAH), which is, in part, mediated by oxidative stress. Since 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) exhibit beneficial vascular effects independent of cholesterol synthesis, we hypothesized that rosuvastatin (RSV) treatment ameliorates PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling in Ren 2 rats, in part, by reducing oxidative stress. Six-week-old male Ren 2 and Sprague-Dawley rats received RSV (10 mg·kg− 1 ·day− 1 ip) or vehicle for 3 wk. After treatment, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. To evaluate treatment effects on <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> remodeling, morphometric analyses were performed to quantitate medial thickening and cell proliferation, whereas whole lung samples were used to quantitate the levels of 3 -nitrotyrosine, superoxide, stable nitric oxide (NO) metabolites [nitrates and nitrites (NOx) ], and expression of NO synthase isoforms. In the Ren 2 rat, RVSP is normal at 5 wk of age, PAH develops between 5 and 7 wk of age, and the elevated pressure is maintained with little variation through 13 wk. At 8 wk of age, left ventricular function and blood gases were normal in the Ren 2 rat. Ren 2 rats exhibited elevations in medial hypertrophy due to smooth muscle cell proliferation, 3 -nitrotyrosine, NOx, NADPH oxidase activity, and endothelial NO synthase expression compared with Sprague-Dawley rats. RSV significantly blunted the increase in RVSP but did not reduce MAP in the Ren 2 rat; additionally, RSV significantly attenuated the elevated parameters examined in the Ren 2 rat.

40|$|These {{studies have}} {{investigated}} different candidate genomic regions {{for their contributions}} to ascites in broilers. Ascites syndrome is a manifestation of idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> hypertension that concerns the poultry industry worldwide. Investigations have demonstrated the disease to be genetically regulated and to exhibit moderate to high heritabilities. Although previous studies have indicated a few chromosomes {{to be involved with}} ascites, no genes have been identified to date with direct links to the disease. This dissertation presents a collection of studies that determine the genomic and genetic interactions for regions on chromosome 2 and 9 for ascites phenotypes in broiler chickens. The dissertation further focuses on developing genetic markers for selection of broilers for ascites-resistance. To achieve these aims, the studies described here use two high throughput approaches- genome-wide association and whole genome re-sequencing. A previously identified region on chromosome 9 was further investigated with fine mapping using SNPs. A region on chromosome 2 was investigated using 2 different SNPs. Neither of these regions was found to contain more than a minor association with ascites. Re-evaluation of chromosome 2 and 9 by whole genome resequencing identified multiple regions. One of the most intriguing regions was further evaluated and found to contain the most significant association with ascites ever identified. The region contains the CPQ gene. The data support three different alleles for CPQ with two of those alleles associated with resistance to ascites. Those two alleles appear to be expressed at higher levels in three tissues critical for oxygen homeostasis. Taken together, this collection of studies provides an insight and adds to our current understanding of the molecular correlates of the disease. The markers developed in these studies will be useful in breeding schemes for ascites resistance in the broiler industry...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Idiopathic <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>arteriole</b> {{hypertension}} (IPAH) {{is a rare}} but severely {{debilitating disease}} that strikes women to men {{at a ratio of}} 3 : 1. Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is a hallmark of the disease. This includes rapid growth of the ECs until the occlusion of the vasculature as well as decreased blood levels of vasodilators. Markedly increased levels of endothelin- 1, a potent vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogen, have been noted in IPAH patients. Recently mutations in the bone morphogenic protein receptor type II (BMPRII) have been linked to the disease. Interestingly mutations in activin-like kinase- 1 (ALK- 1) and endoglin have been linked to hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a disease that results in PAH clinically indistinguishable from IPAH. All of these proteins are either receptors or co-receptors to members of the TGFbeta superfamily. The connection of these mutations to the disease still remains largely a mystery to researchers and the effects of either bone morphogenic proteins 2, 4, 7 or TGFbeta levels on endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) production in human microvascular endothelial cells cultured from normal lungs (HMVEC-LBI) are unknown. Methods: HMVEC-LBI cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of BMP 2, 4, 7 and TGFbeta, in complete media or serum starved conditions. After allotted time points the media was collected and assayed by ELISA, meanwhile the cells were lysed and protein content assayed for normalization purposes. Small Mothers against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) 1 / 5 phosphorylation was also measured. Results and Conclusions: Despite evidence that all BMPs used were biologically active, namely through SMAD phosphorylation studies, only BMP 7 at very high dosages increased ET- 1 production levels. TGFbeta had a more pronounced effect at earlier time points with lower concentrations. The results provide insights on the effects of an important group of proteins, the BMPs and TGFbeta, on lung microvascular ECs and which are likely the key cellular player In IPAH development. These findings may have clinical relevance in terms of control of the disease and understanding the normal response of these cells BMPs and TGFbeta...|$|E

Two groups of commercial broiler chickens were used: one of them were raised at 2638 (hypobaric hypoxia) and the other one at 300 m (relative normoxia) above sea level. Incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was evaluated by calculating the cardiac mass index values and ET- 1 protein expression was established in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> by immunohistochemistry and morphometry. Results. ET- 1 expression was higher in arterioles of animals exposed to hypoxia as compared to the low altitude exposed broilers (p< 0. 01). <b>Arterioles</b> from <b>pulmonary</b> hypertensive chickens (PHC) showed ET- 1 higher expression than arterioles from healthy chickens (non-hypertensive, NHC) at low altitude, those exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (p< 0. 01). 53 % of chickens subjected to altitude conditions developed pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|Background—Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) is {{a progressive}} disease characterized by raised pulmonary vascular resistance, {{thought to be}} curable only through lung transplantation. Pathophysiologically, proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells triggers pulmonary arterial stenosis and/or regurgitation, especially in advanced PH. Methods and Results—Using a rat model of advanced pulmonary vascular disease produced by injecting monocrotaline, we show that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) targets <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> and blocks the progression of PH. In these rats, endogenous HGF production was dramatically downregulated during developing experimental PH, but c-Met/HGF receptor was abundant in the medial layers of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles.</b> HGF gene transfection 2 weeks after the monocrotaline injection resulted in milder medial hyperplasia in lung arterioles and inhibited overgrowth of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Notably, exogenous HGF reduced lung expression levels of endothelin- 1 and transforming growth factor-, which are critically involved in PH-linked fibrogenic events. Overall, medial wall thickening of pulmonary arteries was almost completely prevented by HGF, and the total collagen deposition in the lung decreased; both effects contributed to the suppression of pulmonary artery hypertension. Conclusions—Our {{results suggest that the}} loss of endogenous HGF may be a feature of the pathogenesis of PH and that HGF supplementation may minimize pathological lung conditions, even advanced PH.

With respect o the postcapillary venules and pulmonary venules, it was discovered that, in the cat lung, true smooth muscle cells, albeit widely scattered, are present in these segments of the pulmonary microcirculation. These smooth muscle cells display extensive areas of myoendothelial junctions. That is, the cell membranes of the endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells make contact without an intervening basal Ian&a. Some myoendotbelial junctions were identified also in the arterioles and precapillary sphincter areas. However, they were few in number and had points of only limited membrane contact. The functional implications of these findings are discussed in terms of possible regulatory influence on the pulmonary microcirculation and hypothetical role in the development of pulmonary hypertension...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: P-selectin {{glycoprotein}} ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1) {{has been}} shown to {{play a significant role in}} septic lung injury. However, the detailed role of PSGL- 1 in the pulmonary leukocyte recruitment remains elusive. We have developed a method based on intravital fluorescence microscopy of the lung microcirculation to examine the role of PSGL- 1 in the extravasation process of leukocytes in septic lung damage. METHODS: Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated with a control antibody or an anti-PSGL- 1 antibody prior to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Leukocyte-endothelium interactions and microvascular hemodynamics were studied in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles,</b> capillaries and venules 4 h after CLP. RESULTS: Immunoneutralization of PSGL- 1 decreased CLP-induced leukocyte rolling in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> and venules significantly. Inhibition of PSGL- 1 had no effect on leukocyte adhesion in venules, whereas the number of adherent leukocytes in lung arterioles and the number of trapped leukocytes in capillaries were markedly decreased. Moreover, immunoneutralization of PSGL- 1 improved microvascular perfusion in the lung of septic animals. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results document that PSGL- 1 mediates leukocyte rolling in arterioles and venules. However, inhibition of PSGL- 1 only decreases leukocyte adhesion in arterioles, suggesting that leukocyte rolling is not a prerequisite for pulmonary venular adhesion of leukocytes in sepsis. In addition, our data show that capillary trapping of leukocytes is dependent on PSGL- 1 function...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease, characterized by functional or structural abnormalities involving distal <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> {{that result in}} increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and ultimately right heart failure. Our objective {{is to establish a}} conditional transgenic system in mice, to test the hypothesis that lung EC apoptosis at the level of distal <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> is necessary and sufficient to cause a PAH phenotype. In a pilot study, the Fas-Induced Apoptosis (FIA) construct was expressed under the control of endothelial-specific Tie 2 promoter in transgenic mice (i. e. EFIA mice). Administration of a small molecule dimerizing agent, AP 20187, resulted in lung modest dose-dependent PAH, which was associated with proliferative vascular lesions localized to distal lung arterioles in a small proportion of mice. Due to the low level of transgene expression in preliminary EFIA lines, we re-designed the transgenic vector by incorporating a more robust endothelial promoter (superTie 2). The new construct was transfected into HUVEC and BAEC and analyzed by monitoring immunofluorescence (DsRed). Data from the EFIA model suggests that EC apoptosis may be sufficient to induce a PAH phenotype with the characteristic lung vascular lesions. The EFIA model will allow us to better explore the mechanism that links distal lung EC apoptosis with reactive vascular cell proliferation in the pathogenesis of this devastating disease...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} is {{a severe}} and progressive disease, a key feature {{of which is}} pulmonary vascular remodeling. Several growth factors, including EGF, PDGF, and TGF-β 1, are involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling during pulmonary hypertension. However, increased knowledge of the downstream signaling cascades is needed if effective clinical interventions are to be developed. In this context, calpain provides an interesting candidate therapeutic target, since it is activated by EGF and PDGF and {{has been reported to}} activate TGF-β 1. Thus, in this study, we examined the role of calpain in pulmonary vascular remodeling in two rodent models of pulmonary hypertension. These data showed that attenuated calpain activity in calpain-knockout mice or rats treated with a calpain inhibitor resulted in prevention of increased right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, as well as collagen deposition and thickening of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> in models of hypoxia- and monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, inhibition of calpain in vitro blocked intracellular activation of TGF-β 1, which led to attenuated Smad 2 / 3 phosphorylation and collagen synthesis. Finally, smooth muscle cells of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension showed higher levels of calpain activation and intracellular active TGF-β. Our data provide evidence that calpain mediates EGF- and PDGF-induced collagen synthesis and proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells via an intracrine TGF-β 1 pathway in pulmonary hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The muscularization of non-muscular <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> is an {{important}} pathological feature of hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, {{the origin of the}} cells involved in this process is still not well understood. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) can induce transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which might {{play a key role in}} the muscularization of non-muscular <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles.</b> It was found that mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased significantly after 7 d of hypoxia. Pulmonary artery remodeling index and right ventricular hypertrophy became evident after 14 d of hypoxia. The distribution of nonmuscular, partially muscular, and muscular vessels was significantly different after 7 d of hypoxia. Immunocytochemistry results demonstrated that the expression of α-smooth muscle actin was increased in intra-acinar pulmonary arteries with increasing hypoxic time. TGF-β 1 mRNA expression in pulmonary arterial walls was increased significantly after 14 d of hypoxia, but showed no obvious changes after 3 or 7 d of hypoxia. In pulmonary tunica adventitia and tunica media, TGF-β 1 protein staining was poorly positive in control rats, but was markedly enhanced after 3 d of hypoxia, reaching its peak after 7 d of hypoxia. The myofibroblast phenotype was confirmed by electron microscopy, which revealed microfilaments and a well-developed rough endo-plasmic reticulum. Taken together, our results suggested that TGF-β 1 induces transdifferentiation of fibro...|$|R
40|$|During acute lung {{injury and}} repair, leukocytes {{are thought to}} enter the lung {{primarily}} across alveolar capillaries and postcapillary venules. We hypothesized that leukocytes also migrate across <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> and venules, which serve as alternative sites for leukocyte influx into the lung during acute lung injury and repair. Lung sections from C 57 BL/ 6 J mice up to 14 days after intratracheal bleomycin (3. 33 U/kg) or saline instillation were assessed by light, fluorescence, confocal, and transmission electron microscopy for evidence of inflammatory cell sequestration and transmigration at these sites. After bleomycin treatment, large numbers of leukocytes (including neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes) {{were present in the}} vascular lumina and in perivascular interstitia of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> and venules, as well as within the vascular walls. Leukocytes were observed within well-defined pathways in arteriolar walls and much less structured pathways in venular walls, apparently in the process of transmigration. Intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) were expressed at sites of leukocyte interaction with the luminal surface, especially in arterioles. Leukocytes appeared to exit from the vessels near collagen fibers into the perivascular interstitium. Results indicate that leukocytes can directly migrate across arteriolar and venular walls into the perivascular interstitium, which may represent an important but under-recognized pathway for leukocyte influx into the lung during injury and repair...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to characterize the role of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on pulmonary vascular remodeling and its functional consequences in chronic hypoxia. On the basis of data obtained by pharmacological inhibition of ACE in rats we hypothesized that, under chronic hypoxic conditions, tissue ACE-deficient mice show less remodeling of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> as compared with wild-type mice, but have equally increased right ventricular pressures. Wild-type and tissue ACE-deficient mice were exposed to chronic hypoxia for 4 wk. Absence of tissue ACE did not affect the increase in the mean right ventricular pressures (MRVP) and the extent of right ventricular hypertrophy under chronic hypoxic conditions. Chronic hypoxia induced significant remodeling of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> in tissue ACE-deficient mice. The percentage of completely muscularized arterioles was, however, lower in tissue ACE-deficient mice compared with wild-type animals (29 +/- 12 versus 41 +/- 18 %, p < 0. 05), whereas the percentage of partially muscularized arterioles had increased (48 +/- 11 versus 39 +/- 11 %, p < 0. 05). No sex-based effects were found. We conclude that the absence of tissue ACE does not prevent the MRVP and right ventricular weight from increasing during chronic hypoxia in the mouse. Also, pulmonary vascular remodeling occurs in hypoxic tissue ACE-deficient mice, albeit to a lower level than in mice that do have an intact ACE gen...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{responses}} {{to changes in}} trangmural pressure were investigated in pulmonary allo-graft and cheek pouch arterioles in two oxygen environments. Neonatal hamster lung tissue was transplanted into adult hamster cheek pouches. After vasculaxization (8 - 10 days), pulmonary and cheek pouch vessels were observed by intravital microscopy in hamsters anesthetized with pentobar-bital. By gassing the suffusion solution (bicarbonate-buffered Ringer's) (pH 7. 4 at 35 - 37 °C) with either low oxygen (95 % N,/ 6 % COi) or high oxygen (75 % Na/ 5 % CO 2 / 20 % Oj) and after sealing {{the top of the}} chamber, extravascular pressure was altered by varying the fluid volume of the closed chamber. Changes in arteriolar diameters in response to positive and negative square-wave pressure pulses were quantified using a video micrometer and close-circuit TV system. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> showed a passive dilation or constriction in response to increases or decreases in transmural pressure (± 20 mm Hg). These responses were not altered either by changes in Po? or nitroprusside. In contrast, cheek pouch arterioles showed myogenic responses by constricting 'when transmural pressure was increased and vice versa. These responses were potentiated at high Po? and abolished with nitroprusside. It is concluded that a myogenic response is dominant in cheek pouch arterioles but not in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterioles</b> under these conditions. These latter observations are consistent with results obtained fro...|$|R
