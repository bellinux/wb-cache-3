25|$|The average adult Minnesotan is married, {{although}} {{the numbers are}} shrinking. In 2007, 53.7% of Minnesotans {{over the age of}} 15 were married. People who were widowed made up 5.5% and people who were divorced made up 9.5%. People who were separated made up a mere 1.2% and people who were never married made up the remaining 30.1%. In the year 2005, 56.0% of people aged over 15 were married and people who were never married made up 28.6%.

25|$|The Kinsey reports {{rated the}} <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had sexual {{interaction}} with animals {{at some point}} in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms, but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing sampling bias. Martin Duberman has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when Paul Gebhard, Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{political}} scientist Sarah Birch, the Green Party draws support from [...] "a {{wide spectrum of}} the population".In 1995, sociologist Chris Rootes stated that the Green Party [...] "appeals disproportionately to younger, highly educated professional people" [...] although noted that this support base was [...] "not predominantly urban".In 2009, Birch noted that the Green's strongest areas of support were Labour-held seats in university towns or urban areas with relatively large student populations.

25|$|MDMA {{was first}} made in 1912. It {{was used to}} improve {{psychotherapy}} beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. It is often sold mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. In 2014, between 9 and 29 million people {{between the ages of}} 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.2% to 0.6% of the world population). This was broadly similar to the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> use cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids, but fewer than for cannabis. In the United States, about 0.9 million people used ecstasy in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The HPI (Human Poverty Index) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the percentage of people in a country who live in relative poverty. In order to better differentiate {{the number of people in}} abnormally poor living conditions the HPI-1 is used in developing countries, and the HPI-2 is used in developed countries. The HPI-1 is calculated based on the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight. The HPI-2 is calculated based on the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> do not survive to 60, the adult functional illiteracy rate and the percentage of people living below 50% of median personal disposable income.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the term}} for {{schizophrenia}} in Japan was changed from [...] to [...] to reduce stigma.

50|$|It {{was true}} that Iran had made {{progress}} with various social programs from the White Revolution, but it was equally true that Iran still {{had one of the}} worst infant mortality rates and doctor-patient ratios in the Middle East. It also had one <b>of</b> the lowest <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were receiving a higher education. For example, 68 percent of the adult population still remained illiterate, and 60 percent of children did not complete primary school. This resentment and anger towards the Shah’s failed reforms seems to unite the people against the Shah, and certainly did not increase any class loyalty towards the Shah, as he had intended.|$|R
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of sexual monogamy can be roughly estimated as the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> married <b>people</b> <b>who</b> do {{not engage in}} extramarital sex.

500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the first round}} in season two, each team {{had a chance to}} earn 25 additional points. Before the show, a question was asked to 100 YouVersion users (e.g. [...] "Would you rather fast for 40 days or eat manna for 40 years?"). A question with three possible choices was then asked about the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> answered (e.g. [...] "What percentage said they would rather fast for 40 days than eat manna for 40 years?"). During the break, each team wrote their answer on a tablet computer, and each team that submitted the correct answer earned 25 points. This round was removed from the game in the third season and replaced with another opening round-style game played for ± 100 points a question.|$|E
500|$|What {{is often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "clit piercing" [...] is actually the more common (and significantly less complicated) clitoral hood piercing. Since clitoral piercing is difficult and very painful, piercing of the clitoral hood is more common than piercing the clitoral shaft, owing to the small <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are anatomically suited for it. Clitoral hood piercings are usually channeled in the form of vertical piercings, and, to a lesser extent, horizontal piercings. The triangle piercing is a very deep horizontal hood piercing, and is done behind the clitoris as opposed to in front of it. For styles such as the Isabella, which pass through the clitoral shaft but are placed deep at the base, they provide unique stimulation and still require the proper genital build; the Isabella starts between the clitoral glans and the urethra, exiting at the top of the clitoral hood; this piercing is highly risky with regard to damage that may occur because of intersecting nerves.|$|E

2500|$|Americans seem {{to report}} more {{loneliness}} {{than any other}} country, though this finding may simply be an effect of greater research volume. A 2006 study in the American Sociological Review found that Americans on average had only two close friends in which to confide, which was down {{from an average of}} three in 1985. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> noted having no such confidant rose from 10% to almost 25%, and an additional 19% said they had only a single confidant, often their spouse, thus raising the risk of serious loneliness if the relationship ended. The modern office environment has been demonstrated to give rise to loneliness. [...] This can be especially prevalent in individuals prone to social isolation who can interpret the business focus of co-workers for a deliberate ignoring of needs.|$|E
2500|$|Wendy Leigh, {{who wrote}} an {{unofficial}} biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise {{from an early}} age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, [...] "I {{wanted to be part of}} the small <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." [...] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, [...] "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes." [...] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.|$|E
