5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It was felt he had been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> activities.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E

5|$|Erasmus Smith (1611– 1691) was an English {{merchant}} and a landowner with possessions in England and Ireland. Having acquired significant wealth through {{trade and}} land transactions, {{he became a}} philanthropist {{in the sphere of}} education, treading a path between idealism and self-interest during a period of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> turbulence. His true motivations remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2002 {{deterioration}} of his health, al-Jamri's {{position as a}} <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> leader of Bahrain's Shia opposition {{was taken over by}} his lifelong friend, Ayatollah Isa Qassim. Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions, but his views were kept private, in part as a sign of respect for al-Jamri. Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained empty, as the opposition became fragmented.|$|E
5|$|George's {{elder brother}} ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon {{the death of}} their father in 1936.

British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised Edward that for <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. Edward abdicated to marry Simpson, and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the House of Windsor.|$|E

5|$|He {{also took}} {{advantage}} of his travels to deliver fiery <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> sermons in which he encouraged villagers to organize resistance units to attack the British and Jews. He intensified his agitation and obtained a fatwa from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the Mufti of Damascus, which ruled that the struggle against the British and the Jews was permissible.|$|E
5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E
5|$|While the {{governmental}} {{system in the}} central and western part of Switzerland, as described above, is well documented, nothing of substance {{is known about the}} political and administrative system in eastern Raetia. However, records of the time show that a great number of local nobles held <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> offices in Raetia, indicating that the Romans successfully co-opted the local elite.|$|E

5|$|According to Chard, in the 48 {{years of}} his career, Johnson {{published}} around 2,700 imprints, averaging 56 per year. About half of these were pamphlets (e.g. sermons, religious tracts, political leaflets) and many were reprints; therefore he averaged around 20 to 30 new books per year. About 25% of his publications were of anonymous authors; these were usually political or religious works. He published more religious works than any other genre (1,067 titles). Johnson made roughly 750 copies for each print run, although many of his <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> works would have been printed in editions of 250, as their topics were often ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} four, Sarmiento {{was taught}} to read by {{his father and his}} uncle, José Eufrasio Quiroga Sarmiento, who later became Bishop of Cuyo. Another uncle who {{influenced}} him in his youth was Domingo de Oro, a notable figure in the young Argentine Republic who was influential in bringing Juan Manuel de Rosas to power. Though Sarmiento did not follow de Oro's <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> leanings, he learned the value of intellectual integrity and honesty. He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 {{the synagogue}} began {{granting}} women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of lifting and re-wrapping the Torah {{after it has}} been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation began calling women to the Torah and counting women in the minyan, the latter just two years after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 Hezbollah {{decided to}} {{participate}} in elections, and Ali Khamenei, supreme leader of Iran, endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, Subhi al-Tufayli, contested this decision, {{which led to a}} schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, <b>political,</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it does not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel.|$|E
5|$|Justinian also {{strengthened}} {{the borders of}} the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground cisterns (see Basilica Cistern). To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town Dara, an advanced arch dam was built. During his reign the large Sangarius Bridge was built in Bithynia, securing a major military supply route to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called Justiniana Prima, which was intended to replace Thessalonica as the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> centre of Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most important, the Analytical Review {{provided}} {{a forum for}} radical <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of the Analytical Review, was founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the Analytical and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{political}} division is unknown. It might have happened {{at the beginning of}} Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart <b>political</b> (<b>and</b> <b>religious)</b> propaganda. Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne and ruled only Upper Egypt, whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne and ruled Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{peaceful}} town of Duisburg, untroubled by <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> unrest, was {{the perfect}} place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly {{established himself as a}} man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} {{autonomy}} was not accomplished at this time, but the Seimas {{was an important}} development in the Lithuanian bid for independence. It consolidated efforts, spearheaded the organization of political parties, strengthened national conscience, and energized the rural populace. The assembly resolutely rejected ideas to restore the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{and for the first}} time voiced the demands for autonomy. Many of the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> rights that were granted by the October Manifesto were retained. A number of agricultural, educational, scientific, literary and artistic societies emerged.|$|E
