If people vote their financial self-interest, there is a <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> such {{that those who are}} younger favor smaller benefits and those who are older favor larger benefits. We estimate the expected present value of benefits and costs to US voters of each age and sex for a small permanent increase in social security benefits. We find that if voters vote their self-interest, a substantial majority will favor maintaining benefit levels at least at current levels. Over the next four decades, as the population ages, maintaining social security will become more expensive. Consequently, the <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> at which voters begin to favor social security will rise. At the same time, the median age of voters will also rise and remain above the <b>pivotal</b> <b>age.</b> Throughout the period, a majority of selfish voters would favor maintaining current benefit levels. We also investigate support for changes in the age at which benefits begin. Self-interest on this issue does not divide simply between old an...|$|E

In this paper we compare the medium- to long-term mental health effects of four groups of women in Britain in the 1990 s: teenage women who had first births, teenage nonmothers, and mothers of two older age groups. We study as well the effect of women's age at first birth on their psychological well-being and estimate the so-called <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> at first birth to determine at what age having a birth would change to from a bust to a boost to mental health. These aims are achieved by analyzing the first 10 waves the British Household Panel Survey (1991 - 2000). We find that teenage mothers tend to have a significantly higher level of depression in the medium term postpartum. More generally, within five years postpartum, no <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> at first birth is found, and estimated <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> at first birth begins to appear reasonable only from five to ten years postpartum. The results suggest that, while older mothers tend to have a smaller likelihood of depression than younger mothers, the effects are curvilinear, and that motherhood may not enhance a mother's well-being until the child is at least no longer a toddler. ...|$|E

Although it represents only 2 % of the total body weight, it accounts for 20 % of all oxygen consumption, reflecting its high rate of metabolic activity.

Consequently, their deterioration can have important detrimental consequences on the function and plasticity of neurons, and is thought to have a <b>pivotal</b> role in <b>ageing</b> and in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. Owing to their inherent physiological functions, mitochondria are subjected to particularly high levels of stress and have evolved specific molecular quality-control mechanisms to maintain the mitochondrial components.

40|$|Epigenetics is a quickly growing field {{encompassing}} mechanisms regulating {{gene expression}} {{that do not}} involve changes in the genotype. Epigenetics is of increasing relevance to neuroscience, with epigenetic mechanisms being implicated in brain development and neuronal differentiation, {{as well as in}} more dynamic processes related to cognition. Epigenetic regulation covers multiple levels of gene expression; from direct modifications of the DNA and histone tails, regulating the level of transcription, to interactions with messenger RNAs, regulating the level of translation. Importantly, epigenetic dysregulation currently garners much attention as a <b>pivotal</b> player in <b>aging</b> and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, where it may mediate interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors, or directly interact with disease-specific pathological factors. We review current knowledge about the major epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and DNA demethylation, chromatin remodeling and non-coding RNAs, as well as the involvement of these mechanisms in normal aging and in the pathophysiology of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we examine the current state of epigenetics-based therapeutic strategies for these diseases, which either aim to restore the epigenetic homeostasis or skew it to a favorable direction to counter disease pathology. Finally, methodological challenges of epigenetic investigations and future perspectives are discussed...|$|R

Thus the generation time = where R 0 is the net reproductive rate (= erT); r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase. As Birch (1948) points out, cannot be accurately calculated without an accurate value for r. However, this author offers an approximate method, assuming that all the breeding for one generation takes place at one moment of time, with successive generations consequently spaced at equal time intervals of units, as was first proposed by Dublin & Lotka (1925). Using this assumption, his expression is: rx-mx. m. where is the <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> of any age group in the female life-table; l'x is the probable number of wildebeeste alive at <b>pivotal</b> <b>age,</b> x, divided by 1000 (cohort of 1000); mx is {{the mean number of}} female offspring produced over the span of the age-group, namely, the age-specific fecundity. In my earlier paper(Watson, 1969), a generation time of 1 year was incorrectly deduced, this being the interval between successive reproductive periods and not the mean interval between reproduction in successive generations (i. e. the mean genera¬ tion time). The data of Watson (1969) allow computation of a generation time of 6 - 356 years. An alternative, more accurate calculation of is possible from the earlier quoted expression loge R-O R 0, the net reproductive rate, is derived from the summation of l'xmx terms in m 557 558 R. M.

40|$|The net {{present value}} of costs and {{benefits}} from a pay-as-you-go social security system are negative for young people and positive for the elderly. If people all vote their financial self-interest, {{there will be a}} <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> such that those who are younger favor smaller social security benefits and those who are older will favor larger benefits. For persons of each age and sex, we estimate the expected present value gained or lost from a small permanent increase in the amount of benefits, where the cost of these benefits is divided equally among the population of working age. Assuming that everyone votes his or her long run financial self-interest, and calculating the number of voters in the population of each age and sex, we can determine whether there is majority support for an increase or a decrease in social security benefits. We use statistics on the age distribution and mortality rates for the United States to explore the sensitivity of political support for social security to alternative assumptions about the discount rate, excess burden in taxation, voter participation rates, and birth, death, and migration rates. We find that a once-and-for-all decrease in benefits would be defeated by a majority of selfish voters under a wide range of parameters. We also study the predicted majority outcomes of votes on changing the retirement age. ...|$|E
40|$|Staging {{theories}} {{have been used}} to explain children’s understanding of various concepts including those relating to health. Yet the extent to which children understand the concept of stress and are able to make associations between stress and physical illness has rarely been explored. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate young children’s understanding of the stress-health relationship and to identify from what age this understanding is evident. Methods: An experimental measure of implicit understanding, adapted for use with children, was applied to the concepts of stress and illness. Thirty-two children aged 5 - 11 years completed the child Implicit Association Test (PSIAT), a computer-based measure of reaction time (RT) to associated (stress and illness) and unassociated (stress and health) concept pairings. This was analysed using MANOVA. Findings: Significantly faster correct responses to consistent concept pairings than to inconsistent concept pairings were observed as age increased, F(3, 28) = 3. 27, p<. 01. Within age groups, a significant RT difference was detected between consistent and inconsistent pairings from age 7. 5 years, indicating this as a <b>pivotal</b> <b>age</b> for the ability to associate stress and illness. Differences were noted in the younger age groups but significant effects were not observed. Discussion: Whilst associations between stress and illness increased with age, findings support the notion that children as young as 7. 5 years were able to make a link between the concept of stress and feeling unwell. These theoretical constructs are important in developing appropriate interventions to promote health by supporting children in learning to identify and cope with stress...|$|E
40|$|The endosomal/lysosomal {{system is}} {{essential}} for cell survival. The regulation of lysosomal pH is critical for lysosomal function and {{has been known to}} play a <b>pivotal</b> role in <b>aging</b> and disease. The pH within the lysosomes is essentially increased in certain diseases and our preliminary data suggests that it may also increase with age. It is known that the methods used for lysosomal pH measurement are extremely difficult and technique sensitive. In this study, we searched for key genetic markers to help identify the presence of chronic elevation of lysosomal pH. This will allow us to utilize the speed, specificity and sensitivity of laboratory confirmation with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as an alternative method to direct measurement of lysosomal pH. In our study, we demonstrated a trend towards an increased expression of TcfEB and vATPase genes in the presence of long-term lysosomal pH elevation. Therefore, these two genes could potentially be used as markers to recognize the presence of chronic lysosomal pH elevation in diseased cells. In contrast, a short-term lysosomal pH elevation showed a decreased expression of IL- 1 b, IL- 18 and TcfEB highlighting the time-dependent nature of genetic expression. Both genes, TcfEB and vATPase, might be used as important tools for the rapid detection of disease or infection in clinical specimens and are also particularly suitable in optimizing the therapeutic management of diseased cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn elderly {{patients}} with HER 2 -positive breast cancer, few data on efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment exists since older patients were in general excluded from large randomized studies. This prospective observational study aimed {{to confirm the}} beneficial findings from <b>pivotal</b> trials in <b>age</b> cohorts ≥ 65 years. Materials and MethodsThere were no restrictions for recruitment with respect to age or concomitant/sequential adjuvant medication. Long-term relapse/survival status of the patients was assessed once a year. ResultsAmong the 3940 evaluable patients enrolled between 2006 and 2012 at 339 institutions, 507 were aged between 65 and 69 years, with another 507 patients ≥ 70 years. Elderly patients suffered from significantly more advanced primary tumors. Preceding or concomitant chemotherapy showed decreasing aggressiveness with patient's age. Trastuzumab treatment was stopped prematurely in only 11 % of the elderly, {{but more often than}} in younger patients (p= 0. 0008). With 453 events hitherto reported, {{elderly patients}} did not exhibit an inferior relapse-free survival when adjusted for other relevant prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1. 01 per year; p= 0. 24). Three-year overall survival was significantly lower in the population older than 64 years than in younger patients (94. 2 % vs. 96. 8 %, p= 0. 0011). ConclusionsTo our knowledge, our population of elderly patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab is the largest analyzed so far. The beneficial long-term results were comparable to those in the younger cohorts. Although the risk of cardiotoxicity increased significantly with age, it also remained manageable in older patients. Thus, chronological age alone should not preclude HER 2 antibody treatment...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{is intimately}} related {{to health and}} disease. The {{incidence}} of major fatal pathological conditions, including cancer, is strongly associated with aging. The finding that aging is malleable by genetic or pharmacological perturbations has offered enormous hope for transforming our understanding and treatment of aging and age-related diseases. Yet few valid longevity drugs have been developed or translated for treating age-related diseases as target identification and a mechanistic understanding of their activity is largely missing. Metabolism plays a <b>pivotal</b> role in <b>aging.</b> Metabolic interventions, such as dietary restriction, significantly modulate aging and aging-related symptoms. Recently, emerging evidences has shown that metabolites can directly modulate aging as well. Studies of these endogenous “elixirs” provide insights on the biological regulatory networks acted upon by the metabolites as well as potential therapeutic interventions for aging and aging-related symptoms. Our lab aims to discover novel longevity metabolites and explore their applications in aging-related symptoms. Here we present several novel longevity metabolites, which are α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), 2 -hydroxyglutarate (2 -HG), and α-ketobutyrate (α-KB). By combining target identification, epistasis, metabolomics, and bioenergetics analyses, we successfully uncover the molecular mechanisms of the longevity effects of these compounds. Specifically, we, for the first time, showed that α-KG and 2 -HG extend lifespan of C. elegans by inhibiting ATP synthase and TOR, while α-KB delays aging through interruption of pyruvate oxidation and activation of AMPK. Interestingly, we discover an unexpected growth inhibitory effects of α-KG and 2 -HG on tumor cells through targeting ATP synthase, and find that α-KG may confer beneficial effects for tumor treatment. In brief, our results identify novel potent longevity compounds and reveal their underlying mechanisms. More importantly, our work suggests a potential translational application of longevity metabolites in aging-related symptoms and provides novel directions for metabolic therapy...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is {{a phenomenon}} characterised by stable and durable states of proliferative arrest induced by various stress stimuli. The abundance of senescent cells in tissues increases over a lifetime and, among other functions, they have been proposed to play a <b>pivotal</b> role in <b>ageing.</b> Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a disease characterised by segmental premature ageing. It {{is caused by the}} expression of a persistently farnesylated lamin A isoform. Strikingly, HGPS patients show an increased abundance of senescent cells. Therefore the relationship between the farnesylated lamin A precursor, prelamin A, and senescence was studied in this thesis. Cellular models of ageing in human dermal fibroblasts were established. They relied on either replicative exhaustion or prelamin A accumulation. An unbiased genome-wide transcript analysis of the ageing models revealed that {{a significant part of the}} common senescence programme during cellular ageing can be replicated in young cells by accumulating prelamin A. The most prominent and overlapping expression changes were observed in pathways regulating inflammation, lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. Six genes, identified as underexpressed consistently across the studied ageing models, were tested functionally in the context of senescence regulation by prelamin A. The ability of prelamin A-accumulating cells to induce inflammation has also been demonstrated by multiplexed detection of secreted cytokines, chemokines and other factors. This confirms that a significant overlap between replicative and prelamin A-induced senescence exists not only at mRNA level changes, but is also observed at the level of secreted proteins. Finally, nuclear morphology was studied in the ageing models, with a particular interest in the formation of a nucleoplasmic reticulum. We identified NOGO/Reticulon- 4 as a new protein involved in the process of NR formation, and also demonstrated that new NR channels require incorporation of newly synthesised lipid and protein components. The research presented in this thesis offers a new insight into a role of the prelamin A maturation process in senescence and ageing. </p...|$|R
40|$|From {{its first}} ignorant {{description}} as a plain dark spot two centuries ago, the cell nucleus {{has emerged as}} the central hub which stores and processes information to coordinate the cell's activities. Ensuring proper functionality, the nucleus is meticulously organized with chromatin as well as proteins occupying distinct but interacting subcompartments. Though organized, the nuclear interior is far from static; all nuclear components demonstrate distinct kinetic behaviour and different levels of mobility, which are crucial for the regulation and coordination of nuclear processes and guarantee flexibility in varying environmental conditions. Disturbance of the spatiotemporal organisation of the nucleus is correlated with aging and disease. This is exemplified by a variety of interrelated nuclear components (Ch. 1). Telomeres, the end structures of mammalian chromosomes, are known to gradually erode with (cellular and organism) age. Proper telomere maintenance is crucial for successful aging as accelerated shortening is observed in premature aging diseases and tumour cells display telomere stabilization or even telomere lengthening. Impaired telomere function leads to nuclear reorganisation, characterized by telomere fusions and consequent genome instability. Defects in architectural components such as the lamina, which delineates the nuclear boundary, elicit a spectrum of diseases, referred to as laminopathies, characterized by dramatic nuclear deformations and reorganisations. Some laminopathies, such as Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome, lead to premature aging as well and demonstrate accelerated telomere shortening and increased DNA damage. Accumulation of irreparable DNA damage is in turn suspected to contribute to the aging phenotype but also to instigate genome instability. Given the dual role of many of these nuclear processes, it appears that the cell walks a thin line between death and immortality. Understanding this complexity requires sensitive tools that allow for studying nuclear organisation within a natural context. Microscopy has the adequate spatiotemporal resolution to visualize intracellular behaviour. However, current microscopic methods are limited in their possibility of extracting quantitative information and microscopic images are often manually evaluated, which is inevitably prone to variability and subjectivity. The aim of this work was to establish robust methods for objective and quantitative analysis of nuclear organisation and dynamics within the single cell. The act of measuring cellular properties is also referred to as cytometry. In order to provide insights in the nuclear microenvironment we have addressed single- cell analysis from two converging perspectives – in a top-down fashion by means of high content cytometry and bottom-up by 4 -dimensional live cell imaging methods. To quantify subcellular characteristics in a population of cells with regard for the stochasticity of events in a natural context, we devised a general approach for multivariate phenotypic profiling of individual cell nuclei and quantification of subnuclear foci using automated fluorescence mosaic microscopy, optimized digital image processing tools and supervised classification feedback (Ch. 2). The HCS approach has a broad application radius and was used inter alia to asses DNA damage in the framework of a space experiment (Ch. 3) as well as to model nuclear shape in cells from patients suffering from laminopathies (Ch. 6). Given the importance of the temporal aspect in nuclear organisation we diverted to live-cell imaging. We focused on telomeres because of their <b>pivotal</b> role in <b>aging</b> and genome stability. To visualize telomeres in living cells we created cell lines stably producing fluorescent telomere-binding fusion proteins. In order to obtain a quantitative signature of the spatiotemporal organisation within the nuclear volume we elaborated an image analysis toolbox that allows for documenting 3 - dimensional telomere characteristics and accurately tracking telomeric spots through time (Ch. 4). As we progressed we bumped into another limitation of current imaging systems, which is the limited possibility of observing cells for a long time. This is due to the difficulty of keeping cells alive on the microscope stage and the loss of fluorescent signal or bleaching; both caused by excessive exposure to light. Therefore, novel technology of Controlled Light Exposure Microscopy (CLEM) was applied, which enabled highly resolved long term imaging and reduced photobleaching to a negligable phenomenon. Using this setup, we found that telomeres share small territories at specific positions in the nucleus where they dynamically interact. Most telomeres showed limited motion, but some appeared to move transiently in a directed and energy-dependent manner (Ch. 5). Telomere mobility as well as global nuclear dynamcis were found altered in cells bearing lamin mutations. Absence of functional Lamin A/C, resulted in complete spatiotemporal mayhem in the nucleus and revealed a remarkable transient permeability, indicative of a reduced barrier function of the nuclear envelope. We thereby exposed a novel trait that might underlie the disease mechanism in laminopathies (Ch. 6). In conclusion, studying the cell’s constituents in their natural environment by quantitative means will not only generate fundamental knowledge about their function in the cell, but will also provide insights in the molecular defects underlying disease, which in turn is essential for the development of new diagnostic tools or drugs...|$|R
