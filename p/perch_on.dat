5|$|Bushshrikes {{are similar}} in habits to shrikes, hunting insects and other small prey from a <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> a bush. Although similar in build to the shrikes, these tend to be either {{colourful}} species or largely black; some species are quite secretive.|$|E
5|$|The Singapura is {{described}} by the CFA as active, curious and playful. They are affectionate and desire human interaction. They {{have a tendency to}} <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> high places, to allow them a better view of their surrounding.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> top of the fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E

5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The red-billed chough's food {{consists}} {{largely of}} insects, spiders and other invertebrates {{taken from the}} ground, with ants probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies P. p. centralis will <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> the backs of wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make {{up most of the}} chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. In the Himalayas, they form large flocks in winter.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> plants and eat from there.|$|E

5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E
5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with glides. Wintering birds regularly <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a contraindication, {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they might be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The Australian raven can {{be found}} in a wide range of natural and {{modified}} habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or <b>perch</b> <b>on.</b> Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
