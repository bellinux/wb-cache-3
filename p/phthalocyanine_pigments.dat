40|$|A polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) {{that was not}} produced {{as part of the}} Aroclor mixtures banned in the 1980 s was recently reported in air samples collected in Chicago, Philadelphia, the Arctic, and several sites around the Great Lakes. In Chicago, the congener 3, 3 ′-dichlorobiphenyl or PCB 11 was found to be the fifth most concentrated congener and ubiquitous throughout the city. The congener exhibited strong seasonal concentration trends that suggest volatilization of this compound from common outdoor surfaces. Due to these findings and also the compound’s presence in waters that received waste from paint manufacturing facilities, we hypothesized that PCB 11 may be present in current commercial paint. In this study we measured PCBs in paint sold on the current retail market. We tested 33 commercial paint pigments purchased from three local paint stores. The pigment samples were analyzed for all 209 PCB congeners using gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). More than 50 PCB congeners including several dioxin-like PCBs were detected, and the PCB profiles varied due to different types of pigments and different manufacturing processes. PCB congeners were detected in azo and <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>pigments</b> which are commonly used in paint but also in inks, textiles, paper, cosmetics, leather, plastics, food and other materials.

In this work we focus on the determination of PCB- 11 in lake water and superficial snow samples collected in Northern Victoria Land during the 27 th Italian Antarctic Expedition (austral summer 2011 – 2012). Six summer ice-free lakes near Terra Nova Bay (Carezza, Edmonson Point 15 A, Edmonson Point 14, Tarn Flat 20, Inexpressible island 10 B, Gondwana) were investigated, together with five snow-covered sites (David Glacier, Vegetation Island, Mid Point, ITASE GV 5, Campo Faraglione) ranging from coastal areas to East Antarctic plateau. Samples were collected in pre-cleaned airtight stainless steel containers, allowed to melt and continuous liquid-liquid extracted at the Mario Zucchelli Station in Antarctica. Afterwards extracts were purified onto a disposable neutral silica column with an automated system (PowerPrepTM, FMS) and analysed by HRGC-HRMS (HP 6890 - MAT 95 XP Thermo Finnigan). Quantification was performed using internal standards and isotope dilution technique. Results were corrected using procedural blanks. PCB- 11 was detected in all the samples, with comparable levels in each lake (few pgL- 1); slightly higher values were found in snow samples, maybe because of the larger surface area.

With large surface area and high activity energy, the ultra-microscopy in particle is filled by dispersion into the matrix structure for a thinner and super performance of opto-electronic and information like color filter, flat plate display, high density and thermal reversible digital versatile disc, ultra-thinning insulation of electrical magnetic interruption, and so on. This research develops a method to disperse nano-organic pigments using the supercritical fluid. Taking a supercritical fluid with low surface tension and high diffusion coefficient as solvent, the nano-scale powder may be wetted and swelled effectively to form the primary particles in the dispersing solution. For the <b>phthalocyanine</b> green <b>pigment,</b> the particle size of 93. 5 nm in the dispersing solution without the dispersant have been obtained by using supercritical carbon dioxide in this study. Additionally, through Taguchi method, in this dissertation the particle dimensions of aminoanthraquinone red, phthalocynaine green, and phthalocynaine blue organic components in the dispersing solution with the dispersant are respectively shown as follows: (1) 178. 5 nm at a stability of 4 hours, (2) 121. 9 nm at a stability of 6 hours, and (3) 187. 4 nm at a stability of 3 hours under the optimum conditions of dispersion on the operations of supercritical carbon dioxide. 隨著科學技術的進步，工業材料傾向精細、高性能、高可靠度，尤其電子材料的要求特別嚴格。因此，粉末成形、燒結製成的陶瓷與金屬、粉末粒子分散系-顏料或塗料等工業，需將原料粉末粒子更須細微化以滿足未來新穎電子資訊產品之需求。將粒子分散至 100 nm以下稱為超微粒子，也稱為奈米材料。由於粒徑極小而具有廣大之表面積與極高之表面活化能，故若能將奈米級粒子均勻分散於基材中，則可製作出薄層化且高性能之資訊電子材料，如高精細的平面顯示器用彩色濾光片、超薄電磁波遮敝層、高密度熱可逆性光學記錄元件等。 本研究利用同時具有低表面張力和高擴散係數之超臨界流體做為溶劑，促使凝聚之奈米級粒子充分分散，期變成一次粒徑的分散液。經由田口實驗，目前完成超臨界CO 2 對紅、綠、藍三色有機顏料分散之最適化，其結果如下： (a) 紅色有機顏料分散之最小平均粒徑為 178. 5 nm，其安定性可達 4 小時之久； (b) 綠色花菁有機顏料分散之最小平均粒徑為 121. 9 nm，其安定性可達 6 小時之久；及 (c) 藍色花菁有機顏料分散之最小平均粒徑為 187. 4 nm，其安定性可達 3 小時之久。 此外，綠色花菁有機顏料無加入分散劑，使用超臨界流體分散可達到 93. 5 nm的超微粒子。中文摘要 [...] - 英文摘要 [...] - 目錄 [...] - 表目錄 [...] 圖目錄 [...] 第一章 緒論 [...] - 1 - 1 前言 [...] - 1 - 2 研究動機與目的 [...] 1 - 3 研究方法 [...] - 1 - 4 本論文架構 [...] 第二章 理論與基礎 [...] 2 - 1 有機顏料的特性 [...] 2 - 2 超臨界流體 [...] 2 - 3 傳統分散方法 [...] - 2 - 4 分散穩定性與效果評估方法 [...] - 2 - 5 田口品質工程 [...] - 第三章 超微粒有機顏料分散之研究 [...] - 3 - 0 本章摘要 [...] - 3 - 1 實驗材料 [...] - 3 - 2 實驗儀器與設備 [...] 3 - 3 實驗裝置 [...] - 3 - 4 實驗方法 [...] - 3 - 5 結果與討論 [...] 3 - 6 本章結論 [...] - 第四章 綜合結論與未來延續工作 [...] 第五章 參考文獻 [...] - 附錄一 光散射粒徑分析之圖表 [...] -...|$|R
40|$|Purging {{compounds}} {{allow for}} rapid colour and material changes in plastics converting machines. They have both a cleaning and a purging action. The cleaning action {{refers to the}} removal of contaminants, e. g. carbon deposits, from the die, barrel and extruder-screw surfaces. This mechanism relies on conventional detergency in combination with high wall shear stresses. The purging action refers to the observed narrowing in the residence time distribution and is less well understood. The action of a purge compound may encompass both the cleaning and purging mechanisms {{in order to achieve}} the desired effect. In industry the effectiveness of a purge is determined by a visual observation of the extrudate. Therefore, a scientific method was required to quantitatively determine the efficiency of each purging mechanism under a set of fixed experimental conditions. In this study, a method was developed using a laboratory film-blower, which made use of a <b>phthalocyanine</b> blue <b>pigment</b> to impart colour to the film produced. The method was used to test the efficiency of various commercial purge compounds in switching the colour of film from blue to clear. The analysis was achieved by measuring the residual pigment concentration in the blue polymer film using a UV -Visible spectrophotometer. Commercial purge compounds function by means of various mechanisms such as filler abrasion, solvent dissolution, the dislodging of deposits with the aid of surfactants, etc. This study also considered the use of slip additives as an additional purging mechanism. In proposing that slip additives can contribute to a purging action, several slip additives where tested in polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The slip additives polypropylene wax and polyamide showed {{a significant increase in the}} MFI of PE whereas the additives polar wax and polyamide exhibited a slight increase in MFI of PP. Three additives, namely, polyamide, polypropylene wax and polar wax had showed noticeable improvement on the MFI of ABS. The slip additives that showed a significant improvement in polyethylene were tested together with six different commercial purge compounds. These compounds were tested for their colour change efficiency using polyethylene and switching from blue to clear in a laboratory film blower. It was found that the slip mechanism contributes very little to the purging action. Polymeric materials tend to adhere to hot metal surfaces. When the material continues to adhere to the metal after cooling down, cleaning of the processing equipment becomes very difficult. A purge manufactured by the CSIR, Pretoria, exhibited this problem. This study also covers an investigation into overcoming the adhesion problem of this purging compound. Dissertation (MSc (Chemistry)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|The Sam Francis’s colors, {{literally}} {{described as}} vivid, saturated, pure, vibrant intense and rich, largely {{contribute to the}} unique character of his work. This idiosyncrasy explains the interest in conducting an extended study on the Francis’ painting materials through analytical techniques. On the other hand, many Francis’ paintings display colored surfaces that exhibit bronzing, fluorescent or opalescent effects. As a consequence, retouching paint losses from Sam Francis works may become a challenging task for the involved conservators, the degree of the color matching required in the imitative technique being particularly difficult to attain, {{in the presence of}} such surfaces. Furthermore, the attained degree of the color match has to be conserved in all conditions of illumination and observation. The use of pigments chemically similar to the original ones is often necessary for matching highly chromatic pigments. Though, many modern synthetic organic pigments (SOPs) possess high color strength. That is why the characterization of the Francis palette would provide helpful information to the conservators, which have to deal with this type of issue. The upcoming Getty publication Sam Francis: The Artist’s Materials, planned for 2016, offered the opportunity for in-depth analyses of hundreds paint samples. Almost three hundreds of paint fragments supplied by the Sam Francis Foundation have been investigated at the GCI laboratory, by using three complementary analytical techniques, Py-GC-MS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. The Raman spectroscopy {{is one of the most}} efficient techniques for identifying SOPs in paint systems, while the Py-GC-MS and FTIR methods provide essential information concerning the binding media. The analyzed paint fragments were sampled from twenty-nine canvases and works on paper, made between 1946 and 1992. Although, primary established in Southern California, Sam Francis spent numerous long journeys in different places around the world, including Paris, Bern, Mexico City, New York and Tokyo. However, the material study has outlined the uninterrupted use of` certain classes of SOPs in specific colors. For example, copper <b>phthalocyanine</b> (CuPc) <b>pigments</b> were systematically detected in the blue and green samples, while azo pigments have been identified in most of the yellow areas sampled from post 1940 s works. Regardless of the support and the paint technique, the Francis’ blues primary contain Ultramarine and/or CuPc blue pigments. And, it has been shown that the bronzing blue surfaces noticed for some of the investigated artworks correspond to PB 15 -based paint films. The present study has also underlined the recurrent use of perinone orange and dioxazine violet in fluorescent orange and purple area. Despite the early introduction of SOPs, on the Francis’ palette, the works dating from the 1940 ’s remained mainly composed of traditional inorganic pigments, for instance lead white and red, chrome yellow, viridian and iron oxides. Interestingly, various binding media, i. e. Shellac gum, modified and unmodified oils, PVA, alkyd resins and acrylic copolymers have been identified. Actually, the investigated samples have pointed out the frequent combination of more than three types of binders on a same painting. Through the identification of the various SOPs used by Francis over fifty years, this research provide helpful information for selecting the most appropriate retouching pigments. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Stability is {{important}} for producing stable inks and other dispersions, and for developing simpler, less costly, and environmentally safer inks. Understanding and controlling the stability is also important in deinking and paper recycling. This thesis deals with (a) experimental investigation of dispersion stability and (b) modeling of aggregation process with Brownian dynamics simulations for understanding energetic and hydrodynamic interactions. ^ Aqueous copper <b>phthalocyanine</b> (CuPc) cyan <b>pigment</b> dispersions are commonly used in inkjet printing, and in paint and varnish industries. For many of these applications, {{it is essential to}} induce hydrophilicity and dispersibility leading to good dispersion stability. Two types of CuPc particles were examined: (i) CuPc-U particles, which are unsulfonated and initially hydrophobic; and (ii) CuPc-S particles, which have chemically attached sulfonate groups on the surface. CuPc nanoparticles can be stabilized mainly by electrostatic and steric mechanisms. The Fuchs-Smoluchowski dispersion stability ratio W, as determined from DLS data and the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (RDG) scattering theory, is used as a quantitative measure of stability. ^ Electrostatic stabilization was investigated using a model system of CuPc-S particles in aqueous NaNO 3 solutions. The particles effective non-retarded Hamaker constant, was determined from the London dispersion coefficient, which was computed with a time-dependent density functional theory method. The estimated Hamaker constant allowed the predictions of W-values from the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which ignores short range forces in solution and hydrodynamic interactions. Large discrepancies were found between the experimental and the predicted W-values, indicating that either significant particle shape effects are important, or that there are additional short-range repulsive forces, not predicted by the macroscopic DLVO theory. Nonetheless, electrostatic repulsive forces play a substantial role in the dispersion stability, as revealed qualitatively by the effect of the ionic strength. ^ Steric stabilization is usually achieved by adsorption of surfactants or polymers. The effect of a nonionic surfactant Triton X- 100 on the dispersion stability of CuPc-U and CuPc-S in water and in NaNO 3 solution was studied. The adsorption isotherms showed that the adsorption density for both types of particles increased with increasing concentration of surfactant and then reached a plateau above the cmc. The results also imply that micelles do not adsorb. Desorption tests showed that some surfactant molecules adsorbed irreversibly, suggesting the presence of some strong and some weak adsorption sites. The maximum molar adsorption density was higher for the CuPc-U than that for the CuPc-S. The values of minimum areas per molecule indicated coil or 2 ̆ 2 mushroom 2 ̆ 2 conformations of the ethylene oxide chains. At a quite high surface coverage, CuPc-U particles became quite stable, because of a steric mechanism. Adsorption of Triton X- 100 on CuPc-S particles in NaNO 3 solutions, affected the stability, suggesting that there is a minor steric effect in addition to electrostatic stabilization. The effect of a commercial nonionic surfactant Myrj 45 on stabilizing CuPc-U particles was also studied. A mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that Myrj 45 contains at least 78 components of 6 classes. The adsorption of each component class on CuPc-U particles was determined using an HPLC-MS method. The overall adsorption density of Myrj 45 was much lower than that of Triton X- 100. Accordingly the W-values with Myrj 45 were about one order of magnitude smaller. For both systems, the zeta potentials were substantial while the resulting total particle charges were quite low. Hence, electrostatic interactions are unlikely to contribute to the dispersion stabilization mechanism, which appears to be primarily steric. ^ Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations were performed to provide a better understanding of particle aggregation process and information not easily obtained from experiments. Using this computational method, the effects of ionic strength, particle volume fraction, and initial particle size polydispersity were studied. In addition, the average aggregation number and distribution of particle aggregates were examined. A more accurate description of stability could be obtained by BD simulations when the actual interaction potential energies of particles are known or can be estimated. ...|$|R
