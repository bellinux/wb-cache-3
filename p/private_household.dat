While large farms concentrate mainly on grain production and husbandry products, small <b>private</b> <b>household</b> plots produce most of the country's potatoes, vegetables and fruits.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, the {{government}} tried to reshape <b>private</b> <b>household</b> consumption under the Four-Year Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. The organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives.|$|E

2500|$|The Quran {{accepts the}} {{distinction}} between slave and free {{as part of the}} natural order and uses this distinction as an example of God's grace, regarding this discrimination between human beings as in accordance with the divinely established order of things. [...] "The Qur'an, however, does not consider slaves to be mere chattel; their humanity is directly addressed in references to their beliefs, their desire for manumission and their feelings about being forced into prostitution. In one case, the Qur'an refers to master and slave with the same word, rajul. Later interpreters presume slaves to be spiritual equals of free Muslims. For example, verse 4:25 urges believers to marry 'believing maids that your right hands own' and then states: [...] "The one of you is as the other," [...] which the Jalaalayn interpret as [...] "You and they are equal in faith, so do not refrain from marrying them." [...] The human aspect of slaves is further reinforced by reference to them as members of the <b>private</b> <b>household,</b> sometimes along with wives or children. Pious exhortations from jurists to free men to address their slaves by such euphemistic terms as [...] "my boy" [...] and [...] "my girl" [...] stemmed from the belief that God, not their masters, was responsible for the slave's status.|$|E

Furthermore specific data sets will be developed to establish consistent parameters of reaction for the most important factors.

On the subjects of temperance, public morals, and education, I have no doubt that the introduction of the female vote into legislation, in States, counties, and cities, would produce results very different from that of men alone. There are thousands of women who would close grog-shops, and stop the traffic in spirits, if they had the legislative power; and it would be well for society if they had. In fact, I think that a State can no more afford to dispense with the vote of women in its affairs than a family. Imagine a family where the female has no voice in the housekeeping! A State is but a larger family, and there are many of its concerns which, equally with those of a <b>private</b> <b>household,</b> would be bettered by female supervision." ...|$|E

[...] He had also expected a very stiff and capable service by implacable parlourmaids, and the whole thing indeed highly genteel. But two cheerful women servants appeared from what was presumably the kitchen direction, wheeling a curious wicker erection, which his small guide informed him was called Aunt Clatter--manifestly deservedly--and which bore on its shelves the substance of the meal. And while the maids at this migratory sideboard carved and opened bottles and so forth, the small boy and a slightly larger brother, assisted a little by two young men of no very defined position and relationship, served the company. Mrs. Britling sat {{at the head of the}} table, and conversed with Mr. Direck by means of hostess questions and imperfectly accepted answers while she kept a watchful eye on the proceedings.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we examine changes in the {{proportion}} of older widowed and divorced women in England and Wales moving from “independent” to two kinds of “supported” household–supported <b>private</b> <b>households</b> and institutions–during the decades 1971 – 81 and 1981 – 91. Our main aim was to see whether observed increases in institutionalisation over this period were the result of a decreased propensity to move to the households of relatives. We used the ONS Longitudinal Study, a record linkage study including individual level data from the 1971, 1981 and 1991 censuses of England and Wales. A multinomial logit model was used to investigate the correlates of transitions from independent to supported <b>private</b> <b>households</b> versus institutions among elderly widowed and divorced women. While the overall rate of transitions to join either supported <b>private</b> <b>households</b> or institutions was largely the same in the two decades, the balance between the two shifted markedly in favour of transitions to institutions. In terms of the limited range of covariates it was possible to consider, owner-occupiers were significantly more likely than tenants to move to supported <b>private</b> <b>households</b> than to institutions...|$|R
