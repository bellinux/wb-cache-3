50|$|Having {{returned}} from the tunnels, Nick's group splits up to remove evidence of the fights at Nick's loft and Rosalee's shop. At the shop, one of the corpses grips Eve's arm, and she enters a trancelike state. Rosalee identifies this as the Death Grip, and on consulting a book hacks off the attacker's hand as a remedy. Eve then returns to consciousness. Rosalee mentions that the Death Grip can return a dead wesen to life if they offer up a <b>pure</b> soul as <b>barter.</b> The group wonders how Eve's soul can be pure. At the loft, Adalind calls Nick, asking him to see her and Kelly and he agrees.|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{at a new}} {{approach}} for a known fundamental result: barter or trade increases economic value. It successfully bridges {{the gap between the}} theory of value and the exchange process attached to the transition from endowments to the equilibrium in the core and contract curve. First, we summarise the theory of value; in Section 2, we present the Edgeworth (1881) box and an axiomatic approach and in Section 3, we apply our pure exchange model. Finally (in Section 4), using our open econo-physics <b>pure</b> <b>barter</b> (EPB) model, we derive an improvement in value, which means that <b>pure</b> <b>barter</b> leads to a decline in depreciation rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} {{function of}} money is {{its role as a}} medium of exchange. The authors formalize this idea using a search-theoretic equilibrium model of the exchange process that captures the "double coincidence of wants problem" with <b>pure</b> <b>barter.</b> One advantage of the framework described here is that it is very tractable. The authors also show that the model can be used to addre ss some substantive issues in monetary economics, including the potenti al welfare-enhancing role of money, the interaction between specializat ion and monetary exchange, and the possibility of equilibria with multip le fiat currencies.

40|$|Given {{the rapidly}} growing {{reserves}} in Asia (China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) and the pressures from trading partners to revalue, {{there is a need}} to examine commercial policy in more than a <b>pure</b> <b>barter</b> model. Here we evaluate the joint impacts of exchange rate appreciation on trade flows and country surpluses using a general equilibrium trade model with a simple monetary structure in which the trade surplus is endogenously determined in the exchange rate setting country and the exchange rate is exogenous. We illustrate its application to the Chinese case using calibration to 2005 data. Our results, while elasticity dependent, suggest that the impacts of Renminbi (RMB) revaluation on the surplus are proportionally larger than on trade flows, and that changes in trade flows can be substantial. Different treatments of China's processing trade have small impact on changes in China's trade flow under RMB appreciation, but significant impacts on the change in the surplus. Results are elasticity dependent; larger substitution elasticities in preferences yield larger effects on trade flows and the surplus.

40|$|AbstractFollowing Smale's notations let n and l denote {{respectively}} {{the number of}} agents and commodities in <b>pure</b> exchange <b>barter</b> economy (with no production and no prices). Let u 1, u 2, â€¦ un denote n real valued functions describing the individuals preferences. Assume that the mechanism which describes the adjustment in the quantities traded by the agents {{at any point in}} time is given by the Edgeworth process. This dynamic is assumed to take the form of an autonomous ordinary differential equation. The aim of this paper is first to develop necessary conditions for a pure exchange rate mechanism to converge to the set of Pareto points. The proof of this result uses ideas of LaSalle's Theorem. Second, we examine the conditions under which positive results may be obtained as solutions of the Edgeworth mechanism approach the boundary of the sub-manifold of feasible allocations W. Third, we examine the local stability and instability of Pareto points. The instability result is a version of Cetaev's Theorem. These resultsare proved by means of Liapunov Theory which does not require the utility functions to be C 2. An example is given which shows that stability does not necessarily imply Pareto-optimality...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 New {{types of}} {{exchange}} arrangements {{are becoming increasingly}} popular {{for a wide range}} of goods traded internationally. Several types of countertrade arrangements have been identified, ranging from <b>pure</b> <b>barter</b> to more elaborate schemes where only a portion of the trade is "paid for" in goods, including bilateral trading agreements with clearing arrangements and those with arrangements for partial or total compensation in goods. The economic feasibility of these arrangements has been questioned by a number of economists as well as by government officials. In this paper a partial equilibrium model of exchange is developed that incorporates countertrade by focusing on the transaction costs associated with various types of trading arrangements. The role of transaction costs in determining the types of trading arrangements that emerge when exchange is not costless is examined. The model is presented graphically and mathematically. The effect of changes in demand and in the levels of transaction costs on the shares of trade accounted for by cash, credit and countertrade are examined. Several testable hypotheses emerge from this discussion. The hypothesis that the share of trade accounted for by countertrade increases when the unit cost of credit transaction services increases is tested. Correlation coefficients are calculated for countertrade shares of trade for several products and sales agreements versus hard currency debt, the current account deficit, net external borrowing and the current account balance. All product categories examined except minerals and metals support the hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to begin to experimentally study general equilibrium theory. Partial equilibrium analysis {{has been the focus}} of hundreds of experiments, and evidence abounds supporting the proposition that gains from trade will be realized in the market for a single good. Yet, in a general equilibrium context, almost no such documentation exists. Furthermore, general equilibrium theory is not amenable to testing via field data. Thus, at present, the theory that is the intellectual foundation of microeconomics remains untested. The natural starting point of such an investigation is the well-known Edgeworth Box environment. This involves conducting experiments within four major categories. In the first treatment, a two-person, two-good <b>pure</b> <b>barter</b> setting, subjects with given endowments effect trades over the goods. Information is incomplete but symmetric, with individuals having knowledge only of their own endowments and valuations. In the second treatment, prices are introduced to induce a budge constraint. Here, the experimenter acts as an auctioneer, adjusting prices based upon excess demand and supply. Third, the case of asymmetric information is considered, as subjects with full knowledge of both parties' endowments and valuations trade with the experimenter, who acts in a purely price-taking capacity. The final set of experiments extends the second treatment to an r-replication of the economy; here, price-taking behavior is the only individually rational strategy. The results of the barter experiments clearly support standard theoretical predictions, as all gains from trade are exhausted in virtually every case. However, one party usually captures most of these gains through superior bargaining ability. When prices are introduced there is often an initial attempt to behave strategically by at least one of the parties. However, in the limited information environment, it is rarely successful. Thus, the competitive equilibrium is almost always achieved. When information is asymmetric, however, the result is quite different; the majority of people do engage in strategic under-revelation of demand and are thus able to capture the maximum extra surplus available. The final treatment, that of the r-replication of the economy shows the surprising result that subjects in this environment cannot learn, in the alloted time, that behaving in a non-price-taking fashion is very costly...|$|E
