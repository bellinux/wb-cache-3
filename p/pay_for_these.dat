5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E

Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that boosters help families <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> policies.|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E

25|$|Large {{quantities}} of goods were in Britain or in transit when Washington suddenly and unexpectedly terminated Lend-Lease on 21 August 1945. The British economy had been heavily geared towards war production (around 55% GDP) and had drastically reduced its exports. The UK therefore relied on Lend-Lease imports to obtain essential consumer commodities {{such as food}} while it {{could no longer afford}} to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> items using export profits. The end of lend-lease thus came as a great economic shock. Britain needed to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. As a result, the Anglo-American loan came about. Lend-lease items retained were sold to Britain at the knockdown price of about 10 cents on the dollar giving an initial value of £1.075 billion.|$|E

25|$|The HBC {{built a new}} {{much larger}} Fort Vancouver in 1824 {{slightly}} upstream of Fort Astoria {{on the north side}} of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would be the future Canada–U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via Cape Horn) to drop off supplies and trade goods in their trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.|$|E
25|$|The SGR was {{the subject}} of {{possible}} reform legislation again in 2014. On March 14, 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015; 113th Congress), {{a bill that would have}} replaced the (SGR) formula with new systems for establishing those payment rates. However, the bill would <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> changes by delaying the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate requirement, a proposal that was very unpopular with Democrats. The SGR was expected to cause Medicare reimbursement cuts of 24 percent on April 1, 2014, if a solution to reform or delay the SGR was not found. This led to another bill, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress), which would delay those cuts until March 2015. This bill was also controversial. The American Medical Association and other medical groups opposed it, asking Congress to provide a permanent solution instead of just another delay.|$|E
500|$|The Gold Rush stimulated economies {{around the}} world as well. Farmers in Chile, Australia, and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food; British {{manufactured}} goods were in high demand; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China. The return of large amounts of California gold to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs {{around the world}}. Australian prospector Edward Hargraves, noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country, returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes. [...] Preceding the Gold Rush, the United States was on a bi-metallic standard, but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation. [...] The increase in gold supply also created a monetary supply shock.|$|E

50|$|With {{the onset}} of the Late-2000s recession, the {{restaurant}} experienced a downturn. Nearly half of the restaurant's business came from large parties of workers from local hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. As part of the recession, though, many of <b>these</b> companies stopped <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> dinners, so the workers were no longer able to eat there. In an attempt to garner support for the restaurant and to keep it from failing, the Alliance for Downtown Meridian urged people to eat there at least once a week.|$|R

As he completed his fifth trip to Iowa, party officials in the state remarked that he was [...] "making inroads" [...] in the state, commenting that [...] "Democrats are looking for somebody who is new and fresh." [...] The candidate revealed his economic goals during a speech, stating [...] "that creating opportunity for middle-class Americans will be a centerpiece of my campaign."

In 1887, {{shortly after his}} retirement, {{he wrote a letter}} to the editor of The Times addressing some of the highly publicized problems of desertions from the ranks. [...] "War Office civilians," [...] he wrote, [...] "like the plan of indiscriminate enlist, as it swells their list of recruits. [...] Then, when the list of deserters grows, they put on long faces, and say, 'it must be those wicked officers.' [...] The officers would stop this plan in a day if they were allowed." [...] The problem with recruiters, Phipps maintained, lay in the need for quantity, not quality. [...] "What fools you civilians are to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> blackguards," [...] he wrote. [...] "If you would let the officers select their men, for the first year or so, you would have fewer men on paper, fewer men in prison, and just as many men for service....I will then give you another hint for saving money...why not do away with the Inspector-General of Recruiting, and spend his pay in horse artillery, who would be very ornamental and very serviceable? What use is the Inspector General?" [...] He had retired from active service in 1883, and Phipps fully retired in 1887, after attaining the rank of colonel.|$|E
