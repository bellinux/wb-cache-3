A setup for real data live gathering is used to collect LTE signals while driving a car in the town of Rapperswil, Switzerland. The collected data are then processed to extract the received LTE cell-specific reference signals (CRSs), which are exploited for estimating <b>pseudoranges.</b> More precisely, the <b>pseudoranges</b> are evaluated by using the “ESPRIT and Kalman Filter for Time-of-Arrival Tracking” (EKAT) algorithm and by taking advantage of signal combining in the time, frequency, spatial, and cell ID domains.

That is, {{when more}} satellites are available than {{needed to produce}} a position fix, the extra pseudoranges should all {{be consistent with the}} computed position. A <b>pseudorange</b> that differs significantly from the expected value (i.e., an outlier) may indicate a fault of the associated satellite or another signal integrity problem (e.g., ionospheric dispersion). Traditional RAIM uses fault detection (FD) only, however newer GPS receivers incorporate fault detection and exclusion (FDE) which enables them to continue to operate {{in the presence of a}} GPS failure.|$|E

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) is {{the most}} widely used {{navigation}} system in land vehicle applications. In urban areas, the GPS suffers from insufficient signal strength, multipath propagation and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) errors, so it thus becomes difficult to obtain accurate and reliable position information. In this paper, an integration algorithm for multiple receivers is proposed to enhance the positioning performance of GPS for land vehicles in urban areas. The <b>pseudoranges</b> of multiple receivers are integrated based on a tightly coupled approach, and erroneous measurements are detected by testing the closeness of the <b>pseudoranges.</b> In order to fairly compare the <b>pseudoranges,</b> GPS errors and terms arising due to the differences between the positions of the receivers need to be compensated. The double-difference technique is used to eliminate GPS errors in the <b>pseudoranges,</b> and the geometrical distance is corrected by projecting the baseline vector between pairs of receivers. In order to test and analyze the proposed algorithm, an experiment involving live data was performed.

In this paper, we collected the trace data of <b>pseudoranges</b> by driving cars in urban areas, analyzed the properties of MPEs (specifically, their dependency on signal strength, elevation angles of satellites, and receivers’ speeds), and highlighted their spatial correlation. On this basis, the CoRelPos scheme is refined by considering the dynamics of MPEs.

40|$|Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) {{is one of}} {{the most}} precise Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) {{positioning}} technologies, with which users can obtain centimetre-level relative positioning accuracy in real-time. Routinely, expensive and dedicated dual-frequency,geodetic-quality receivers are used to provide RTK positioning. However a myriad of industrial and engineering applications (e. g., utility services, automated continuous monitoring of ground subsidence and deformation of man-made structures, robotics, intelligent transportation systems, agriculture, etc.) demand small-size, cost-effective and highly accurate GNSS positioning. This encourages the use of easily available low-cost single-frequency receivers with carrier-phase tracking and output capabilities and hence, the potential of those receivers to provide RTK positioning is examined in this thesis. A novel and effective Doppler-aided epoch-by-epoch processing technique is devised and developed to increase the single-frequency RTK positioning availability in GPS/GNSS challenged environments. The technique utilises raw Doppler frequency shift measurements to smooth code <b>pseudoranges</b> and also uses a new integer ambiguity estimation and validation technique. Doppler-smoothing of <b>pseudoranges</b> is motivated both by the continual availability and the centimetre-level precision, even in difficult urban canyons, of receiver generated raw Doppler frequency shift measurements. The influence of Doppler-smoothed <b>pseudoranges</b> on both the positioning and the carrier-phase integer ambiguity resolution is investigated. It is shown that in urban areas the proposed Doppler-smoothing technique is more robust and effective than that of the traditional carrier-smoothing of <b>pseudoranges</b> (e. g., the Hatch filter).

40|$|The {{position}} of a GPS receiver can be determined by obtaining <b>pseudoranges</b> from a minimum of four different GPS satellites. The measured ranges do not represent the true ranges as the signal coming from a GPS satellite will be contaminated by various errors like Ephemeris error; Propagation error {{in the form of}} Ionospheric and Tropospheric delays; Satellite and Receiver clock biases with respect to GPS Time (GPST); Multipath error etc. Most of these errors can be estimated accurately and can be accounted for. After making necessary corrections to the observed <b>pseudoranges</b> the receiver position in ECEF coordinates (xu, yu, zu) and the receiver clock bias with GPS Time (GPST) tu can be determined either by using Linearization Technique [1] or Method of least squares using Bancroft Algorithm [2]. As it is easy to implement, most of the GPS receivers employ former method for fixing the user position when a great degree of accuracy is not required. The latter method is found to be more accurate when <b>pseudoranges</b> from more than four satellites are considered [3]. So far only Bancroft method has been suggested for an accurate estimation of a GPS receiver position when more than four satellites are observed. In this paper we are proposing a new technique namely, Extended Linearization Technique (ELT) for the estimation of an user position. Results show that the accuracy obtained using ELT is better compared to the Linearization Technique and is on par with the Bancroft algorithm for over specified cases when <b>pseudoranges</b> from more than four satellites are observed.
