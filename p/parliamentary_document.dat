The work will {{provide the basis for}} the OASIS Legal XML LegalDocumentML project. The [...] "United States Legislative Markup" [...] (USLM) schema for the United States Code (the US codified laws) was designed to be consistent with Akoma Ntoso.

The United States Library of Congress created the Markup of US Legislation in Akoma Ntoso challenge in July 2013 to create representations of selected US bills using the most recent Akoma Ntoso standard within a couple months for a $5000 prize, and the Legislative XML Data Mapping challenge in September 2013 to produce a data map for US bill XML and UK bill XML to the most recent Akoma Ntoso schema within a couple months for a $10000 prize.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As {{the amount}} of {{information}} increases every day and the users normally formulate short and ambiguous queries, personalized search techniques are becoming almost a must. Using the information about the user stored in a user profile, these techniques retrieve results that are closer to the user preferences. On the other hand, the information is being stored more and more in an semi-structured way, and XML has emerged as a standard for representing and exchanging this type of data. XML search allows a higher retrieval effectiveness, due to its ability to retrieve and to show the user specific parts of the documents instead of the full document. In this paper we propose several personalization techniques in the context of XML retrieval. We try to combine the different approaches where personalization may be applied: query reformulation, reranking of results and retrieval model modification. The experimental results obtained from a user study using a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>document</b> collection support the validity of our approach...|$|E

The volume focuses on the more conspicuous Italian case, using a combination of both primary research methods (judicial proceedings, interviews, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>documents,</b> ecc.) as well as cross-national comparisons. Ultimately the volume presents a model for analyzing corruption as a network of illegal exchanges, a model that will serve both as a theoretical approach to a political problem bearing on all democratic institutions, and as a theoretical undestanding useful for the formulation of more effective anti-corruption policies...|$|R

40|$|Is ‘public opinion’ {{systematically}} {{opposed to}} immigration? And has this pushed policymakers to implement restrictive migration policies? To answer these questions, we investigate {{the impact of}} public opinion, as expressed in media debates, on the making of family migration policies in the Netherlands. Based on newspaper articles, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>documents</b> and ministerial archives, we analysed three debates on family migration from the 1960 s, the 1980 s and the 1990 s, respectively. We identify how and why media coverage influenced administrative and political decision-making. Our findings contradict common assumptions in migration studies literature: media debates do not necessarily contribute to restrictive policy dynamics. As often as not, media debates supported liberal migration policy agendas. Furthermore, the impact of media on migration policy-making was smaller than often assumed...|$|R

The intention to return to a foreign policy base line was eschewed in favour of last minute adjustments and compromises.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how the salience and framing of political {{issues in the}} press and in parliament influence each other and how this salience and framing is influenced by key events outside the media and parliamentary realms. The case focused on is the debate on immigration and integration in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004. The empirical analyses are based on a computer-assisted content analysis of both <b>parliamentary</b> <b>documents</b> and newspaper articles. Results show bidirectional causal relationships between media and parliament. In the case of salience only long-term influence relationships are found, while framing influences follow an interesting pattern: an increase in the use of a frame in one arena leads to an increase in the other arena only if this frame has already been used regularly in the latter arena. External events have more considerable and consistent impact on issue salience and framing in both arenas. Copyright © 2007 Sage Publications...|$|R
