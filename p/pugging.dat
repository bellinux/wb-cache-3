50|$|The natural {{building}} materials available for construction in Kerala are stones, timber, clay and palm leaves. Granite {{is a strong}} and durable building stone; however its availability is restricted mostly to the highlands and only marginally to other zones. Owing to this, the skill in quarrying, dressing and sculpturing of stone is scarce in Kerala. Laterite {{on the other hand}} is the most abundant stone found as outcrops in most zones. Soft laterite available at shallow depth can be easily cut, dressed and used as building blocks. It is a rare local stone which gets stronger and durable with exposure at atmospheric air. Laterite blocks may be bonded in mortars of shell lime, which have been the classic binding material used in traditional buildings. Lime mortar can be improved in strength and performance by admixtures of vegetable juices. Such enriched mortars were used for plastering or for serving as the base for mural painting and low relief work. Timber is the prime structural material abundantly available in many varieties in Kerala - from bamboo to teak. Perhaps the skilful choice of timber, accurate joinery, artful assembly and delicate carving of wood work for columns, walls and roofs frames are the unique characteristics of Kerala architecture. Clay was used in many forms - for walling, in filling the timber floors and making bricks and tiles after <b>pugging</b> and tempering with admixtures. Palm leaves were used effectively for thatching the roofs and for making partition walls.From the limitations of the materials, a mixed mode of construction was evolved in Kerala architecture. The stone work was restricted to the plinth even in important buildings such as temples. Laterite was used for walls. The roof structure in timber was covered with palm leaf thatching for most buildings and rarely with tiles for palaces or temples. The exterior of the laterite walls were either left as such or plastered with lime mortar to serve as the base for mural painting. The sculpturing of the stone was mainly moulding in horizontal bands in the plinth portion (adhistans) whereas the carving of timber covered all elements _ pillars, beams, ceiling, rafters and the supporting brackets. The Kerala murals are paintings with vegetable dyes on wet walls in subdued shades of brown. The indigenous adoption of the available raw materials and their transformation as enduring media for architectural expression thus became the dominant feature of the Kerala style.|$|E

The forages that were used are alfalfa (Medicago sativa), red clover (Trifolium pratense), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), two varieties of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) and chicory (Cichorium intybus). Plots were evaluated for plant establishment, pasture mass and nutritional value in a randomized complete block design. In addition, plots were divided into two halves with one half being cut twice as frequently as the other to compare the effects of cutting frequency. The results showed that new forage varieties were established (P.

40|$|Irregular pagination: missing pages 67 - 68. Two {{management}} systems for dry dairy cows were studied {{during the winter}} of 1975 at No. 3 Dairy Unit, Massey University. The objective {{of the study was to}} help develop a system which may reduce the need for supplementation of pasture grown, and at the same time ensure that adequate feed supplies are available over the winter and early spring to meet animal requirements. The parameters studied were pasture growth rates and recovery, pasture damage through <b>pugging,</b> feed consumption and live weight changes of cows, milk production for the first three months of lactation, and the grass 'cover' on the two farmlets. In general, the results have shown that each system had its own advantages and disadvantages and these are discussed in the text. It is, however, recommended that while such advantages and disadvantages exist, a grazing system which incorporates the two systems warrants experimentation.

40|$|Forage crops {{perform an}} {{important}} role in New Zealand farming systems. They provide large quantities of high quality forage when perennial pasture growth is low or of poor quality. The production advantages of forage crops over conventional pasture are varied and relate to the level of utilisable yield of the forage crop. These advantages include: renovation of pasture that is beyond improvement through grazing management (Hook, 1981), use as a break crop to assist weed and pest control, and to confine or reduce the level of overall farm winter <b>pugging.</b> This paper reviews the off-farm forage cropping opportunities available to dairy farmers. It assumes that the main livestock objectives are to grow young dairy stock at optimum rates, maintain or improve the condition of dry cows, or provide feed for longer term conservation. Forage crops can be broadly classified into the brassicas and greenfeeds. As brassica crops are covered in detail in another session of this conference, this paper only covers recent brassica research conducted at Lincoln University, particularly with regard to leaf turnips.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a wet winter on milksolid {{production}} in early lactation was measured for the years 1994 and 1995, against the 1993 year which had a dry winter. Data for milksolid production {{to the end of}} December, and for the whole season, were collected from 70 farms in the Manawatu region that had remained relatively unchanged in area and cow numbers over the three years. Management information was also collected from 18 selected farmers, whose milksolid production was either affected or unaffected by the wet winters. These farmers were also visited to obtain supplementary information about their management. For the 70 farms, the effect of the wet winters on production in early lactation was a significant reduction (P< 1 %) in milksolids for both wet years studied. (- 24 KgMS/ha;- 9 KgMS/cow in 1994, and - 66 KgMS/ha;- 26 KgMS/cow in 1995). These effects could have been caused by 0. 2 tDM/ha and 0. 5 tDM/ha less pasture being eaten in the wet springs of 1994 and 1995 respectively. However the effect on the total lactation milksolid production was not significant, with increases in late lactation compensating for the decreases apparent in early lactation. The effect of the wet winters was probably to increase the incidence of <b>pugging</b> damage and to lower the pasture growth rates and pasture cover through calving and into early spring, reducing the ability of the farmers to feed lactating cows in early lactation. For the 18 farms selected in the management survey, the effect of the wet winter (1995) on production in early lactation was larger on the affected farms (- 133 KgMS/ha; - 45 KgMS/cow), than for the unaffected farms (- 4 KgMS/ha; - 11 KgMS/cow). There was a significant decrease in the total seasons production for the affected farmers with lower production (- 93 KgMS/ha; - 25 KgMS/cow) in 1995 than 1993. The total seasons production for the unaffected farmers was a significant increase of 80 KgMS/ha, and an increase of 13 KgMS/cow for 1995 compared to 1993. There was no one single management strategy that was used during the wet winter of 1995 by unaffected farmers that was not used by the affected farmers. Instead, more unaffected farmers used off farm grazing, on-off grazing, and had better overall farm drainage. This decreased the risk of <b>pugging</b> damage during the winter, and early spring to enable more pasture to be converted to milksolids. There were differences in goals between the groups, because the affected farmers had more goals associated with lifestyle, while the unaffected farmers had more production orientated goals, with the unaffected farmers constantly monitoring the system to ensure the achievement of their production goals...|$|E

40|$|Soil carbon (C) is {{important}} because even small changes in soil C can affect atmospheric concentrations of CO₂, which in turn can influence global climate. Adequate soil carbon is also required to maintain soil quality, which {{is important}} to if agricultural production is to be sustained. The soil carbon balance of New Zealand's pastoral soils is poorly understood, with recent research showing that soils under dairy pasture have lost large amounts of C {{during the past few}} decades. The main objective of this research was to determine an annual farm scale C budget for an intensively grazed dairy farm, with a second objective being to determine the amount of CO₂-C lost following cultivation for pasture renewal, and soil <b>pugging</b> by dairy cattle. A third objective was to investigate the environmental controls of CO₂ exchange in a dairy farm pasture system. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO₂ was measured using an eddy covariance (EC) system from 15 December 2007 to 14 December 2008. Closed chamber techniques were used to measure CO₂ emissions from three cultivated paddocks and three adjacent pasture paddocks between 26 January 2008 and 5 March 2008. CO₂ emissions were also measured using chambers from pugged and control plots between 25 June and 5 August. Coincidentally this research was carried out in a year with a severe summer/autumn drought and a wetter than usual winter. Annual NEE measured with the eddy covariance system was - 1, 843 kg C ha⁻¹ (a C gain by the land surface). Accounting for C in supplement import, milk export, pasture export and losses in methane, the dairy pasture system was a net sink of - 880 ± 500 kg C ha⁻¹. This C sequestration occurred despite severe drought during the study, which was in contrast to other studies of grasslands during drought. Cultivation under dry conditions did not increase cumulative CO₂-C emissions compared to adjacent pasture paddocks. However, when C inputs to pasture paddocks via photosynthesis were included in calculations, net C loss from the cultivated paddocks (during the 39 day study) was estimated to be 622 kg C ha⁻¹ more than the pasture paddocks. CO₂ emissions were lower from pugged plots compared to control plots, probably caused by decreased microbial and root respiration due to wetter soil conditions, and lowered root respiration as a result of lower pasture production. Volumetric soil moisture content (soil moisture) had a dominant effect on CO₂ exchange at a range of temporal scales. Respiration and photosynthesis were both reduced when soil moisture was below 43 % (~the lower limit of readily available water) and photosynthesis virtually ceased when soil moisture declined below 24 % (~wilting point). Soil moisture also influenced the relationship between temperature and respiration and photosynthetic flux density (PPFD) and NEE. These results suggest that management related soil disturbances of occasional cultivation for pasture renewal and soil <b>pugging,</b> are unlikely to cause large losses of soil C. Further, a severe drought also did not cause CO₂-C losses from the land surface to the atmosphere on an annual scale, in contrast to previous studies...|$|E

One of the promising methods used for bioethanol purification is pervaporation membrane. This research is aimed to prepare and characterize zeolite membranes for pervaporation membrane. The membrane preparation consisted of two stages, namely support preparation and zeolite deposition on the support. In support preparation, α- alumina and kaolin with specific composition (50 : 30; 40 : 40; 50 : 30) was mixed with additives and water. After <b>pugging</b> and aging process, the mixture became paste and extruded into tubular shape. The tube was then calcined at temperature of 1250 °C for 3 hours. After that, zeolite 4 A was deposited on the tubes using clear solution made of 10 %wt zeolite and 90 %wt water and heated at temperature of 80 °C for 3 hours. Furthermore, the resulting zeolite membranes was washed with deionized water for 5 minutes and dried in oven at temperature of 100 °C for 24 hours. Characterization of zeolite membranes included mechanical strength test, XRD, and SEM. In the mechanical strength test, the membrane sample with α- alumina:kaolin = 50 : 30 (membrane A) has the highest mechanical strength of 46. 65 N/mm 2. Result of XRD analysis for the membrane A indicated that mullite and corundum phases were formed, which mullite phase was more dominant. Meanwhile the result of SEM analysis shows that zeolite crystals have been formed and covered the pores support, but the deposition of zeolite has not been optimal yet. The performance examination for bioethanol purification showed that the membrane could increase the purity of bioethanol from 95 % to 98. 5 % wt. © 2013 BCREC UNDIP. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Examinations of the {{described}} object were undertaken {{because of}} building works {{carried out on}} the ground neighbouring the Łódź ZOO, that is at the site of a Lusatian Culture settlement from the IV th and V th phase of the Bronze Age. The site had been explored by the workers without archaeological supervision until the final stage of building works. Excavations resulted in recovering and registration of 6 dwelling pits and a cultural layer of the mid-Poland Lusatian culture group. Only the object no. 6 has been preserved in its greatest part. The remaining objects were devoid of full outline and higher layers of the filling. The object no. 6 was most probably a household object of a semi- sunken hut type. In spite of a large size of the object on the level on which it was distinguished (302 by 160 cm), its size reaches only 250 x 160 cm at the bottom level, what excludes its dwelling character. Presumably it was a storage object. During exploration, {{in the western part of}} the cave, a readable filling was observable, clearly distinguishing from the rest of the object (by a light brown colouring).

A target level of milk production of 7000 L/cow. year was set, based on predicted intakes of 2. 7 t DM/cow. year as concentrates, pasture intakes from 1. 5 to 2. 7 t/cow. year and purchased fodder. In years 1 and 2, up to 1. 5 t DM/cow. year of purchased fodder was used and in years 3 and 4 the amounts were increased if necessary to enable levels of milk production per cow to be maintained at target levels. Cows in dryland farmlets calved in March to May inclusive and were stocked at 2. 5, 2. 9, 3. 3, 3. 6 and 4. 1 cows/ha, while those in irrigated farmlets calved in August to October inclusive and were stocked at 4. 1, 5. 2, 6. 3 and 7. 4 cows/ha. In the first 2 years, when inputs of purchased fodder were limited, milk production per cow was reduced with higher stocking rates (P < 0. 01), but in years 3 and 4 there were no differences. Mean production was 7149 kg/cow. year in years 1 and 2, and 8162 kg/cow. year in years 3 and 4. Production per hectare was very closely related to stocking rate in all years (P < 0. 01), increasing from 18 to 34 t milk/ha. year for dryland farmlets (1300 to 2200 kg milk solids/ha) and from 30 to 60 t milk/ha. year for irrigated farmlets (2200 to 4100 kg milk solids/ha). Almost all of these increases were attributed to the increases in grain and purchased fodder inputs associated with the increases in stocking rate. Net pasture accumulation rates and pasture harvest were generally not altered with stocking rate, though as stocking rate increased there was a change to more of the pasture being grazed and less conserved in both dryland and irrigated farmlets. Total pasture harvest averaged similar to 8 and 14 t DM/ha. year for dryland and irrigated pastures, respectively.

Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. Water quality issues are at the forefront of people’s minds at present. The sheep and beef sector is coming under increasing pressure to ‘do their bit’ to improve water quality on farm. This is not necessarily a straight forward task, {{and there are a number}} of barriers preventing widespread action. The sector is also coming under pressure to produce more in an increasingly resource constrained environment. The aim of this project was to investigate sheep and beef farmer views on barriers to uptake of environmental practices on-farm, seek sheep and beef farmer views on how the industry might improve uptake of environmental practices on-farm to manage the challenges ahead and test these views with environmental activists. Thirteen sheep and beef farmers in the Waikato (including Taumarunui) and Bay of Plenty Region who were considered to be relatively innovative and involved in the industry were interviewed on a range of questions relating to environmental practices on farm. In addition, four environmentalists were interviewed to test some of the farmer views on them and get their perspective. A trustee from the Grasslands Trust was also interviewed as well as an ecologist from the Land and Water Institute in Australia. The major impacts sheep and beef farming are having on water quality is through nitrogen leaching and phosphorus, sediment and faecal coliform run-off. There are a number of practices to mitigate these impacts such as riparian fencing and planting, erosion control on steep hill country, avoiding <b>pugging</b> and compaction damage, smart use of fertiliser and sensible management practices with crops, particularly in winter. The farmers interviewed had undertaken a range of practices on their farms. Their motivations for these practices were generally related to management benefits such as improving animal health and safety, or ease of grazing management. However, they also had an understanding of mitigating their environmental impact. Most of the farmers interviewed wanted to undertake more practices, and the primary barrier to this was unsurprisingly, money. Other barriers for either the farmers interviewed, or their view on the barriers for other farmers were knowledge and understanding, attitude, fear of rules, the maintenance requirements, and not understanding the benefits in a practical or economic sense...|$|E
40|$|The Reureu Valley is {{distinctive}} {{with several}} enclaves from various iwi living there; Ngāti Raukawa, Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Kahungunu and Tūwharetoa. The {{history of the}} valley shows several hapū migrating there due to broader land conflicts and to protect their land interests. The Reureu blocks lie within the rohe of Ngāti Pikiahu hapū o Ngāti Raukawa near Poupatate Marae. Māori land development {{has the potential to}} contribute significantly to the agricultural sector. In a report conducted by the then Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in 2011, 40 % of Māori freehold land was under-preforming with a further 40 % under-utilised. The large number of Māori land blocks underdeveloped or underperforming means there is considerable room for development. Māori land development is not simple; many aspects from multiple ownership through to governance structures have inhibited growth. However, a recent dairy conversion has seen the collaboration of trusts, incorporations with land interests and government bodies to develop and accelerate a transformation of Māori land. The Reureu blocks studied are currently under-developed and have owners wanting to look at possible land-use options. This includes research on what information is presently available; the quality of this information; and areas where information is lacking relative to make an informed decision about a change in land-use. Subsequently a determination of the information gaps was made. A practical assessment of the resource was deemed necessary. Soil surveying was then conducted on the Reureu blocks. It was discovered that the soils previously mapped on these blocks were not found in this exercise, triggering the need for a full and extensive land evaluation approach. Land evaluation tools were then used to assess the land, to ensure or aid the decision making in a type of land-use for the Reureu blocks. Land evaluation tools included LRI mapping, LUC mapping and suitability of six important features. Nutrient Management is a key issue when dealing with contemporary land-use, and the Reureu blocks lie within Horizons Regional Council region and regulations. Limits of leaching and consent conditions were therefore looked at for the potential of developing a dairy farm. The conversion into dairy was preferred by the hapū therefore further investigation was carried out which is considered vital to a dairy platform. An assessment of FDE application, irrigation requirement (irrigation benefit), presence of stones, <b>pugging</b> susceptibility, potential use for cropping (presence of stones inhibiting crop growth), flood risk and nutrient budgets was made. Various computer models including Farmax and Overseer were used to gain realistic results to best represent the Reureu blocks as a dairy platform.

Using the Cup of Rlnn Skrr, Owyn restores <b>Pug's</b> powers and they find Gamina imprisoned in a crystal cage in the underground ruins of the Temple of Dhatsavan. Gorath smashes the cage and, using a special pattern stone <b>Pug</b> has brought, {{the four of them}} return to Midkemia.|$|R
