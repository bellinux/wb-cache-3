50|$|As {{the first}} film {{streamed}} across the Internet in 1993, the New York Times declaring Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees an “historic event.” That same year, the hypermedia version of the film, Waxweb, {{was one of the}} first sites on the World Wide Web, and thus has been repeatedly cited as a milestone of Internet Art. Waxweb has been presented in museums world-wide. Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees was an early example of digital cinema, {{was one of the first}} independent films to be edited on a digital non-linear system, the Montage <b>Picture</b> <b>Processor,</b> and transferred from video to film for theatrical presentation.|$|E
50|$|The EditDroid is a {{computerized}} analog NLE (non-linear editing system), which {{was developed by}} Lucasfilm spin-off company, the Droid Works and Convergence Corporation who formed a joint venture company. The company existed up through the mid-80's to the early 90's {{in an attempt to}} move from analog editing methods to digital. EditDroid debuted at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) 62nd Annual meeting in Las Vegas in 1984 concurrent with another editing tool that would compete with the EditDroid for all its years in production, the Montage <b>Picture</b> <b>Processor.</b> The EditDroid was never a commercial success and after the close of The Droid Works in 1987 and subsequent redevelopment of the product for seven years, the software was eventually sold to Avid Technology in 1993. Only 24 EditDroid systems were ever produced.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we simplify {{the model of}} {{computation}} considered in [1], namely network of evolutionary <b>picture</b> <b>processors,</b> by moving the filters from the nodes to the edges. Each edge is now viewed as a two-way channel such that input and output filters, respectively, of the two nodes connected by the edge coincide. Thus, the possibility of controlling the computation in such networks seems to be diminished. In spite of this observation all the results concerning the computational power of networks of evolutionary <b>picture</b> <b>processors</b> reported in [1] are extended over these simplified networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The goal of {{this work}} is to survey in a {{systematic}} and uniform way the main results regarding different computational aspects of networks of <b>picture</b> <b>processors</b> viewed as rectangular picture accepting devices. We first consider networks with evolutionary <b>picture</b> <b>processors</b> only and discuss their computational power {{as well as a}} partial solution to the picture matching problem. Two variants of these networks, which are differentiated by the protocol of communication, are also surveyed: networks with filtered connections and networks with polarized processors. Then we consider networks having both types of processors, i. e., evolutionary processors and hiding processors, and provide a complete solution to the picture matching problem. Several results which follow from this solution are then presented. Finally we discuss some possible directions for further research...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} study of {{networks}} of evolutionary processors accepting words to a similar model, processing rectangular pictures. To this aim, we introduce accepting networks of evolutionary <b>picture</b> <b>processors</b> and investigate their computational power. We show that these networks can accept the complement of any local picture language as well as picture languages that are not recognizable. Some open problems regarding decidability issues and closure properties are finally discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} malaria {{parasite}} detection in thin blood-smears is presented. Sample slides prepared with standard methods are accepted. A low-cost TV-camera mounted on an ordinary microscope {{with a computer}} controlled stage {{is used as a}} picture sensor. Frames, digitized in windows of 64 x 64 pixels are fed into a special purpose <b>picture</b> <b>processor</b> at normal frame rate (25 frames/sec). In the <b>picture</b> <b>processor</b> measurements are made on the images at high speed. The classification problem is split into different levels each having different characteristics such as different sampling density. Four classes, three of which are different types of malaria parasites, are recognized. As a whole the classification is best labelled as a sequential pattern recognition procedure. In its preliminary version the system has been run at a speed comparable to that of a human operator, that is l 500 cells per minute. A test on 80 000 cells gave 25 false negatives out of 283 parasites (9 %) and 41 false positives (0. 05 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a new type of picture processing system for images represented as digital arrays of pixels. This is a synthesis of two established ideas, already under independent investigation. The first of these is picture processing by look-up tables. This is a fast method of generating pixel outputs as a result of input pixels accessing a particular region of a look-up table, pre-loaded with the required data. The second idea is the use of RAMs as learning machines. Here, RAM elements are connected together so as to be alterable in data content by training stimuli in a coherent manner. This results in a system able to exhibit definite responses to later test stimuli, and thus identify these stimuli unambiguously. The methods used for bringing these two conceptstogether are described here. A practicable <b>picture</b> <b>processor</b> results, which can be trained by examples. That is, it can perform a picture transformation simply by presenting to the machine (in a prior training phase) examples of the process. From this, the machine deduces the information necessary to be able to perform the same transformation on unseen patterns. Experiments have been performed on a wide range of variations on this theme. Different types of machines acting on different data and tasks have been tried, under various conditions. A description is given of these machine variations, together with a generalized system fordescribing such variations more formally. The machines were simulated in practice on a microcomputer system; The simulation software used in these investigations is also described. Finally, the implications and limitations of such machines are discussed with reference to their ultimate performance and possible applications in fields other than picture processing. <p...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{solution}} based on networks of <b>picture</b> <b>processors</b> {{to the problem}} of picture pattern matching. The network solving the problem can be informally described as follows: it consists of two subnetworks, one of them extracts simultaneously all subpictures of the same size from the input picture and sends them to the second subnetwork. The second subnetwork checks whether any of the received pictures is identical to the pattern. We present an efficient solution based on networks with evolutionary processors only, for patterns with at most three rows or columns. Afterwards, we present a solution based on networks containing both evolutionary and hiding processors running in O(n+m+kl+k) computational (processing and communication) steps, where the input picture and the pattern are of size (n,m) and (k,l), respectively...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new concept for image {{recognition}} and understanding whereby both overall and local image processing are executed in parallel. Using this concept, we have developed an advanced vision processor that can recognize moving objects and handle moving <b>pictures.</b> The vision <b>processor</b> cames out feature extraction for image recognition by means of several local processors in parallel from time varying images on which an overall image processing unit has performed low-level operations such as data conversion and filtering. Special characteristics of the system are that each local processor processes only its region of interest, the division of regions being determined from the image feature and contents. A balloon-juggling robot has been developed to demonstrate the capability of the system. The system recognizes the balloon and measures its 3 -D position in real time. The robot hits the balloon by using the 3 -D data. 1...|$|R
40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of Visualization Technology, massive data {{need to be}} converted into intuitive graphics {{in more and more}} areas, such as in oil and geological exploration fields. In order to achieve highly efficient visualization of 2 D seismic data, the following important methods are employed to improve the speed of rendering. The first method is to process massive data in point coordinate (x, y) forms. The second method is to draw local area of graphics by figuring out what points need to be painted for that graphics of massive data that sometimes can’t be shown completely on a displayed screen, which results in a high rate of drawing and less usage of memory.   The third method is to pick out a sparsing algorithm by K-Neighboring in order to see the whole picture of massive 2 D data or to zoom out the whole picture to guarantee the quality of <b>pictures.</b> And sometimes <b>processors</b> need to view detailed graphics of a region of 2 D seimic data, then it proposed bilinear interpolation algorithm. Overall, visualization system of massive 2 D seismic data presented in this paper is based on the methods proposed above and uses Qt as a development language. Finally, high efficiency is achieved by drawing local area data and bitmap-cache mechanism when massive 2 D data need to be displayed on more screens; and also high speed is obtained to render by operating 2 D graphics such as by zooming out through K-Neighboring sparsing algorithm...|$|R
