40|$|In several {{projects}} within ABB {{there is}} a need of state and parameter estimation for nonlinear dynamic systems. One example is a project investigating optimisation of gas turbine operation. In a gas turbine there are several parameters and states which are not measured, but are crucial for the performance. Such parameters are <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in compressor and turbine stages, cooling mass flows, friction coefficients and temperatures. Different methods are being tested to solve this problem of system identification or parameter estimation. This thesis describes the implementation of such a method and compares it with previously implemented identification methods.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} case study of {{apparent}} performance variation of an optimized centrifugal compressor design when its metal parts are cold - before the conjugated heat transfer between the fluid and parts reaches an energetic equilibrium. The methods used are numerical, using full viscous 3 D computational fluid dynamics with heat transfer. Three cases were considered, an adiabatic wall baseline, an all-blade cooling at 293 K and a more realistic stator row cooling at 293 K. Results indicate an apparent yet erroneous isentropic efficiency reading increase beyond 100 % - which was to be expected due to the fluid cooling. However the isentropic and <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> could be estimated and were used to more accurately assess the performance of the compressor. Power consumption decreased to approximately 97 % of the original load while the pressure ratio was marginally increased. This alone does not, however, explain the non-physical efficiency readings, which are mainly due to the assumptions and manner under which the efficiency itself is calculated. The paper  presents a more robust approach to measuring efficiency, regardless of the heat transfer within the turbomachinery itself. Possible applications of the study may range from cold-start regime simulation to the optimization of inter-cooling setup or even flow angle control without mechanically actuated OG...|$|R

Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.Higher stage pressure ratios are also possible if the relative velocity between fluid and rotors is supersonic, but this is achieved at the expense of efficiency and operability. Such compressors, with stage pressure ratios of over 2, are only used where minimizing the compressor size, weight or complexity is critical, such as in military jets.The airfoil profiles are optimized and matched for specific velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this can result in an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit on the number of stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the design conditions. These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the main flow between stages (inter-stage bleed).Modern jet engines use a series of compressors, running at different speeds; to supply air at around 40:1 pressure ratio for combustion with sufficient flexibility for all flight conditions.|$|E

The GA is used to seek the optimal values of eight parameters that define the turbofan engine. These parameters are encoded as chromosomes (a metaphor) in GA. A computer program called TurboJet-Engine Optimizer v 1. 0 (TJEO- 1. 0) {{was developed by the}} authors to perform calculations of thermodynamic properties of the engine and implement the optimisations.

The thermodynamic model developed by Galanis and Sorin (2015) assumes the primary flow is always choked, and irreversibilities due to viscous dissipation {{are taken into}} account through <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> The CFD model developed by Croquer et al. (2015) using the software ANSYS Fluent v 15. 0 has already been validated for supersonic ejectors working with R 134 a. A standard high Reynolds number k- Ï‰ SST turbulence model coupled with the perfect gas law is used to model the turbulent air flows. The dimensions of the ejector were first determined by the thermodynamic model and then used in the CFD model. The thermodynamic model predicts higher entrainment ratios for double choking operation and somewhat different values of the critical and limiting pressure ratios. The CFD model validates the similarity solutions characteristic of ejectors using perfect gases. The present results show in particular that identical inlet pressure and temperature ratios induce the same entrainment ratio as well as the same critical and limiting pressure ratios. Both models confirm also that similar diameter ratios between the primary nozzle throat and the constant area section lead to the same values of the entrainment ratio. Thus, for double-choking operations, the entrainment ratio depends on the inlet pressure and temperature ratios rather than on the individual values of these four properties as is the case for ejectors with real fluids. It also shows that the position of the shock varies linearly with the compression ratio in qualitative agreement with the assumption used in the thermodynamic model. Finally, the main assumptions made to build the thermodynamic model have been checked and discussed a posteriori using the CFD results...|$|R

The goal of this work is to improve the accuracy and applicability of TASOPT in conceptual design of advanced technology, high bypass ratio, small-core, geared and direct-drive turbofan engines. The engine weight surrogate model was built as separate engine component weight surrogate models using least squares and Gaussian Process regression techniques on data data generated from NPSS/WATE++ and then combined to estimate a "bare" engine weight-including only the fan, compressor, turbine, and combustor-and a total engine weight, which also includes the nacelle, nozzle, and pylon. The new model estimates bare engine weight within +/- 10 % of published values for seven existing engines, and improves TASOPT's accuracy in predicting the geometry, weight, and performance of the Boeing 737 - 800. The effects of existing TASOPT engine weight models on optimization od D 8 -series aircraft concepts are also discussed.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Currently {{there are a number}} of Generation IV SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactor (SCWR) concepts under development worldwide. The main objectives for developing and utilizing SCWRs are: 1) Increase gross thermal efficiency of current Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) from 33 – 35 % to approximately 45 – 50 %, and 2) Decrease the capital and operational costs and, in doing so, decrease electrical-energy costs (~$ 1000 US/kW or even less). SCW NPPs will have much higher operating parameters compared to current NPPs (i. e., pressures of about 25 MPa and outlet temperatures up to 625 °C). Additionally, SCWRs will have a simplified flow circuit in which steam generators, steam dryers, steam separators, etc. will be eliminated. Furthermore, SCWRs operating at higher temperatures can facilitate an economical co-generation of hydrogen through thermo-chemical cycles (particularly, the copper-chlorine cycle) or direct high-temperature electrolysis. To decrease significantly the development costs of a SCW NPP, to increase its reliability, and to achieve similar high thermal efficiencies as the advanced fossil steam cycles it should be determined whether SCW NPPs can be designed with a steam-cycle arrangement that closely matches that of mature SuperCritical (SC) fossil power plants (including their SC turbine technology). The state-of-the-art SC steam cycles in fossil power plants are designed with a single-steam reheat and regenerative feedwater heating and reach thermal steamcycle efficiencies up to 54 % (i. e., net plant efficiencies of up to 43 % on a Higher Heating Value (HHV) Basis). Therefore, simplified no-reheat, single-reheat, and double-reheat cycles without heat regeneration and a singlereheat cycle with heat regeneration based on the expected steam parameters of future SCW NPPs were analyzed in terms of their thermal efficiencies. On this basis, several conceptual steam-cycle arrangements of pressure-tube SCWRs, their corresponding T–s diagrams and steam-cycle thermal efficiencies (based on constant isentropic turbine and <b>polytropic</b> pump <b>efficiencies)</b> are presented in this paper. vk 201...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} [1] three {{polytropic}} {{change of state}} calculation methods for air gases and CO 2 are compared. The conclusions are that the most used formulas can produce with the same input data deviations in terms of <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> up to 1. 5 % points even for nearly ideal gases like nitrogen. The paper suggests therefore a recursive algorithm, which is based directly on the classic definition of a polytropic change of state. This definition assumes a constant dissipation rate during an adiabatic change of state. The proposed algorithm can be applied for any gas with an equation of state, which is an unambiguous function of the two variables pressure p and temperature T. The latter condition is not fulfilled by steam in the wetness range because the specific volume v depends not only from p and T {{but also from the}} vapor fraction x. The aim of this paper is the development of an analogous recursive “constant dissipation rate algorithm ” for a two phase mixture assuming equilibrium conditions between the vapor and the liquid fractions.

40|$|Large tip gaps can {{be found}} in the rear stages of {{transonic}} compressors. If the size of the tip gap is large in relation to the blade height it will likely affect the flow in the rotor passage significantly. Therefore, including a large tip gap in the optimization process of a compressor stage can already be of importance in the early design phase. In the present study, a transonic compressor stage is optimized with and without a large tip gap (2. 5 % of the rotor leading edge span) with respect to part speed stability and <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> at a design point. The performance is evaluated using 3 D CFD calculations. The two approaches are compared to determine the importance of including the tip gap in the optimization. It is shown that, when the compressor stage is optimized with a tip gap, redistribution of mass flow in the rotor passage affects the design at mid span and near the hub. A lower stagger angle is preferred away from the tip region to allow for a higher mass flow at lower spanwise positions. The k-epsilon turbulence model with wall functions is used to evaluate the performance of the stages during optimization.

The methodology applied in PTC 10 {{is based upon the}} original work of Schultz (1962) which utilizes a polytropic model of the compression process. Recent efforts associated with the selection and testing of compressors for high pressure carbon dioxide/hydrocarbon mixture reinjection compression services have revealed that the application of PTC 10 can result in significant errors in the estimation of compressor <b>polytropic</b> head and <b>efficiency.</b> The defined evaluation procedures use compressor suction and discharge pressures and temperatures along with gas composition to determine the thermodynamic properties necessary to derive the estimated head and efficiency. While it is recognized that these properties vary continuously from suction to discharge, average properties are used along with a correction factor proposed by Schultz (1962) to correct for variations in these properties along the actual compression path followed. Previous investigations by Mallen and Saville (1977), Huntington (1985), and Hundseid, Bakken and Helde (2006) have identified errors in some compressor applications and have proposed methods to address these issues, however, they have not fully identified the root cause nor the conditions under which these errors become significant. The results of this effort will: 1. Illustrate those portions of the test code procedures that are subject to errors caused by unique process conditions. 2. Identify those gas conditions where the errors incurred in the application of the code are significant. 3.

40|$|The Norwegian {{petroleum}} industry has {{played an important}} role in the country’s industrial development since the early 1970 s. At present, however, the largest oil and gas fields on the Norwegian continental shelf have been developed. To maintain its position and production rates in the future, the {{petroleum industry}} rely on improved recovery from existing fields and the development of smaller, remoter and more technically complicated discoveries. A major contribution to accomplishing this will be made by the development of new and cost-efficient technology. One consequence of technological progress in recent years is that a greater proportion of the processing equipment is being installed subsea. Ormen Lange and Snøhvit are gas fields developed on the basis of subsea solutions, where wellstream processing is located on land. These discoveries are characterised by high gas fractions with relative small amounts of liquid. Gas containing less that 5 % liquid on a volume basis is denoted wet gas. To maintain production rates as well pressure decreases, boosting the wellstream is essential. This has therefore created a big incentive in recent years to develop subsea boosting technology. Subsea compression is also applicable for boosting existing gas fields to increase tail production and in development of marginal fields where subsea boosting can be utilised in transportation of wellstream to nearby processing facility. Technology development for subsea compression is currently based on two alternatives: compressing the unprocessed wellstream and subsea separation with compression based on traditional gas compressors and pumps. This thesis evaluates performance prediction models for wet gas compression. No commercial available wet gas compressors exist at present, but several concepts for such equipment have been tested. No performance and test standards currently exist for wet gas compressors. To ensure nominated flow under varying fluid flow conditions, a complete understanding of compressor performance is essential. Present evaluation methods for compressor performance fail when evaluating the compression of wet gas. The development of a wet gas compressor performance model has been based on the polytropic approach given in ASME and ISO standards, and a full review of this method is given. Assuming a polytropic compression path, the method is based on averaged gas properties of inlet and outlet condition. Depending on how this polytropic compression analysis is implemented, the review has revealed up to 4 % deviation in <b>polytropic</b> head and <b>efficiency</b> for some specific compressors. This adds an extra uncertainty in compressor performance verification. Even though the API 617 allows up to 4 % deviation, some compressors have to meet a more stringent demand, such as 2 % at the Snøhvit gas liquefaction plant. Existing computer technology permits a direct integration of the compression path where the variation in actual gas properties along the path is included.   This method eliminates the averaging of gas properties which the Schultz procedure includes. Direct integration is of special interest when evaluating wet gas compression. Phase changes along the compression path are included, enabling a detailed prediction to be made of the actual volumetric flow rate for the various compressor stages. This thesis reports the implementation of the direct integration procedure for wet gas performance prediction. The procedure enables generic wet gas compression to be studied, which forms the foundation for performance analysis with variations in operation conditions and fluid properties. The polytropic procedure in its current form does not permit a direct comparison of wet and dry gas conditions owing to the influence of a high-density liquid phase in wet conditions. Correction methods to account for these changes are presented. These correction parameters are verified against the results from a wet gas compressor test. The compressor was tested on fluid conditions typically encountered in a North Sea gas and condensate field.

High-fidelity models of geometric variability were constructed from surface measurements of existing hardware using principal component analysis (PCA). A quasi-two-dimensional cascade analysis code, at the core of a parallel probabilistic analysis framework, was used {{to assess the impact of}} uncertainty on aerodynamic performance of compressor rotor airfoils. Three rotor blades with inlet relative Mach numbers of 0. 82, 0. 90 and 1. 25 were considered. Discrepancies between nominal and mean loss (mean-shift) of up to 20 % were observed. Loss and turning variability were found to grow linearly with geometric noise amplitude. A probabilistic, gradient-based approach to compressor blade optimization was presented. Probabilistic objectives, constraints and gradients are approximated using low-resolution Monte Carlo sampling. Test airfoils were optimized both deterministically and probabilistically and then analyzed probabilistically to account for geometric variability. Probabilistically redesigned airfoils exhibited reductions in mean loss of up to 25 % and in loss variability of as much as 65 % from corresponding values for deterministically redesigned airfoils. (cont.) A probabilistic mean-line multi-stage axial compressor model was used to estimate the impact of geometric variability on overall compressor performance. Probabilistic loss and turning models were exercised on a six-stage compressor model. At realistic levels of geometric variability, the mean <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> was found to be upwards of 1 % lower than nominal. Compressor simulations using airfoils redesigned probabilistically for minimum loss variability exhibited reductions of 30 to 40 % in <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> variability and mean shift. by Victor E.

40|$|A {{compressor}} {{optimization study}} defined a 10 stage configuration with a 22. 6 : 1 pressure ratio, an adiabatic efficiency goal of 86. 1 %, and a <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 90. 6 %; the corrected airflow is 53. 5 kg/s. Subsequent component testing included three full scale tests: a six stage rig test, a 10 stage rig test, and another 10 stage rig test {{completed in the}} second quarter of 1982. Information from these tests is used to select the configuration for a core engine test and an integrated core/low spool test. The test results will also provide data base for the flight propulsion system. The results of the test series with both aerodynamic and mechanical performance of each compressor build are presented. The second 10 stage compressor adiabatic efficiency was 0. 848 at a cruise operating point versus a test goal of 0. 846...|$|E
40|$|Water as a {{refrigerant}} (R 718) {{is compared}} with other modern refrigerants (R 717, R 290 R 134 a, R 12, R 22, and R 152 a) regarding refrigeration capacity and COP (coefficient of performance). A computer program simulating a theoretical vapor compression refrigeration cycle was developed to calculate COPs, compression ratios, and discharge temperatures of the refrigerants from the compressor. The effects of temperature lift, which is the temperature difference between condenser and evaporator, and <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> are also investigated. It is shown that for evaporator temperatures above 20 ˚C and small temperature lifts (5 K), R 718 gives the highest COP, assuming exactly the same cycle parameters. For medium temperature lifts (20 … 25 K), this evaporator temperature is above 35 ˚C, whereas for even greater temperature lifts it decreases again. Furthermore this evaporator temperature at which R 718 gives a greater COP than the other refrigerants decreases with increasing values of polytropic efficienc...|$|E
40|$|Cooling in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be cool down, which {{is known as the}} shell cooling. This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other cooling methods. Cooling can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the back plate. This paper focuses on seeking the most effective cooling place to increase the performance and reduce the impeller temperature. It is found that shroud cooling improves the compressor performance the most. Shroud cooling with 2400 W of cooling power increases the pressure ratio by 4. 6 % and efficiency by 1. 49 %. Each 500 W increase in the shroud cooling power, increases the efficiency by 0. 3 %. Diffuser cooling and back plate cooling have an identical effect on the <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However, back plate cooling increases the pressure ratio more than diffuser cooling. Furthermore, only back plate cooling reduces the impeller temperature, and with 2400 W of cooling power, the impeller temperature reduces by 45 K...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Industrial centrifugal air compressors can require {{a combination of a}} large range of mass flow, high efficiency, constant pressure ratio, and constant rotational speed, specifically when used for sewage effluent aeration treatment. In order to achieve this performance it is common to use variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV's). The performance characteristics of an existing VIGV design have been determined using both an experimental test facility and state of art numerical techniques. The results obtained from these techniques are far more comprehensive than earlier fullscale performance testing. Validation of the performance of the existing design using these techniques has {{led to the development of}} a new vane design and potential improvements to the inlet ducting geometry. The aerodynamic interaction between the VIGV system and the centrifugal compressor impeller has also been investigated using a 3 -D computational model of the complete variable geometry compressor stage. The results of these investigations have been validated by data available from full scale experimental testing. Strong correlation was obtained between numerical and experimental techniques, and a predicted improvement in <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> up to 3...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{the use of}} gas {{turbines}} in power generation cycles has been growing. Small size, easy installation, high power-to-mass ratio {{and the ability to}} load and unload the cycle quickly are the advantages of such systems. Low efficiency is considered as one of the major disadvantages of such power plants. Thus providing a way to increase cycle efficiency can be very effective in making the cycle more efficient and thus saving fuel consumed in such systems. In this paper the thermal efficiency of the cycle is introduced through describing the mechanism of gas turbine in power generation cycle. Then we will examine the factors affecting the efficiency of the cycle and finally practical solutions such as increasing the inlet temperature, recovery, internal cooling of the compressor and heat recovery for increasing efficiency will be explained. Evaluating the <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of cycles shows that increasing the inlet gas temperature has little effect on turbine efficiency and is limited at high levels of η poly. Water or steam injection into the {{gas turbines}} will not only lead to increased efficiency of the cycle, but also increases the flexibility of the turbine, too. </p...|$|E
40|$|Current design {{improvements}} of {{both the}} rotating and stationary aerodynamic components of centrifugal compressors can greatly increase the efficiency of vintage machines. A centrifugal compressor built in the 1970 's or 1980 's might have an external <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the high 70 's, whereas a newer compressor might have an efficiency over 85 percent. Centrifugal compressors are designed to operate at a best efficiency point (BEP) shown on its performance map. Whether a centrifugal compressor is operating at its BEP, near choke, near the surge point, or in recycle, the operator {{may be able to}} significantly reduce the total energy consumption by rerating the installed machine with new, higher efficiency aero components. Whether the compressor is driven by an electric motor, steam turbine or gas turbine, costs for operating these drivers is ever increasing and how much it may go up in the future is uncertain. With a greater worldwide focus on protecting the environment by reducing greenhouse gases, improving the efficiency of an installed centrifugal compressor by rerating {{can go a long way}} toward that goal. This paper will explain the reasons for rerating a compressor and provide details of the rerate process...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{development and}} implementation of an on-line performance monitoring system of a natural gas compressor unit. The system can be used to monitor and evaluate the operation and performance of a gas compressor. The system was built for the use of natural gas network operators and maintenance personnel of Gasum Oy in Finland. This paper focuses on how the reference values of a compressor performance can be obtained if reference is not available. A short overview is made also to the capacity loss due to the gas compressor degradation, compressor operating map and their normalization due to changing process conditions. History data of pressure-, temperature-, and rotational speed measurements of the gas turbine’s axial compressor were collected in order to create the reference value for performance estimation. The monitoring system has to produce reference or expected values of the prime performance parameters in order to reliably evaluate the performance and condition of the compressor. The reference value in this case is the <b>polytropic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the axial compressor calculated from the history data using a fuzzy cluster model. This paper explains the main principles of how fuzzy cluster model can be built for performance reference value calculation. This method can be used for many types of compressors an...|$|E
