5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil {{because he does not}} play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E

5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning <b>pain)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E

5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. To hide from the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{investigated}} the changes in pressure <b>pain</b> threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper trapezius, leva-tor scapular, and rhomboid muscles during continuous computer work. [Subjects] Fourteen males and females aged 26 – 32 years, were recruited. [Methods] A dolorimeter pressure algometer {{was used to measure}} <b>the</b> pressure <b>pain</b> threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper trapezius, levator scapular, and rhomboid muscles, respectively, before computer work and after 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min of computer work. [Results] <b>The</b> pressure <b>pain</b> threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper trapezius was significantly decreased after 15 min or more <b>of</b> computer work. <b>The</b> pressure <b>pain</b> threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> levator scapular was significantly decreased after computer work for 30 min and 60 min. <b>The</b> pressure <b>pain</b> threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhomboid muscle was significantly decreased after 60 min of computer work. [Conclusion] Continuous computer work could produce much more pain in the levator scapular and rhomboid muscle than the upper trapezius...|$|R

25|$|Lateral {{internal}} sphincterotomy (LIS) is {{the surgical}} procedure {{of choice for}} anal fissures due to its simplicity and its high success rate (~95%). In this procedure the internal anal sphincter is partially divided {{in order to reduce}} spasming and thus improve the blood supply to the perianal area. This improvement in the blood supply helps to heal the fissure, and the weakening of the sphincter is also believed to reduce the potential for recurrence. The procedure is generally performed as a day surgery after the patient is given general anesthesia. The pain from the sphincterotomy is usually mild and is often less than the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fissure itself. Patients often return to normal activity within one week.|$|E
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights {{groups such as the}} ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E
25|$|Celtic met Portuguese side Boavista in the semi-final. Boavista {{took the}} {{advantage}} on away goals after a 1–1 {{draw in the}} first leg, in which Larsson scored the equaliser after missing a penalty. In the second leg, Larsson struck for Celtic after a one-two with John Hartson with only ten minutes remaining. The goal sent Celtic through to their first European final since 1970. The final in Seville against Porto saw Larsson equalise twice for Celtic with two headers, although the Scottish club eventually lost 3–2 after extra time. Larsson also finished runner-up to Porto's Derlei in the competition's goalscoring charts. Larsson described the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defeat as being the worst moment of his career, including his leg break, which he suffered against Lyon, when challenging for the ball against Serge Blanc in 1999. More disappointment followed, as Celtic finished up runners-up to Rangers {{on the last day}} of the SPL season, by only a single goal on goal difference. 2003 also saw Larsson voted as the Greatest Swedish Footballer of the Last 50 Years as part of the UEFA Jubilee Awards. He also finished the season again the top SPL goalscorer with 28 goals from 35 games.|$|E

25|$|A month later, Forrest {{was back}} in action at the Battle of Shiloh (April 6–7, 1862). He {{commanded}} a Confederate rear guard after the Union victory. In the battle of Fallen Timbers, he drove through the Union skirmish line. Not realizing {{that the rest of}} his men had halted their charge when reaching the full Union brigade, Forrest charged the brigade single-handedly, and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of Union soldiers and pulled out his saber, hacking and slashing. A Union infantryman on the ground beside him fired a musket ball into Forrest's spine with a point-blank musket shot, nearly knocking him out of the saddle. The ball went through his pelvis and lodged near his spine. Steadying himself and his mount, he used one arm to lift the Union soldier by the shirt collar and then wielded him as a human shield before casting his body aside after he had found his way to safety. Forrest is acknowledged to have been the last man wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Forrest galloped back to his incredulous troopers. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later, without anesthesia, which was unavailable. Forrest would likely have been given a generous dose of alcohol to muffle the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surgery.|$|E
25|$|Business {{enterprises}} contributed 59.1 % of US GERD in 2012, {{down from}} 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute {{a small fraction}} of total R, 3.3% and 3.8% respectively. The USA has historically been a leader in business R and innovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R largely maintained their commitments, the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the US Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business ‘deaths’ began overtaking the number of business ‘births’ and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R spending were in agriculture production: -3.5% compared to the average R to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.|$|E
