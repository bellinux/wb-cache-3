To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E
25|$|Applied {{similarly}} to the parabolic reflector, the slotted waveguide is moved mechanically to scan and is particularly suitable for non-tracking surface scan systems, where the vertical pattern may remain constant.

25|$|The {{operating}} principle of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is that a}} point source of radio waves at the focal point {{in front of a}} paraboloidal reflector of conductive material will be reflected into a collimated plane wave beam along the axis of the reflector.

25|$|A <b>{{parabolic}}</b> <b>antenna</b> is {{an antenna}} {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E

It has a 3-meter <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> that can be directed in azimuth and elevation, an LNA that covers the 1420MHz spectrum, a receiver to reproduce the wideband audio, and a standard personal computer as the control device and for deploying the detection algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Airborne Interception radar, Mark VIII, or AI Mk. VIII for short, was {{the first}} {{operational}} microwave-frequency air-to-air radar. It was used by Royal Air Force night fighters from late 1941 {{until the end of}} World War II. The basic concept, using a moving <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> to search for targets and track them accurately, remained in use by most airborne radars well into the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{other large}} use of <b>parabolic</b> <b>antennas</b> is for radar antennas, {{in which there}} is a need to {{transmit}} a narrow beam of radio waves to locate objects like ships, airplanes, and guided missiles, and often for weather detection.

25|$|A {{parabolic}} microphone uses a {{parabolic reflector}} {{to collect and}} focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, {{in much the same}} way that a <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.|$|E
25|$|The DRS {{undertook}} {{terrestrial broadcasting}} for large cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages. However, {{it did not}} provide for small towns where the TV set density was {{higher than in the}} villages while not as much as in a city. The concept of a low-power limited rebroadcast (LRB) TV transmitter system was evolved to overcome such situations. The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a 4.5m chicken-mesh <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> with a low-noise block converter, that served as the front-end for a low-power TV transmitter at the same location. Two suitable locations, Sambalpur in Orissa (75 villages) and Muzaffarpur in Bihar (110 villages), were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems. This experiment was expected to provide useful data on the trade-off between DRS and LRB. However, due to financial constraints, these two LRBs had to be shelved, and instead an LRB was set up at SHAR, Sriharikota.|$|E

Then in September 1941, the {{rectangular}} Mk 4 Fire-control radar antenna was mounted on top. Soon aircraft flew faster, and in c1944 to increase speed and accuracy the Mk 4 was replaced by a combination of the Mk 12 (rectangular antenna) and Mk 22 (<b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna)</b> radars.

The Würzburg radar device consisted of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>antenna</b> about [...] in diameter, which worked in conjunction with Freya to locate British bombers and then direct Luftwaffe night fighters to attack them. The two systems complemented each other: Freya was a long-range early-warning radar system, but lacked precision, whereas Würzburg had a much shorter range but was far more precise. Würzburg also had the advantage of being much smaller than the Freya system and easier to manufacture in the quantities needed by the Luftwaffe to defend German territory.|$|E

There is also usually a backlobe, in the opposite direction to the main lobe, due to the spillover radiation from the feed antenna that misses the reflector.|$|R
