However, control or even prediction of <b>powder</b> <b>performances</b> is a well known difficult task. The difficulties are essentially caused by the heterogeneous nature of the particle assembly reflected in the broad distribution of their sizes, shapes and structures. To achieve a better predicability and ultimate control of particle performances, many research efforts have recently been directed towards the production of particles with controlled attributes, i. e. structured particles with a very narrow size distribution, or structured monodisperse "designer" particles.

However, surface induced denaturation of bio-molecules during atomization and subsequent drying can be substantial and it is therefore important to develop new formulation concept for concurrent encapsulation and stabilization of proteins during spray drying. Hence, with an overall objective to increase the knowledge of the formation of particulate systems for systemic administration of proteins by spray drying, {{the first part of this}} thesis, systematically investigated the particle formation by droplet size and particle size measurements. It was described how specific properties, such as the solubility and the crystallization propensity of the solute, can affect the product, e. g. the particle size, internal structures, and possibly particle density. A new method using atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the assessment of the effective particle density of individual spray-dried particles was demonstrated. In the second part, two different formulation concepts for encapsulation of protein during spray drying were developed. Both systems used non-ionic polymers for competitive adsorption and displacement of protein from the air/water interface during spray drying. The aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and dextran, and the surface-active polymers, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and triblock co-polymer (poloxamer 188) used for in situ coating, proved efficient in encapsulation of a model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). Inclusion of polymeric materials in a carbohydrate matrix also influenced several particle properties, such as the particle shape and the surface morphology, and was caused by changes in the chemical composition of the particle surface and possibly the surface rheology.

Melting is done by selectively scanning the cross-sections of the part one powder layer at a time.

Optimization of powder characteristics ensures products that have good quality and consistency.

Two different powders from each material were studied to determine the differences in their powder characteristics affecting either the {{laser sintering}} process or the quality of the final product. Most of the characterization methods were standard procedures according to ASTM F 3049 – 14 but some additional methods were utilized. Standard test methods used were sampling (ASTM B 215 – 15), size determination (ASTM B 214 – 07 & ASTM B 822 – 10), morphology characterization, chemical composition, flow characteristics (ASTM B 213 – 13 & ASTM B 964 – 09) and density (B 212 – 13, B 417 – 13 & B 527 – 06). Additionally water content of powders was analyzed. Most remarkable differences in the characteristics of the comparable powders were found in particle size distribution (PSD) and particle morphology. There {{were no significant differences in}} the elemental compositions of comparable powders observed. Favorable powder characteristics were wide PSD and spherical and round particle shape especially in large particle size. Unfavorable characteristics were narrow PSD, irregular particle shape, agglomerates, excessive amount of fine particles and lack of fine particles. Wide PSD and high sphericity and roundness of particles improve compactibility and flowability of the powder. On the contrary narrow PSD, irregular particle shape and agglomerates reduce compactibility and flowability. Also excessive amount of fine particles has reducing effect on flowability.

40|$|Fluid flow {{accompanied}} by heat transfer, solidification and interrelated chemical reactions {{play a key}} role during Continuous Casting (CC) of steel. Generation of defects and production issues are a result of the interaction between mould flux, steel grade and casting conditions. These issues are detrimental to both productivity and quality. Thus, the development of reliable numerical models capable of simulating fluid flow coupled to heat transfer and solidification are in high demand to assure product quality and avoid defects. The present work investigates the influence of steel grade, mould powder and casting conditions on process stability by including heat and mass transfer through liquid steel, slag film layers and solidifying shell. The thesis addresses the application of a numerical model capable of coupling the fluid flow, heat transfer and solidification developed by Swerea MEFOS; based on the commercial CFD code FLUENT v 12. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, which is an interface tracking technique, is coupled to the flow model for distinction of the interface between steel and slag. The current methodology not only allows the model to describe the behaviour of molten steel during solidification and casting but also makes the assessment of mould <b>powders</b> <b>performance</b> possible.   Direct prediction of lubrication efficiency, which is demonstrated by solid-liquid slag film thickness and powder consumption, {{is one of the most}} significant advantages of this model. This prediction is a direct result of the interaction between metal/slag flow, solidification and heat transfer under the influence of mould oscillation and transient conditions.   This study describes the implementation of the model to analyse several steel and mould powder combinations. This led to detection of a combination suffering from quality problems (High Carbon Steel + High Break Temperature Powder) and one, which provides the most stable casting conditions (Low Carbon Steel + Low Break Temperature Powder).   Results indicate the importance of steel pouring temperature, mould powder break temperature and also solidification range on the lubrication efficiency and shell formation. Simulations illustrate that Low Carbon Steel + Low Break Temperature Powder delivers the best lubrication efficiency and thickest formed shell. In contrast, High Carbon Steel + High Break Temperature Powder conveys the minimum lubrication efficiency. Therefore, it was concluded that due to absence of proper powder consumption and solidification rate the latter combination is susceptible to production defects such as stickers and breakouts during the casting sequence...|$|R

The clay mineral was used as a cement replacement. The material was tested at industrial scale. The test results indicated relationships between halloysite chemical properties and the properties of the ready-made product. The most important properties of the mineral from the kaolinite group include high specific surface area and chemical composition. Physical and mechanical properties were tested in terms of bulk density, porosity, thermal conductivity and compressive strength of the finished product. In addition, the testing programme included determining the influence of halloysite on the phase composition and microstructure of the aerated concrete, using the XRD analysis and SEM imaging...|$|R
