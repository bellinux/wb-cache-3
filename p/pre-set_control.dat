40|$|Key words: robot; heavy {{handling}}; S 3 C 44 B 0 X; {{light sensors}} Abstract. Heavy handling robot can transport goods automatically from the origin to the destination along the guide wire. During the operating process, light sensors are firstly employed {{to detect the}} robot’s relative position of guide wire, the test data can be brought in microprocessor S 3 C 44 B 0 X to be saved, analyzed, and processed, and then, according {{to the results of}} the information processing and the <b>pre-set</b> <b>control</b> algorithm, the system gives off the corresponding instruction and guides the robot along a pre-drawn line running smoothly to achieve the purpose of carrying the goods automatically. Heavy handling robot can be widely applied as an intelligent vehicle to workshop, factory, dock and other places...|$|E
40|$|Conventional HVAC {{control systems}} are usually incognizant of the {{physical}} structures and materials of buildings. These systems merely follow <b>pre-set</b> HVAC <b>control</b> logic based on abstract building thermal response models, which are rough approximations to true physical models, ignoring dynamic spatial variations in built environments. To enable more accurate and responsive HVAC control, this paper introduces the notion of self-aware smart buildings, such that buildings are able to explicitly construct physical models of themselves (e. g., incorporating building structures and materials, and thermal flow dynamics). The {{question is how to}} enable self-aware buildings that automatically acquire dynamic knowledge of themselves. This paper presents a novel approach using augmented reality. The extensive user-environment interactions in augmented reality not only can provide intuitive user interfaces for building systems, but also can capture the physical structures and possibly materials of buildings accurately to enable real-time building simulation and control. This paper presents a building system prototype incorporating augmented reality, and discusses its applications...|$|R
40|$|The Wheelchair Mounted Robotic Arm (WMRA) is {{a device}} {{designed}} to help people with disabilities complete their activities of daily living. The goal of this project is to choose and create hardware and software for two new interfaces to work with existing control software written for the WMRA. An eye gaze system and a voice control system were chosen because they will expand current interface choices to benefit {{the greatest number of}} people with disabilities, and will be able to control all the joints on the robotic arm and the wheelchair. The eye gaze interface system will consist of a webcam to track the user 2 ̆ 7 s eye, and software written with the open source image processing library OpenCV. The eye position will be used to control a mouse cursor for interfacing with an existing computer touch screen command system. The voice control system will use a microphone and the open source speech recognition engine 2 ̆ 2 Julius 2 ̆ 2 to map the user’s voice input to <b>pre-set</b> commands to <b>control</b> the WMRA. The completed interfaces will be tested by human subjects on three activities of daily living and data will be collected on the effectiveness and difficulties encountered during their use...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle control may be {{considered}} as a hierarchically structured set of functions. Plan conception and plan selection activities are performed in the navigation function, verification and adjustment of the short-term voyage progress are performed in the guidance function, and typical closed-loop control activities are performed in the control function. Supervisory control of vehicles deals with automated vehicle control functions to a large extent. Nowadays, technology permits the typical control functions to be entirely executed by automated systems, while the navigation and guidance functions are still partially automated. The operator, who may observe the controlled process directly, acts as a manager who supervises the system and only interacts with the automperforming corrective actions. The human operator remains the primary responsible factor, specifying the constraints, and procedures in terms of setpoint changes for the automated system. It is known, however, that humans have certain limitations in supervising capabilities, particularly when slowly responding systems are concerned. Humans are not always able to anticipate, that is, to mentally predict future state information by applying knowledge of the goals, process characteristics and disturbances that act on the system, considering the current control actions and the observed changes in process state. Literature on human performance models indicates that accurate vehicle control mainly depends on the operator's knowledge of the controlled process characteristics and the route to be followed, on the ability to predict the future states of the controlled process, and on the quality of track planning and track following activities. A technical system g behaviour should provide information that addresses these elements. The current study focusses on the question what type of information is required to obtain accurate supervisory vehicle control. Five experiments were conducted in a man-in-the-loop simulator facility, where participating subjects were required to perform specific aircraft and ship control tasks, in routine and in non-routine task conditions, using different information systems. Task performance was measured and analysed with respect to accuracy of guidance and quality of navigation. The need of three information elements for accurate supervisory control was investigated: · preview information that enables immediate perception of the planned route, and assessment of future position error relative to that route · path prediction information, showing the predicted track ahead · capability prediction information, showing the predicted consequences of a range of process control actions with respect to the process states reaching their predetermined safety margins, thus indicating the boundaries of safe operation. The results of the experiments indicate that accurate supervisory vehicle control is obtained when information is provided containing the following complementary elements: · Capability prediction information, needed to support the navigator in the navigation function (knowledge-based behaviour), where non-routine task conditions occur. Capability prediction aids the mental process of generating alternative solutions for a problem situation. These alternatives are presented as an advise to the navigator. Knowledge of the safety margins allows navigators to properly re-plan the route by selecting the safest alternative. · Preview and path prediction information, needed to support accurate guidance along that alternative route (rule-based behaviour). During guidance, only routine task conditions exist. Navigators first roughly <b>pre-set</b> their <b>controls</b> based on preview and rules-of-thumb for creview and rules-of-thumb for control, then perform corrective setpoint control actions based on error information provided by the path predictor. It is suggested to apply {{the findings of this study}} for the guidance and navigation of high-speed craft. Because continuous observation of the outside world and of the controlled process state is required, it is advised to show prediction information as an overlay, superimposed over the external world scene, thus indicating where safe areas of navigation are located. The present study focussed on anticipation behaviour in guidance and control functions with a limited time horizon, for example, 5 to 10 times the time constant of the controlled process. Many navigation functions exist that encompass larger time horizons. In that case, more factors affect the controlled variables, requiring more knowledge based support. Additional research is needed to assess these longer term support systems more objectively. It is recommended to improve technology for prediction. For exaiction. For example, an extrapo-lator is relatively simple to implement because extrapolators operate on the basis of a limited quantity of sampled data. In practice, however, it is questionable whether sensors are capable to provide signals with sufficient stability and accuracy...|$|R
