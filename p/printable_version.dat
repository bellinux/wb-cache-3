40|$|Neurons {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of shapes and sizes. In a quest to {{understand}} this neuronal diversity, researchers have three-dimensionally traced tens of thousands of neurons; many of these tracings are freely available through online repositories like NeuroMorpho. Org and ModelDB. Tracings can be visualized on the computer screen, used for statistical analysis of the properties of different cell types, used to simulate neuronal behavior, and more. We introduce the use of 3 D printing as a technique for visualizing traced morphologies. Our method for generating <b>printable</b> <b>versions</b> of a cell or group of cells is to expand dendrite and axon diameters and then to transform the wireframe tracing into a 3 D object with a neuronal surface generating algorithm like Constructive Tessellated Neuronal Geometry (CTNG). We show that 3 D printed cells can be readily examined, manipulated, and compared with other neurons to gain insight into both the biology and the reconstruction process. We share our printable models in a new database, 3 DModelDB, and encourage others to do the same with cells that they generate using our code or other methods. To provide additional context, 3 DModelDB provides a simulatable version of each cell, links to papers that use or describe it, and links to associated entries in other databases...|$|R
40|$|Background: Currently, {{there is}} a paucity of data {{concerning}} the long-term outcomes, educational placement {{and quality of life}} of children implanted with hearing devices from large and representative samples of the population. To address this concern, a large, prospective, multicentre, multinational patient-outcomes registry for paediatric recipients of implantable hearing devices was developed. The benefits of this registry, its approach and methodology are described. Methods/Design: The Cochlear ™ Paediatric Implanted Recipient Observational Study (Cochlear P-IROS) is a prospective international patient-outcomes registry for children who are implanted in routine clinical practice with one or more hearing devices. The study aims to collect data on patient comorbidities, device use, auditory performance, quality of life and health-related utilities, across different types of implantable hearing devices from a range of manufacturers. Patients will be evaluated with a set of standardised and non-standardised questionnaires prior to initial device activation (baseline) and at six-monthly follow-up intervals up to 24 months and annually thereafter. The Cochlear P-IROS utilises a secure web interface to administer electronic case report forms to clinicians and families of implanted children. The web interface is currently available in five languages: English, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Russian. The interface also provides <b>printable</b> <b>versions</b> of the case report forms translate...|$|R

40|$|A {{year has}} passed with our {{newsletter}} published only in electronic version. As a newsletter editor, I watch closely format {{of different kinds}} of newsletter publications within IEEE and outside. I also watch the discussion regarding which formats are convenient for readers. There are five primary kinds of publications: traditional printed, <b>printable</b> electronic <b>version</b> available on a Web site, non-easy-printable version on a Web site, News portal with database-based content management, and distributed by e-mail, usually in a reduced HTML (Web) format. My definition of “printable ” was “it is reasonably easy to print the whole newsletter or at least its part (part in sense of a department) without browsing through multiple pages and clicking print multiple times. Our newsletter evolved from traditional printed <b>version</b> to <b>printable</b> electronic <b>version</b> with an HTML excerpt send to subscribers by email when the next issue of the newsletter is ready on the Web site. During the transition, first a non-printable version was added in 1997, followed by e-mail notification added in 2000. In 2002, the Web-based version was changed to PDF-based printable as the printing and hard copy distribution was suspended. The electronic version, however, opened possibility to publish more and colorful graphics. That yielded making the file size manageable soon started to be challenging. The solution for now is to publish two versions, one low-byte/low-fat with significantly reduced quality of graphics (400 - 600 kB), and another one large but with full printing house quality (2 - 3 MB). The current PDFbased version lacks flexibility that would allow reader to jump immediately to any page by clicking a link in the excerpt that is sent by email. We will work on that...|$|R

40|$|A common but {{challenging}} language revitalization scenario {{features a}} language with no fluent speakers, {{and a body}} of recordings of the last fluent speakers. Fortunately, electronic tools are increasingly available to create resources that will give community members access to the sound recordings that are critical for revitalization. But how should such resources be structured? Community members may have different goals for reclaiming and revitalizing the language. Some seek only to know key words for cultural terms, or everyday expressions they can share with friends. Others want to hear recordings of stories, with accessible translations. Finally, some are energized {{to make a commitment}} to learning and then teaching the language. Ideally, an on-line resource featuring edited recordings could support all of these goals. Using a corpus of soundfiles of Northern Pomo, a dormant language of California, we are constructing a set of on-line resources designed to support many learner goals. After consultations with Tribal Historic Preservation Officers of three Rancherias, teachers at a Rancheria Head Start program, and other community members, we constructed a set of materials containing the following components, available on mobile devices: an introductory language app, and a website containing pages addressing Sounds and Letters, Everyday Expressions, Talking Dictionary, Phrasicon, Basic Sentence Structures, and Stories and Texts. Sounds and Letters contains a matrix of all phonemes with soundfiles for each. Tabs to Consonant and Vowel pages provide brief videos comparing and contrasting Northern Pomo sounds, designed to introduce the learner to unfamiliar sounds and letter symbols. The Everyday Expressions page contains 90 -second videos teaching common phrases and sentences. The videos break down these examples in order to provide non-technical introductions to basic vocabulary, morphology, and syntax, while encouraging the learner to repeat the phrases. The Talking Dictionary and Phrasicon are connected, so that clicking a link in a dictionary entry brings the learner to a page of phrases and sentences containing that lexical item. The Stories and Texts page contains videos with spoken texts and written translations, and <b>printable</b> <b>versions</b> of text plus translation. We will describe and provide a rationale for each component, along with some of the basic design choices that we think will make it useful for learners with different goals. (A companion abstract concerns making templates and codes available to those wishing to construct a similar tool for other languages.) Finally, we hope to present responses to the tool from community members...|$|R
40|$|A modern {{approach}} for generating individualized web-sites is {{to compose a}} page out of individual elements, for instance XML-fragments, which is eventually transformed to. If the generated pages differ for each user, then the required transformation processes put a heavy load on the server, hence slowing down response times significantly. The learning environment ACTIVEMATH uses this composing approach to generate learning courses that suit best the needs and goals of the individual learner. For instance, depending on their current knowledge, different users that learn the same content get presented courses that differ in length and in amount and difficulty of exercises and examples. Currently, the learning materials are transformed in one step from XML to (or other output formats). The learning materials are encoded in a language called OMDoc which encodes semantically the fragments {{as well as the}} mathematical formulae. This article hence provides an approach to the answer ``How can Semantic Web technology be used to improve adaptation and information retrieval?''. Moreover the ability to generate multiple output formats from the same content source is a central requirement of the architecture. It provides a first step towards device adaptation providing, currently, an on-screen <b>version</b> and a <b>printable</b> PDF <b>version.</b> This article describes the architecture we developed to solve the performance problems that arouse out of the page generation process. In this architecture, the generation process is divided into several layers, with each layer adding/transforming well-specified data. Among other advantages, this approach allows caching of individual transformed fragments. We hope that in this way the performance problems can be reduced. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} effects of a comptonizing corona on the {{appearance}} of the reflection components, and in particular of the reflection hump, in the X-rays spectra of accreting black holes. Indeed, in the framework of a thermal corona model, we expect that part (or even all, depending on the coronal covering factor) of the reflection features should cross the hot plasma, and thus suffer Compton scattering, before being observed. We have studied in detail the dependence of these effects on the physical (i. e. temperature and optical depth) and geometrical (i. e. inclination angle) parameters of the corona, concentrating on the slab geometry. Due to the smoothing and shifting towards high energies of the comptonized reflection hump, the main effects on the emerging spectra appear above 100 keV. We have also investigated the importance of such effects on the interpretation of the results obtained with the standard fitting procedures. We found that fitting Comptonization models, taking into account comptonized reflection, by the usual cut-off power law + uncomptonized reflection model, may lead to an underestimation of the reflection normalization and an overestimation of the high energy cut-off. We discuss and illustrate the importance of these effects by analysing recent observational results as those of the galaxy NGC 4258. We also find that the comptonizing corona can produce and/or emphasize correlations between the reflection features characteristics (like the iron line equivalent width or the covering fraction) and the X-ray spectral index similar to those recently reported in the literature. We also underline the importance of these effects when dealing with accurate spectral fitting of the X-ray background.
