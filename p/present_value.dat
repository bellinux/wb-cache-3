5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net <b>present</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing the <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments {{would result in the}} Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the <b>present</b> <b>value.</b> This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{appropriate}} approach to calculating accrual equivalent marginal tax rates for nonaccrual taxes on personal financial investments is the relative-reduction-in-the-internal-rate-of-return approach, which equates the <b>present</b> <b>values</b> from the after-tax returns from an investment under an accrual and a nonaccrual tax. Detailed comparisons are made with alternative approaches proposed by Boadway, Bruce, and Mintz (1984) and by King and Fullerton (1984) for the capital gains tax. Both find accrual tax rates that equate the <b>present</b> <b>values</b> of accrual and actual tax revenues. Fundamental problems are found with both alternative approaches. ...|$|R
