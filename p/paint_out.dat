25|$|It seems that, in {{response}} to this new submarine threat, some alterations were made to Lusitania and her operation. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the War Zone, a number of warnings, plus advice, were sent to the ship's commander to help him decide how to best protect his ship against the new threat, and it also seems that her funnels were most likely painted a dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. Clearly, there was no hope of disguising her actual identity, since her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to <b>paint</b> <b>out</b> the ship's name at the prow.|$|E
500|$|The CGI {{removal of}} actor Gary Sinise's legs, after his {{character}} had them amputated, {{was achieved by}} wrapping his legs with a blue fabric, which later facilitated {{the work of the}} [...] "roto-paint" [...] team to <b>paint</b> <b>out</b> his legs from every single frame. At one point, while hoisting himself into his wheelchair, his legs are used for support.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the <b>paint</b> <b>out</b> of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E

2500|$|Before leaving Mexico City, the viceroy {{commissioned}} Cristóbal de Villalpando to do {{a painting}} of the main square of Mexico {{as a kind of}} souvenir of his tenure as viceroy. [...] Villalpando's 1695 painting, View of the Zócalo of Mexico City now in a private collection in the UK, shows a vibrant scene of urban life. Stikingly, however, Villalpando depicts the severe fire damage to the viceregal palace. [...] The viceroy's commissioned painting did not <b>paint</b> <b>out</b> the major riot during his tenure that challenged royal authority.|$|E
2500|$|Hale's friend Clare Boothe Luce, {{an ardent}} admirer of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, almost {{immediately}} commissioned Kahlo {{to paint a}} recuerdo (remembrance) portrait of their deceased mutual friend, so that in Kahlo's words: [...] "her life must not be forgotten". Luce understood a recuerdo to be an idealized memorial portrait and was doubtless expecting a conventional over-the-fireplace portrait for her $400. After being shown in March in Paris, the completed painting arrived in August 1939: Luce claims she was so shocked by the unwrapped painting that she [...] "almost passed out". What Kahlo created was a graphic, narrative retablo, detailing every step of Hale's suicide. It [...] depicts Hale standing on the balcony, falling to her death while also lying on the bloody pavement below. Luce was so offended that she seriously considered destroying it, but instead, she had the sculptor Isamu Noguchi <b>paint</b> <b>out</b> {{the part of the}} legend that bore Luce's name. Luce simply left the work crated up in the care of Frank Crowninshield, only to be presented with it again decades later, when Crowninshield's heirs discovered it in storage. She donated it anonymously to the Phoenix Art Museum, where it was eventually outed as a Luce donation. The museum retains ownership, although the painting is frequently on tour in exhibitions of Kahlo's works.|$|E

60|$|They {{were getting}} {{some of their}} things out to send into the country, and Forsyth had left his work to help his wife look them over and decide which to take and which to leave. The things were mostly trunks that they had stored the fall before; there were some tables and Colonial bureaus {{inherited}} from his mother, and some mirrors and decorative odds and ends, which they would not want in the furnished house they had taken for the summer. There were some canvases which Forsyth said he would <b>paint</b> <b>out</b> and use for other subjects, but which, {{when he came to}} look at again, he found really not so bad. The rest, literally, was nothing but trunks; there were, of course, two or three boxes of books. When they had been packed closely into the five-dollar room, with the tables and bureaus and mirrors and canvases and decorative odds and ends put carefully on top, the Forsyths thought the effect very neat, and laughed at themselves for being proud of it.|$|E
60|$|Is it a {{reply to}} these suggestions, to say, {{society is a}} Pestalozzian school; all are {{teachers}} and pupils in turn. We are equally served by receiving and by imparting. Men who know the same things, are not long the best company for each other. But bring to each an intelligent person of another experience, and {{it is as if}} you let off water from a lake, by cutting a lower basin. It seems a mechanical advantage, and great benefit it is to each speaker, as he can now <b>paint</b> <b>out</b> his thought to himself. We pass very fast, in our personal moods, from dignity to dependence. And if any appear never to assume the chair, but always to stand and serve, it is because we do not see the company in a sufficiently long period for the whole rotation of parts to come about. As to what we call the masses, and common men;--there are no common men. All men are at last of a size; and true art is only possible, on the conviction that every talent has its apotheosis somewhere. Fair play, and an open field, and freshest laurels to all who have won them! But heaven reserves an equal scope for every creature. Each is uneasy until he has produced his private ray unto the concave sphere, and beheld his talent also in its last nobility and exaltation.|$|E
