40|$|A <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test,</b> using sheep {{red blood}} cells sensitised with Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide, was {{compared}} with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in an endemic area. The results obtained on sera from 152 patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid and 183 patients {{who did not have}} typhoid were analysed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and rapidity of the respective tests. The <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> was found to be more sensitive (80 %) than the S typhi O antigen (71 %) but marginally less sensitive than the H antigen (82 %) of the Widal test. The false positive rate on control sera was 1. 2 % and 6. 6 %, respectively, for the Widal O and H antigens, and 1. 6 % for the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test.</b> Our findings indicate that the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> is comparable with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in endemic areas, but is more simple, rapid, and economic. The <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> may be a useful alternative to the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in busy microbiology laboratories in areas in which the disease is endemic...|$|E

40|$|Alterations in the {{functional}} properties of antibodies formed during prolonged immunization with bovine serum albumin and Freund's complete adjuvant were {{indicated by the}} synthesis of non-precipitating antibody and by the increased avidity of the antibody formed {{during the course of}} immunization. Prolonged antigenic stimulation often resulted in decrease in both the level and precipitating efficiency of antibody. The route of immunization did not affect the quality (i. e. avidity, precipitating efficiency) of the antibody produced but did affect the quantity of antibody formed, as indicated by assay of antigen binding or precipitation. <b>Passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>tests</b> failed to disclose significant differences in the response of individual rabbits.

40|$|BALB/c mice were immunized {{with a human}} gamma 2 k paraprotein and hybridomas {{prepared}} by the Kohler & Milstein technique. Ten hybridoma clones producing high levels of antibody competed reacting specificity with the immunogen were isolated. Six of the monoclonal antibodies competed strongly {{with each other for}} sites on the antigen. In reverse <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>tests</b> immunoglobulins reacting with the antibodies were not detectable in normal or pathological sera. Polyclonal antisera to two of the monoclonal antibodies were prepared in rabbits; they were rendered specific by adsorption with Sepharose-normal mouse IgG and tested against the other monoclonal antibodies. A weak cross-reaction of one of the mouse antibodies with the immunogen was observed with one antiserum but none with the other. Furthermore, no repetition of the idiotypes of the two immunogens was observed in polyclonal responses of BALB/c mice immunized with the same paraprotein antigen. These results with monoclonal antibodies confirm those obtained with polyclonal antisera in showing that the antibody response of one species to the private idiotype determinants of an immunoglobulin of another species is highly heterogeneous...|$|R
40|$|Hyperlipidaemia, {{glomerulonephritis}} and IgG λ monoclonal gammopathy {{were found}} to be associated in two patients (Ler. and Lac.). A severe atherosclerosis was also present in the former patient. After a purification–activation procedure active IgG λ was obtained from the serum chylomicra and from the ammonium sulphate-precipitated serum gamma-globulins. In <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>tests,</b> including inhibition tests, the IgG λ Ler. reacted specifically with the protein moiety of human low density lipoproteins (LDL) and the IgG λ Lac. reacted with human, rat and rabbit very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) as well as with human serum albumin (HSA). These IgG λ behaved like autoantibodies though no activity was found in whole serum, in which they are probably blocked by the corresponding antigens. They are very similar, although not identical, to the autoantibodies found in auto-immune hyperlipidaemia (AIH) and it is proposed that in these patients the hyperlipidaemia is a variety of AIH. Finally it is suggested that the hyperlipidaemia associated with glomerulonephritis chiefly in the nephrotic syndrome may sometimes be AIH. If this is the case the renal lesions and the hyperlipidaemia may be different expressions of an immune complex disease which may also lead to other tissue lesions such as atherosclerosis...|$|R

Twenty three selected PHA-positive sera of subjects with bacteriological confirmation of plague were also positive in the DOT-ELISA but only 19 were detected by the conventional ELISA technique. Another group of 186 serum samples from subjects diagnosed as plague-infected by clinical and epidemiological parameters, but PHA-negative, were screened with DOT-ELISA and 11 gave positive results. The specificity of the assays on the serological detection of plague was confirmed in inhibition tests using purified F 1 antigen.

40|$|The passive {{haemagglutination}} and bentonite flocculation tests were compared for detecting plant viruses, using antibody-sensitized tanned red cells or bentonite particles. Parsnip yellow fleck, raspberry ringspot, turnip yellow mosaic, narcissus mosaic, potato X and tobacco rattle viruses were detected by both tests in purified preparations and, where studied, in crude plant extracts. The highest antigen titres were obtained {{only when the}} red cells or bentonite particles were sensitized with optimal amounts of antibody; these had to be found experimentally because they differed between antisera and between the two tests. In comparative experiments the bentonite flocculation and {{passive haemagglutination}} tests were respectively about 2 to 5 and IOO to 125 times more sensitive than tube-precipitin tests for detecting the elongated viruses and about IO to 2 o and 5 oo to 6 oo times more sensitive for detecting the isometric viruses. The minimum concentrations of virus detected were 1. 8 to 2. 6 /,g. /ml. with the bentonite flocculation test and o'o 4 to o' 24 /,g. /ml, with the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test.</b> Red cells treated with formalin before they were tanned and sensitized with antibody could be preserved at- 14 ° for up to 8 weeks without loss of activity. In experiments with turnip yellow mosaic virus, extracts from healthy plants of eight species tested {{had little or no}} effect on either test but concentrated extracts from Chenopodium amaranticolor and Spinacia oleracea plants caused non-specific agglutination of unformalinized red cells, and dilute extracts from Petunia hybrida plants decreased eightfold the sensitivity of the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test.</b> These effects did not occur with formalinized red cells.

Blood samples taken before each of the injections and one taken 7 days after the last injection were examined for immune response to the vaccine and for possible adverse clinical, biochemical and haematological effects. Raised titres of antibody in serum of volunteers given 0 - 5 - 1 - 0 RHD vaccine were shown, often by the seventh day, in <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>tests</b> against all of the 16 serotypes of Ps. aeruginosa represented in the vaccine; serum from volunteers who received 0 - 1 RHD usually showed a reduced antibody titre.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{included the}} examination of tissues for evidence of infection with the human wart virus, and the development and application of serological techniques for demonstrating response to the infection. The majority of specimens were examined by negative staining methods, {{and the presence of}} virus particles and other structures in various types of wart at different stages is reported. Two cases of molluecum oontagiosum of the sole of the foot, previously considered a site rarely if ever infected, were diagnosed. A series of twelve genital wart specimens was studied by thin sectioning and negative staining techniques. Intranuclear virus particles with the morphology of wart virus were found in cells of the stratum granulosum, and the pancity of virus particles in such tissues noted for the first time. Examination of three specimens of bladder papillomata by such methods revealed no evidence of a virus infection. Serological studies included the application of an established precipitin test for antibody to wart virus, and development of complement fixation and <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>tests</b> for this purpose. The specific nature of the antigen involved in these reactions was demonstrated, and the immunoglobulin class of the antibodies concerned determined. These tests were applied to sera from 265 patients with different types of wart, and to sera from 110 people not currently infected with warts. The development of a full immune response with rising titres of antibody and appearance of immunoglobulin G was demonstrated in rabbits immunised with the virus, and in some patients, particularly those with the simple type of plantar wart. The relationship of the appearance of antiviral antibodies to regression of warts, spontaneous or following therapy, was observed and considered to be a result of increased exposure to the virus antigen at that time...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{relatively}} long duration of specific serum plague antibodies in the host, the serological diagnosis of plague has substantial advantages over the conventional method of isolation of the causative agent.

Rats vaccinated with F 1 antigen and rats {{that had been}} infected previously were challenged intranasally with 8. 9 × 104 Y. pestis and subsequently demonstrated similar rates of survival that was zero at titres less than 1 : 128, 86 % at titres of 1 : 128 - 1 : 256, and 100 % at titres of 1 : 512 - 1 : 1024. The significance of titre of F 1 antibody {{as a measure of}} seroimmunity against acute bubonic or pneumonic plague is discussed for rats, monkeys, and man...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{of the relationship}} between the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> and <b>haemagglutination</b> inhibition <b>tests</b> used in serum surveys for specific plague antibodies. Both techniques gave similar titres for sera of albino Rattus norvegicus convalescent from plague infection. They appear to be equally suitable for plague surveillance and control programmes...|$|R
