40|$|The state, {{the family}} and the market are the main pillars of welfare regimes that have {{different}} configurations from one country to another. In Turkey, these mechanisms are under increasing pressure today. The family seems unable to extend protection beyond the nuclear household. In addition to that, support to rural employment and urban housing, deployed through clientele networks, decline. Wage insurance, as a way of accessing the social protection system, is also challenged by the characteristics of the labour market. We argue that the structure of employment is increasingly incompatible with the existing welfare system framework, which is mainly centred on formal workers insurance. In this context, will the current pensions and health reforms lead to a better articulation between employment forms and the social protection system? The first part of the article analyzes the evolution of the labour market since the 1990 s. Recent adjustments of this market take place in the context of structural changes in the regulation of labour relations and of the economic model. The second part of the article examines social protection reforms. We analyse first parametric adjustments in the case of pensions (retirement age, <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> and replacement rates), and secondly, measures adopted to ensure universal access to health care and services. We argue that other forms of insurance and/or assistance might be necessary to increase the scope and depth of coverage. The last section explore three possible transformations of the Turkish welfare regime: increased labour market flexibility, a more important role of private insurance and the scope of social assistance mechanisms.  ...|$|E

By analyzing the cases heard by Federal Court of the 5 th Region, which constitutes the Brazilian states of Pa-raíba, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, Alagoas and Sergipe, fourteen cases were found on appeal of special courts.

3000|$|In {{order to}} compute pension rights it is {{important}} to know which individuals have started contributing to the system before 1967 because the elegibility requirements up to 64 are different as already mentioned in Sect.  2. An important limitation of the data set used is that only a part of the details describing the relations taking place before 1966 are electronically recorded. Hence, the data set is incomplete in terms of the number of social security relations collected at least for those individuals who started contributing to the system before 1966. Pension rights have been calculated as if all individuals had the condition of membership in a labour mutual society before 1967. The reason is that as we focus on individuals born between 1937 and 1945, in ages ranging from 22 to 30 in 1967, all of them had the potential to have contributed to labour mutual funds that preceded the establishment of the social security system. 5 The main consequence of this assumption is that for those individuals who started their real contributory life after 1967, the satisfaction <b>of</b> the minimum <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> before 64 is not sufficient to claim for an old-age pension. 6 [...]...|$|R

40|$|The mapping {{method is}} an {{efficient}} tool to investigate distributive mixing induced by periodic flows. Computed only once, the mapping matrix {{can be applied}} {{a number of times}} to determine the distribution of concentration inside the flow domain. Spectral analysis of the mapping matrix reveals detailed properties of the distributive mixing as all relevant information is stored in its eigenmodes. Any vector that describes a distribution of concentration can be expanded in the complete system of linearly independent eigenvectors of the mapping matrix. The rapid decay <b>of</b> the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> each mode in the eigenmode decomposition allows for a truncation of the eigenmode expansion from the whole spectrum to only the dominant eigenmodes (characterized by a decay rate significantly lower than the duration of the mixing process). This truncated decomposition adequately represents the distribution of concentration inside the flow domain already after a low number <b>of</b> <b>periods,</b> because <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> all non-dominant eigenmodes rapidly become insignificant. The truncation is determined independently of the initial distribution of concentration and based on the decay rates of the eigenmodes, which are inversely proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues. Only modes with eigenvalues above a certain threshold are retained. The key advantage of the proposed compact eigenmode representation of the mapping method is that it includes practically relevant transient states and not just the asymptotic one. As such the method enables an eigenmode analysis of realistic problems yet with a substantial reduction in computational effort compared to the conventional approach...|$|R
