40|$|The current day {{technology}} such as Flow Cytometry is {{only able}} to classify Dendritic Cells (DCs) once they are stained. Subsequently this procedure affects the cell viability for vaccine preparation in DCs immunotherapy. Visually, the DCs classification can be distinguished through their unique morphological feature called tentacles compared to other immune cells, which have more rounded shape. Therefore, this paper proposes two pattern matching approaches based on Geometric and 1 D Fourier Descriptors (FDs) to classify DCs from Phase Contrast Microscopy (<b>PCM)</b> <b>image</b> containing a mix of T-cells and debris. The performance of the developed algorithm is analysed and compared with the manual counting provided by the pathologist.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{quantitative}} determination of key adherent cell culture {{characteristics such as}} confluency, morphology, and cell density {{is necessary for the}} evaluation of experimental outcomes and to provide a suitable basis for the establishment of robust cell culture protocols. Automated processing of images acquired using phase contrast micros-copy (PCM), an imaging modality widely used for the visual inspection of adherent cell cultures, could enable the non-invasive determination of these characteristics. We present an image-processing approach that accurately detects cellular objects in <b>PCM</b> <b>images</b> through a combination of local contrast thresholding and post hoc correction of halo artifacts. The method was thoroughly validated using a variety of cell lines, microscope models and imaging conditions, demon-strating consistently high segmentation performance in al...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the nanoscopic investigation of the three-dimensional surface morphology of the neural growth cones from the snail Helisoma trivolvis, and InN and InGaN semiconductor material systems using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). In {{the analysis of the}} growth cones, the results obtained from AFM experiments have been used to construct a 3 D architecture model for filopodia. The filopodia from B 5 and B 19 neurons have exhibited different tapering mechanisms. The volumetric analysis has been used to estimate free Ca 2 + concentration in the filopodium. The Phase Contrast Microscopy (<b>PCM)</b> <b>images</b> of the growth cones have been corrected to thickness provided by AFM in order to analyze the spatial refractive index variations in the growth cone. AFM experiments have been carried out on InN and InGaN epilayers. Ternary InGaN alloys are promising for device applications tunable from ultraviolet (Eg[GaN]= 3. 4 eV) to near-infrared (Eg [InN]= 0. 7 eV). The real-time optical characteristics and ex-situ material properties of InGaN epilayers have been analyzed and compared to the surface morphological properties in order to investigate the relation between the growth conditions and overall physical properties. The effects of composition, group V/III molar ratio and temperature on the InGaN material characteristics have been studied and the growth of high quality indium-rich InGaN epilayers are demonstrated...|$|R

PCM is an agricultural management system de-signed to target crop Ad. soil inputs according to within-jield requirements to optimize projitability and protect the environment. Progress in PCM has been hampered {{by a lack of}} timely, distributed information on crop and soil conditions. Based on a revieu! of the inf&mation re-quirenlents of PCM, eight areas were identi$ed in which image-based remote sensing technology could provide in-formation that is crcrrently lacking or inadequate. Recorn-mendations were made for applications with potential j) r near-term implementation with available remote sensing technology and instrumentation. We found tllat both air-cra & and satellite-based remote sensing could provide valuable information for <b>PCM</b> applications. <b>Images</b> from aircrft-based SensorS have a unique role for m&oring. seasonally variable crop/soil conditions and for time-spe-ci$c and time-critical crop management; current satellite-based sensor,s have limited, but important, applications; and upcoming commercial Earth observation satellites may provide the resolution, timelinesss, and high quality required for many PCM operations. The current limita-tions for image-bu. ped remote sensing applications are mainly due to Sensor attributes, such as restricted spec-tral range, coarse spatial resolution,,slow turnaround tirw, and inadequate repeat coverage.

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a novel {{two-stage}} Projection Correction Modeling (<b>PCM)</b> framework for <b>image</b> reconstruction from (non-uniform) Fourier measurements. PCM consists of a projection stage (P-stage) motivated by the multi-scale Galerkin method and a correction stage (C-stage) with an edge guided regularity fusing together the advantages of total variation (TV) and total fractional variation (TFV). The P-stage allows for continuous modeling of the underlying image of interest. The given measurements are projected onto a space in which the image is well represented. We then enhance the reconstruction result at the C-stage that minimizes an energy functional consisting of a fidelity in the transformed domain and a novel edge guided regularity. We further develop efficient proximal algorithms to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Various numerical results in both 1 D signals and 2 D images have also been presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-stage method to other classical one-stage methods.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the anatomical changes and associated dosimetric consequences to pharyngeal constrictor muscles (PCMs) that occur during head and neck (H and N) radiotherapy (RT). Materials and Methods: A cohort of 13 oropharyngeal cancer patients with daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was retrospectively studied. On every 5 th CBCT <b>image,</b> <b>PCM</b> was manually delineated by a radiation oncologist. The anterior-posterior PCM thickness was measured at the midline level of C 3 vertebral body. Delivered dose to PCM was estimated by calculating dose on daily images and performing dose accumulation on corresponding planning CT images using a parameter-optimized B-spline-based deformable image registration algorithm. The mean and maximum delivered dose (Dmean, Dmax) to PCM were determined and compared with the corresponding planned quantities. Results: The average (±standard deviation) volume increase (ΔV) and thickness increase (Δt) over the course of 35 total fractions were 54 ± 33 % (11. 9 ± 7. 6 cc) and 63 ± 39 % (2. 9 ± 1. 9 mm), respectively. The resultant cumulative mean dose increase from planned dose to PCM (ΔDmean) was 1. 4 ± 1. 3 % (0. 9 ± 0. 8 Gy), while the maximum dose increase (ΔDmax) was 0. 0 ± 1. 6 % (0. 0 ± 1. 1 Gy). Patients who underwent adaptive replanning (n = 6) showed a smaller mean dose increase than those without (n = 7); 0. 5 ± 0. 2 % (0. 3 ± 0. 1 Gy) versus 2. 2 ± 1. 4 % (1. 4 ± 0. 9 Gy). There were statistically significant (P = 0. 001) strong correlations between ΔDmean and Δt (Pearson coefficient r = 0. 78), as well as between ΔDmean and ΔV (r = 0. 52). Conclusion: The patients underwent considerable anatomical changes to PCM during H and N RT. However, the resultant increase in dose to PCM was minor to moderate. PCM thickness measured at C 3 level is a good predictor for the mean dose increase to PCM...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Articular {{cartilage}} chondrocytes are solely {{responsible for}} the synthesis, assembly, and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and yet occupy < 10 % of the cartilage tissue volume. Chondrocytes (equilibrium modulus, E ~ 0. 3 - 4 kPa) develop a micrometer-thick pericellular matrix (PCM) in vivo and in vitro which is softer (equilibrium modulus, E ~ 40 ~ 70 kPa) than the surrounding mature ECM (E ~ 0. 5 MPa). PCM is a jim-thick hydrated, porous macromolecular region surrounding chondrocytes, being rich in fibronectin, proteoglycans (e. g., aggrecan, hyaluronan, and decorin) and collagen (types II, VI, and IX); PCM is primarily defined {{by the presence of}} type VI collagen as compared to ECM. Since PCM transfers loads from the ECM to the cell during physiological compression, it is important to cell signaling and mechanotransduction. The structure of chondron, single chondrocyte and surrounding region of <b>PCM,</b> is recently <b>imaged</b> with respect to the temporal evolution. One promising approach to cartilage tissue engineering is embedding chondrocytes in synthetic scaffolds and exposing to various growth factors and mechanical loads to facilitate ECM synthesis and suppress catabolic degradation of ECM macromolecules. Chondrocytes are capable of developing a cell-associated matrix in vitro when seeded in 3 -D hydrogel scaffold with similar cell division rate, as compared to isolated chondrons. However, the morphology of pericellular halo from cultured chondrocytes are distinctively different from that of isolated chondrons and mature cartilage, reflecting the disparity in the gene expression of cartilage-related genes between the tissue-engineered constructs and native cartilage (9). Despite of these deficiencies, the use of chondrocytes can be beneficial to accomplish the cell expansion, cell manipulation, a higher cell yield per volume of tissue with ease, as compared to the use of chondron. With this regards, the understanding of mechanics at cellular level in articular cartilage may provide a better picture of the composition-structure-function relations linked to the growth/remodeling activity of articular cartilage in order to achieve the mechanically functional cartilage tissue engineered constructs. While the biomechanical testing of the macroscopic tissue would give an overall outcome of multiple interactions involved, the biomechanical study at cellular level might better examine the consequences of such interactions in a more focused manner. by BoBae Lee.
