40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{dataflow}} architecture called DFNET (DataFlow architecture on the interNET), which realizes a scalable dynamic dataflow computer on a <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> <b>network.</b> A {{vast amount of}} research on dataflow computers has been extensively performed during, in particular, 1970 s and 1980 s as a promising approach for realizing very high-speed computers. In spite of {{the large amount of}} expectations, success of dataflow computer re-searches is quite limited. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the concept of a scalable and extensible dataflow architecture on a <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> <b>network,</b> which utilizes the abundant resources of a large-scale computer network. In this paper, we introduce the concept of DFNET (DataFlow architecture on the in-terNET). DFNET is composed of configuration and control methodologies of routers in a <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> <b>network.</b> The key of DFNET is that a packet switch-ing network is utilized not for end-to-end communication but for dataflow com-puting. Because of desirable properties of a <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> <b>network,</b> DFNET has high scalability in terms of the dataflow program size and high robustness against failures. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} new simulation and analytic models for the performance analysis of wide area communication networks. The models are used to analyse adaptive routing and flow control in fully connected circuit switched and sparsely connected <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> <b>networks.</b> In particular the performance of routing algorithms derived from the L(_R-I) linear learning automata model are assessed for both types of network. A novel architecture using the INMOS Transputer is constructed for simulation of both circuit and <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> <b>networks</b> in a loosely coupled multi- microprocessor environment. The network topology is mapped onto an identically configured array of processing centres to overcome the processing bottleneck of conventional Von Neumann architecture machines. Previous analytic work in circuit switched work is extended to include both asymmetrical networks and adaptive routing policies. In the analysis of <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> <b>networks</b> analytic models of adaptive routing and flow control are integrated to produce a powerful, integrated environment for performance analysis The work concludes that routing algorithms based on linear learning automata have significant potential in both fully connected circuit <b>switched</b> <b>networks</b> and sparsely connected <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
