Chironomus riparius exhibited bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for AHTN and HHCB substantially lower than predicted for nontransformed organics. The BCFs for both chemicals increased after coexposure of the organism to the cytochrome P 450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide. Thus, the low BCF values were the result of rapid biotransformation of AHTN and HHCB in the midge larvae. Bioconcentration kinetics indicated that both chemicals induced their own cytochrome P 450 -mediated metabolism. Acute toxicity of AHTN to midge larvae was reduced compared to predicted baseline toxicity and was similar for HHCB.

40|$|This {{work was}} focused on the {{determination}} of musk compounds in various components of the environment. Synthetic musk compounds are organic substances commonly used as fragrant constituents of detergents, perfumes, cosmetics and other personal care products (PCPs). These compounds contaminate the aquatic environment through municipal wastewater from sewage treatment plants. The result is accumulation of these analytes in the environment and their occurrence in food chain. Synthetic fragrances are commonly detected also in human body; these substances generally belong among relatively new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity. The aim of this work was to optimize the methods for the determination of selected synthetic fragrances in wastewater (municipal, industrial) and in fish muscle. These analytes were determined in wastewater [the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Brno – Modřice, cosmetic manufacturing plant] and in fish Squalius cephalus that had been caught in the river Svratka. The selected analytes (14 substances) originate from the group of nitromusk, <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musk</b> and linear musk compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) [for wastewater samples] and pressurized solvent extraction (PSE) [for fish samples] were used for isolation of analytes from real samples. The identification and quantification of analytes were carried out by high resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). The results show that galaxolide (g. L- 1) and tonalide (tenths of g. L- 1) were <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musk</b> compounds which were found at the highest concentration level in influent and also in effluent samples from the WWTP Brno – Modřice. The most extended nitromusk compound was musk ketone (hundredths of g. L- 1). Linear musk compounds were detected in all influent samples (g. L- 1). The overall removal efficiency of synthetic musk compounds from wastewater in the WWTP varies within the following ranges: nitromusk compounds 34. 4 % – 85. 4 %, <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musk</b> compounds 36. 7 % – 53. 3 % and linear musk compounds 90. 5 % – 99. 9 %. On the basis of the results it can be stated that wastewater (effluent from the WWTP) is the primary source of musk compounds, especially of the polycyclic ones in the environment. It has been also shown that ultrafiltration used in a cosmetic plant is a highly efficient technology for removing nitromusk and <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musk</b> compounds from industry wastewater. The results from evaluation of the fish contamination by musk compounds show that galaxolide was the substance which reached the highest concentration levels (tens of g. kg- 1 l. w.). The results corroborate ubiquitous occurrence of musk compounds in the environment and reduction of using of nitromusk compounds due to their potential toxic properties.

40|$|Synthetic musk compounds, {{widely used}} as {{fragrances}} in consumer products, {{have been detected}} in human tissue and, surprisingly, in aquatic organisms such as fish and mollusks. Although their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate are of concern, the toxicity and environmental risks of these chemicals are generally regarded as low. Here, however, we show that nitromusks and <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musks</b> inhibit the activity of multidrug efflux transporters responsible for multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) in gills of the marine mussel Mytilus californianus. The IC 10 (concentration that inhibits 10 %) values for the different classes of musks were {{in the range of}} 0. 09 – 0. 39 µM, and IC 50 values were 0. 74 – 2. 56 µM. The immediate consequence of inhibition of efflux transporters is that normally excluded xenobiotics will now be able to enter the cell. Remarkably, the inhibitory effects of a brief 2 -hr exposure to musks were only partially reversed after a 24 - to 48 -hr recovery period in clean seawater. This unexpected consequence of synthetic musks—a long-term loss of efflux transport activity—will result in continued accumulation of normally excluded toxicants even after direct exposure to the musk has ended. These findings also point to the need to determine whether other environmental chemicals have similar long-term effects on these transporters. The results are relevant to human health because they raise the possibility that exposure to common xenobiotics and pharmaceuticals could cause similar long-term inhibition of these transporters and lead to increased exposure to normally excluded toxicants.

Synthetic musk fragrance concentrations were highest in urban locations, including Milwaukee, WI (previously reported) and an urban location in Cedar Rapids, IA. Urban concentrations of HHCB and AHTN are {{on the order of}} 1 - 5 ng m- 3 and background terrestrial concentrations are about an order of magnitude less. In rural Iowa, the concentrations and frequency of detection of the synthetic musk fragrances are comparable to (and often greater than) gas-phase pesticide concentrations. The concentrations measured at the suburban location in Iowa City, IA and over the Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan were generally intermediate of those measured at the rural and urban locations. Concentrations of HHCB and AHTN were correlated with temperature at the sampling sites in Iowa. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal and}} {{transformation}} of 15 common fragrance allergens and two <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musks</b> in water samples were studied using UV irradiation and chlorination treatments. The {{monitoring of the}} reaction {{was carried out by}} a HS-SPME method coupled to GC-MS analysis. Different behaviours were observed depending on the compound and the treatment applied. Elimination experiments showed that all target compounds were affected by {{at least one of the}} two treatments. A total of 15 UV transformation products were detected and chemical structures were proposed for five of them. In the chlorination experiments, only galaxolide and benzyl cinnamate transformation products were observedA.

40|$|Methods Solutions of 0. 5 g of each {{chemical}} with 0. 5 g of reference, methyl decanoate were made. These {{were then}} {{run on a}} 7890 A Agilent Gas Chromatograph. The samples were run at the following temperature program: initial temperature at 70 °C, temperature ramp of 2 °C until 270 °C {{at the end of}} 100 minutes. Each sample was run in triplicate for statistical confidence. Results The calculated Equivalent Alkane Carbon Numbers range across a wide spectrum. However, instances of similarities in the 149 EACNs of molecules within the same functional group have been observed. As an example, the calculated EACNs ester molecules – manzanate, mahagonate, bulgarate and cyclogalbanate fall in the range of 0. 93 to 1. 04. This proximity to 1 is also alluded {{to the fact that the}} reference molecules is a methyl ester. EACNs of molecules with carbonyl functional groups such as Claritone, Florazone, Melozone and Orivone are within 1. 06 and 1. 14. Among <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musks,</b> Cellestolide, Cervolide and Habanolide have EACNs within 1. 08 and 1. 11 while Romandolide and Helveltolide are outliers...|$|R
40|$|An {{environmental}} risk assessment {{has been carried out}} for the <b>polycyclic</b> <b>musks</b> AHTN and HHCB according to the EU Technical Guidance Document for Environmental Risk Assessment for New and Existing Substances. AHTN and HHCB are used in fragrances for cosmetics and detergents. Both substances are high volume chemicals with a use volume for Europe of 585 and 1482 tonnes in 1995, respectively. The {{environmental risk}} assessment is based on information and results of studies provided by the fragrance industry as represented in the Netherlands by its association of Fragrance and Flavouring Materials Manufacturers (NEA), and the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM) and international literature sources as well. Endpoints in the assessment were aquatic organisms, sediment dwelling organisms, soil organisms, fish-eating predators and worm-eating predators. Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs) were calculated with the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES). Since monitoring data were available for several media, measured concentrations could be compared with predicted ones. Subsequently, one of the two was selected as the exposure concentration used for the risk characterisation...|$|R
