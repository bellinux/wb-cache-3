A pre-prototype board has been designed to verify all functionalities. The performance of this pre-prototype has been tested and evaluated. As a major achievement, the high-speed links in FPGAs are stable at 12. 8 Gb/s with Bit Error Ratio (BER) < 10 - 15 (no error detected). The low-latency parallel GPIO (General Purpose I/O) buses for communication between FPGAs are stable at 960 Mb/s. Besides that, the peripheral components of Soc FPGA have also been verified.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of Project 4 {{was to develop}} and test a high-temperature, uncooled gas turbine blade using MA 6000 alloy. Production scale up of the MA 6000 alloy was achieved with a fair degree of tolerance to non-optimum <b>processing.</b> The <b>blade</b> manufacturing process was also optimized. The mechanical, environmental, and physical property evaluations of MA 6000 were conducted. The ultimate tensile strength, to about 704 C (1300 F), is higher than DS MAR-M 247 but with a corresponding lower tensile elongation. Also, above 982 C (1800 F) MA 6000 tensile strength does not decrease as rapidly as MAR-M 247 because the ODS mechanism still remains active. Based on oxidation resistance and diffusional stability considerations, NiCrAlY coatings are recommended. CoCrAlY coating should be applied {{on top of a}} thin NiCrAlY coating if hot corrosion is expected. Vibration, whirlpit, and high-rotor-rig tests were conducted to ensure successful completion of the engine test of the MA 6000 TFE 731 high pressure turbine blades. Test results were acceptable.

50|$|In {{most members}} of Dicynodontia, both the reduced {{dentition}} and sharp cutting edge around the anterior end of the lower jaw suggest a scissor-like mode of food collection. After collection, mastication would have occurred via a back-and-forth grinding process. However, Dicynodontoides strays from this general pattern of food <b>processing.</b> Its caniniform <b>blades,</b> though periodically absent in this genus, {{are likely to have}} functioned as a paper cutter. However, the short mouth, blunted edges of the lower jaw, and the lack of a tough palatal surface against which the jaw could grind downplay the significance of this apparent shearing component. The morphology of the jaw hinge prevents the anterior end of the lower jaw from meeting the palate, only allowing palatal contact with the more posterior portion of the dentary. While there is little possibility of any transverse movement in the lower jaw, a crushing function is possible, and consistent with the feeding mechanism observed in other Emydopoids.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{theoretical}} approach to the calculation of the temperature of the blade cutting tool, taking into account the distribution of heat released during the cutting process, formed between the chip and the surface layer of the workpiece. On the basis of the received analytical dependences for determining the temperature of cutting when turning the basic conditions for its reduction have been defined. They mainly consist in reducing the cutting adequate stress (machining energy consumption) by reducing the intensity of the cutter friction against the cutting material in the cutting zone by applying a high-speed processing, but also by reducing the main cutting edge angle. It has been shown that if the cutting speed and longitudinal feed continuously increase the cutting temperature continuously increases as well, asymptotically approaching a constant value equal to the temperature of the produced chips. This indicates that with increasing speed of cutting and longitudinal feed all the heat generated during cutting is spent on heating the chip, and just {{a small part of the}} heat goes into the workpiece. As a result, it is possible to improve the quality of the treated surface as the probability of forming burns, cracks, and other temperature microscopic defects occurring on the treated surface decreases. Calculations revealed that neglecting the heat going into the resulting chips in turning leads to a significant increase in cutting temperature up to the values physically unrealizable in cutting. Consequently, it is possible to calculate maximum cutting temperature close to the experimental values only taking into account the heat balance going into the chips and the surface layer of the workpiece. Practical recommendations for improving <b>blade</b> <b>processing</b> technology based on the reduction of thermal stress in cutting have been give...|$|R
