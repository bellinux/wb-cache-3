40|$|This paper brings {{together}} {{a number of}} previously known techniques {{in order to obtain}} practical and efficient "pipelined" implementations of the prefix operation for the complete binary tree, hypercube, and shuffle-exchange families of networks. In each case, we provide a scheme for performing k prefix operations in O(k + <b>lg</b> <b>p)</b> time on p processors. The same bounds are shown to apply to the "data distribution" operation of Ullman [9]. The data distribution primitive leads to a simplified implementation of the optimal merging algorithm of Varman and Doshi [10], which runs on a pipelined model of the hypercube.

The process {{is applied to}} a large suite of regional events recorded on the three-component sensors in the NORESS array in southern Norway. Polarization properties of the regional seismic phases <b>P,,</b> S,, and <b>Lg</b> are examined in detail. The analysis {{technique is}} based on a time-domain algorithm originally proposed by Flinn (1965). The polarization ellipse is computed within sliding time windows by solving the eigenproblem for the covariance matrix. Various attributes characterizing the particle motions are extracted from the motion ellipse. This technique is extended to multiple three-component sensors in an array configu-ration by averaging covariance matrices for the different sensors. In this case a 1 /M reduction in the estimation variance is obtained (M is the number of sensors), when the noise and local scattering effects are uncorrelated. An important feature of this approach is that the phase velocities of coherent wavefronts across the array are not required to a high degree of accuracy. Significant results of the data analysis are the well-defined polarization of P, and Sn waves across the entire short-period band, the source azimuth estimates obtained from <b>P,</b> and <b>Lg</b> motions, and the distinct polarization for S, and Lg waves allowing these phases to be distinguished in most cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify {{differences}} in the kinematic and kinetic profiles of the trunk and lower extremities during baseball pitching in collegiate baseball pitchers, in relation to differences in the pitched ball velocity. The subjects were 30 collegiate baseball pitchers aged 18 to 22 yrs, who were assigned to high- (HG, 37. 4 ± 0. 8 m·s- 1) and low-pitched-ball-velocity groups (LG, 33. 3 ± 0. 8 m·s- 1). Three-dimensional motion analysis with a comprehensive lower-extremity model was used to evaluate kinematic and kinetic parameters during baseball pitching. The ground-reaction forces (GRF) of the pivot and stride legs during pitching were determined using two multicomponent force plates. The joint torques of hip, knee, and ankle were calculated using inverse-dynamics computation of a musculoskeletal human model. To eliminate any effect of variation in body size, kinetic and GRF data were normalized by dividing them by body mass. The maxima and minima of GRF (Fy, Fz, and resultant forces) on the pivot and stride leg were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). Furthermore, Fy, Fz, and resultant forces on the stride leg at maximum shoulder external rotation and ball release were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). The hip abduction, hip internal rotation and knee extension torques of the pivot leg and the hip adduction torque of the stride leg when it contacted the ground were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05).

Our analysis models the job scheduler as the thread scheduler’s adversary, challenging the thread scheduler to be robust to the system environment and the job scheduler’s administrative policies. We analyze the performance of A-STEAL using “trim analysis, ” which allows us to prove that our thread scheduler performs poorly on at most a small number of time steps, while exhibiting near-optimal behavior on the vast majority.

40|$|A multithreaded {{parallel}} {{program that is}} intended to be deterministic may exhibit nondeterminism clue to bugs called determinacy races. A key capability of race detectors is to determine whether one thread executes logically in parallel with another thread or whether the threads must operate in series. This thesis presents two algorithms, one serial and one parallel, to maintain the series-parallel (SP) relationships "on the fly" for fork-join multithreaded programs. For a fork-join program with T 1 work and a critical-path length of T[infinity], the serial SP-Maintenance algorithm runs in O(T 1) time. The parallel algorithm executes in the nearly optimal O(T 1 /P + PT[infinity]) time, when run on P processors and using an efficient scheduler. These SP-maintenance algorithms can be incorporated into race detectors to get a provably good race detector that runs in parallel.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} bifocal sampling, a {{new technique}} for estimating {{the size of an}} equi-join of two relations. Bifocal sampling classi es tuples in each relation into two groups, sparse and dense, {{based on the number of}} tuples with the same join value. Distinct estimation procedures are employed that focus on various combinations for joining tuples (e. g., for estimating the number of joining tuples that are dense in both relations). This combination of estimation procedures overcomes some well-known problems in previous schemes, enabling good estimates with no a priori knowledge about the data distribution. The estimate obtained by the bifocal sampling algorithm is proven to lie with high probability within a small constant factor of the actual join size, regardless of the skew, as long as the join size is (n lg n), for relations consisting of n tuples. The algorithm requires a sample of size at most O (<b>p</b> n <b>lg</b> n). By contrast, previous algorithms using a sample of similar size may require the join size to be (n p n) to guarantee an accurate estimate. Experimental results support the theoretical claims and show that bifocal sampling is practical and e ective. ...|$|R

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The role of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of gastric cancer has not yet been defined, and many doubts remain about the ability to satisfy all the oncologic criteria met during conventional, open surgery. METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective, randomized clinical trial with a total of 59 patients. Twenty-nine (49. 1 %) patients were randomized to undergo open subtotal gastrectomy (OG), while 30 (50. 9 %) patients were randomized to the laparoscopic group (LG). Demographics, ASA status, pTNM stage, histologic type of the tumor, number of resected lymph nodes, postoperative complications, and 5 -year overall and disease-free survival rates were studied to assess outcome differences between the groups. RESULTS: The demographics, preoperative data, and characteristics of the tumor were similar. The mean number of resected lymph nodes was 33. 4 +/- 17. 4 in the OG group and 30. 0 +/- 14. 9 in the <b>LG</b> (<b>P</b> = not significant). Operative mortality rates were 6. 7 % (2 patients) in the OG and 3. 3 % (1 patient) in the <b>LG</b> (<b>P</b> = not significant); morbidity rates were 27. 6 % and 26. 7 %, respectively (P = not significant). Five-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 55. 7 % and 54. 8 % and 58. 9 % and 57. 3 % in the OG and the <b>LG,</b> respectively (<b>P</b> = not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic radical subtotal gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer is a feasible and safe oncologic procedure with short- and long-term results similar to those obtained with an open approach. Additional benefits for the LG were reduced blood loss, shorter time to resumption of oral intake, and earlier discharge from hospital...|$|R

However, using linear space is not su ciently good for large text collections. In this paper we explore how far the space / time tradeo for this problem can be pushed.

Across the Stress Hyporesponsive Period (SHRP) H LG offspring had significantly increased plasma CORT (p= 0. 00) compared to L <b>LG</b> offspring at <b>P</b> 3. Challenged with a stressor at <b>P</b> 10, H <b>LG</b> offspring have an exaggerated plasma CORT response (p= 0. 00).

Strategy when imposed by external forces such as governmental regulations and policies as well as stiff competition, companies in the telecommunications sector tend to find new directions for their operations. However, telecommunications companies that are open to explicit or specific strategies as well as tend to find a middle ground between these two strategies as it was evident from this study. There were factors that the telecommunications company could not have planned such as government’s requirement for the registration of details of their subscribers for policy making. Planned strategies within the telecommunications industry have a lot of advantages such insignificant reduction in revenue regardless of competition. From this study it is evidence that planned or deliberate strategies which are implemented with some level of flexibility have its own advantages. <b>P.</b> O.

40|$|Low {{phytoplankton}} biomass usually {{occurs in}} the presence of submerged macrophytes, possibly because submerged macrophytes enhance top-down control of phytoplankton by offering a refuge for efficient grazers like Daphnia against fish predation. However, other field studies also suggest that submerged macrophytes suppress phytoplankton in the absence of Daphnia. In order to investigate these mechanisms further, we conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment to study the effect of submerged macrophytes (Elodea nuttallii) on phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. The experiment combined four nutrient addition levels (0, 10, 100, and 1000 <b>lg</b> <b>P</b> l- 1; N/P ratio: 16) with three macrophyte levels (no macrophytes, artificial macrophytes, and real macrophytes). We inoculated the tanks with species-rich inocula of phytoplankton and zooplank macrophyte treatment combinations. Compared to the treatment combinations without macrophytes, lower phytoplankton biomass occurred in the treatment combinations with real macrophytes at all the nutrient addition levels and in those with artificial macrophytes at all the nutrient levels except the highest. Significantly, higher abundances of plant-associated filter feeders (Simocephalus vetulus and Ceriodaphnia spp.) occurred in the treatment combinations with real and artificial macrophytes. T...|$|R
40|$|It is {{meaningful}} {{to use the}} Beijing metropolitan digital Seismic Network (BSN) of China to study deep crustal structure by recording artificial earthquakes. However, the energy released by artificial sources is small and they generally generate short-period seismic signals. In order to study the weak signal detectability of the Seismic Network between I and 20 Hz, this paper carries out the following work: (1) The analysis of background noise of BSN shows that the noise level. at seismic stations on bedrock is about 13 dB lower than that at stations located on sedimentary layer. The difference of noise level is equivalent to variations of detectable earthquake magnitude 1. 0. The noise between night and day time varies by about 5 dB. There is a trend of noise level increasing year-by-year. The noise level in 2006 is 4 dB higher than that in 2001. (2) A borehole explosion experiment with 25 kg chemical charges was conducted with its energy equal to an M(L) 0. 69 natural earthquake. The seismic phases Pg, Pm and Pc generated by explosion can be identified at 18 seismic stations. At a permanent seismic station 218 km away, the seismic phase Pm can be detected with the peak-to-peak amplitude being about 1. 6 nanometers. (3) An underground nuclear explosion carried out by North Korea in 2006 is {{a good opportunity to}} examine the weak signal detectability of the BSN. The records filtered with 1 similar to 5 Hz shows that the <b>P</b> or <b>Lg</b> waves generated by the nuclear explosion can clearly be recorded by 18 seismic stations located on bedrock. The average amplitude of P waves is 16 nanometers. The magnitude calculated is m(b) 4. 3, the same as that given by NEIC. The result also shows the noise level of station {{is one of the most}} important factors for signal detectability...|$|R
40|$|To {{facilitate}} the development testing and comparison of regional seismic discriminants, we have implemented {{some of the}} most promising techniques in Matseis, a-Matlab-based seismic processing toolkit. The existing Matseis package provides graphical tools for analyzing seismic data from a network of stations. It can access data via a CSS 3. 0 database, or from static files in a format defined by the user. Waveforms are displayed in a record-section format, with overlays for IASPE 191 travel-time curves. The user can pick arrivals and locate events, then show the results on a map. Tools are available for spectral and polarization measurements, as well as beam forming and f-k analysis with array data. Additionally, one has full access to the Matlab environment and any functions available there, as well as to portions of the U. S. Department of Energy Knowledge Base. Recently, we have added some new tools to Matseis for calculating regional discrimination measurements. The first of these performs Lg coda analysis as developed by Mayeda and coworkers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Lg coda magnitudes are calculated from the amplitudes of the coda envelopes in narrow frequency bands. Ratios of these amplitudes between high- and low-frequency bands provide a spectral-ratio discriminant for regional events. The second tool we have implemented measures P/Lg phase ratios, using the MDAC technique of Taylor (Los Alamos National Laboratory) and Walter (LLNL). <b>P</b> and <b>Lg</b> amplitudes are obtained at select frequencies, then corrected for source magnitude and propagation path. Finally, we added a tool for analyzing long-period Rayleigh and Love arrivals, useful for moment:magnitude and LQ:LR discrimination. Because all these tools have been written as Matlab functions, they can be easily modified to experiment with different processing details. The performance of the discriminants can be evaluated using any event available in the database...|$|R

Various results have been previously shown related to the minimum time needed to broadcast a message from any vertex to all the vertices of Gn,p random graphs. We prove here that in Gn,p random graphs {{for the value of}} probability p used in Gerbessiotis, near-optimal broadcast can be achieved, with high probability, in llg n + O(lg lg lg n) time steps, an improvement over the previous time bound of lg n + O(lg lg n). It is assumed that at any time step a given vertex could either transmit to or receive from at most one other vertex one message in unit time. We also prove that for <b>p</b> = c <b>lg</b> lg lg n log nn, for any constant c > 16, a message held by any vertex of a Gn,p random graph can be broadcast to all other vertices in at most lgn + 1 time steps, with high probability.

40|$|Abstract: Inorganic–organic hybrid {{materials}} {{designed to}} facilitate bone tissue regeneration use a calcium phosphate mineral layer to encourage cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. Mineral formed on porous materials is often discontinuous through {{the thickness of}} the scaffold. This study aimed to uniformly coat the pores of three-dimensional (3 D) porous, polymer scaffolds with a bone-like mineral layer in addition to uniformly incorporating a model protein within this mineral layer. A filtration system designed to induce simulated body fluid flow through the interstices of 3 D polylactic-co-glycolic acid scaffolds (10 -mm diameter 3 2 -mm thickness) illustrated that a uniform, continuous mineral layer can be precipitated on the pore surfaces of a 3 D porous structure within 5 days. MicroCT analysis showed increased mineral volume percent (MV%) (7. 86 6 3. 25 MV%, p 0. 029) and continuous mineralization of filtered scaffolds compared with two static control groups (floating, 0. 166 0. 26 MV % and submerged, 0. 20 6 0. 01 MV%). Furthermore, the system was effective in coprecipitating a model protein, bone sialoprotein (BSA), within the mineral layer. A 10 -fold increase in BSA incorporation was seen when coprecipitated filtered scaffolds (1308 6 464 lg) were compared to a submerged static control group (139 6 45 <b>lg),</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 001...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{elucidate}} whether ketamine, a non-competitive antag-onist of the NMDA receptor, can suppress the morphine withdrawal syndrome in rats at a dose without affecting motor functions and to identify its site of action in the central ner-vous system. Rats were made dependent on morphine by multiple injections of morphine hydrochloride for 5 days. They were then given ketamine at the following doses and routes of administration: (a) intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections (2 – 16 mg/kg), (b) intracerebroventricu-lar (i. c. v.) injections (4 – 100 lg), and (c) intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) or intra-amygdalar microinjections (0. 4 – 10 lg). Naloxone HCl (1 mg/kg, i. p.) was administered 3 h after the last ketamine injection to precipitate withdrawal syndrome, which was scored within a per-iod of 30 min. Results showed that some of the precipitated withdrawal signs were dose-dependently suppressed by repeated injections of ketamine at 8 and 16 mg/kg, i. <b>p.</b> or 100 <b>lg,</b> i. c. v. Dose-dependent suppression was observed by repeated microinjections (0. 4 – 10 lg) of ketamine to NAc, but not to amygdala. These results indicate that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has the ability to suppress morphine withdrawal syndrome in experimental settings without motor interference, and NAc could be the critical CNS site mediating such effect.
