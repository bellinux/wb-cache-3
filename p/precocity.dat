5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual <b>precocity.</b> He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This <b>precocity</b> convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E

25|$|Gauss {{was a child}} prodigy. A contested story relates that, when he was eight, {{he figured}} out how to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100. There are many other anecdotes about his <b>precocity</b> while a toddler, and he made his first {{ground-breaking}} mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, his magnum opus, in 1798 at the age of 21, although it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.|$|E
25|$|His {{advances}} must {{be attributed}} {{mainly to the}} influence of his contemporary Rasmus Christian Rask. Rask was born two years later than Grimm, but his remarkable <b>precocity</b> set him beyond his years. In Grimm's first editions, his Icelandic paradigms are based entirely on Rask's grammar, and in his second edition, he relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English. His debt to Rask can be appreciated only by comparing his treatment of Old English in the two editions; the difference is very great. For example, in the first edition he declines dæg, dæges, plural dægas, without having observed the law of vowel-change pointed out by Rask. (The correct plural is dagas.) There {{can be little doubt that}} the appearance of Rask's Old English grammar was the primary impetus for Grimm to recast his work from the beginning. To Rask also belongs the merit of having first distinctly formulated the laws of sound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the vowels (those more fleeting elements of speech previously ignored by etymologists).|$|E
500|$|The music {{historian}} Roger Parker {{points out}} that both of Verdi's parents [...] "belonged to families of small landowners and traders, certainly not the illiterate peasants from which Verdi later liked to present himself as having emerged... Carlo Verdi was energetic in furthering his son's education...something which Verdi tended to hide in later life... he picture emerges of youthful <b>precocity</b> eagerly nurtured by an ambitious father and of a sustained, sophisticated and elaborate formal education." ...|$|E
500|$|Breeders {{speak of}} a 'nick" [...] {{occurring}} when a sire or grandsire produces significantly better offspring from the daughters of one particular sire than with mares from other bloodlines. The breeding of Bold Ruler with Somethingroyal {{is an example of}} a famous nick between Bold Ruler's sire Nasrullah and daughters of Princequillo. The goal was to balance the speed, <b>precocity,</b> and fiery temperament provided by the Nasrullah side of the pedigree with Princequillo's stamina, soundness, and sensible temperament.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} between 1854 and 1856 Smetana {{suffered}} a series of personal blows. In July 1854 his second daughter, Gabriela, died of tuberculosis. A year later his eldest daughter Bedřiška, who {{at the age of}} four was showing signs of musical <b>precocity,</b> died of scarlet fever. Smetana wrote his Piano Trio in G minor as a tribute to her memory; it was performed in Prague on 3December 1855 and, according to the composer, was received [...] "harshly" [...] by the critics, although Liszt praised it. Smetana's sorrows continued; just after Bedřiška's death a fourth daughter, Kateřina, had been born but she, too, died in June 1856. By this time Smetana's wife Kateřina had also been diagnosed with tuberculosis.|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn's first {{published}} works were his three piano quartets, (1822–1825; Op. 1 in C minor, Op. 2 in F minor and Op. 3 in B minor); but his capacities are especially revealed {{in a group}} of works of his early maturity: [...] the String Octet (1825), the Overture A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826), which in its finished form also owes much to the influence of Adolf Bernhard Marx, at the time a close friend of Mendelssohn, and the two early quartets: Op. 12 (1829) and Op. 13 (1827), which both show a remarkable grasp of the techniques and ideas of Beethoven's last quartets that Mendelssohn had been closely studying. These four works show an intuitive grasp of form, harmony, counterpoint, colour, and compositional technique, which justify claims frequently made that Mendelssohn's <b>precocity</b> exceeded even that of Mozart in its intellectual grasp.|$|E
2500|$|When {{his mother}} took Rudolf Nureyev and his sisters into a {{performance}} of the ballet [...] "Song of the Cranes", {{he fell in love}} with dance. As a child he was encouraged to dance in Bashkir folk performances and his <b>precocity</b> was soon noticed by teachers who encouraged him to train in Saint Petersburg. On a tour stop in Moscow with a local ballet company, Nureyev auditioned for the Bolshoi ballet company and was accepted.|$|E
2500|$|... "noble rot" [...] is {{a method}} of {{concentration}} depending on climatic conditions. The Botrytis cinerea creates microscopic perforations of the grape skin through which water is allowed to evaporate while maintaining the other components. The action of botrytis induces different flavours in the grape related to chemical reactions in the berry. The <b>precocity</b> of the varietal-land and low vigour of the vine are favourable to the action of noble rot and helps prevent gray rot. This type of grape {{is used for the}} production of Hungarian Tokaji, Fortified wines of Aquitaine (Sauternes, Barsac, Loupiac, Monbazillac, etc.), and some selections of noble rot berries in Alsace and Germany: Trockenbeerenauslese ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first two}} laws of error that were {{proposed}} both originated with Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first law {{was published in}} 1774 and stated that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude of the error, disregarding sign. The second law of error was proposed in 1778 by Laplace and stated that {{the frequency of the}} error is an exponential function of the square of the error. The second law of error is called the normal distribution or the Gauss law. [...] "It is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss, who in spite of his well-known <b>precocity</b> had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{living at}} the Cecil House, De Vere's daily studies {{consisted}} of dancing instruction, French, Latin, cosmography, writing exercises, drawing, and common prayers. During {{his first year at}} Cecil House, Oxford was briefly tutored by Laurence Nowell, the antiquarian and Anglo-Saxon scholar. In a letter to Cecil, Nowell explains: [...] "I clearly see that my work for the Earl of Oxford cannot be much longer required", and his departure after eight months has been interpreted as either a sign of the thirteen-year-old De Vere's intractability as a pupil, or an indication that his <b>precocity</b> surpassed Nowell's ability to instruct him. In May 1564 Arthur Golding, in his dedication to his Th' Abridgement of the Histories of Trogus Pompeius, attributed to his young nephew an interest in ancient history and contemporary events.|$|E
2500|$|His mother Màgia died in 1491 when Raphael was eight, {{followed}} on August 1, 1494 by his father, who {{had already}} remarried. Raphael was thus orphaned at eleven; his formal guardian became his only paternal uncle Bartolomeo, a priest, who subsequently engaged in litigation with his stepmother. He probably continued {{to live with his}} stepmother when not staying as an apprentice with a master. He had already shown talent, according to Vasari, who says that Raphael had been [...] "a great help to his father". A self-portrait drawing from his teenage years shows his <b>precocity.</b> His father's workshop continued and, probably together with his stepmother, Raphael evidently played a part in managing it from a very early age. In Urbino, he came into contact with the works of Paolo Uccello, previously the court painter (d. 1475), and Luca Signorelli, who until 1498 was based in nearby Città di Castello.|$|E
2500|$|William James Sidis ( [...] ; April 1, 1898 – July 17, 1944) was an American child prodigy with {{exceptional}} mathematical {{abilities and}} a claimed mastery of many languages. After his death, his sister made the unverifiable claim that his IQ was [...] "the very highest {{that had ever}} been obtained", but any records of any IQ testing that Sidis actually took have been lost to history. He entered Harvard at age 11 and, as an adult, was claimed to be conversant in over 40 languages and dialects. It was later acknowledged, however, {{that some of the}} claims made were exaggerations, with a researcher stating [...] "I have been researching the veracity of primary sources of various subjects for about twenty-eight years, and never before have I found a topic so satiated with lies, myths, half-truths, exaggerations, and other forms of misinformation as is in the history behind William Sidis". Sidis became famous first for his <b>precocity</b> and later for his eccentricity and withdrawal from public life. Eventually, he avoided mathematics altogether, writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms.|$|E
2500|$|Bosley Crowther of the New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "a big musical shenanigan and {{theatrical}} tour-de-force" [...] and added, [...] "In essence, it is a poignant story. It {{was in the}} opera of Bizet, {{and it is in}} the rich nostalgic folklore of the American Negro in the South. But here {{it is not so much}} poignant as it is lurid and lightly farcical, with the Negro characters presented by Mr. Preminger as serio-comic devotees of sex [...] [...] [...] The incongruity is pointed when these people break into song to the wholly surprising and unnatural aria airs from Bizet's opera. The tempos are alien to their spirits, the melodies are foreign to their moods, but they have at those classical numbers as though they were cutting rugs. And whatever illusions and exaltations the musical eloquence might remotely inspire are doused by the realistic settings in which Mr. Preminger has played his film [...] [...] [...] There is nothing wrong with the music — except that it does not fit the people or the words. But that did not seem to make much difference to Mr. Hammerstein or Mr. Preminger. They were carried away by their <b>precocity.</b> The present consequence is a crazy mixed-up film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, artistic {{director}} of Jazz at Lincoln Center, learned about Joey Alexander after a friend suggested he watch a YouTube video clip of him playing compositions by Coltrane, Monk and Chick Corea. Marsalis praised Joey Alexander as [...] "my hero" [...] on his Facebook page, and invited him to appear at his organization's gala in May 2014, when he was 10. It marked Joey Alexander's United States debut. He received positive reviews for his performance, particularly for his solo version of the Monk song [...] "'Round Midnight". The New York Times said he became an [...] "overnight sensation" [...] after the performance. Allen Morrison of Down Beat magazine said of the performance: [...] "If the word 'genius' still means anything, it applies to this prodigy. He played his own solo variations on 'Round Midnight' with a breathtaking <b>precocity</b> and mastery of several decades of piano style." [...] Marsalis said of him: [...] "There has never been anyone that {{you can think of}} who could play like that at his age. I loved everything about his playing – his rhythm, his confidence, his understanding of the music." [...] Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, widow of tennis player Arthur Ashe, invited Joey Alexander to perform at the Arthur Ashe Learning Center gala, where he played for a crowd that included former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Moutoussamy-Ashe introduced him to Gordon Uehling III, founder of the CourtSense Tennis Training Center, who has allowed Joey Alexander and his family to stay at his estate in Alpine, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Bernini {{was born}} in Naples in 1598 to [...] Angelica Galante and Mannerist {{sculptor}} Pietro Bernini, originally from Florence. He was the sixth of their thirteen children. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was the definition of childhood genius. He was “recognized as a prodigy {{when he was only}} eight years old, [...] he was consistently encouraged by his father, Pietro. His <b>precocity</b> earned him the admiration and favor of powerful patrons who hailed him as ‘the Michelangelo of his century’”. In 1606 his father received a papal commission (to contribute a marble relief in the Cappella Paolina of Santa Maria Maggiore) and so moved from Naples to Rome, taking his entire family with him. Sometime thereafter, word about the great talent of the boy Gian Lorenzo got around and he soon caught the attention of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew to the reigning pope, Paul V, who spoke of the boy genius to his uncle. Bernini was therefore presented before Pope Paul V, curious to see if the stories about Gian Lorenzo's talent were true. The boy improvised a sketch of Saint Paul for the marveling pope, and this {{was the beginning of the}} pope’s attention on this young talent. Once he was brought to Rome, he never left. Rome was Bernini’s city. “For Bernini there could be only one Rome. ‘You are made for Rome,’ said Pope Urban VIII to him, ‘and Rome for you’”. It was in this world of 17th-century Rome and religious power that Bernini created his greatest works.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{almost universally}} praised the novel upon its publication, {{primarily}} citing the compelling character portrayal of 11-year-old lead detective, Flavia de Luce. Reviewers have called Flavia brilliant, bold, irresistible, incorrigible, precocious, adorable, and unique. For Canadian Literature, Beverly Haun wrote [...] "Flavia is a gem of a character; her <b>precocity</b> offset by her emotional vulnerability makes a winning combination." [...] Marilyn Stasio for The New York Times Book Review agreed, proclaiming Flavia [...] "impressive as a sleuth and enchanting as a mad scientist," [...] but [...] "most endearing {{as a little}} girl who has learned how to amuse herself in a big lonely house." [...] Reviewer Paula Todd for The Globe and Mail (Canada), however, was not impressed. Calling Flavia [...] "too much of a caricature to appeal to the subtlety-seeking adult mystery reader," [...] she declared the language [...] "often tedious" [...] and the references [...] "too obscure" [...] for younger readers. Todd wrote [...] "the burning question a few chapters in is not whodunit, but who wants to read it? To whom, exactly, is this book meant to appeal?" [...] Other reviewers have noted strong appeal {{to a wide range of}} readers. Michele Leber for Library Journal noted [...] "appeal for cozy lovers and well beyond" [...] while Francisca Goldsmith for School Library Journal suggested [...] "mystery fans, Anglophiles, and science buffs will delight" [...] in The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie. Judy Coon for Booklist insisted [...] "only those who dislike precocious young heroines with extraordinary vocabulary and audacious courage can fail to like this amazingly entertaining book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rawat {{was born}} in Haridwar, {{northern}} India, on 10 December 1957, the fourth and youngest son of guru Shri Hans Ji Maharaj and his second wife, Jagat Janani Mata Shri Rajeshwari Devi. Rawat attended St. Joseph's Academy elementary school {{in his hometown of}} Dehra Dun. At the age of three he began speaking at his father's meetings, and at six his father taught him the [...] "techniques of Knowledge." [...] His father died in 1966, and during the customary 13 days of mourning his mother and senior officials of the organization discussed the succession. Both his mother, Mata Ji, and eldest brother, Satpal Rawat (known then as Bal Bhagwan Ji, and currently as Satpal Maharaj), were suggested as potential successors, but before either could be nominated, Rawat addressed the crowd of mourners, reminding them that their master was immortal and was still among them. In response, his mother, brother and the senior disciples accepted Rawat as their Satguru, bowed to his feet and received his blessing. Previously known to his father's followers as Sant Ji, Rawat now assumed the title [...] "Guru Maharaj Ji" [...] and was called [...] "Balyogeshwar" [...] by others (roughly [...] "born saint" [...] or [...] "born lord of Yogis") on account of his youth and spiritual <b>precocity.</b> From that time, Rawat spent his weekends and school holidays travelling as his father had, addressing audiences on the subject of Knowledge and inner peace. Because of his youth, effective control of the DLM was shared by the whole family.|$|E
2500|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} family, of Han ethnicity, {{originally}} from Qixian (present-day Qi County in Shanxi province), Wang Wei's father moved {{east of the}} Yellow River to Puzhou, part of the historic Hedong Commandery (today's Yongji, Shanxi). Known for his youthful <b>precocity,</b> Wang Wei, the eldest of five brothers, set off for the imperial capital {{at the age of}} nineteen, in order to study and take the jinshi civil service entrance examination. In the period while residing in Chang'an, before taking the test, Wang's proficiency at poetry and his musical proficiency with the pipa helped him to achieve popularity at the royal court. He passed the jinshi examination, in 721, with the first class award (Zhuangyuan), which started his potentially lucrative civil service career. Wang Wei's career as an official had its ups and downs. His first appointment was as a court musician, or [...] "Deputy Master of Music"; however, he was then demoted to a position of being in charge of a granary in the former province of Jizhou (now the name of a different town Jizhou, in Hebei). The reason for this demotion, according to tradition, was Wang's breach of etiquette by performing a lion dance. In any case, this was only a minor setback to his career, and it had a compensation in that it did allow him to travel. Then, a series of promotions following this demotion was apparently attributable to a relationship with the prominent governmental minister, poet, and literary scholar Zhang Jiuling, at least until Zhang's 727 demotion to a post in Jingzhou. By 728, Wang Wei was back in Chang'an, where he entertained the poet Meng Haoran, who was to become a close friend and poetic colleague. At this point, Wang seems to have achieved the rank of Assistant Censor, and then a subsequent governmental promotion, but then later being demoted back to Assistant Censor, with the loss in imperial favor of Zhang Jiuling and the rising political ascendency of Li Linfu. After his wife's death in 731, he never remarried. It was in his role as a government official that Wang Wei was dispatched to Liangzhou, which was then the northwestern frontier of the Chinese empire, and the scene of constant military conflicts. By invitation of the local commander, Wang served in this location until returning to Chang'an in 738 or early 739.|$|E
