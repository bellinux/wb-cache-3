5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
5|$|National Park Service {{staff have}} {{continued}} to uncover artifacts from throughout Manzanar's history, the result of archaeological digs that have also excavated several of the gardens designed and built by World War II incarcerees, including the famous Merritt Park (also known as Pleasure Park).

5|$|Research is {{important}} in 4X games because technological <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|A Short History of <b>Progress</b> <b>is</b> a non-fiction {{book and}} lecture series by Ronald Wright about {{societal}} collapse. The lectures were delivered {{as a series}} of five speeches, each taking place in different cities across Canada as part of the 2004 Massey Lectures which were broadcast on the CBC Radio program, Ideas. The book version was published by House of Anansi Press and released {{at the same time as}} the lectures. The book spent more than a year on Canadian best-seller lists, won the Canadian Book Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year, and was nominated for the British Columbia's National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction. It has since been reprinted in a hardcover format with illustrations.|$|E
5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> {{being made}} to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable {{the remainder of the}} project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E
5|$|After {{sufficiently}} {{upgrading the}} ship and exploring the map, the player is allowed to buy the three powerful artifacts, which then spawn at random ports. Defeating the Ancient Guardian in a card minigame awards the player additional loot and previously unavailable upgrades. Ancient Trader does not include a saving feature, which means that all <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase the artifacts, and defeat the Guardian. The prices of the artifacts increase as other players buy them. The players can check the wealth and artifacts gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard.|$|E

5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E

5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> {{illustrated}} in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|In Seattle, {{two friends}} argue about {{applying}} for college. Landon Bryce (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) tells his friend Howard Gordon (Michael R. Coleman) to apply, but Gordon has been convinced by school counselor Teresa Roe (Mariangela Pino) that his <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> too mediocre {{to make it}} worthwhile. Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon {{died of a heart}} attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his friend and colleague Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left in a room with the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Children of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls a main character, chosen from one of four options. Each of the characters have different ratings from one to five in four areas: the damage they do with magic, the speed that they can attack, {{and the amount of}} health and mana they have. The game plays out nearly identically regardless of which character is chosen, except for a few quests specific to each character. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, the main character typically has no companions during the game; however, a cooperative multiplayer option is present for up to four players, who all appear on each player's screens. This multiplayer mode is only present with local WiFi, and <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> only saved on the host player's game.|$|E

5|$|None of the {{original}} engines survived into preservation, however <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> being made by a Registered Charity (No. 1062320), the Standard Steam Locomotive Company, on constructing a new locomotive {{that would have been}} the first of the uncompleted batch of 15, number 72010 Hengist. As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive build to be commenced to a British Railways standard design. The Standard Steam Locomotive Company believes that significant costs will be avoided as many of the required cast parts can be made from patterns held by fellow members of the British Railways Standard Locomotive Owners Group (BRSLOG).|$|E
5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow crawling, with some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Progress</b> <b>is</b> {{punctuated by}} cutscenes and codec, {{as well as}} {{encounters}} with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec {{is also used to}} provide exposition on the game's backstory.|$|E
