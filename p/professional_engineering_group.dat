40|$|This article {{examines}} the mismatches between supply of skills and attributes of immigrants {{and the demands of}} employers that influence workplace integration of skilled immigrants in Australia. It argues that, despite being skilled, immigrants still cannot meet the requirements of employers in doing their jobs effectively. There are mismatches, which happen mainly in the aspects of English proficiency, qualification and culture. The study followed a qualitative research design taking skilled immigrants from IT and <b>engineering</b> <b>professional</b> backgrounds and their employers in Australia as the interviewees. The results confirm that the workplace integration of immigrants is not only affected by the inherent capacities of immigrants, but the mindset of employers and their perception towards immigrants 2 ̆ 7 overall qualities also manipulate the process. The results are, however, indicative only, as the study is confined to IT and <b>engineering</b> <b>professional</b> <b>groups,</b> and does not report the experiences of other immigrants...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{undergraduate}} engineering {{education is to}} develop graduates {{who are capable of}} commencing <b>professional</b> <b>engineering</b> practice. <b>Professional</b> education should equip graduates with the skills, knowledge and attitudes required for their initial professional practice. It should also enable the capacity to continue the professional development required to refresh knowledge and skills as the graduates mature and the nature of <b>professional</b> <b>engineering</b> work develops. However, it is true that many graduates from <b>professional</b> <b>engineering</b> programs, either immediately or at some later time, pursue a career outside of <b>professional</b> <b>engineering.</b> The reasons for this are widely speculated upon, and are no doubt complex. In this regard, the <b>professional</b> <b>engineering</b> workforce, the undergraduate engineering education system, the links between them, and the occupational outcomes for engineering graduates in Australia are similar to many other developed nations. Using the latest Australian national census data we present a detailed analysis of the makeup of the <b>professional</b> <b>engineering</b> workforce and the occupational outcomes for graduates of undergraduate engineering programs in Australia. The data show that the Australian <b>professional</b> <b>engineering</b> workforce is comprised of people {{with a wide range of}} educational qualifications, and, even immediately post-graduation, many Australian engineering graduates pursue non-engineering occupations. This analysis presents important findings for those designing undergraduate engineering curricula that seek to equip students for the best employment outcomes, given the nature of the <b>professional</b> <b>engineering</b> work environment, and the short- and long-term occupations that engineering graduates actually pursue in Australia...|$|R
