40|$|A {{new type}} of road marking on {{residential}} roads outside the built-up area is emerging; a marked driving strip for motor vehicles. The border marking is situated several decimetres {{from the edge of}} the road surface. By this means there exists an outside <b>edge</b> <b>strip</b> between the marking and the road surface edge that could be used by cyclists (and the occasional pedestrian). Between the outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> on either side of the carriageway, there exists a driving strip without an axis line. The driving strip aims to: (i) lower the driving speeds by means of a visual narrowing of the carriageway; (ii) provide the cyclists their own safe place on the carriageway by marking the driving strip; and (iii) cause less damage by motor vehicles to the edges of the carriageway and shoulder. The question is whether the marked driving strip achieves these positive aims. An answer to this question was sought by means of inspections, observations, and measurements on a number of roads, with and without these driving <b>strips.</b> Outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> occur on narrower roads than where the Dutch Centre for Research and Contract Standardization and Traffic Engineering CROW proposed them. CROW maintains that outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> on both sides of the road should have a minimum width of 1. 25 metres, and that the road itself should be at least 5. 5 metres wide. Almost all the roads found and used in this study are narrower. All the outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> found were also narrower. For the purposes of this study, the different <b>edge</b> <b>strip</b> widths were subdivided into three classes: narrower than 80 centimetres, 80 - 95 centimetres, and broader than 95 centimetres. In fact, all three classes consist of ‘narrow’ <b>edge</b> <b>strips.</b> Speed measurements did not show that cars drove considerably slower on roads with outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> than on roads without them. The speed differences found were small and showed an unsystematic, unclear pattern. The space between an overtaking motor vehicle and a cyclist is at its smallest when no outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> have been provided. Only a small percentage of cyclists cycle outside the edge strips; a maximum of c. 11 % in the case of those cycling alone. On roads with broad outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips,</b> and to a lesser extent on roads with narrow <b>edge</b> <b>strips,</b> the cyclists swerve less when being overtaken, than on roads without <b>edge</b> <b>strips.</b> The narrower the <b>edge</b> <b>strip</b> the more the cyclists swerve to the right. The narrow <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> would appear to offer the cyclists their own place less than broader <b>edge</b> <b>strips.</b> In the most cases where the shoulder was used, there were one or more agricultural vehicles or lorries involved. In the most cases where vehicle were observed using the shoulder while swerving, were on roads without outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips.</b> The roads, however, also have a narrower hardened road surface than the roads that do have <b>edge</b> <b>strips.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>strips</b> would appear not to result in motor vehicles driving closer to the middle of the road. The high speed limit (80 km/h) and the sometimes even higher measured driving speeds of cars and lorries, and the slow speeds of cyclists, lead to great differences in speed and mass. This is in conflict with the principles of ‘sustainably safe’. Even if the speed limit was to be reduced from 80 km/h to 60 km/h, the expected differences in speed are still great. The new type appears to have only small effects. Based on the data in this study, it has not become clear that the introduction of outside <b>edge</b> <b>strips,</b> on its own, is a sufficiently effective means of achieving the goals aimed at.

40|$|This {{study of}} the effects of <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> in the borough of Pijnacker took place within the {{framework}} of a broader ‘Data collection trial project’. That trial project is part of the SWOV theme ‘Road design and road safety’. Within this data collection trial project, the studies of <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> and (non-compulsory) cycle lanes form one whole. Various road authorities participate in these studies, and similar studies are conducted at various locations. The present study has acquired the character of a pilot study. <b>Edge</b> <b>strips</b> and cycle lanes are seen by many as a possible way of implementing sustainably-safe rural, residential roads, where the speed limit is 60 km/h. An <b>edge</b> <b>strip</b> comes into being when a broken side-marking at some distance {{from the edge of the}} road surface is introduced. An <b>edge</b> <b>strip</b> lacks a bicycle pictogram on the road surface, and, therefore, lacks the legal status of the cycle lane. Together with the rest of the carriageway (i. e. that meant only for motorised vehicles), <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> and cycle lanes are part of one and the same road surface. <b>Edge</b> <b>strips</b> have the same grey colour as the rest of the road surface. <b>Edge</b> <b>strips</b> painted red are often called non-compulsory cycle lanes. The research design is a before-and-after study and is aimed at the road users. The question was whether behaviour of cyclists and car drivers (speed, distance between vehicles, position on the road) would change as a result of the measure. To determine this, speed measurements and behaviour observations were carried out. The observed behaviour was subdivided into five different types of events, e. g. ‘a car overtaking a bicycle’. During such events the ‘lateral positions’ were observed: the transverse positions of the road users on the road, in relation to the shoulder and marking. The lateral distances between vehicles was only measured when a car overtook a bicycle. On the street called Molenlaan in Pijnacker there was a speed limit of 60 km/h in the before and after situation. No marking at all was present in the before situation. The <b>edge</b> <b>strips</b> do not appear to have had undivided positive effects: - Cyclists use the <b>edge</b> <b>strip</b> (if they are not cycling next to each other). - The lateral position of cars in the cross-sectional profile seem not, or hardly, to be influenced by the <b>edge</b> <b>strips.</b> Neither is the cyclist overtaken with a greater lateral distance. - The average speed increased slightly after the introduction of the <b>edge</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R

40|$|The domain {{decomposition}} strategies proposed {{in this thesis}} are efficient preconditioning techniques with good parallelism properties for the discrete systems which arise from the finite element approximation of symmetric elliptic boundary value problems in two and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces. For two-dimensional problems, two new {{domain decomposition}} preconditioners are introduced, such that the condition number of the preconditioned system is bounded independently {{of the size of}} the subdomains and the finite element mesh size. First, the alternate strip-based (ASB 2) preconditioner is based on the partitioning of the domain into a finite number of nonoverlapping strips without interior vertices. This preconditioner is obtained from direct solvers inside the strips and a direct fast Poisson solver on the <b>edges</b> between <b>strips,</b> and contains two stages. At each stage the strips change such that the <b>edges</b> between <b>strips</b> at one stage are perpendicular on the <b>edges</b> between <b>strips</b> at the other stage. Next, the alternate strip-based substructuring (ASBS 2) preconditioner is a Schur complement solver for the case of a decomposition with multiple nonoverlapping subdomains and interior vertices. The subdomains are assembled into nonoverlapping strips such that the vertices of the strips are on the boundary of the given domain, the <b>edges</b> between <b>strips</b> align with the edges of the subdomains and their union contains all of the interior vertices of the initial decomposition. This preconditioner is produced from direct fast Poisson solvers on the <b>edges</b> between <b>strips</b> and the <b>edges</b> between subdo- mains inside strips, and also contains two stages such that the <b>edges</b> between <b>strips</b> at one stage are perpendicular on the <b>edges</b> between <b>strips</b> at the other stage.

If we consider only open paths {{in the above}} definition then we call it as a graphoidal path cover [3]. Generally, a Smarandache graphoidal tree (k, d) -cover of a graph G is a <b>partition</b> of <b>edges</b> of G into trees T 1, T 2, · · ·, Tl such that |E(Ti) ∩E(Tj) | ≤ k and |Ti | ≤ d for integers 1 ≤ i, j ≤ l.

40|$|This thesis will compare {{two ways}} of distributing data for {{parallel}} graph algorithms: vertex and <b>edge</b> <b>partitioning,</b> using a distributed memory system. Previous studies on the parallelization of graphs has often been focused on a vertex partitioning, where each processor is assigned a set V' ⊆ V where G = (V,E), yielding a one-dimensional partitioning. It has been shown, however, that an <b>edge</b> <b>partitioning</b> (or 2 D partitioning), where each processor is assigned a set E' ⊆ E, may yield a benefit {{in terms of a}} lower communication volume. The performance and scalability of vertex and edge partitionings are compared by implementing the Karp-Sipser matching set algorithm for both partitioning schemes. A matching set is a set E' ⊆ E of independent edges such that each vertex in V occurs at most once in E'. We find that while the vertex partitioned algorithm gives a significantly higher speedup, the increased performance of the <b>edge</b> <b>partitioned</b> algorithm on more dense graphs suggests that if the graph framework is improved further, it could lead to the implementation of an <b>edge</b> <b>partitioned</b> matching algorithm that offers better scalability and comparable matching quality to a vertex partitioned matching algorithm. An <b>edge</b> <b>partitioning</b> requires a rigorous framework for handling the communication resulting when edges owned by multiple processors are incident on the same vertex. Hopefully, the framework developed for representing an <b>edge</b> <b>partitioned</b> graph facilitates the implementation of other parallel graph algorithms using an <b>edge</b> <b>partitioning</b> approach...|$|R
