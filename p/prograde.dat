5|$|In {{order of}} their {{distance}} from the planet, the irregular moons are Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso, a group that includes both <b>prograde</b> and retrograde objects. The five outermost moons {{are similar to the}} irregular moons of other giant planets, and are thought to have been gravitationally captured by Neptune, unlike the regular satellites, which probably formed in situ.|$|E
5|$|Inward of Triton {{are seven}} small regular satellites, {{all of which}} have <b>prograde</b> orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune's {{equatorial}} plane; some of these orbit among Neptune's rings. The largest of them is Proteus. They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has six more outer irregular satellites other than Triton, including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have <b>prograde</b> orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured. The two outermost Neptunian irregular satellites, Psamathe and Neso, have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of the distribution of reservoir properties along carbonate platform margins, the connection between facies, sequence stratigraphy, and early diagenesis of discontinuities along the Bathonian <b>prograding</b> oolitic wedge of the northeastern Aquitaine platform was investigated. Eight facies are distributed along a 50 km-outcropping transect in (1) toe-of-slope, (2) infralittoral <b>prograding</b> oolitic wedge, (3) platform margin (shoal), (4) open marine platform interior, (5) foreshore, and (6) terrestrial settings. The transition from shallow platform to toe-of-slope facies is marked in the field by clinoforms hundred of meters long. Carbonate production was confined to the shallow platform but carbonates were exported basinward toward the breakpoint where they cascaded down a 20 – 25 ° slope. Ooid to intraclast grainstones to rudstones pass into alternating marl-limestone deposits at an estimated paleodepth of 40 – 75 m. Three sea-level falls of about 10 m caused the formation of discontinuities corresponding to sequence boundaries. Along these discontinuities, erosional marine hardgrounds formed in a high-hydrodynamic environment at a water depth of less than 10 m, displaying isopachous fibrous cements and meniscus-type cements. The cements pass landward into meniscus and microstalactitic forms along the same discontinuities, which are characteristic of subaerial exposure. During the deposition of transgressive systems tracts, carbonate accumulation remained located mostly on the shallow platform. Energy level increased and carbonates were exported during the deposition of highstand systems tracts forming the infralittoral <b>prograding</b> oolitic wedge. During the deposition of lowstand systems tracts, carbonate production fell to near zero and intraclast strata, derived from the erosion of hardgrounds on the shallow platform, <b>prograded</b> basinward. Early diagenetic cements are related exclusively to discontinuities that are not found within the <b>prograding</b> wedge because of the continuous high sedimentation rate under lower hydrodynamic conditions. This absence of early cementation within the infralittoral <b>prograding</b> oolitic wedge was conducive to porosity conservation, making such features good targets for carbonate reservoir exploration. This study proposes a novel sequence stratigraphy model for oolitic platform wedges, including facies and early diagenesis features...|$|R

The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular satellites whose <b>prograde</b> and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities.

40|$|<b>Prograded</b> {{barriers}} are distinctive coastal landforms preserving {{the position of}} past shorelines as low relief, shore-parallel ridges composed of beach sediments and commonly adorned with variable amounts of dune sand. <b>Prograded</b> barriers have been valued as coastal archives which contain palaeoenvironmental information, however integrating the millennial timescale geological history of barriers with observed inter-decadal modern beach processes has proved difficult. Technologies such as airborne LiDAR, ground penetrating radar (GPR) and optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL) were utilised at Boydtown and Wonboyn, in southeastern Australia, and combined with previously reported radiocarbon dates and offshore seismic and sedimentological data to reconstruct the morpho-sedimentary history of <b>prograded</b> barrier systems. These technologies enabled reconstruction of geological timescale processes integrated with an inter-decadal model of ridge formation explaining the GPR-imaged subsurface character of the barriers. Both the Boydtown and Wonboyn barriers began <b>prograding</b> ~ 7500 ¿ 8000 years ago when sea level attained at or near present height along this coastline and continued <b>prograding</b> until the present-day with an initially slower rate of shoreline advancement. Sources of sediment for progradation {{appear to be the}} inner shelf and shoreface with a large shelf sand body likely contributing to progradation at Wonboyn. The Towamba River seems to have delivered sediment to Twofold Bay during flood events after transitioning to a mature estuarine system sometime after ~ 4000 cal. yr BP. Some of this material appears to have been reworked onto the Boydtown barrier, increasing the rate of progradation in the seaward 50 % of the barrier deposited over the past ~ 1500 years. The GPR imaged beachfaces are shown to have similar geometry to beach profiles following recent storm events and a model of ridge formation involving cut and fill of the beachface, and dune building in the backshore, explains the character of the preserved beachface record and the morphology of the ridges. This model is applicable to future management of individual beaches where such beaches are subject to ongoing cut and fill, dune building processes and inherited sediment budget conditions...|$|R
40|$|Two depositional {{models to}} account for Holocene gravel-dominated beach ridges covered by dunes, {{occurring}} on the northern coast of Ireland, are considered {{in the light of}} infrared-stimulated luminescence ages of sand units within beach ridges, and 14 C ages from organic horizons in dunes. A new chronostratigraphy obtained from <b>prograded</b> beach ridges with covering dunes at Murlough, north-east Ireland, supports a model of mesoscale alternating sediment decoupling (ASD) on the upper beach, rather than macroscale sequential sediment sourcing {{to account for}} <b>prograded</b> beach ridges and covering dunes. The ASD model specifies storm or fair-weather sand beach ridges forming at high-tide positions (on an annual basis at minimum), which acted as deflationary sources for landward foredune development. Only a limited number of such late-Holocene beach ridges survive in the observed <b>prograded</b> series. Beach ridges only survive when capped by storm-generated gravel beaches that are deposited on a mesoscale time spacing of 50 ? 130 years. The morphodynamic shift from a dissipative beach face for dune formation to a reflective beach face for gravel capping appears to be controlled by the beach sand volume falling to a level where reflective conditions can prevail. Sediment volume entering the beach is thought to have fluctuated as a function of a forced regression associated with the falling sea level from the mid-Holocene highstand (ca. 6000 cal. yr BP) identified in north-east Ireland. The <b>prograded</b> beach ridges dated at ca. 3000 to 2000 cal. yr BP indicate that the Holocene highstand?s regressive phase may have lasted longer than previously specified. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional seismic {{data and}} a {{regional}} seismic sequence {{analysis of the}} Paleocene succession in the southwestern Barents Sea are presented and discussed. The Paleogene Torsk Formation is bounded by a Cretaceous – Paleogene hiatus at the base and an erosional truncation at the top. Well data was tied to the seismic to define the base and top of the Torsk Formation. Based on reflection terminations, three Paleocene progradational units are defined within the Torsk Formation in the Hammerfest and Tromsø basins. A regional depositional model for the <b>prograding</b> system is outlined and applied to describe the depositional history for the Paleocene succession in the SW Barents Sea. The base of the Paleocene succession is an unconformity related to uplift and erosion. Subsidence of {{large parts of the}} Barents Shelf generated accommodation, and deposition initiated in Late Paleocene. The deposition in earliest Paleocene started out as widespread aggradational shelf deposits over large parts of the Barents Shelf, and was later succeeded by a Paleocene progradational system. The system <b>prograded</b> from ENE towards WSW, and uplifted areas on the northern Barents Shelf acted as sediment source. The geometry of the <b>prograding</b> system towards Loppa High shows that the area {{was a part of the}} shallow Barents Shelf during the Early Paleogene, which differs from earlier publications. The area was not a topographic or bathymetric high, but part of the wider Barents Shelf depocenter. Most of the Early Paleogene succession is missing in the Barents Sea due to Late Cenozoic uplift and erosion, but it is expected that the <b>prograding</b> system covered large areas with a significant thickness prior to uplift and erosion...|$|R

50|$|Key to {{understanding}} the Delta Field is {{the formation of the}} Niger Delta. Since the Eocene, the Niger Delta has been <b>prograding</b> to the southwest with sediment coming from the Niger River. As the delta <b>progrades,</b> growth-fault-bounded depobelts are created. These depobelts represent the most active portion of the delta at each stage of its development. They also represent a change in regional dip of the delta. Each depobelt is composed of genetically similar sediments that are diachronous. There are three main provinces of depobelts within the delta: the northern delta province, central delta province, and the distal delta province. The provinces are delineated based on structure. The Delta Field falls into the northern delta province, which has the oldest growth faults compared to the other provinces.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} 38, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits {{are much}} farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between <b>prograde</b> and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or {{debris from the}} breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The largest of the irregular moons is Phoebe, the ninth moon of Saturn, discovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a <b>prograde</b> debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E

Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near {{the outer edge of}} the A Ring, within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.|$|E
40|$|A thick Pleistocene {{shelf and}} nearshore {{cyclical}} succession was {{deposited in the}} S. Mauro sub-basin of the Crotone basin (southern Italy). The regressive units of the cycles are mostly represented by coastal siliciclastic and bioclastic <b>prograding</b> wedges showing a clinoform geometry. These are separated by blanket-like deposits of high lateral persistence recording major transgressive episodes. The aim {{of this paper is}} (1) to describe facies patterns and depositional setting of two <b>prograding</b> wedges, particularly focussing on their polycyclic internal architecture, (2) to analyze these units within a sequence-stratigraphic framework, and (3) to speculate on the possible origin of the small-scale cyclicity. The two wedges analyzed in this paper consist of a number of shingles. Individual shingles consist of two physically connected units: (1) a relatively thin package of sigmoid clinoforms, grading into (2) a volumetrically dominant package of oblique-tangential clinoforms with toplap terminations. The shingles are bounded by seaward-dipping surfaces with sigmoid clinoform geometry, which are ravinement surfaces updip, passing into conformable flooding surfaces downdip. The wedges are thus organized into high-frequency, small-scale sequences, each comprising transgressive, highstand and falling-stage systems tracts. As a whole, individual <b>prograding</b> wedges are interpreted as forced-regressive units, as the shoreline was subject to an overall shift basinwards and downwards along a low-angle trajectory, in spite of the repeated minor relative sea-level rises. Tectonic subsidence, and particularly the syndepositional growth of gentle synclines, are thought to have been the key factors allowing the preservation of these forced-regressive units. Progradation of the wedges took place in a high-energy wave climate characterized by high frequency of storms and very efficient alongshore redistribution of sediments. Recurrent, storm-driven, offshore currents led to intense reworking of sediments on the topset platform and gravity spreading on the foreset slope of the <b>prograding</b> wedges. Well-oxygenated conditions over the shelf due to intensified storm activity during glacial periods may have enhanced the rate of production of skeletal, foramol-type carbonates. It can reasonably be assumed that progradation took place from a line source and that the sand bodies are to be regarded as coastal <b>prograding</b> bodies. In spite of active syndepositional tectonics, the cycles can be correlated to Pleistocene high-amplitude sea-level oscillations. The older of the two wedges can be correlated, through bio-magnetostratigraphy, to the major climatic transition which occurred from the marine oxygen-isotope stage 25 to 24 - 22 (Rio et al., 1996). The younger probably developed during the sea-level fall that ended with substage 18. 2, as suggested by sequence- and bio-stratigraphic data. The <b>prograding</b> wedges are thus interpreted to record long-lived sea-level falls of fourth-order cycles. Due to the particular depositional setting, we are inclined to exclude authigenic mechanisms in the origin of small-scale cyclicity. Although the concomitance and interaction of different controlling factors may be taken into account, it is tempting to ascribe this cyclicity to minor eustatic changes punctuating long-lived, erratic falling stages, possibly accompanied by climate-driven fluctuations of sediment supply. Shelf-perched and shelf-edge <b>prograding</b> units consisting of foramol-type carbonates are apparently a common falling-stage to lowstand depositional feature in the Mediterranean area during the Late Pliocene and Pleistcen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Following the rifting and {{spreading}} {{related to the}} opening of the Tethys Ocean during the Triassic and Early Jurassic, relaxation and subsidence affected its passive margins. In Iran and Oman, such subsidence of the continental margins gave rise to deeper marine', marginal shelf basins, that initially were filled with pelagic sediments, but were progressively infilled by <b>prograding</b> shallow shelf-derived sediments. In Oman the fill sequence is well displayed for study in surface outcrops in the Oman Mountains as well as in subsurface geological and geophysical data. This paper provides an integrated picture of the geometry and facies distribution of the sediments, which filled this marginal shelf basin. The pelagic facies comprises the Rayda Formation and the basin, therefore, is named the Rayda Basin. The <b>prograding,</b> shelf-derived, fill facies comprises the Salil Formation. Surface-type sections of these two formations are described from outcrops in the Oman Mountains. The last stage of the basin fill is represented by a diversified shallow marine facies, referred to as the Habshan Formation, which is defined in Abu Dhabi.

40|$|The Salento {{continental}} shelf of Apulia (southern Adriatic) shows a complex stratigraphic architecture of Pleistocene <b>prograding</b> wedges that records {{the effects of}} the interplay of sediment accumulation, glacio-eustatic sea level changes, and regional tectonics. The interpretation of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles reveals three ravinement surfaces, extending landwards from the shelf break and showing low gradients. They have been considered to be stratigraphic markers and tentatively correlated to the oxygen curves of the isotopic stratigraphy. Even if direct dating of seismic sequences and corresponding unconformities is lacking, this correlation is well supported by the lateral extent and continuity of the ravinement surfaces, recognized in the whole investigated area. Similar qualitative correlation of unconformities with the curves of oxygen-isotope stratigraphy has been already used by other authors in different case histories of continental shelves of both active and passive margins. Moreover, in the study area the regional geological framework suggests that during the Middle Pleistocene the rate of tectonic uplift interacted with the rate of glacio-eustatic fluctuations, producing the deposition of forced-regression systems tracts. The forced-regression <b>prograding</b> wedge that enlarged the shelf by about fifteen kilometers is here dated as Middle Pleistocene. Starting from {{the upper part of the}} Middle Pleistocene, the stratigraphic architecture of the <b>prograding</b> wedges was controlled mainly by glacio-eustatic sea-level changes forced by short-eccentricity cycles. This is suggested by the stratigraphic architecture of the last two <b>prograding</b> wedges, interpreted as incomplete fourth-order depositional sequences and consisting of forced regression,lowstand, and transgressive systems tracts. The eustatic signal as an expression of the Earth’s orbital cyclicity (short eccentricity) appears overwhelming with respect to the tectonic one, and its prominence suggests a decrease in the rate of uplift of the Apulian foreland during the last 250 ky...|$|R
