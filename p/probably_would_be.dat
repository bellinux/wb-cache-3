5|$|On the {{approach}} to and during an actual battle, a well-ordered formation was critical: if a fleet fell into disorder, its ships {{would be unable to}} lend support to each other and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> defeated. Fleets that failed to keep an ordered formation or that could not order themselves into an appropriate counter-formation (antiparataxis) to match that of the enemy, often avoided, or broke off from battle. Tactical manoeuvres were therefore intended to disrupt the enemy formation, including the use of various , such as dividing one's force and carrying out flanking manoeuvres, feigning retreat or hiding a reserve in ambush (Tactica, XIX.52–56). Indeed, Leo VI openly advised (Tactica, XIX.36) against direct confrontation and advocates the use of stratagems instead. According to Leo VI (Tactica, XIX.52), a crescent formation seems to have been the norm, with the flagship in the centre and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. A range of variants and other tactics and counter-tactics was available, depending on the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|If the {{sequence}} of bedrock formations of northern Indiana were exposed, the extensive cliffs along the ‘deep stage’ of the Teays and its tributaries would provide {{a clearer understanding of}} the stratigraphy of northern Indiana. The entire Silurian section below the Liston Creek limestone and a few feet of the upper Ordovician <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> visible in the vicinity of La Fontaine.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Thursday, 9 May, Chamberlain {{attempted to}} form a National Coalition Government. In talks at Downing Street with Viscount Halifax and Churchill, he indicated that he was quite ready to resign if that was necessary for Labour to enter such a government. Attlee and Arthur Greenwood then joined the meeting, and when asked, they indicated that they must first consult their party (then in conference at Bournemouth), but it was unlikely they could serve in a government led by Chamberlain; they <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to serve under some other Conservative.|$|E

500|$|Wanting to [...] "have a {{surprise}} in [...] " [...] {{of the sixth}} season episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On", the writers considered bringing back various deceased characters.

500|$|Meanwhile, the Soviet fleet {{had been}} growing, and outnumbered the U.S. fleet in every type except carriers, and the Navy {{calculated}} they <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{defeated by the}} Soviet Navy in a major conflict. This concern led the Reagan administration to set a goal for a 600-ship Navy, and by 1988 the fleet was at 588, although it declined again in subsequent years. The Iowa-class battleships , , Missouri, and [...] were reactivated after 40 years in storage, modernized, and made showy appearances off the shores of Lebanon and elsewhere. In 1987 and 1988, the United States Navy conducted various combat operations in the Persian Gulf against Iran, most notably Operation Praying Mantis, the largest surface-air naval battle since World War II.|$|E
500|$|Garcia was not {{selected}} {{a member of}} the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His normal window of eligibility has closed, and he would only be elected by decision of the Hall's Veterans Committee. Baseball historian Bill James dismissed Garcia's low ERA due to the [...] "cold, cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which at that time had a pitcher's mound higher than white cliffs of Dover". Referring to Garcia's great seasons of 1949 to 1954, baseball historian Wayne Corbett countered, [...] "Garcia's more famous teammates enjoyed the same home-field advantage, but it was Garcia who recorded the staff's lowest ERA in four of those six seasons." [...] Historian Stephen Lombardi wrote, [...] "It is a shame that Mike Garcia is sometimes disregarded. A career such as his does not deserve to fade away from the memory of the overall baseball public." [...] Cleveland sportswriter and Hall of Fame voter Hal Lebovitz wrote, [...] "If Garcia had pitched long enough, he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in the Hall of Fame." ...|$|E

ADC then-communications director Hussein Ibish wrote that the extended definition trivialized the “very concept of anti-Semitism” and “smears and impugns the motives {{of all those who}} support the human and political rights of Palestinians.” A Merriam-Webster company spokesman stated that the older definition was not supported by current usage and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dropped with publication of a new unabridged version by 2010.|$|E
2500|$|John Baird, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, {{welcomed the}} {{decision}} and praised {{the conduct of the}} referendum. The Premier of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, said that there were limited comparisons between Scotland and Quebec, where the sovereignty movement lost referendums in 1980 and 1995, and suggested a devolved model similar to federalism as a possible future model for the UK: [...] "I think that if the Scots had what we have, Quebecers within Canada, they <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quite happy". Stéphane Bédard, leader of the Parti Québécois, described himself as [...] "disappointed" [...] by the result.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the humour in Lucky Luke {{is based}} on clichés and stereotypes, {{including}} many ethnic stereotypes of [...] "sneaky" [...] Chinese or [...] "lazy" [...] Mexicans, Native Americans, Irish and Italians as well as [...] "darky" [...] depictions of Afro-Americans. According to the Forbidden Planet correspondent: [...] "They played on the clichés of the genre, with humour that nowadays <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered quite racist (lazy Mexicans, sneaky Chinese), but also with a special sort of satire, mirroring contemporary social platitudes." [...] Luke himself however, treats everyone with respect and protects any vulnerable person (stereotype-or-not) against injustice.|$|E

2500|$|In early July 3, 1891, Jacob Kamm and his son, Charles T. Kamm, were {{rushing to}} {{complete}} {{the work on the}} new steamer, in an effort to have the vessel running by July 15, 1891, as the low water in the river could prevent the river steamer then on the route, the T.J. Potter, from making the scheduled time to Ilwaco. [...] On July 15, 1891, it was reported that Ocean Wave had been launched, that the boat had cost $70,000 to construct, and that it bore a “striking resemblance to the T.J. Potter” [...] The new steamer would make connections with the Ilwaco trains and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> run in opposition to the Union Pacific’s boat on the Portland-Ilwaco route.|$|E
2500|$|John Jakala from Anime News Network (ANN) was {{surprised}} by its first chapter because {{of the absence of}} on-screen appearance of the main character on it. He considered it [...] "a daring move" [...] but said [...] "it pays off: I found myself anxious to meet Sakuragi, and curious to see how he will deal with all of the political crises erupting around him." [...] However, Jakala affirmed the first actual appearance of Sakuragi <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more impactaful if his face had not been showed on a Jumbotron {{at the end of the}} chapter. [...] "Still, it was a cute bit", he said. The third chapter had [...] "a very powerful" [...] scene about the formation of a lifelong friendship between Sakuragi and a childhood's friend. Jakala deemed it [...] "inspirational without becoming overly sentimental". On the other hand, he criticized the [...] "'excited' word balloons" [...] in uppercase that seem to be shouting at him as [...] "painfully purple". In the end, Jakala said that [...] "certain situations or lines seem a bit too melodramatic, but overall the series maintains an engaging tone". About its tone, Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics stated it [...] "feature overly dramatic theatrics in the forms of speeches and actions by the protagonist" [...] — which led to a comparison to [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of a man who knows a whole lot more about things than you do and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E
