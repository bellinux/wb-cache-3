40|$|Perron (1989) {{introduced}} {{a variety of}} unit root tests that are valid when <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in the trend function of a time series is present. The motivation was to devise testing procedures that were invariant to {{the magnitude of the}} shift in level and/or slope. In particular, if a change is present it is allowed under both the null and alternative hypotheses. This analysis was carried under the assumption of <b>a</b> known <b>break</b> date. The subsequent literature aimed to devise testing procedures valid in the case of <b>an</b> unknown <b>break</b> date. However, in doing so, most of the literature and, in particular the commonly used test of Zivot and Andrews (1992), assumed that if <b>a</b> <b>break</b> occurs, it does so only under the alternative hypothesis of stationarity. This is undesirable since a) it imposes an asymmetric treatment when allowing for <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> so that the test may reject when the noise is integrated but the trend is changing; b) if <b>a</b> <b>break</b> is present, this information is not exploited to improve the power of the test. In this paper, we propose a testing procedure that addresses both issues. It allows <b>a</b> <b>break</b> under both the null and alternative hypotheses and, when <b>a</b> <b>break</b> is present, the limit distribution of the test is the same {{as in the case of}} <b>a</b> known <b>break</b> date, thereby allowing increased power while maintaining the correct size. Simulation experiments confirm that our procedure offers an improvement over commonly used methods in small samples. JEL Classification Number: C 22...|$|R
