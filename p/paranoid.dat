5000|$|The Crying of Lot 49 was {{published}} shortly after Beatlemania and the [...] "British invasion" [...] {{that took place}} in the United States and other Western countries. Internal context clues indicate that it is probably set in 1964, the year in which A Hard Day's Night was released. Pynchon makes a wide variety of Beatles allusions. Most prominent are The <b>Paranoids,</b> a band composed of cheerful marijuana smokers whose lead singer, Miles, is a high-school dropout. The <b>Paranoids</b> all speak with American accents but sing in English ones; at one point, a guitar player is forced to relinquish control of a car to his girlfriend because he cannot see through his hair. It is not clear whether Pynchon was aware of the Beatles' own nickname for themselves, [...] "Los Para Noias"; since the novel is replete with other references to paranoia, Pynchon may have chosen the band's name for other reasons.|$|R

She appeared to be <b>paranoid</b> and constantly looked out of the windows; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had run away from an abusive partner. Shortly before midnight Molloy left the two, and Sabina stayed the night in Hollinshead's home.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{development}} of Kingdom Hearts II, Nomura had more creative freedom due to advances in technology. Port Royal, Space <b>Paranoids,</b> and Pride Lands, in particular, benefited from these advances. In Port Royal and Space <b>Paranoids,</b> the character models were generated from live-action pictures using a new program. Nomura had wanted to include a world based on The Lion King in the first game, but could not since its engine could not process quadrupedal character models properly, a feature which was resolved for Kingdom Hearts II. A sub-world of Disney Castle is Timeless River, meant to be the [...] "past" [...] of Disney Castle, shortly before it was built. The world is portrayed in black and white; Nomura had intended it {{to be this way}} from the beginning of development. The world has many throwback effects including intentionally poor sound quality to imitate old cartoons. In this grayscale world, Sora's character model is simplified to the style of early cartoons, while Goofy and Donald Duck revert to their original designs from when they first appeared in Disney cartoons.|$|R

5|$|Domitian's reign {{came to an}} end in 96 when he {{was assassinated}} by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was {{condemned}} to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and <b>paranoid</b> tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.|$|E

A winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine, it is Krivenko's research into bone damage that has contributed to enabling humanity to access space easily. Although the Star Cops are independent, Spring's relationship with Krivenko is often deferential and he frequently seems to capitulate to Krivenko's wishes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Moynihan wrote {{a memo to}} President Nixon saying, [...] "The {{time may}} have come when {{the issue of race}} could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect'.
