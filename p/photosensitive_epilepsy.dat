RE may have different subtypes depending on the stimulus characteristic. There are significant clinical and electrophysiologic differences between different RE types. Visual stimuli-sensitive or <b>photosensitive</b> <b>epilepsies</b> constitute {{a large proportion of}} the RE and are mainly related to genetic causes. Reflex epilepsies may present with focal or generalized seizures due to specific triggers, and sometimes seizures may occur spontaneously. The stimuli can be external (light flashes, hot water), internal (emotion, thinking), or both and should be distinguished from triggering precipitants, which most epileptic patients could report such as emotional stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol, and menstrual cycle. Different genetic and acquired factors may play a role in etiology of RE. This review will provide a current overview of the triggering factors and management of reflex seizures.

40|$|<b>Photosensitive</b> reflex <b>epilepsy</b> {{is caused}} by the {{combination}} of an individual’s enhanced sensitivity with relevant light stimuli, such as stroboscopic lights or video games. This is the most common reflex epilepsy in humans; it is characterized by the photoparoxysmal response, which is an abnormal electroencephalographic reaction, and seizures triggered by intermittent light stimulation. Here, by using genetic mapping, sequencing and functional analyses, we report that a mutation in the acceptor site of the second intron of SV 2 A (the gene encoding synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A) is causing <b>photosensitive</b> reflex <b>epilepsy</b> in a unique vertebrate model, the Fepi chicken strain, a spontaneous model where the neurological disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation. This mutation causes an aberrant splicing event and significantly reduces the level of SV 2 A mRNA in homozygous carriers. Levetiracetam, a second generation antiepileptic drug, is known to bind SV 2 A, and SV 2 A knock-out mice develop seizures soon after birth and usually die within three weeks. The Fepi chicken survives to adulthood and responds to levetiracetam, suggesting that the low-level expression of SV 2 A in these animals is sufficient to allow survival, but does not protect against seizures. Thus, the Fepi chicken model shows that the role of the SV 2 A pathway in the brain is conserved between birds and mammals, in spite of a large phylogenetic distance...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} the {{experience}} with fenfluramine in epileptic and other paroxysmal disorders. Since the best available data are from the treatment of Dravet syndrome, we will focus primarily on this condition. Originally fenfluramine was launched as an anorectic agent. As early as 1985, seizure reduction in children could be demonstrated {{in a few cases}} with <b>photosensitive,</b> self-induced <b>epilepsy.</b> Hereafter, a small study was launched in patients with self-induced epilepsy. Results showed a significant seizure reduction, and review of the patient data showed that 5 of the 12 patients had Dravet syndrome. During that observation period, fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market because of cardiovascular side effects associated with prescribing higher doses in combination with phentermine for weight loss. In March 2002, a Belgian Royal Decree was issued permitting further study of fenfluramine in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. In 2011 under the Royal Decree, a prospective study of patients with Dravet syndrome treated with low-dose fenfluramine was initiated and is currently ongoing. The initial results are promising in terms of reduction of seizure frequency and overall tolerability. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{delineate}} phenotypic heterogeneity, {{we describe}} the clinical features of a cohort of patients with GABRA 1 gene mutations. Methods: Patients with GABRA 1 mutations were ascertained through an international collaboration. Clinical, EEG, and genetic data were collected. Functional analysis of 4 selected mutations was performed using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. Results: The study included 16 novel probands and 3 additional family members with a disease-causing mutation in the GABRA 1 gene. The phenotypic spectrum varied from unspecified epilepsy (1), juvenile myoclonic <b>epilepsy</b> (2), <b>photosensitive</b> idiopathic generalized <b>epilepsy</b> (1), and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (1) to severe epileptic encephalopathies (11). In the epileptic encephalopathy group, the patients had seizures beginning between {{the first day of}} life and 15 months, with a mean of 7 months. Predominant seizure types in all patients were tonic-clonic in 9 participants (56 %) and myoclonic seizures in 5 (31 %). EEG showed a generalized photoparoxysmal response in 6 patients (37 %). Four selected mutations studied functionally revealed a loss of function, without a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. Conclusions: GABRA 1 mutations make a significant contribution to the genetic etiology of both benign and severe epilepsy syndromes.

40|$|Introduction: Our aim is {{to define}} the electroclinical {{characteristics}} of patients with <b>photosensitive</b> idiopathic generalized <b>epilepsy</b> (IGE) and to investigate the differences in seizure types, therapy and outcome between subgroups, based on photoparoxysmal response (PPR) /EEG characteristics and different syndromes. Patients and Methods: Fifty consecutive patients with a diagnosis of IGE and having EEG or clinical evidence for photosensitivity have been identified from the epilepsy outpatient clinic database of the Department of Neurology (Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University). Clinical and EEG data was collected retrospectively. Results: Thirty-six female and 14 male patients with median age 25. 5 (14 - 63) were included to the study. The juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) subgroup (n: 24) had a significantly higher current age (p= 0. 035) and age at onset of seizures (p= 0. 029) compared with the absence epilepsy (AE) (n: 12). Sleep deprivation triggers the seizures significantly more often in the JME subgroup compared with AE (p= 0. 003). Seizure records during EEG significantly more often in patients with AE (p= 0. 016). Patients with prolonged PPRs experienced significantly more clinical seizures during an EEG recording than patients with self-limited PPRs (p= 0. 000). The patients who were not seizure free had significantly more absence seizures (AS) (initially) compared with the patients who became seizure free (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: Our findings in a retrospective cohort suggest that having AS is a negative prognostic factor for the seizure outcome in patients with photosensitive IGE...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the electroclinical features of subjects who {{presented with a}} <b>photosensitive</b> benign myoclonic <b>epilepsy</b> in infancy (PBMEI). Methods: The patients were selected {{from a group of}} epileptic subjects with seizure onset in infancy or early childhood. Inclusion criteria were the presence of photic-induced myoclonic seizures and a favorable outcome. Cases with less than 24 month follow up were excluded from the analysis. Results: Eight patients were identified (4 males, 4 females). Personal history was uneventful. All of them had familial antecedents of epilepsy. Psychomotor development was normal in 6 cases, both before and after seizure onset. One patient showed a mild mental retardation and a further patient showed some behavioral disturbances. Neuroradiological investigations, when performed (5 cases), gave normal results. The clinical manifestations were typical and could vary from upward movements of the eyes to myoclonic jerks of the head and shoulders, isolated or briefly repetitive, never causing a fall. Age of onset was between 11 months and 3 years and 2 months. Characteristically, the seizures were always triggered by photic stimulation. Non photo-induced spontaneous myoclonic attacks were reported in 2 cases during the follow-up. Other types of seizures were present at follow-up in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable, even if, usually, seizure control required high AED plasma levels. Since the clinical symptoms were not recognized early, some patients were treated only many years after the onset of symptoms. Conclusion: Among BMEI patients, our cases constitute a subgroup in which myoclonic jerks were always triggered by photostimulation, in particular at onset of their epilepsy. © 2006 International League Against Epilepsy...|$|R
