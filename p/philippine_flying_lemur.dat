50|$|The Sunda flying lemur {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout Southeast Asia, {{ranging from the}} Sunda Shelf mainland to other islands - Northern Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia (Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak), Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatera, Bali, Java), and many adjacent islands. Conversely, the <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> (C. volans) is confined to the southern parts of the Philippines only.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> is {{endemic to}} the {{southern}} Philippines. Its population is concentrated in the Mindanao region and Bohol. Colugos live in heavily forested areas, living mainly {{high up in the}} trees in lowland and mountainous forests or sometimes in coconut and rubber plantations, rarely coming down to the ground. The types of forests they inhabit are mainly primary and secondary forests.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> is a folivore, eating mainly young {{leaves and}} {{occasionally}} soft fruits, flowers, plant shoots and insects. They also obtain {{a significant amount}} of their water from licking wet leaves and from the water in the plants and fruits themselves. Most of their nutrition is obtained from jumping and gliding between trees high in the canopy; rarely do they eat on the forest floor.|$|E
50|$|Prey {{specimens}} {{found at}} the eagle's nest have ranged in size from a small bat weighing 10 g to a Philippine deer weighing 14 kg. The primary prey varies from island to island depending on species availability, particularly in Luzon and Mindanao, because the islands are in different faunal regions. For example, the tree squirrel-sized <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs,</b> the preferred prey in Mindanao, are absent in Luzon. The primary prey for the eagles seen in Luzon are monkeys, birds, flying foxes, giant cloud-rats Phloeomys pallidus which can weigh {{twice as much as}} <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs</b> at 2 to 2.5 kg, and reptiles such as large snakes and lizards. The <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> could make up an estimated 90% of the raptor's diet in some locations. While the eagles generally seem to prefer <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs</b> where available, most other animals found in the Philippines, short of adult ungulates and humans, may be taken as prey. This can include Asian palm civets (12% of the diet in Mindanao), macaques, flying squirrels, tree squirrels, fruit bats, rats, birds (owls and hornbills), reptiles (snakes and monitor lizards), and even other birds of prey. They have been reported to capture young pigs and small dogs.|$|R

40|$|The {{superorder}} Archonta {{has been}} hypothesized to include primates, tree shrews, bats, and <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs</b> as descendants {{of a common}} ancestor. More recently, a diphyletic origin for bats has been proposed. To evaluate these hypotheses, the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene was determined from a bushbaby (Galago senegalensis), <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cynocephalus variegatus), tree shrew (Tupaia glis), spear-nosed bat (Phyllostomus hastatus), rousette bat (Rousettus leschenaulti), and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and was compared with published sequences of a human, cow, and mouse. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences give evidence that primates, tree shrews, and <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs</b> have a recent common ancestor but that bats are genealogically distant. The monophyletic origin of bats is supported. Contrary to interpretations based on morphological data, tree shrews are shown {{to be no more}} closely affiliated with primates than are <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs.</b> Analyses of the cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene give marginally more support to a Dermoptera-Scandentia clade than to a Dermoptera-Primates clade...|$|R
50|$|The Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus), {{also known}} as the Malayan flying lemur, Sunda Colugo or Malayan colugo, is a species of colugo. Until recently, it was thought to be one of only two species of flying lemur, the other being the <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> which is found only in the Philippines. The Sunda flying lemur is found {{throughout}} Southeast Asia in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.|$|E
50|$|The park also {{supports}} six species of large mammals namely, the Philippine tarsier, long-tailed macaque, <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur,</b> Malayan civet, Asian palm civet and Philippine warty pig. It {{is also a}} habitat of some rodent species, such as the Philippine forest rat, rice-field rat and Mindanao hairy-tailed rat. The more than 100 caves also hold several species of bats and swiftlets. Its forest cover is dominated by native dipterocarp trees such as molave.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{interesting}} animals that inhabit the area in and around Abaga Falls. The most notable include; the endangered Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) also commonly known as the [...] "monkey-eating eagle", the rufous hornbill (Buceros hydrocorax), the endangered giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus) which can only be found in the Philippines, and the <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cynocephalus volans). Many of these animals are either near extinction or in danger of losing their habitats due to human activities.|$|E
5000|$|The patagium is a fleshy {{membrane}} that {{is found}} in gliding mammals such as <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs,</b> <b>flying</b> squirrels, sugar gliders and the extinct Volaticotherium. These mammals all acquired the patagium independently.|$|R
5000|$|The Sunda <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> mainly forages in tree canopies. It may forage {{on several}} {{different}} tree species {{in a single}} night, or on a single species. It {{can also be seen}} licking tree bark of selected tree species to obtain water, nutrients, salts, and minerals. [...] Though the Sunda <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> has been reported to also occur in gardens and plantations, the species resides in forests primarily.|$|R
50|$|Other {{endemic species}} include the eagle-owl, Philippine hawk-eagle, rufous-lored kingfisher, Philippine leafbird and {{miniature}} tit-babbler and <b>flying</b> <b>lemur.</b>|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{reproductive}} behavior in colugos. The female <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> usually gives birth to one young after a two-month gestation period. The young is born undeveloped and helpless and it attaches itself to its mother's belly, in a pouch formed from the mother's tail membrane. They are eventually weaned around 6 months old, and they leave their mother's patagium. Adult size and sexual maturity is reached between two and three years of age. Mating usually occurs between January and March.|$|E
50|$|Both {{species are}} {{threatened}} by habitat destruction, and the <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> was once classified by the IUCN as vulnerable. In 1996 The IUCN declared the species vulnerable owing to destruction of lowland forests and hunting. It was downlisted to Least Concern status in 2008, but still faces the same threats. In addition to the ongoing clearing of its rainforest habitat, it is hunted for its meat and fur. It is also a favorite prey item for the gravely endangered Philippine eagle: some studies suggest colugos account for 90% of the eagle's diet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> is {{arboreal}} and nocturnal {{and usually}} resides in {{primary and secondary}} forests. However, some wander into coconut, banana, and rubber plantations as deforestation for farming and industry is an increasingly prevalent problem. The colugo sleeps in hollow trees or clings onto branches in dense foliage during daytime. When they engage in this hanging behavior from branches, they keep their heads upright, unlike bats. On the ground, colugos are slow and clumsy, and not able to stand erect, so they rarely leave the canopy level of the forest where they glide {{from tree to tree}} to get to food or their nests which are also high in the trees. In the trees, though, colugos are quite effective climbers, though they are slow; they move in a series of lingering hops as they use their claws to move up the tree trunk. Foraging only at night, colugos on average forage for 9.4 minutes about 12 times per night. They typically leave their nests at dusk to begin their foraging activity. When foraging, returning to the nest, or just moving around, the <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> uses its patagium to glide from tree to tree. The patagium is also used for cloaking the colugo when it is clinging to a tree trunk or branch, and sometimes it is even seen curled up in a ball, using its patagium again as a cloaking mechanism among palm fronds often in coconut plantations. Colugos maintain height in the trees to avoid predators that may live in lower levels, but they are still susceptible to other predators that can reach these higher levels of the canopy and predatory birds that can attack from above. They live alone, but several may be seen in the same tree where they maintain their distance from one another and are very territorial of their personal areas. Though they are not social mammals, they do engage in a unique semisocial behavior where colugos living in the same relative area or tree follow each other's gliding paths through the trees in search of food. This may be a defense mechanism where, as a population, the safest route possible is determined and shared as a sort of cooperative mechanism for increased survival rates. The only time colugos actually live socially is after a mother has given birth; then she will care for and live with her offspring until they are weaned; at that point, the offspring is on its own. The average lifespan of the <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> is unknown.|$|E

50|$|Large mammals are {{not found}} on Penang Hill. Wild boars, small and {{medium-sized}} mammals such as the squirrels, monkeys and tree shrews can be seen. A number of species found in these hills are nocturnal. These include the civets, <b>flying</b> <b>lemurs,</b> <b>flying</b> civets and bats.|$|R
50|$|An average <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> {{weighs about}} 1.0 to 1.7 kg and its head-body length is 33-38 cm (13-15 inch). Its tail length is 17-27 cm (6.7-10.6 inch). The species does exhibit sexual {{dimorphism}} where females {{are a bit}} larger than males. It has a wide head and rostrum with a robust mandible for increased bite strength, small ears, and big eyes with unique photoreceptor adaptations adapted for its nocturnal lifestyle. The large eyes allow for excellent vision which the colugo uses to accurately jump and glide from tree to tree. It has an avascular retina which is not typical of mammals, suggesting this is a primitive trait; on par with other nocturnal mammals, specifically nocturnal primates, the rod cells in the eye make up about 95-99% of the photoreceptors and cones make up about 1-5%. Its clawed feet are large and sharp with an incredible grip strength, allowing them to skillfully but slowly climb trees, hang from branches, or anchor themselves to {{the trunk of a}} tree. One unique feature of the colugo is the patagium, the weblike membrane that connects its limbs to allow for gliding. Unlike other mammals with patagia, its patagium extends from the neck to the limbs, in between digits, and even behind the hind limbs and the tail. Its keeled sternum, which is also seen in bats, aids in its gliding efficiency. Its patagium is the most extensive membrane used for gliding in mammals and also functions as a hammock-like pouch for its young. This membrane helps it glide distances of 100 m or more, useful for finding food and escaping predators, such as the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) and tree-climbing snakes that try to attack the colugos when they glide between trees. The dental formula of <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> is 2/3, 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, with a total of 34 teeth. The first two lower procumbant incisors are pectinate with up to 15 tines which are thought to be used for grooming and grating food. The upper incisors are small and have spaces between them, as well. The deciduous teeth are serrated until they are lost and then they are replaced with blade-like teeth, designed to shear along with the molars that also have long shearing crests to help break down the plant matter they ingest. Following mechanical digestion, the digestive tract of the <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur,</b> especially the stomach, is specially adapted to break down and process the large amount of leaves and vegetation they ingest. Colugos also have a brownish grey-and-white pelage they use as camouflage amongst the tree trunks and branches, which allows them to better hide from predators and hunters.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> or Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans, {{made famous}} in the TV show 'Avatar'), known locally as the kagwang, {{is one of two}} species of flying lemurs, the only two living species in the order Dermoptera. [...] Additionally, it is {{the only member of the}} genus Cynocephalus. The other species is the Sunda flying lemur. Recent {{research}} from genetic analysis suggests two other species, the Bornean flying lemur and the Javan flying lemur, may exist as well; but they have yet to be officially classified so. Although called a flying lemur, it cannot fly and is not a lemur. Both species of Dermoptera are classified under the superorder Euarchonta which includes the Scandentia and the primates, as well as an extinct order of mammals, the Plesiadapiformes.|$|E

5000|$|Colugos (...) are {{arboreal}} gliding mammals {{found in}} Southeast Asia. Just two extant species {{make up the}} entire family Cynocephalidae (...) and order Dermoptera.

50|$|The Sunda <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> is a {{skillful}} climber, but is helpless when on the ground. Its gliding membrane connects from the neck, extending along the limbs to {{the tips of}} the fingers, toes and nails. This kite-shaped skin is known as a patagium, which is expanded for gliding. It can glide over a distance of 100 m with a loss of less than 10 m in elevation. It can maneuver and navigate while gliding, but strong rain and wind can affect its ability to glide. Gliding usually occurs in open areas or high in the canopy, especially in dense tropical rainforest. The Sunda <b>flying</b> <b>lemur</b> needs a certain distance to glide and to land to avoid injury. The highest landing forces are experienced after short glides; longer glides lead to softer landings, due to the colugo's ability to brake its glide aerodynamically. The ability to glide increases a colugo's access to scattered food resources in the rainforest, without increasing exposure to terrestrial or arboreal predators.|$|R
