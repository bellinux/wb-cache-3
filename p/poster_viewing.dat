The local organization of the meeting was done {{under the auspices of the}} Medical Genetic Centre South-West, The Netherlands (MGC), c/o Department of Radiation Genetics and Chemical Mutagenesis, University of Leiden (The Netherlands). Local organizers were: D. Bootsma (chairman), W. Ferro, J. H. J. Hoeijmakers, A. R. Lehmann, P. H. M. Lohman, L. Mullenders, and A. A. van Zeeland (secretarial assistance: Mrs. C. Escher-van Heerden and Mrs. R. Bontre). Over 190 scientists participated, and the format of the meeting followed that of the 1987 {{workshop on}} the 'Molecular Aspects of DNA Repair' (Friedberg et al., 1987). Plenary review talks in the mornings were followed, in the afternoon, by <b>poster</b> <b>viewing</b> in three or four parallel sessions. Groups of 15 - 20 posters were discussed in detail, and later on, in plenary sessions, chairpersons of the poster discussions reviewed the afternoons' posters. The principal themes of the meeting were the isolation and characterisation of repair genes and proteins, repair in specific sequences, consequences of defective DNA repair, and new methods for detecting DNA damage and repair. Remarkable progress has been made recently in all of these areas, and many exciting new results were presented. It is impossible to summarize all contributions to this (intensive) one-week meeting.

Objectives: To examine the psychosocial impact on women with concurrent abnormal cytology and positive HPV results. Methods: Ethnic Chinese women who received reflex HPV testing following a borderline cytology result (ASCUS) were recruited from five community-based well women's clinics in Hong Kong. A group with normal cytology (HPV unknown) was included as control. The participants' psychological and psychosocial status was assessed with self-administered questionnaires immediately before and after smear result disclosure and by telephone interview 6 months afterwards. The adapted Breast Cancer Worry Scale and HPV Impact Profile (HIP) were used to measure cancer worry and HPV-related burden. We also asked women the chance that their smear results {{could be attributed to}} their sex partner. The findings of these outcomes measured immediately after results disclosure is presented. Results: 685 women (aged 16 to 67 years) were recruited to form three groups of study subjects (ASCUS-HPV positive= 275; ASCUS-HPV negative= 212; control= 198). In the HPV positive group, 32. 8 % felt quite/very worried about having cervical cancer in future (versus 13. 9 % and 3. 6 % in the HPV negative group and control group, respectively). In multivariate analysis, cytology-HPV status had significant overall effect on the outcomes (F= 3. 88, df= 4, p= 0. 004). Controlling for the covariate age, pair wise comparisons showed that the HPV positive group had significantly higher cancer worry and HPV burden than the HPV negative group and control group. Among ASCUS women, 16. 7 % of HPV positive women versus 7. 4 % of HPV negative women believed there was a high/very high chance that their sex partner was responsible for their smear results. Conclusions: HPV positivity intensified the psychological and psychosocial burden borne by women with a borderline cervical abnormality...|$|E

Previously we found that peroxynitrite (ONOO-) {{plays an important role}} in HT after t-PA treatment. Here we test the CONCLUSIONS: Unerupted permanent incisors could be associated with other dental anomalies. Clinicians should be aware of such an association and thereby should look for presence of any dental anomalies in patients with unerupted incisors. hypothesis that baicalin, a highly-safe natural compound capable of scavenging peroxynitrite, could attenuate HT in a rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model with delayed t-PA treatment. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 5 hours plus reperfusion 19 hours. T-PA (10 mg/kg) or t-PA plus baicalin (50, 100, 150 mg/kg) was administrated via femoral vein at 4. 5 hours after MCAO. RESULTS: Delayed t-PA treatment significantly increased the mortality rate, induced hemorrhagic transformation, and exacerbated blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain edema, and neurological deficit at 24 hours after ischemia. Such deleterious effects of t-PA were dosedependently and significantly attenuated by baicalin cotreatment. Delayed t-PA treatment substantially increased 3 -NT (a biomarker of peroxynitrite) formation in ischemic hemispheres, leading to active MMP- 9 overproduction, which were also greatly prevented by baicalin cotreatment. CONCLUSION: Baicalin is a potential candidate for combination therapy in ischemic stroke to reduce HT and other complications induced by delayed t-PA treatment, possibly via inhibiting ONOO- mediated active MMP- 9 production.

We prospectively studied the efficacy and safety of hyperfractionated (HF) IMRT and compared to a historical cohort treated with conventionally fractionated (CF) IMRT. MATERIALS/METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with locoregionally advanced (T 3 -T 4, N 0 -N 1, M 0) NPC prospectively recruited and treated with induction chemotherapy gemcitabine/platinum for 3 cycles followed by 9 -field (HF-IMRT) (64. 8 Gy/ 54 fr/ 5. 5 weeks, twice daily, interfractional interval 37 hours) concurrent with weekly platinum for 6 cycles. Objective response rate (ORR), local failure-free survival (LFFS), regional failure-free survival (RFFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment-related complications were compared to a historical cohort of another 10 patients in the same setting treated with 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by CF-IMRT (60 Gy/ 30 fr/ 6 weeks). RESULTS: Median age was 59. 5 years (HF-IMRT) and 44. 0 years (CF-IMRT, P=. 764). After a median follow up of 27. 9 months (range 5. 2 to 69. 0 months), ORR were 40. 0 % (HF-IMRT) and 30. 0 % (CF-IMRT, P=. 871) respectively. Median LFFS showed a trend in favor of HF-IMRT (33. 6 months [95 % CI 12. 2 – 55. 1 months] vs 14. 8 months [95 % CI 14. 1 – 15. 4 months], P=. 179). RFFS (40. 8 months vs not reached, P=. 857) and OS (31. 9 months vs 34. 3 months, P=. 681) were not different between the 2 groups. Commonest chronic treatment-related complications were brain necrosis (10. 0 % in HF-IMRT vs 20. 0 % in CF-IMRT; P=. 531), aspiration pneumonia (40. 0 % in HF-IMRT vs 20. 0 % in CF-IMRT; P=. 329) and hemorrhage (0 % in HF-IMRT vs 30. 0 % in CF-IMRT; P=. 060). CONCLUSION: HF-IMRT offered marginally better LFFS and relatively less treatment-related hemorrhage compared to CF-IMRT in locoregionally advanced recurrent NPC. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{symposium}} Kuwa Tayari (“be prepared” in English) : finding {{pathways to}} nutrition and food security resilience {{in response to}} climate change in East Africa was held in Eldoret, Kenya, in May, 2016. The goals of this symposium were to increase awareness, stimulate research ideas and recommendations, catalyse the development of training opportunities, and provide an evidence base for policy and decision-making in these regions in preparation for, and response to, our changing world. Here, we describe the structure, aims, and outcome of the symposium. Methods: The 2 -day symposium was a partnership initiative between University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto, Canada, and Moi University, College of Health Sciences, School of Public Health in Eldoret, Kenya. Target audiences were scientists, students, and educators in public health, environmental studies, agriculture, agroecology, civil society, non-government organisations, and government stakeholders. Symposium organisers did a literature review to develop a background paper that helped inform the selection of five planetary health subthemes of the symposium: (1) agriculture, nutrition, and agro-biodiversity; (2) water security; (3) renewable and sustainable cooking fuels; (4) nutrition and food security issues affecting vulnerable populations; and (5) human rights and sustainable development. The symposium format consisted of keynote and oral abstract presentations, plenary discussions, small group work, <b>poster</b> <b>viewing</b> sessions, and networking opportunities. A final report was produced to highlight key outcomes and recommendations. Findings: There were 121 attendees at the symposium from 26 institutions in Kenya, Uganda, Canada, USA, and elsewhere; most were from academic and community organisations. Participants' reasons for attending were met: personal growth and development, networking, research, course and training ideas, and potential collaborations. There was consensus {{on the need to}} invest in innovative, context-specific, climate-smart agricultural practices that support sustainable livelihoods and development, and improve food security at the household level throughout east Africa. Interpretation: Multisectoral, transdisciplinary, community-based, and population health research and interventions are needed to address the complex and interconnected issues of climate change, nutrition, and food security. Within east Africa, participatory initiatives that engage vulnerable populations (such as women, pastoral populations, and the urban poor), and those that integrate indigenous food system practices are crucial. Training priorities should be in the areas of integration of climate change topics into existing public health curriculums, and novel interdisciplinary courses on planetary health.

40|$|This {{award was}} {{intended}} to provide financial support for an international astrophysics conference on gravitational lensing which was held at Boston University from July 25 to July 30, 1999. Because {{of the nature of}} the award, no specific research was proposed, nor was any carried out. The participants at the conference presented results of their on-going research efforts, and written summaries of their presentations have been published by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific as part of their conference series. The reference to the conference proceedings book is Gravitational Lensing: Recent Progress and Future Goals, ASP Conference Series volume 237, eds. T. G. Brainerd and C. S. Kochanek (2001). The ISBN number of this book is 1 - 58381 - 074 - 9. The goal of the conference was to bring together both senior and junior investigators who were actively involved in all aspects of gravitational lensing research. This was the first conference in four years to address gravitational lensing from such a broad perspective (the previous such conference being IAU Symposium 173 held in Melbourne, Australia in July 1995). The conference was attended by 190 participants, who represented of order 70 different institutions and of order 15 different countries. The Scientific Organizing Committee members were Matthias Bartelmann (co-chair), Tereasa Brainerd (co-chair), Ian Browne, Richard Ellis, Nick Kaiser, Yannick Mellier, Sjur Refsdal, HansWalter Rix, Joachim Wambsganss, and Rachel Webster. The Local Organizing Committee members were Tereasa Brainerd (chair), Emilio Falco, Jacqueline Hewitt, Christopher Kochanek, and Irwin Shapiro. The oral sessions were organized around specific applications of gravitational lensing and included invited reviews, invited 'targeted talks', and contributed talks. The review speakers were Roger Blandford, Tereasa Brainerd, Gus Evrard, Nick Kaiser, Guinevere Kaufmann, Chris Kochanek, Charley Lineweaver, Gerry Luppino, Shude Mao, Paul Schechter, Peter Snhneider, amd Ed Turner. The 'targeted talk' speakers were Andy Boden, Ian Browne, Emilio Falco, Harry Ferguson, Bhuvnesh Jain, Christine Jones, Arlie Petters, Hans-Walter Rix, Penny Sackett, Prasenjit Saha, Virginia Trimble, and Joachim Wambsganss. Due to limited time, only 25 % of the abstracts which were submitted for consideration as contributed talks could actually be accepted for the final program; those which were not selected as talks were presented as posters, and a special <b>poster</b> <b>viewing</b> session was held to allow participants to present their work.

40|$|<b>Poster</b> <b>Viewing</b> and Discussion 28 : no. P 28 - 3 Background We {{conducted}} a hospital-based study {{to investigate the}} prevalence and associated risk factors for progression of structural MRI markers of cerebral aging and vascular damage (white matter ischemia, cerebral microbleeds, and hippocampal volume loss) in high-risk non-demented adults. Methods We recruited 29 older non-demented adults (mean 73. 8 ± 8. 5 years, 66 % male), who underwent two brain MRIs at least 1 year apart (mean 2 ± 0. 9 years), from a University Hospital. The 3 T MR images were examined for the severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH, Fazekas score 0 - 3), cerebral microbleeds (CMB, Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale), and hippocampal volume (HV, Scheltens score 0 - 4). Comparisons were made {{between the first and}} second MRI for each patient. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses with SPSS. Ethical approval was obtained. Results In our 29 participants, 38 % were current/ex-smokers, 83 % had hypertension, 35 % had diabetes mellitus, 21 % had coronary heart disease, 65 % had previous stroke, 62 % had hyperlipidemia, and 7 % had atrial fibrillation (AF). For medications, 35 % were on statins, 69 % on antiplatelet agents, and 10 % on oral anticoagulants. MRI at baseline showed that 100 % had subcortical WMH, 83 % had periventricular WMH, 57 % had CMB, and 48 % had abnormal HV. During a mean interval of 2 years, 31 % had more severe WMH, 28 % had more CMB, and 38 % had deterioration in their HV. Multivariate analyses found that age (p= 0. 004), diabetes mellitus (p= 0. 018), coronary heart disease (p= 0. 033), hyperlipidaemia (p= 0. 014), AF (p= 0. 046) and a stroke history (p= 0. 005) predicted progression of WMH. Patients with WMH also had a lower white cell count (p= 0. 018) and platelet count (p= 0. 016) compared with those who did not. Age or vascular risk factors did not predict the progression of CMB or HV. Use of antiplatelet agents, oral anticogulants or statins at baseline had no significant influence. Conclusion Amongst high-risk aging adults, structural MRI markers of cerebral aging and vascular damage are highly prevalent, and progression is common and rapid. Vascular risk factors are the major determinants of progression of white matter ischaemia, but not cerebral microbleeds or hippocampal volume loss. The effectiveness of vascular prevention on cerebral aging and vascular damage is yet to be proven...|$|E

MATERIALS/METHODS: The volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans (by Eclipse Treatment Planning System version 10. 0) of two prospective-recruited patients treated with post-operative spinal SBRT after surgical decompression with titanium implantation for spinal cord compression were generated with application of electron densities of 4. 50 g/cm 3 (titanium) and 1. 0 g/cm 3 (water) to the titanium {{and its associated}} metallic artefacts based on their respective Hounsfield units (Hus) before treatment optimization. An override with electron density of 1. 82 g/cm 3 (cortical bone) {{was applied to the}} titanium implant to the same set of CT images including the target volumes and organs-at-risk followed by dose re-calculation without optimization. The same sets of planning CT images were re-planned by algorithms for proton therapy after conversion from HUs to the relative stopping powers (RSPs) for the titanium hardware and metallic artefacts followed by dose re-calculation without re-optimization after density and RSP override with those for cortical bone. Planning target volume (PTV) to the involved spine was given 24 Gy in 2 fractions and the dose to planning volume of spinal cord (PRV_SC) was limited to 17 Gy in 2 fractions. Doses to the clinical target volume (CTV), PTV, spinal cord (SC) and planning volume for spinal cord (PRV_SC) were compared before and after density override and between protons and photons. RESULTS: An average increase in dose by 6. 5 % (range - 0. 1 % – + 17. 0 %), 7. 9 % (range - 0. 7 % – + 23. 9 %), 8. 8 % (range - 21. 2 % – + 33. 3 %) and 6. 6 % (range - 7. 1 % – + 22. 3 %) for protons and an average corresponding increase in dose by 1. 7 % (range - 1. 4 % – + 5. 4 %), 1. 5 % (range - 1. 4 % – + 2. 5 %), 2. 2 % (range - 7. 0 % – + 15. 4 %) and 1. 1 % (range - 7. 1 % – + 5. 9 %) for CTV, PTV, SC and PRV_SC respectively for photons were observed after density override from 4. 5 g/cm 3 to 1. 82 g/cm 3. In general, larger percentage differences in dosimetric parameters were demonstrated after density override for protons compared to photons. CONCLUSION: Titanium hardware caused larger dosimetric variations in protons after density override, probably due to its larger RSP against protons compared to photons. Density override with the electron density of individual artificial material should be seriously considered when treatment is delivered by protons. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe conference {{highlighted}} the latest scientific results and technical developments from VLBI, space VLBI and e-VLBI. All fields of astrophysics were concerned - stellar, galactic and extragalactic - {{as well as}} astrometry and planetary science. Presentations addressing synergy between (e-) VLBI and other new or planned radio facilities (ALMA, LOFAR, e-MERLIN, [...] .) or instruments at other wavelengths (Fermi, CTA, Gaia, [...] .) were also {{an integral part of}} the program. The scientific program was organized in 11 sessions including 71 oral presentations, with an additional 43 <b>posters</b> available for <b>viewing</b> during the entire length of the conference. An EVN Users Meeting was also held during one of the evening to foster interaction between the EVN users and the EVN organization. The symposium was attended by a total of 122 delegates originating from 47 institutes world-wide, sharing new VLBI science and innovations while also building links with other communities...|$|R
40|$|Many {{specialist}} societies present ‘best poster’ prizes, yet without {{generally agreed}} assessment methods. 31 posters at a neurology meeting were divided randomly into two sets; 14 neurologists, randomized into two groups, were each assigned one poster set. They ‘quick scored’ the first half, <b>viewing</b> <b>posters</b> for 10 - 15 seconds, and ‘detailed scored’ the others. 11 administrators and pharmaceutical representatives quick scored all posters. Neurologists' quick score ranking correlated highly (r= 0. 75) with other neurologists' detailed score ranking, and identified {{four of their}} six top-ranked posters. Correlations were strongest for presentation (r= 0. 65), message (r= 0. 65) and star-quality (r= 0. 64), but weak for facts (r= 0. 09), originality (r= 0. 15) or science (r= 0. 02). Non-neurologists could not identify the posters ranked highest by neurologists. We conclude that quick ranking by specialists can efficiently identify the best posters for more detailed assessment. On this basis we offer poster-scoring guidelines for use at scientific meetings...|$|R
40|$|Graduate {{students}} in applied {{areas such as}} psychology and public health often collect data for their dissertation projects and are typically faced with constraints that result in their samples being viewed as mere convenience samples. In describing their sampling plan and its limitations, students often struggle to evaluate {{the quality of their}} sampling procedures. This <b>poster</b> takes the <b>view</b> that all samples of human participants are convenience samples to some degree, {{if for no other reason}} than ethical considerations make participation voluntary and financial limits make pure random sampling exorbitantly expensive. According to this view, psychology and other applied fields are disciplines built on convenience samples. In spite of the use of convenience samples, applied statistics and data analysis procedures are useful in making advances in applied research. Because some convenience samples may be better than others, this poster session will examine factors and issues in sample selection. The aim is initiate discussion that will result in a framework that graduate students can use to address how to generalize their results...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This <b>poster</b> {{reports the}} <b>views</b> {{of parents of}} young people with {{intellectual}} disabilities in their last year at school about personal, family, school and employment service factors that influence their vocational decisions. Method: A sample was drawn of 87 young people leaving school in 2005 and experiencing different approaches to transition to employment. Detailed qualitative interviews with a parent gained {{their views on the}} impact of school and service inputs on family decisions on next career steps. A sub-sample of 32 cases provided further detail on the impact on transition decisions of the characteristics of the young person, family structure, experience of school and resources. Results: The most common next step decision is for a college place. Careers advice favoured a college exit route for these school leavers. Many parents were still unaware of the options available after school. The decision for employment by families was linked to significant work experience inputs while at school, family employment views and status, and young person’s motivation. Fear of losing stable welfare benefit income affected some. Conclusion: Changes are needed in the way government conceptualises vocational development for this group. How we inform young people/families over next career steps must take account of family background and experiences...|$|R
