40|$|Why do {{individuals}} work overtime? In {{this study}} we tried {{to answer this question}} by arguing that individuals with extrinsic needs work overtime to increase their chances for promotion and pay raise. Furthermore we analyzed how certain characteristics of the national context moderate this relation. We used four waves of the ESS-data (2002 - 2008) to investigate our statements.
