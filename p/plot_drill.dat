40|$|Seed depth {{consistency}} is {{a critical}} performance metric of agricultural seeding equipment. To improve productivity, equipment manufacturers have historically focused on increasing the equipment working width of hoe-opener style seeding drills (hoe drills). However, the physical limitations of hoe drill size do present a design challenge. Increasing seeding speed to improve equipment productivity {{continues to be a}} challenge for equipment designers. Most operating conditions restrict hoe-drill seeding speeds to approximately 2. 2 m/s (5 mph); depth consistency generally degrades above this speed with current hoe drill technology. This research focused on developing an understanding of why this performance degradation occurs as speed increases. The general industry hypothesis points vaguely to "excessive motion" of the components to which the soil-engaging tools connect (the row units). However, little research on the dynamics of towed agricultural implements was found in the open literature. An understanding of the mechanism(s) causing this "excessive motion" was sought during this research. A 2 -D simulation tool was developed in MATLAB to provide equipment designers with the capability to conduct performance trade-off and sensitivity studies early in the prototype stage of a project. The simulation tool was compartmentalized so that changes to equipment geometry, component-soil contact models, or hydraulic systems could be modified with little or no change {{to other parts of the}} program. Operational data were also collected using a small <b>plot</b> <b>drill</b> based on a New Holland P 2070 Precision Hoe Drill. Data were collected at multiple operating speed up to 4. 4 m/s (10 mph) to characterize depth consistency issues present at higher speeds. Various geometric seed depth and hydraulic pressure settings were also tested. Kinematic parameters (acceleration, position), force, hydraulic pressure, and video of the instrumented row unit were recorded during steady-state the operation of the machine in typical seeding conditions. Measured data aided in calibrating aspects of the simulation tool, and the tool enabled certain performance features in the measurement data to be explored further. Frequency domain acceleration power spectra revealed that row unit acceleration power was generally concentrated at two frequencies. The terrain profile of the test field contained furrows from the previous seeding operation; this resulted in acceleration power to be concentrated at a distinct speed-dependent frequency related to the furrow spacing. While somewhat expected, this indicated the general inability of the current design to attenuate terrain inputs. The small packer wheel provided little compliance between the row unit and soil, so improving the attenuation performance of the system could improve depth consistency performance in future designs. The second major acceleration spectra feature was related to the arrangement of the hoe opener and trailing packer wheel; both rigidly connect to the row unit body. The row unit position changed when the packer wheel encountered a terrain bump or dip; this resulted in a change in the vertical position of the hoe opener located in front of the packer wheel. Immediate changes in the operating depth of the hoe opener tool resulted. Also, depth changes generally modified the terrain such that a new bump or dip was created in the soil surface preceding the packer wheel, thus creating a feedback path between the hoe opener and packer wheel. Considering the simplifications of the 2 -D model, agreement between simulated and measured data was encouraging. The frequencies of the above phenomena were in reasonable agreement throughout the speed range of interest. Power spectra amplitude differences were likely due to both input terrain differences between simulation and test terrains, and simplifications made in representing soil-tire and soil-tool contact. Future work to improve these sub-models, and to further explore the observed non-linear effect of hydraulic pressure changes would improve the predictive accuracy of the model presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} three {{cropping}} histories (sugarcane, maize and soybean) and two tillage practices (conventional tillage and direct drill) on plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes {{in the following}} sugarcane crop was examined in a field trial at Bundaberg. Soybean reduced populations of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) and root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica) in comparison to previous crops of sugarcane or maize but increased populations of spiral nematode (Helicotylenchus dihystera) and maintained populations of dagger nematode (Xiphinema elongatum). However the effect of soybean on P zeae and M. javanica was no longer apparent 15 weeks after planting sugarcane, while later in the season, populations of these nematodes following soybean were as high as or higher than maize or sugarcane. Populations of P zeae were initially reduced by cultivation but due to strong resurgence tended to be higher in conventionally tilled than direct <b>drill</b> <b>plots</b> {{at the end of}} the plant crop. Even greater tillage effects were observed with M. javanica and X. elongatum, as nematode populations were significantly higher in conventionally tilled than direct <b>drill</b> <b>plots</b> late in the season. Populations of free-living nematodes in the upper 10 cm of soil were initially highest following soybean, but after 15, 35 and 59 weeks were lower than after sugarcane and contained fewer omnivorous and predatory nematodes. Conventional tillage increased populations of free-living nematodes in soil in comparison to direct drill and was also detrimental to omnivorous and predatory nematodes. These results suggest that crop rotation and tillage not only affect plant-parasitic nematodes directly, but also have indirect effects by impacting on natural enemies that regulate nematode populations. More than 2 million nematodes/m(2) were often present in crop residues on the surface of direct <b>drill</b> <b>plots.</b> Bacterial-feeding nematodes were predominant in residues early in the decomposition process but fungal-feeding nematodes predominated after 15 weeks. This indicates that fungi become an increasingly important component of the detritus food web as decomposition proceeds, and that that the rate of nutrient cycling decreases with time. Correlations between total numbers of free-living nematodes and mineral N concentrations in crop residues and surface soil suggested that the free-living nematode community may provide an indication of the rate of mineralisation of N from organic matter...|$|R

We test the prediction that smaller distances between neighboring seeds in drill seeded grassland plantings would result in lower species diversity, greater weed abundance, and larger conspecific patch sizes than otherwise similar broadcast seeded plantings. A diverse grassland seed mix was either drill seeded, which places seeds in equally spaced rows, or broadcast seeded, which spreads seeds across the ground surface, into 24 plots in each of three sites in 2005. In summer 2007, we measured species abundance in a 1 m 2 quadrat in each plot and mapped common species within the quadrat by recording the most abundant species in each of 64 cells. Quadrat-scale diversity and weed abundance were similar between <b>drilled</b> and broadcast <b>plots,</b> suggesting that processes that limited establishment and controlled invasion were not affected by such fine-scale seed distribution. However, native warm-season (C 4) grasses were more abundant and occurred in less compact patches in <b>drilled</b> <b>plots.</b> This difference in C 4 grass abundance and distribution may result from increased germination or vegetative propagation of C 4 grasses in <b>drilled</b> <b>plots.</b> Our findings suggest that local plant density may control fine-scale heterogeneity and species composition in restored grasslands, processes {{that need to be}} further investigated to determine whether seed distributions can be manipulated to increase diversity in restored grasslands...|$|R

40|$|RESTRITOSoil surface {{roughness}} {{is known to}} influence water infiltration, runoff and erosion. Soil {{surface roughness}} changes with management and weather and its mathematical description still remains an important issue. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of tillage on the two fractal indices, fractal dimension, D, and crossover length, l, currently used in characterizing soil surface microrelief. The statistical index random roughness, RR, was also assessed. Field experiments were done on an Alfisol located at Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil). Two tillage treatments (conventional versus direct drilling) were tested. The soil surface microrelief was assessed by point elevation measurements in 16 plots for each treatment. The sampling scheme was a square grid with 20 × 20 mm between point spacing and the plot size was 280 × 280 mm, so that each data set consisted of 225 individual elevation points. All indices were calculated after trend removal, both by slope correction, i. e., oriented microrelief, and by slope plus tillage marks correction, i. e., random microrelief. The implemented algorithm for estimating D and l consisted in evaluating the roughness around the local root mean square deviation (RMS) of the point elevation values. Irrespective of tillage treatment and detrending procedure, fractal behavior extended only over a bounded range of scales, from 40 to 100 mm, due to the experimental setup. In these conditions, assessing fractal indices was not always straightforward. The statistical index RR and the fractal index l were significantly different between tillage treatments for oriented and random surface conditions. D values of random soil surfaces were not affected by tillage treatment, whereas D values of oriented microrelief were significantly lower in the direct <b>drilled</b> <b>plots.</b> Removal of tillage marks trend resulted in a significant increase in D values.

The factors consisted of tillage practices i. e. tine cultivator twice plowed (TC 2), chisels plow followed by rotovator (CR), mouldboard plow followed by rotovator (MR), disk plow followed by rotovator (DR) and tine cultivator followed by rotovator (TCR) in the main plots and sowing methods i. e. sowing with single box seed drill (SD), combined drill (CD) and broadcast (BC) in the sub plots. The performance of different tillage implements during seedbed preparation in term of soil depth of cut, wheel slippage, fuel consumption and effective field capacity were statistically significant. Maximum soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth recorded with CR and MR tillage practices, while maximum soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, at 20 and 40 cm depth, fresh and dry weed biomass were obtained in plots tilled with tine cultivator twice (TC- 2). However, minimum soil penetration resistance and fresh/ dry weed biomass were obtained in plots of CR and MR tillage practices, respectively. Higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth was observed when sowing was done with seed drill and combined drill, respectively. Data regarding wheat crop indicated that higher number of tillers m- 2 (403) and grain yield (4. 6 t ha- 1) were obtained in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum biological yield (10. 4 t ha- 1) was recorded in plots that were tilled with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator. Sowing by combined seed drill resulted in higher emergence, number of tillers, straw yield and biological yield. Similarly, higher number of grains spike- 1, spike length, grain yield and harvest indices were recorded when sowing was done with seed drill. Maximum total nitrogen in soil was noted in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, sowing by seed drill and combine drill recorded greater total nitrogen in soil and wheat straw. The data relating to mungbean crop indicated that chisel plow followed by rotavator resulted in higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depths, higher emergence m- 2, plant height, pod length and total nitrogen in grains. Plots tilled with tine cultivator twice delayed flowering and maturity, increase in fresh and dry weed biomass, soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depth and soil penetration resistance at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant - 1, biological yield, soil total nitrogen were higher in plots tilled with moldboard plow followed by rotavator. The maximum grain yield of mungbean and soil organic matter were recorded in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum harvest indices and total nitrogen in straw were recorded in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Higher emergence, plant height, pod length, hundred grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest indices, total soil nitrogen, and total nitrogen in mungbean grain and straw were recorded in plots sown with seed <b>drill.</b> <b>Plots</b> sown with broadcast method delayed flowering and maturity, increase fresh and dry weed biomass and greater soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depths.

Economic analysis of wheat and mungbean showed that maximum net revenue of wheat was obtained with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator (MR) tillage practices and the highest net revenue of mungbean was found with tine cultivator followed by rotavator (TCR) while minimum net revenue were obtained with tine cultivator (TC- 2). Similarly, sowing by seed drill (SD) and combine drill (CD) resulted in maximum net revenue as compared to broadcast (BC) sowing method.
