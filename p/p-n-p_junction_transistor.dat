40|$|Abstract—A new sub- 1 -V curvature-compensated CMOS bandgap reference, which {{utilizes}} the temperature-dependent currents {{generated from}} the parasitic n-p-n and <b>p-n-p</b> bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> devices in the CMOS process, is presented. The new proposed sub- 1 -V curvature-compensated CMOS bandgap reference has been successfully verified in a standard 0. 25 - m CMOS process. The experimental results have confirmed that, with the minimum supply voltage of 0. 9 V, the output reference voltage at 536 mV has a temperature coefficient of 19. 5 ppm C from 0 C to 100 C. With a 0. 9 -V supply voltage, the measured power noise rejection ratio is 25. 5 dB at 10 kHz.

40|$|Abstract—A well-controlled {{low-temperature}} process, demon-strated from 350 ◦C to 500 ◦C, {{has been}} developed for epitaxially growing elevated contacts and near-ideal diode junctions of Al-doped Si in contact windows to the Si substrate. A physical-vapor-deposited (PVD) amorphous silicon layer is converted to monocrystalline silicon selectively in the contact windows by using a PVD aluminum layer as a transport medium. This is a solid-phase-epitaxy (SPE) {{process by which the}} grown Si is Al-doped to at least 1018 cm− 3. Contact resistivity below 10 − 7 Ω · cm 2 is achieved to both p − and p+ bulk-silicon regions. The elevated contacts have also been employed to fabricate p+-n diodes and p+-n-p bipolar transistors, the electrical characteri-zation of which indicates a practically defect-free epitaxy at the interface.

40|$|New {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) clamp devices for using in power-rail ESD clamp circuits with the substrate-triggered technique are {{proposed to improve}} ESD level in a limited silicon area. The parasitic n–p–n and <b>p–n–p</b> bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> (BJTs) in the CMOS devices are used to form the substrate-triggered devices for ESD protection. Four substrate-triggered devices are proposed and investigated in this work, which are named as the substrate-triggered lateral BJT, the substrate-triggered vertical BJT, the substrate-triggered double BJT, and the double-triggered double BJT. An RC-based ESD-detection circuit is used to generate the triggering current {{to turn on the}} proposed substrate-triggered devices. In order to trigger on the parasitic bipolar transistors more effectively, the symmetric multiple-cell square-type layout method is used to realize these substrate-triggered devices. The power-rail ESD clamp circuits with such substrate-triggered devices have been fabricated in a 0. 6 -lm CMOS process. Experimental results have shown that the substrate-triggered device with double-BJT structure can provide 200 % higher ESD robustness in per silicon area, as compared to the NMOS with the traditional gate-driven design. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{stackable}} {{memory devices}} including nano-scaled crossbar array are central for {{the realization of}} high-density non-volatile memory electronics. However, an essential sneak path issue affecting device performance in crossbar array remains a bottleneck and a grand challenge. Therefore, a suitable bidirectional selector as a two-way switch is required to facilitate a major breakthrough in the 3 D crossbar array memory devices. Here, we show the excellent selectivity of all oxide p-/n-type semiconductor-based <b>p-n-p</b> open-based bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> as selectors in crossbar memory array. We report that bidirectional nonlinear characteristics of oxide <b>p-n-p</b> <b>junctions</b> can be highly enhanced by manipulating p-/n-type oxide semiconductor characteristics. We also propose an associated Zener tunneling mechanism that explains the unique features of our p-n-p selector. Our experimental findings are further extended to confirm the profound functionality of oxide p-n-p selectors integrated with several bipolar resistive switching memory elements working as storage nodes.

40|$|We {{developed}} a multi-level lithography process to fabricate graphene <b>p-n-p</b> <b>junctions</b> with the novel geometry of contactless, suspended top gates. This fabrication procedure minimizes damage or doping {{to the single}} atomic layer, which is only exposed to conventional resists and developers. The process does not require special equipment for depositing gate dielectrics or releasing sacrificial layers, and is compatible with annealing procedures that improve device mobility.

40|$|We report {{distinctive}} magnetotransport {{properties of}} a graphene <b>p-n-p</b> <b>junction</b> prepared by controlled diffusion of metallic contacts. In most cases, materials deposited on a graphene surface introduce substantial carrier scattering, which greatly reduces the high mobility of intrinsic graphene. However, {{we show that}} an oxide layer only weakly perturbs the carrier transport, which enables fabrication of a high-quality graphene <b>p-n-p</b> <b>junction</b> through a one-step and resist-free method. The measured conductance-gate voltage (G-V_G) curves can be well described by a metal contact model, which confirms the charge density depinning due to the oxide layer. The graphene <b>p-n-p</b> <b>junction</b> samples exhibit pronounced quantum Hall effect, a well-defined transition point of the zeroth Landau level (LL), and scaling behavior. The scaling exponent obtained from {{the evolution of the}} zeroth LL width as a function of temperature exhibits a relatively low value of κ= 0. 21 ± 0. 01. Moreover, we calculate the energy level for the LLs based on the distribution of plateau-plateau transition points, further validating the assignment of the LL index of the QH plateau-plateau transition...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of the Klein {{tunneling}} on the transport prop-erties of graphene <b>p-n-p</b> <b>junctions.</b> We first analyze the ideal case of a clean system and then study the realistic case in which dis-order is present. To take into account {{the effect of}} disorder we develop a method for obtaining quantum transport properties in graphene that uniquely combines three crucial features: micro-scopic treatment of charge disorder, fully quantum mechanical analysis of transport, and the ability to model experimentally relevant system sizes. Our results allow us to conclude unam-biguously that recent transport experiments on graphene <b>p-n-p</b> <b>junctions</b> have indeed observed signatures of Klein tunneling.

40|$|Nanoelectronics {{requires}} {{the development of}} a priori technology evaluation for materials and device design that takes into account quantum physical effects and the explicit chemical nature at the atomic scale. Here, we present a cross-platform quantum transport computation tool. Using first-principles electronic structure, it allows for flexible and efficient calculations of materials transport properties and realistic device simulations to extract current-voltage and transfer characteristics. We apply this computational method to the calculation of the mean free path in silicon nanowires with dopant and surface oxygen impurities. The dependence of transport on basis set is established, with the optimized double zeta polarized basis giving a reasonable compromise between converged results and efficiency. The current-voltage characteristics of ultrascaled (3 nm length) nanowire-based transistors with p-i-p and p-n-p doping profiles are also investigated. It is found that charge self-consistency affects the device characteristics more significantly than the choice of the basis set. These devices yield sourced-drain tunneling currents in the range of 0. 5 nA (<b>p-n-p</b> <b>junction)</b> to 2 nA (p-i-p junction), implying that <b>junctioned</b> <b>transistor</b> designs at these length scales would likely fail to keep carriers out of the channel in the off-state.
