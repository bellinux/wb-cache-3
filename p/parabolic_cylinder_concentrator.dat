These include interactions between a <b>parabolic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a plane, two <b>parabolic</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and a <b>parabolic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and an ordinary cylinder. To elucidate {{the effect of}} boundaries, special {{attention is focused on}} the "knife-edge" limit in which the <b>parabolic</b> <b>cylinder</b> becomes a half-plane. Geometrical effects are illustrated by considering arbitrary rotations of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>cylinder</b> around its focal axis, and arbitrary translations perpendicular to this axis. A quite different geometrical arrangement is explored for the case of an ordinary cylinder placed in the interior of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> All of these results extend simply to nonzero temperatures.
