50|$|The <b>lesser</b> marbled <b>fritillary</b> {{is present}} in Spain, France, Italy, central and {{northern}} Europe, Siberia, temperate Asia, northern China and Japan.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> false <b>fritillary</b> (Anetia briarea) is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} in the Danainae subfamily. It is found in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the <b>lesser</b> marbled <b>fritillary</b> (Brenthis ino), but the latter is {{slightly}} smaller and the coloration of said patch is completely yellow.|$|R
5000|$|The upperside of {{the wings}} is yellow orange with dark spots, lines, and zigzagged bands. The forewing is squared off {{just below the}} apex. A dark border on the hindwing margin is lacking on most individuals. It has long palps. The {{underside}} of the wings are mottled with orange and purplish-brown. There is a yellowish band that runs across {{the center of the}} hindwing. It lacks the silver spots most <b>lesser</b> <b>fritillaries</b> have. The forewing is smudged with orange and brown near the apex. The wingspan of the meadow fritillary is 3.5 - 5.1 cm ( [...] - 2 inches).|$|R
50|$|Melitaea trivia, the <b>lesser</b> spotted <b>fritillary,</b> is a {{butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. It {{is found in}} the southern part of the Palearctic ecozone. In Europe it is sometimes called the desert fritillary, but this name also refers to the North African relative M. deserticola.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{the record}} is {{considered}} one of Deep <b>Purple's</b> <b>lesser</b> efforts, although it did sell reasonably well on release (#19 in the UK charts, and #43 in the US) and received a rave review in the leading British music paper New Musical Express. The album was certified Silver on 1 November 1975 by the BPI, selling 60,000 copies in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} open water, swamp, bog, wet woodland, scrub and gorse. Plants present include marsh cinquefoil, <b>purple</b> loosestrife, <b>lesser</b> spearwort, royal fern and bog myrtle.|$|R

5000|$|Platanthera psycodes, {{commonly}} called <b>lesser</b> <b>purple</b> fringed orchid or small purple-fringed orchid, is {{a species of}} orchid, genus Platanthera, [...] occurring from eastern Canada (from Manitoba to Newfoundland) to the east-central and northeastern United States (Great Lakes Region, Appalachian Mountains, and New England). It is imperiled in Illinois, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Kentucky.|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{the overall}} {{geographic}} {{range of the}} <b>lesser</b> marbled <b>fritillary,</b> Brenthis ino (Rottemburg, 1775), is currently expanding, this species is patchily distributed at a local spatial scale due to its use of flower rich semi-natural meadows and the aggregated distribution of its host plant. Therefore, understanding the dispersal patterns of this butterfly {{and the effect of}} increasing fragmentation of the landscapes in central and Western Europe on its population dynamics is key to determining whether this patchy distribution can lead to metapopulation structuring and dynamics. One way to determine the degree to which local populations are isolated from one another is to use high resolution molecular genetic markers and thence quantify gene flow and genetic drift. Eleven microsatellite loci have previously been developed for this species, but six showed evidence of null alleles, effectively violating key assumptions of the models used to infer gene flow. We therefore developed a set of new primer pairs to amplify a suite of 16 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci (number of alleles ranged from 2 - 30) of which nine were found to conform to the Hardy-Weinberg's expectations, whilst at the same time not showing any clear signature for the presence of null alleles. We further describe how these primers were optimized for landscape and metapopulation genetics studies in Belgian Ardenne...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the state of}} the knowledge of the Łódź Upland (about 18 000 km 2) avifauna. The total of 278 bird species was recorded by authors in the study area since the last century. After 1945, the total of 267 species were recorded, including 180 breeding species. According to the authors’ estimates about 11 % of the area was investigated more preciously. The best investigated regions are: the Bzura river valley, 219 species were recorded including 165 breeding ones, the Pilica river valley, where the respective values are 211 and 158, region of the Jeziorsko Reservoir - 247 observed species and 152 breeding ones, the vicinities of the locality of Rogów with 118 breeding species and the Łódź city area with 125 breeding species. The Łódź Upland has been the place o f breeding for some rare birds in Poland: Cormorant, <b>Purple</b> Heron, <b>Lesser</b> Spotted Eagle, Hen Harrier, Montague’s Harrier, Curlew, Ruff, Herring Gull, White-winged Tern, Whiskered Tern, Crane, Stonechat, Collared Flycatcher, Aquatic Warbler, Bearded Tit.

50|$|The lake attracts over 210 {{species of}} birds in the winter, and harbors a variety of plants and animals. Besides a few {{mammalian}} species including the endangered wild ass and the black buck, its migratory bird population includes rosy pelicans, flamingoes, white storks, brahminy ducks and herons. Thousands of migratory waterfowl flock to this sanctuary just after the Indian monsoon season. The shallow area and ponds on the outer fringes of the lake attract the wading birds that feed in the shallow waters. Millions of birds visit the bird sanctuary in winter and spring. It harbors over 250 species of wetland birds. Winter migrants from the north including <b>purple</b> moorhen, pelicans, <b>lesser</b> and greater flamingos, white storks, four species of bitterns, crakes, grebes, brahminy ducks and herons visit Nal Sarovar. Between November and February, the lake is home to vast flocks of indigenous and migratory birds. Ducks, geese, pelicans and flamingos are best seen {{early in the morning}} and in the evening and the sanctuary is best visited as a day excursion by personal vehicle, taxi, as buses are infrequent and there is no convenient accommodation. Vehicles are available from parking to the lake site which is approx 1 km.|$|R
