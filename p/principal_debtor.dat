5000|$|Law of guarantees. A surety may be {{entitled}} to be subrogated {{to the rights of}} the creditor as against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the surety}} can be {{rendered}} liable on his guarantee, the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> {{must have made}} default. When, however, this has occurred, the creditor, {{in the absence of}} express agreement to the contrary, may sue the surety, without informing him of such default having taken place before proceeding against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> or resorting to securities for the debt received from the latter. In those countries where the municipal law is based on the Roman law, sureties usually possess the right (which may, however, be renounced by them) of compelling the creditor to insist on the goods, etc. (if any) of the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> being first [...] "discussed," [...] i.e., appraised and sold, and appropriated to the liquidation of the debt guaranteed before having recourse to the sureties. This right [...] "accords with a common sense of justice and the natural equity of mankind". In England this right has never been fully recognized, nor does it prevail in America and Scotland.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, but not {{apparently}} elsewhere, {{there is}} a distinction between a surety and a guarantor. A surety is usually bound with the principal, {{at the same time}} and on the same consideration, while the contract of a guarantor is his own separate undertaking and the guarantor is not liable until due diligence has been exerted to compel the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> to make good any default. There is no privity of contract between a surety and the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b> Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.|$|E
60|$|People grieve and bemoan themselves, {{but it is}} {{not half}} so bad with them as they say. There are moods in which we court suffering, in the hope that here at least we shall find reality, sharp peaks and edges of truth. But {{it turns out to be}} scene-painting and counterfeit. The only thing grief has taught me is to know how shallow it is. That, like all the rest, plays about the surface, and never {{introduces}} me into the reality, for contact with which we would even pay the costly price of sons and lovers. Was it Boscovich who found out that bodies never come in contact? Well, souls never touch their objects. An innavigable sea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and converse with. Grief too will make us idealists. In the death of my son, now more than two years ago, I seem to have lost a beautiful estate,--no more. I cannot get it nearer to me. If to-morrow I should be informed of the bankruptcy of my <b>principal</b> <b>debtors,</b> the loss of my property would be a great inconvenience to me, perhaps, for many years; but it would leave me as it found me,--neither better nor worse. So is it with this calamity: it does not touch me; something which I fancied was a part of me, which could not be torn away without tearing me nor enlarged without enriching me, falls off from me and leaves no scar. It was caducous. I grieve that grief can teach me nothing, nor carry me one step into real nature. The Indian who was laid under a curse that the wind should not blow on him, nor water flow to him, nor fire burn him, is a type of us all. The dearest events are summer-rain, and we the Para coats that shed every drop. Nothing is left us now but death. We look to that with a grim satisfaction, saying There at least is reality that will not dodge us.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a simple {{model of the}} rescheduling of debt following a sovereign default as a bond exchange. In case of default, the sovereign offers a new bond with lower coupon and <b>principal.</b> The <b>debtors</b> accept the offer if {{the value of the}} new bonds is higher than the proceedings of the litigation of the sovereign. Both the default decision of the sovereign as well as the exchange offer are modeled endogenously and in closed form. The resulting formulas for bond value and credit spreads are in closed form as well. The analysis yields credit spread curves similar to corporate credit curves: For high risk issuers, i. e.,sovereign with low country wealth relative to debt level,and high litigation costs,the credit spread curves are “hump ”-shaped. Better quality issues exhibit increasing credit spread curves. The numerical analysis with reasonable parameters yields credit spreads of a size compatible to market spreads. A comparison to corporate debt supports the stylized fact that, using the same parameters,corporate debt is less risky than sovereign debt since the threat of liquidation is stronger than the threat of litigation.

40|$|Professor Adam Levitin {{has responded}} to my recent {{symposium}} article critiquing proposed congressional legislation that would allow modification (including strip down) of home mortgages in Chapter 13 bankruptcy. A portion of my Critique criticized his empirical studies concerning the likely effect of the proposed legislation on mortgage interest rates and availability, and also criticized the arguments he has made {{in support of the}} proposed legislation. The Critique did note, however, that the insight involved in conceiving of such empirical studies was impressive. Surprisingly, Professor Levitin’s Response fails to deal with the substantial case authority discussed in my Critique. He treats the Critique’s case authority on a critical question as if it consisted only of one relatively recent Ninth Circuit case and supposed dicta from an “old” Second Circuit case. But the Critique in fact relies on about twenty cases that deal with the question; the only supposedly contrary case authority he discusses in his Response turns {{out to be one of}} the cases cited in my Critique and not to be contrary at all. The case authority shows that the main defense put forward in his Response - that the mortgage modifications that would be permitted under the proposed legislation are similar to those permitted before the Supreme Court’s 1993 Nobelman decision and similar to those currently permitted where the collateral is not the <b>debtor’s</b> <b>principal</b> residence - is simply untenable. It is also surprising that the entire weight of his defense of the empirical studies rests (A) on a very likely mistaken view of the law - that the law permits Chapter 13 debtors to use a novel, flawed approach in modifying secured claims under current law - and (B) on two remarkably bold and implausible assertions regarding how the market data he collected supposedly should have reflected the risk that debtors might use that novel, flawed approach, even though his data was collected before anyone had suggested that debtors might even try to do so. In addition, one of Professor Levitin’s assertions, if accepted, would fatally undermine the design of a key part of his empirical studies. The article notes in conclusion that law professors and others who have taken divergent positions on the wisdom of the congressional proposals might yet be able to agree on a common-sense middle ground; there is no need to consider those who disagree with us as having been seduced by the Dark Side...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{prolific}} ground of discharge of a guarantor usually {{arises from the}} creditor's conduct. The governing principle {{is that if the}} creditor violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only nominal, the guarantee cannot be enforced. The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation of the terms of the contract between the creditor and the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> or of that between the creditor and the surety; (2) by the creditor taking a new security from the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> in lieu of the original one; (3) by the creditor discharging the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> from liability; (4) by the creditor binding himself to give time to the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by the creditor in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a novation. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere. [...] By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of the creditor inconsistent with the surety's rights, although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when the creditor extends without the surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil, is rejected by the majority of them. A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety.|$|E
5000|$|In England, however, {{before any}} demand for payment {{has been made}} by the {{creditor}} on the surety, the latter can, as soon as the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> has made default, compel the creditor, on giving him an indemnity against costs and expenses, to sue the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> if the latter is solvent and able to pay. and a similar remedy is also open to the surety in America. [...] In neither of these countries nor in Scotland can one of several sureties, when sued for the whole guaranteed debt by the creditor, compel the latter to divide his claim among the sureties, and reduce it to the share and proportion of each surety. However, this beneficium divisionis, as it is called in Roman law, is recognized by many existing codes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the event}} of the {{principal}} debtor's bankruptcy, the surety can in England act against the bankrupt's estate, not only in respect of payments made before the bankruptcy of the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> but also, it seems, in respect of the contingent liability to pay under the guarantee. [...] If the creditor has already acted, the surety who has paid the guaranteed debt {{has a right to}} all dividends received by the creditor from the bankrupt in respect to the guaranteed debt, and to stand in the creditor's place as to future dividends. [...] The rights of the surety against the creditor are in England exercisable even by one who in the first instance was a <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> but has since become a surety, by arrangement with his creditor.|$|E
40|$|The {{peculiar}} three-sided {{relationship of}} principal, surety and creditor {{gives rise to}} many vexatious questions of law, {{and one of the}} most interesting of these vexatious questions is that of the relationship between surety and principal in the case of the latter 2 ̆ 7 s bankruptcy. Under such circumstances, the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s right is fairly simple; he may prove his debt against the principal, take such dividend as may be declared, and recover the balance of the debt from the surety, his remedy against the latter being expressly saved by Sec. 16 of the present Bankruptcy Act. 1 But the position of the surety is less clear. Upon becoming a surety, he has acquired a two-sided status of liability and right; he has become liable to pay money to the creditor if the principal defaults; and if he does so pay to the creditor, he has a right to be reimbursed by the principal for the payment so made. In other words, the surety is contingently the debtor of the creditor, and the creditor of the <b>debtor</b> (<b>principal).</b> And this contingent liability and right exist in the surety from the time of making the contract of suretyship. He is, clearly enough, always liable to pay the debt to the creditor if the principal does not, and he is also always the possessor of a right against the principal, namely, the right to be reimbursed for any payment he may have to make on the principal 2 ̆ 7 s account. It is the nature of this right that leads to the difficulty of determining the status in bankruptcy of the surety 2 ̆ 7 s claim against his bankrupt principal. It is clear that the surety, from the time of making the contract of suretyship, has a potential claim, or contingent possibility of a right, against his principal, but it is equally clear that this claim or right does not become absolute and fixed until the surety has made a payment for his principal. Until this time he has no right of action against his principal, but merely a contingent possibility of a right. The following questions naturally arise as to this right to reimbursement: Can the holder of this claim (the surety) join in a petition in involuntary bankruptcy against the principal? Can he prove his claim against the principal 2 ̆ 7 s estate? Is his right against the principal barred by the latter 2 ̆ 7 s discharge in bankruptcy? Is the surety, by virtue of his inchoate claim, a creditor who may be preferred or defrauded by the bankrupt principal...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumer}} bankruptcy system {{plays an}} enormous albeit largely under appreciated {{role in the}} United States economy. There were nearly 1. 6 million consumer bankruptcy filings in the United States in 2004 - {{more than twice the}} number just ten years earlier, and more than one filing for every 70 households in the country. Nearly a third of these filings were under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Chapter 13 provides for individual debt readjustment pursuant to a repayment plan, whereas Chapter 7 provides for liquidation of assets to pay creditor claims.) Yet, little is known about what debtors and creditors accomplish in Chapter 13 cases or how well the Chapter 13 system serves its intended purposes. This article reports on the findings of the Chapter 13 Project, a national empirical study of 795 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings in seven federal judicial districts. Funded by the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges and the American Bankruptcy Institute, it is the first and only national study of its kind. It provides a detailed portrait of the Chapter 13 system {{and the extent to which}} Chapter 13 has fulfilled its <b>principal</b> purposes [...] <b>debtor</b> fresh start, on the one hand, and creditor repayment, on the other. The article first reports on who is using Chapter 13 - the gender, income, indebtedness and other bankruptcy filings of the debtors in the sample. It then reports on the extent to which the debtors in the seven districts completed their plans and obtained a discharge. Next, we consider various debtor characteristics - gender, income, amount and type of debt, debt-income ratio, other filings - and certain plan features - length, proposed distribution to unsecured creditors, income reserved for payment of living expenses - for their relation to case outcome. Regarding creditor repayment, the study reports in detail on the amounts and types of debt that are collected by creditors in Chapter 13 cases. The Project has produced a wealth of new information and insights into the Chapter 13 system. Some of the highlights include: Most of the debtors in the sample were far less affluent than the population as a whole. At least 50 % of the debtors had filed one or more other petitions. Discharge rates varied significantly by district, but overall only one-third of the debtors completed a plan. We found statistically significant correlations between case outcome and debtor income, amount and type of debt, and other filings. Equally revealing, the study found no significant relationship between case outcome and plan feasibility, proposed plan length or proposed distribution to unsecured creditors. Regarding creditor repayment, the study reports that the primary creditor beneficiaries by far of the Chapter 13 system are secured creditors; and that less than a third of trustee disbursements were to general unsecured creditors. The median amount paid to unsecured creditors in all cases was $ 0...|$|R

50|$|In English law, a {{guarantee}} is {{a contract to}} answer for the payment of some debt, or the performance of some duty by a third person who is primarily liable for that payment or performance. It is a collateral contract, which does not extinguish the original obligation for payment or performance. It is rendered null and void if the original obligation fails. The liabilities of a guarantor in law depend upon those of the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> and when the principal's obligations cease the guarantor's do too, except in certain cases where the discharge of the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> is by {{the operation of the}} law. If, for example, a person wrongly supposes that someone is liable to them, and {{a guarantee}} is given on that erroneous basis, the guarantee is invalid by virtue of the law of contracts, because its foundation (that another was liable) failed.|$|E
50|$|The usual mode in England of {{enforcing}} liability under a guarantee is by {{action in the}} High Court or a County Court. It is also permissible for the creditor to obtain redress {{by means of a}} set-off or counterclaim, in an action brought against him by the surety. On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third-party complaint, claim contribution from his co-sureties towards the common liability. Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial. The creditor cannot rely on admissions made by or a judgment or award against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} situation dramatically {{changed with}} Austria's {{defeat in the}} First World War and {{the dissolution of the}} Austro-Hungarian monarchy and empire. In the late 1920s, a <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> the Steyr-Werke AG faced financial difficulties, with bad loans leading to a drain on finances. In October 1929, the Schober government compelled the allegedly well-financed Credit-Anstalt to assume liabilities, which together with the simultaneous Wall Street Crash led to the financial imbalance of the then-largest Austrian credit provider.|$|E
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the surety is not liable if the {{principal}} debt cannot be enforced. It {{has never been}} actually decided in England whether this rule holds good {{in cases where the}} <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> is a minor and on that account is not liable to the creditor. When directors guarantee the performance by their company of a contract which is beyond their authority, and therefore not binding on the company, the directors' liability is enforceable against them personally.|$|E
50|$|The {{liability}} {{incurred by}} a surety under his guarantee depends upon its terms, {{and is not}} necessarily coextensive {{with that of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b> It is, however, obvious that the surety's obligation cannot exceed that of the principal. By many existing civil codes, however, a guarantee which imposes on the surety a greater liability than that of the principal is not invalidated but is merely reducible to that of the principal. However, in India the liability of the surety is, unless otherwise provided by contract, coextensive with that of the principal.|$|E
5000|$|A {{person liable}} as a surety for another under a {{guarantee}} possesses rights against {{the person to}} whom the guarantee was given. As regards the surety's rights against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> where the guarantee was made with the debtors consent but not otherwise, after he has made default, be compelled by the surety to exonerate him from liability by payment of the guaranteed debt. [...] If the surety has paid any portion of the guaranteed debt, the surety is entitled to rank as a creditor for the amount paid and to compel repayment.|$|E
5000|$|The surety's {{principal}} right {{against the}} creditor entitles him, after payment of the guaranteed debt, {{to the benefit}} of all securities which the creditor held against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b> If the creditor has lost these securities by default or laches or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged pro tanto. This right, which is not in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not. [...] "Every person who being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such debt or perform such duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him, or to a trustee for him, every judgment, specialty, or other security, which shall be held by the creditor in respect of such debt or duty, whether such judgment, specialty, or other security shall or shall not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of the duty, and such person shall be entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all the remedies, and, if need be, and upon a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor, in any action or other proceeding at law or in equity, in order to obtain from the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> or any co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, as the case may be, indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who shall have so paid such debt or performed such duty; and such payment or performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such action or other proceeding by him, provided always that no co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be entitled to recover from any other co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, by the means aforesaid, more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last-mentioned person shall be justly liable". The right of the surety to be subrogated on payment by him of the guaranteed debt, to all the rights of the creditor against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> is recognized in America and many other countries.|$|E

50|$|With the {{approval}} of creditor and/or debtor, an obligation may also {{be joined by a}} third person as co- debtor. If the creditor agreed to the joining, it may not be cancelled or modified without his consent. The <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> and the co-person are jointly and severally liable toward the creditor. The debtor may be substituted by third parties only with the explicit consent of the creditor. The substituted debtor is relieved from the liability towards the creditor. The securities given by third parties expire if they do not agree on serving the new creditor. Pledges and mortgages that have been given to the first creditor remain effective. The new debtor may plead against the creditor any defenses of the former debtor arising from the transferred legal relationship.|$|E
5000|$|Where the {{liability}} of the surety is less extensive in amount {{than that of}} the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> questions have arisen in England and America as to whether the surety is liable only for part of the debt equal to the limit of his liability, or, up to such limit, for the whole debt. The surety cannot be made liable except for a loss sustained by reason of the default guaranteed against. Moreover, {{in the case of a}} joint and several guarantee by several sureties, unless all sign it none are liable thereunder. [...] The limit of the surety's liability must be construed so as to give effect to what may fairly be inferred to have been the intention of the parties as expressed in writing. In cases of doubtful import, recourse to parol evidence is permissible, to explain, but not to contradict, the written evidence of the guarantee.|$|E
5000|$|No fixed {{rules of}} {{interpretation}} determine whether a guarantee is a continuing one or not, but each case must be judged on its individual merits. Frequently, {{in order to achieve}} a correct construction, it becomes necessary to examine the surrounding circumstances, which often reveal what was the subject matter which the parties contemplated when the guarantee was given, and what was the scope and object of the transaction between them. Most continuing guarantees are either ordinary business securities for advances made or goods supplied to the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> or else bonds for the good behavior of persons in public or private offices or employment. With regard to the latter class of continuing guarantees, the surety's liability is, generally speaking, revoked by any change in the constitution of the persons to or for whom the guarantee is given.

50|$|Glanvill {{described}} one action {{which had}} features of both debt and detinue. They were the same. In his time, {{the form of}} the writ was a demand for a sum of money which could be issued for various reasons. “Debt” or detinue could be demanded for return of the loan of money, the price of sale, the loan of a chattel, letting to hire, or a deposit. The writ was available for a creditor against a surety on the default of the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b> Glanvill speaks of debt and its writ as being a retrieval of “debt that is due”, or ‘’detinue’‘. Later, and by the time of Bracton, detinue had been more or less separated from primary actions in debt, Detinue had come to be restricted to actions against bailees. After Bracton, the special situation of ‘’de bonis asportatis’‘, the taking of chattels by a bailee or theft of these from a bailee gave rise to the special situation of trover. Trover became fully formed in the reign of Elizabeth I of England. By the end of Bracton’s life and into the reign of Edward I, debt was confined to contract law, while detinue was concerned with the developing issues of personal property.|$|E
50|$|A surety is {{entitled}} to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is {{not the result of}} any contract, but is derived from a equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor {{in the case of a}} surety for a surety; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} {{means of}} extincting a suretyship is constituted by the creditor’ act, {{in this case}} the bank, which allowed the loss of the rights and securities he had against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> and in which the surety was going to subrogate. The fault of the bank according to the analyzed case-law is that the bankruptcy procedure for the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> was already opened and thus he was too late in lodging claims and did not gain the statute of creditor entitled to participate to the bankruptcy proceedings. The surety’s right of recourse against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor,</b> through subrogation, in order to obtain from him the repayment of the amounts paid to the bank-creditor comes in conflict with the creditor’s act. Following the non-registration of the bank on the statement of assets and liabilities of the debtor undergoing bankruptcy, the surety is deprived of the possibility to legally subrogate to his rights and securities. The extinction of the suretyship consequently acts as sanction for the bank that allowed the loss of the rights and securities it had against the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> and blocked the surety’s possibility to exercise the right of recourse and subrogate to the rights of the bank to recover from the bankrupt debtor the amounts paid to the creditor...|$|E

40|$|The Baker Plan {{essentially}} made existing {{strategy on}} the debt problem more concrete. Like existing policy, it rejected a bankruptcy approach to the problem. It assumed that the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> countries could grow {{their way out of}} the debt problem and could expand their exports enough over time to reduce their debt burden to normal levels. It called for structural reform, and it continued the adjustment efforts in the debtor country in return for financial support from foreign official and bank creditors. The plan did shift emphasis, however: from short-term balance of payments stabilization to longer-term development objectives, and thus from the IMF to the World Bank as the lead institution in debt management. The basic international debt strategy remains valid, but intensified policy efforts are necessary. Banks should provide multiyear new money packages, exit bonds should be guaranteed to allow voluntary debt reduction by banks, and net capital flows to the highly indebted countries should be raised 15 billion dollars a year. Successful emergence from the debt crisis, however, will depend primarily on sound economic policies in the debtor countries themselves.

40|$|Extract: This text is a {{study of}} the tumultuous {{doctrine}} of subrogation. The doctrine of marshalling of securities, which is based on subrogation, will be treated in a separate text. Chapter 1 emphasises the distinction between subrogation and assignment. Chapter 2 examines the right of subrogation to the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of indemnity. The importance, in practice, of the distinc¬ tion between the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of exoneration and the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of reimbursement is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 addresses the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation. It examines the discrete situations where the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation is enlivened. Chapter 4 deals with those situations where the right of subrogation vests in a person (other than a surety) who discharges a third party 2 ̆ 7 s debt to a secured creditor. It also examines the right of subrogation of a surety who discharges the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s debt to the secured creditor. Chapter 5 examines the right of subrogation of a putative lender who purports to lend money to an ultra vires borrower who then uses the proceeds of the putative loan to discharge its intra vires debts. Chapter 6 discusses those situations where a third party payer does not have any right to be subrogated to the (former) right of the payee against the debtor...|$|E
40|$|Suretyships {{given in}} favour of banks are being {{challenged}} in the courts {{on the basis of}} equitable doctrines of unconscionable conduct, undue influence, or statutory provisions dealing with unfair conduct or unfair contract terms.

Such an investigation also necessitates a study of the relationship between banker and customer, as the surety is quite often a customer of the bank as well, and, as a surety's obligation to the bank is an accessory obligation, the obligation is dependent on a valid principal obligation between the bank and the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor</b> - the customer. The face of modern banking has, however, changed dramatically and most major banks have become multi-functional. As a result, the banker-customer relationship may often be seen as a fiduciary relationship. A major problem brought about my multi-functioning banks is that of conflicts of interest between the bank and its customer. Furthermore, the banker-customer relationship is providing much more scope for lender liability than in the past. Various factors are currently having an impact on the law of contract, and this is expected to affect the legal policy makers in their assessments of whether a duty of disclosure of material facts exits or not. A surety has long been a favoured debtor {{in the eyes of the}} law, and the courts have developed a plethora of technical principles on which a surety can be relieved of his obligation. The escape routes of the surety, especially if he is a consumer as well, on the new grounds of public policy, unconscionability, good faith or unreasonableness, are growing. The results of these trends is the expected demise of suretyship as an acceptable, cheap form of debt security in the banking sector. JurisprudenceLL. D...|$|E

Razmatraju se pretpostavke pod kojima se jamac u takvim slučajevima treba smatrati potrošačem na kojeg se primjenjuju pravila potrošačkog prava. Obveza predugovornog obavješćivanja analizira se općenito u odnosu na potrošačko kreditiranje, a zatim se detaljno analiziraju hrvatski i europski propisi u kojima je uređeno predugovorno obavješćivanje jamaca u potrošačkom kreditiranju te se {{hrvatska}} i europska rješenja uspoređuju s austrijskim i njemačkim rješenjima ovog pitanja. Zaključuje se da u hrvatskim i europskim propisima pravno uređenje obveze kreditora u odnosu na obvezu predugovornog obavješćivanja jamaca nije dostatno te se predlažu nova, potpunija zakonska rješenja. Issuing {{guarantees for}} consumer loans in Croatia has very serious {{consequences for the}} guarantors, and this was confirmed in an empirical study conducted within the CitProtect Project, according to which a total of 27. 6 % of subjects-guarantors were not informed or do not remember being informed about their rights and obligations before executing the guarantee. Out of those guarantors that were informed, 11. 9 % did not understand, or poorly understood, or do not remember if they understood the information about their legal position and its consequences. These numbers show that necessary attention should {{be paid to the}} pre-contractual informing of consumers. Croatian law does not expressly provide that a guarantor who issues a guarantee outside his or her commercial, business, trade, or professional activity for a consumer loan should also be considered a consumer. However, an analysis of the content of Croatian law compared to Austrian legislation and case law on this issue, as well as Rec. 12 of Directive 2014 / 17 /EU on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property, indicates that within this context a guarantor should also be considered a consumer under Croatian law, to whom consumer law should consequently be applicable. The pre-contractual duty to inform the guarantor within the consumer loan context is not regulated under European law. However, it is generally accepted that it is not prohibited to widen the personal scope of application of Directive 2008 / 48 /EU on credit agreements for consumers and Directive 2014 / 17 /EU on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property, which consider only principal debtors in consumer loan contracts as consumers. Until 2013, Croatian law had no special rules on the duty to pre-contractually inform guarantors, so the primary mode of inferring its existence was through legal interpretation. The existence of the duty to pre-contractually inform the guarantor in consumer loan contracts was thus to be inferred from the general principle of good faith and fair dealing under the Obligations Act. Furthermore, the Consumer Protection Act also contains rules that enable such an inference about the existence of this duty on the creditor side of the transaction. However, in both these cases, and considering the absence of any relevant domestic case law, it could not be determined what exactly the content of such communication would be. Considering the nature and effects of the rules on the pre-contractual duty to inform the consumer under the Consumer Credit Act and the Draft Residential Consumer Credit Act, which refer only to the principal debtors in consumer loan contracts, it cannot not be argued that the credit institution has a duty to provide to the guarantor the same information that it must provide to a potential borrower before executing the contract per analogy, particularly not that there is identical criminal and civil liability of the credit institution with respect to the guarantor as with respect to the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b> Opinions to the contrary exist in German and Austrian literature, {{in the context of their}} domestic rules that implement European law. However, these comparative examples do not contain case law corroborating such views. It is only the Credit Institutions Act that contains key provisions on the pre-contractual duty to inform guarantors. Under these provisions, the credit institution has a duty to disclose before the execution of a loan contract “all relevant information” about the terms of the contract that will make visible the rights and duties of the parties and advise them about the legal nature of a guarantee, as well as the right of the credit institution to collect their claims from guarantors. Nevertheless, with respect to guarantors the credit institution is not obligated to provide all the information it must provide the <b>principal</b> <b>debtor.</b> This Act does not contain a clear provision defining the meaning of “all relevant information about the terms of the contract that will make visible the rights and duties of the parties. ” Therefore it should be understood that the credit institution has a duty to determine the content of the pre-contractual communication to the guarantor in good faith, as this Act determines the minimum rights of guarantors as consumers of, and credit institutions are in no way prohibited from broader communication with the guarantor about their rights and duties. On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that the right measure of informing is key for the consumer to be truly informed and make an informed decision about entering into the contract. The research on legal regulation conducted here has demonstrated that consumer-guarantors are entirely free and unrestricted in entering into guarantee contracts, while at the same time there is no counter-balance in regulating detailed and sufficiently substantial information that the credit institution should provide before they enter into such contracts. Furthermore, the Credit Institutions Act that generally provides a duty to pre-contractually inform guarantors does not, however, envisage a duty to advise guarantors about entering into such contracts for consumer loans, and particularly about the consequences of such guarantees. Therefore, it would be useful to regulate in detail the duty to pre-contractually inform guarantors within special statutes, such as the Consumer Credit Act and the future Residential Consumer Credit Act, modeled after the current scheme for consumers-principal debtors...|$|E
