5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (<b>poor</b> <b>appetite,</b> weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E
5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, <b>poor</b> <b>appetite,</b> or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Objective This study {{investigated}} the relationship between depression, nutritional risk and dietary intake in a population of older caregivers. Design Mailed questionnaire with sub group participating in a home-based interview. Participants and setting Seventy-six community dwelling caregivers aged 50 y or over from Victoria, Australia. Measurements Questionnaires provided information on weight, height, hours of care, depressive symptoms, nutritional risk and appetite. The home-based interview assessed dietary intake and shopping, cooking and meal consumption habits. Results The sample had a mean±SD age of 70. 3 ± 12. 8 y, BMI of 27. 2 ± 4. 8 kg/m 2 and the time spent caring was 101. 8 ± 68. 1 h/wk. Overall, 32 % of caregivers had depressive symptoms, 21 % were at risk of malnutrition and 21 % reported their appetite was fair/bad/very bad. Caregivers with depressive symptoms (32 %) compared to those with no depressive symptoms (53 %) had a <b>poorer</b> <b>appetite</b> (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} weight misperception and psychosocial health problems among normal weight Chinese adolescent boys and girls. Methods. In the Youth Smoking Survey 200304, 20 677 normal weight students aged 1118 years from 85 randomly selected schools throughout Hong Kong were analysed. Students who perceived themselves as very thin, thin, fat or very fat were classified as having weight misperception {{in contrast to the}} reference group who correctly perceived themselves as normal weight. Psychosocial health outcomes included headache, feeling stressful, feeling depressed, <b>poorer</b> <b>appetite,</b> sleepless at night, having nightmares and less confidence in getting along with friends. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for each outcome by weight misperception in boys and girls separately. Results. In girls, misperceived fatness was associated with all outcomes, while misperceived thinness was associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>appetite</b> and less confidence. Boys who misperceived themselves as very thin or fat had greater odds of all outcomes except having nightmares. In general, greater ORs were observed for misperceived fatness than thinness in girls, but similar ORs were observed in boys. Misperceived thinness and fatness accounted for 0. 6 % to 45. 1 % of the psychosocial health problems in adolescents. Conclusions. Normal weight adolescents with weight misperception {{were more likely to have}} psychosocial health problems, and the associations were stronger for extreme misperceptions (i. e., very fat or very thin) in both boys and girls. © 2011 Informa Healthcare. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nutrition {{is a key}} {{component}} {{in the management of}} infants with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These infants often have <b>poor</b> <b>appetites,</b> small oral intakes, and difficulty meeting their nutritional requirements. The ability of dietitians, nurses, parents, and caregivers to ensure adequate nutritional intake can be complicated by a variety of oral feeding challenges. Without successful treatment, resulting malnutrition contributes to poor growth and potential for neurocognitive developmental delay. This article provides practical information for identifying and providing early intervention to alleviate common feeding challenges in infants with CKD. A collaborative, multidisciplinary approach focused on enhancing oral motor skills and encouraging positive eating experiences for infants helps to minimize stressful feeding experiences for parents. In addition, it supports successful transition from tube feeding to complete oral feeding following transplant...|$|R

2500|$|Acute {{cases of}} {{hepatitis}} {{are seen to}} be resolved well within a six-month period. When hepatitis is continued {{for more than six}} months it is termed chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic early in its course and is detected only by liver laboratory studies for screening purposes or to evaluate non-specific symptoms. As the inflammation progresses, patients can develop constitutional symptoms similar to acute hepatitis, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, <b>poor</b> <b>appetite,</b> and joint pain. Jaundice can occur as well, but much later in the disease process and is typically a sign of advanced disease. Chronic hepatitis interferes with hormonal functions of the liver which can result in acne, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth), and amenorrhea (lack of menstrual period) in women. Extensive damage and scarring of the liver over time defines cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver's ability to function is permanently impeded. This results in jaundice, weight loss, coagulopathy, ascites (abdominal fluid collection), and peripheral edema (leg swelling). Cirrhosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, [...] hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to assess {{factors contributing to}} difference in nutritional status of patients {{at high risk for}} malnutrition. Twenty-five patients hospitalized for treatment of cancer and other disorders and for surgery were assessed using anthropometric, biochemical and dietary measures. Significant malnutrition was found. Males, as compared with females, had lower percent triceps skinfold, percent weight-for-height, percent hemoglobin, decreased appetites and total iron binding capacity. Mean total iron binding capacity for males was 62 percent of normal suggesting acute malnutrition similar to kwashiorkor. Cancer patients had lower total lymphocyte counts than those with other diagnosis. Patients hospitalized more than 23 days showed evidence of marasmus, with lower percent mid-arm muscle circumference, percent hematocrit, percent hemoglobin and a tendency for decreased weight/height than those hospitalized for a short time. Compared with patients with good <b>appetites,</b> those experiencing <b>poor</b> <b>appetites</b> had increased caloric and protein needs but lower protein intake compared to needs and lower creatinine-height-index. Five subjects with decreased weight/height had lower total iron binding capacity. The mean was 61 percent of normal indication severe depletion. The mid-arm muscle circumference was 82 percent of normal suggesting acute malnutrition imposed upon compromised somatic protein stores. Nine subjects showed evidence of frank kwashiorkor, three other subjects experienced marasmic-kwashiokor indication acute malnutrition imposed upon chronic malnutrition. In conclusion, this study suggests several characteristic features of hospitalized patients at risk for malnutrition: hospitalization for over three weeks, inadequate caloric and protein intake relation to need and anorexia.

2500|$|Thin Sow Syndrome (TSS) is a {{behavior}} observed in stalled sows {{that is similar}} to AA where some sows after early pregnancy are extremely active, eat little and waste away, resulting very often in death. They suffer from emaciation, hypothermia, a depraved appetite, restlessness and hyperactivity. [...] The syndrome may mainly be related to social and environmental stressors. [...] Stress in stalled sows is often perceived as the consequence of the restraint of animals that happens in intensive production units. The sows that suffer the most restraining conditions are those lactating or pregnant as they have very little room to move around because they are kept in barred gestation crates or tethered for the 16 weeks of pregnancy which prevents natural and social behaviors. [...] However, increased movement and freedom is also stressful for adult sows, which is usually the case after weaning. When placed into groups they fight vigorously, with one dominant sow emerging that eats voraciously. It is also likely that two subordinate sows make up part of the group who actively avoid competitive feeding situations and are bullied by the dominant sow. Affected sows have <b>poor</b> <b>appetite</b> but often show pica, excessive water intake (polydipsia) and are anemic.|$|E
2500|$|Unless a horse has severe EIPH, {{with blood}} {{present at the}} {{nostrils}} (known as epistaxis), the main sign is usually poor athletic performance; other signs are generally subtle and not easy to detect. Frequent swallowing and coughing in the immediate post-exercise recovery period, and <b>poor</b> <b>appetite</b> post-performance may be suggestive of EIPH. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by endoscopic examination of the trachea. In the case where no blood is visible in the trachea, EIPH in the small airways may still be present and can be confirmed by a bronchoalveolar lavage. [...] Impaired arterial blood gas (oxygen) tensions during intense exercise, increased blood lactate, and rarely death have been noted (likely due to ruptured chordae tendinae or a different mechanism of lung hemorrhage). Epistaxis is diagnosed when blood is visible at either or both nostrils during or following exercise. [...] To confirm whether the blood {{is coming from the}} upper or lower airway requires further examination by endoscopy, although in some cases {{it is not possible to}} determine the location.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Parental {{decision-making}} around extended formula feeding (12 months+) has {{not been}} explored previously. This study tested the hypotheses that extended formula milk use (i) is associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>appetite</b> and (ii) supplements lower food intake. METHODS: Appetite was assessed with the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) in 3854 twin children aged 16 months. Diet was assessed from 3 -day diaries in 2714 children at 21 months. Parents reported their children's weight at 24 months. Associations between formula feeding and (1) appetite, (2) energy intake and (3) weight were examined. 35 mothers were interviewed when the children were 7 years old to explore retrospectively their reasons for extended formula feeding. RESULTS: Formula consumers (13 % of the sample) scored significantly differently than non-formula consumers on {{five of the six}} CEBQ subscales, indicating lower appetite avidity: 'food responsiveness' (2. 02 vs 2. 22, respectively),'enjoyment of food' (3. 99 vs 4. 20), 'satiety responsiveness' (2. 89 vs 2. 65), 'slowness in eating' (2. 63 vs 2. 46) and 'food fussiness' (2. 34 vs 2. 14). Formula consumers had a significantly lower percentage of daily energy intake from food (70 % vs 74 %); however, total daily energy intake did not differ significantly from non-consumers (4315 vs 4373 kJ). At interview, mothers reported supplementing their child's diet with formula because of 'picky eating' and concerns about inadequate food intake. CONCLUSIONS: High formula milk intake is associated with picky-eating behaviours, but seems to act as a substitute for rather than a supplement to solid food. Prospective and intervention studies are needed to determine whether extended formula feeding has an enduring impact on weight trajectories, eating behaviours or health...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There are no {{randomized}} controlled trials {{to assess the}} impact of treating dental caries on various aspects of children’s health. This study was conducted {{to assess the impact}} of dental treatment of severe dental caries on children’s weight, height and subjective health related outcomes, namely dental pain, satisfaction with teeth and smile, dental sepsis and child’s appetite. Methods The study was a community-based, randomized, controlled trial in schoolchildren aged 6 - 7 years with untreated dental caries. Participants were randomly assigned to early (test) or regular (control) dental treatment. The primary outcome was Weight-for-age Z-score. Secondary outcomes were Height-for-age and BMI-for-age Z-scores, dental pain, dental sepsis, satisfaction with teeth and child’s appetite. Results 86 children were randomly assigned to test (42 children) and control (44) groups. Mean duration of follow-up was 34. 8 (± 1. 1) weeks. There were insignificant improvements in anthropometric outcomes between the groups after treatment of caries. However, treated children had significantly less pain experience (P[*]=[*] 0. 006) (OR 0. 09, [0. 01 - 0. 51]) and higher satisfaction with teeth (P[*]=[*] 0. 001) (OR 9. 91, [2. 68 - 36. 51]) compared to controls. Controls had significantly <b>poorer</b> <b>appetites</b> (P[*]=[*] 0. 01) (OR 2. 9, [1. 24 - 6. 82]) compared to treated children. All treated children were free of clinical dental sepsis whereas 20 % (9 of 44) of controls who were free of sepsis at baseline had sepsis at follow-up. Conclusions Although dental treatment did not significantly improve the anthropometric outcomes, it significantly improved the dental outcomes and children’s satisfaction with teeth, smile and appetite. This is the first study to provide evidence that treatment of severe dental caries can improve children’s appetite. Trial registration Effect of Dental Treatment on Children's Growth.
