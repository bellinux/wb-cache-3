40|$|Purpose. Low {{back pain}} is a {{frequent}} pathology among bicyclists, probably due to unappropriate saddle position. This radiographic {{study was conducted to}} evaluate dorso-lumbar angular values in two different <b>pedal</b> <b>unit</b> positions; the first one in a bicycle frame type with pedals in front of the saddle axis and the second one with the pedals behind the saddle axis, in order to define the most physiological sitting position. Materials and methods. Ten voluntary healthy adults, ranging in age between 21 to 45 years, were randomly choosen among a group of cyclist not involved in competition and underwent serial fluoroscopic studies while cyclists sit on two different saddles of a prototype cyclette; dorso-lumbar angles at both different sitting positions were measured on film according to modified Lippmann-Cobb method using as reference the upper somatic limitant of the eleventh or twelth dorsal vertebra and the lower somatic limitant of the third lumbar vertebra. Results. Statistical analysis of the measured angles demonstrates that the differences between the dorso-lumbar spine angle in the different saddle positions are statistically significative with a coefficient correlation equals to 0. 64015 and p> 0. 01; angular values are more physiological in the second position with <b>pedal</b> <b>unit</b> behind the saddle axis. Conclusions. The incidence and importance of low back pain in cyclists can be reduced with appropriate <b>pedal</b> <b>unit</b> position; the position with pedals behind the saddle axis permits more physiological spine angles in comparison with the classic one having the pedals in front of the saddle axis; this fact is due to a different pelvic position which coincides with lumbar angles...|$|E

5000|$|Effects {{are often}} {{incorporated}} into amplifiers {{and even some}} types of instruments. Electric guitar amplifiers typically have built-in reverb and distortion, while acoustic guitar and keyboard amplifiers tend to only have built-in reverb. Some acoustic instrument amplifiers have reverb, chorus, compression and equalization (bass and treble) effects. Vintage guitar amps (and their 2010-era reissued models) typically have tremolo and vibrato effects, and sometimes reverb. The Fender Bandmaster Reverb amp, for example, had built-in reverb and vibrato. Built-in effects may offer the user less control than standalone <b>pedals</b> or rackmounted <b>units.</b> For example, on some lower- to mid-priced bass amplifiers, the only control on the audio compression effect is a button or switch {{to turn it on}} or off, or a single knob. In contrast, a <b>pedal</b> or rackmounted <b>unit</b> would typically provide ratio, threshold and attack knobs and sometimes [...] "soft knee" [...] or other options to allow the user to control the compression.|$|R
50|$|Soldano (full name: Soldano Custom Amplification) is {{a guitar}} {{amplifier}} manufacturing company, founded in 1986 by Michael Soldano in Los Angeles, California and later relocated to Seattle, Washington. It is mostly {{known for its}} high gain amps such as its flagship model, the Soldano SLO-100, but the product lineup also includes effect <b>units,</b> <b>pedals</b> and cabinets. All Soldano products are tube-based and are class A/B.|$|R
25|$|Microprocessor {{technology}} {{allows the}} use of digital onboard effects in guitar amps to create numerous different sounds and tones that simulate {{the sound of a}} range of tube amplifiers and different sized speaker cabinets, all using the same amplifier and speaker. These are known as modeling amplifiers, and can be programmed with simulated characteristic tones of different existing amplifier models (and speaker cabinets—even microphone type or placement), or dialed in to the user's taste. Many amps of this type are also programmable by way of USB connection to a home computer or laptop. Line 6 is generally credited with bringing modeling amplification to the market. Modeling amplifiers and stompbox <b>pedals,</b> rackmount <b>units,</b> and software that models specific amplifiers, speakers cabinets, and microphones can provide a large number of sounds and tones. Players can get a reasonable facsimile of the sound of tube amplifiers, vintage combo amplifiers, and huge 8x10” speaker stacks without bringing all that heavy equipment to the studio or stage.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, the tonal {{palette of}} the {{electric}} guitar was further modified by introducing effect units in its signal path, before the guitar amp, of {{which one of the}} earliest units was the fuzz <b>pedal.</b> Effects <b>units</b> come in several formats, the most common of which are the stompbox [...] "pedal" [...] and the rackmount unit. A stomp box (or pedal) is a small metal or plastic box containing the circuitry, which is placed {{on the floor in front}} of the musician and connected in line with the patch cord connected to the instrument. The box is typically controlled by one or more foot-pedal on-off switches and it typically contains only one or two effects. Pedals are smaller than rackmount effects and usually less expensive. [...] "Guitar pedalboards" [...] are used by musicians who use multiple stomp-boxes; these may be a DIY project made with plywood or a commercial stock or custom-made pedalboard.|$|R

5000|$|The {{requirements}} for a chorus effect using a <b>pedal</b> or effect <b>unit</b> can {{vary depending on}} the type of instrument being used. Bass is a perfect example because it operates at a lower frequency range than a guitar. As such, a standard multi-level chorus can make the sound of the bass notes much thinner. This problem can be corrected by either mixing more of the un-affected signal into the mix or by increasing the amount of bass frequency chorused in the sound. Pedals such as the [...] "I90" [...] chorus from bass amplifier manufacturer Eden Electronics allow the musician to control both of these elements.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Fender Stratocasters, Beck {{occasionally}} plays Fender Telecaster and Gibson Les Paul {{models as}} well. His amplifiers are primarily Fender and Marshall. In his earlier {{days with the}} Yardbirds, Beck also used a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar (now owned by Seymour W. Duncan, and housed in the Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) through Vox AC30s. He has also played {{through a variety of}} fuzz <b>pedals</b> and echo <b>units</b> along with this set-up and has used the Pro Co RAT distortion pedal. The Seymour Duncan JB models name is an acronym for both [...] "Jazz & Blues" [...] and [...] "Jeff Beck", as it was designed in conjunction with the guitarist.|$|R
5000|$|Cream {{recorded}} the song at Atlantic Studios in New York City in May 1967, during the sessions for Disraeli Gears. [...] Atlantic brought in engineer Tom Dowd and producer Felix Pappalardi {{to work with}} Cream on their next album. For the recording, Clapton used a wah-wah <b>pedal</b> guitar effects <b>unit</b> for the first time. Cream performed the song in concert and a 10 March 1968 recording from Winterland in San Francisco is included on Live Cream Volume II. [...] In May 1968, the group were filmed performing it for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour television programme. [...] "Tales of Brave Ulysses" [...] was later overshadowed by [...] "White Room", which utilised the chord progression and wah-wah to create one of Cream's biggest hits.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} by Steven Stapleton {{and his wife}} Diana Rogerson in May 1988. The only sound source was a number of effects units which he had set up to operate in a feedback loop - there was no original input signal being processed, simply the feedback hum generated by plugging the original chain of pedals back into itself. However, when Stapleton went near the pedals he found the sound changed in accordance with his proximity to the various <b>pedals</b> and <b>units.</b> Stapleton told author David Keenan (in the book England's Hidden Reverse) that he had created the album by gently moving his fingers above the various units to create the slow, subtle changes in the sound. As this shouldn't happen, Stapleton has put the album down to an electrical fault of some sort in the studio. This was acknowledged on a later reissue with the credit [...] "our thanks to Electricity for making this recording possible". He remains proud of the album, describing it to Keenan as [...] "fucking brilliant". The album title refers to Stapleton and Rogerson's daughter Lilith who was born that year. Lilith {{would go on to}} contribute both artwork and vocals to releases by NWW and Current 93.|$|R
5000|$|The use of [...] "Full Range Flat Response" [...] (FRFR) {{amplification}} {{systems by}} electric guitarists has received an extra impetus from modeling amplifiers. Before the widespread availability of modeling amplifiers and units, an electric guitarist {{would not be}} able to plug her/his electric guitar straight into a PA system or powered speaker, because in most rock genres, the tonal coloration that a regular guitar amp's preamplifier, equalization filters, power amp, guitar speaker and cabinet design (e.g., 8x10" [...] cabinet) are an essential part of a guitarist's unique tone. The basic concept of FRFR is that the tone is shaped by sound processors placed in the signal chain before the amplifier/speaker stage. However, instead of a guitar amplifier, with its particular sound-shaping characteristics (e.g., many amps roll off high treble frequencies and many amplifiers add frequency coloration), a flat-frequency response amplification systems can be used, such as amplified speakers or a PA system (full-range speakers), or dedicated combo-style amplifiers with a broad frequency range. Such processors can be traditional guitar effects, a modeling amplifier (without power amplifier), or a computer running tone-shaping software. With an amp modeling <b>pedal</b> or <b>unit,</b> a guitarist could even use a flat-response keyboard amplifier combo amp to produce overdriven, vintage tones and sounds.|$|R
50|$|Power-valve {{distortion}} {{can also}} be produced in a dedicated rackmount valve power amp. A modular rackmount setup often involves a rackmount preamp, a rackmount valve power amp, and a rackmount dummy load to attenuate the output to desired volume levels. Some effects pedals internally produce power-valve distortion, including an optional dummy load {{for use as a}} power-valve distortion <b>pedal.</b> Such effects <b>units</b> can use a preamp valve such as the 12AX7 in a power-valve circuit configuration (as in the Stephenson's Stage Hog), or use a conventional power valve, such as the EL84 (as in the H&K Crunch Master compact tabletop unit). However, because these are usually placed before the pre-amplifier in the signal chain, they contribute to the overall tone in a different way. Power amplifier distortion may damage speakers.|$|R
5000|$|The organ {{was built}} by Thomas Christopher Lewis in {{consultation}} with William Rea, the Newcastle City organist, and was dedicated a mere {{three months after the}} consecration of the church in February 1885. It stands in the South Transept, directly under the tower, facing North, with a generous amount of free space around it. From this position, its commanding voice can be heard {{in all parts of the}} building without loss of impact, even with a full congregation.It is a substantial instrument, built in Lewis's grand style with Swell behind Great on the same level and <b>Pedal</b> on three <b>unit</b> chests behind and alongside the manual divisions. There is no facade casework, although the front pipes appear to have been laid out to receive one, the lower part is panelled in oak. The console is central in the case and is 'en fenêtre'. The action to manuals and drawstops is mechanical; the pedal action is pneumatic. A Discus blower feeds the main bellows which can still be raised by hand. A full restoration of the organ was carried out in 1987, by Harrison & Harrison of Durham. The organ is one of a small number in the country designed by Lewis which have not been significantly altered. [...] The church has a regular recital series on Bank Holidays and in the summer months.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} the new , 9.5:1 compression ratio [...] six-cylinder engine with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor. It was VAM's second self-engineered engine, taking the Javelin up to performance levels of its V8 competition. The Go Pack version of this engine took the car to its zenith in terms of performance. The new engine was announced by two [...] "4.6" [...] emblems on both front fenders. The only other technical difference of the new version was a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for units equipped with automatic transmission. The interior saw more changes starting with all-new non-reclining high-back bucket seats with built-in [...] "J" [...] emblems on the seat backs {{as well as on}} the center of the rear seat back. The dashboard was restricted to the unit with woodgrain overlays only; the instrument cluster was once again completely different from the AMC Javelins. The right pod housed a clock and tachometer hybrid with the same design and appearance as the US Rallye Pak units, except that it was tuned for six cylinder engines. The center pod had a 240km/h speedometer, a range that put it on par as an equivalent to AMC's 140 MHP unit of the Rallye Pak; but the colors, graphics, and typography of the dial were the same as the standard gauges. This created a high contrast between the speedometer and the clock/tack hybrid. On the left pod were the fuel and water temperature gauges with no oil pressure and ammeter gauges present. Like the AMC Javelins, the car now held a single dome light at the center of the headliner and a new brake <b>pedal</b> design for <b>units</b> with automatic transmission.|$|R
40|$|There {{is almost}} no water left {{on earth that}} is safe to drink without {{purification}} after 20 - 25 years from today. This is a seemingly bold statement, but it is unfortunately true. Only 1 % of Earth’s water is in a fresh, liquid state, and nearly {{all of this is}} polluted by both diseases and toxic chemicals. For this reason, purification of water supplies is extremely important. Keeping these things in mind, we have designed a model which will convert the dirty/saline water into pure/ potable water using the renewable source of energy (i. e., Human power). The machine consists of a human-powered flywheel motor using a bicycle-drive mechanism with speed-increasing gearing and a flywheel, which drive the process unit though a spiral jaw clutch and torque increasing gearing. The operator puts energy into the flywheel at a convenient power level for about one minute. After enough energy is stored, pedaling is stopped and the energy in the flywheel is made available to the process <b>unit.</b> <b>Pedal</b> power is the transfer of energy from a human source {{through the use of a}} foot pedal and crank system. This technology is most commonly used for transportation and has been used to propel bicycles. Less commonly pedal power is used to power agricultural and hand tools and even to generate electricity by using the generator. This electricity is used for distillation of water in evaporator. The basic mode of the heat transfer involved is convection and The results are obtained by evaporation of the dirty/ saline water and fetching it out as pure/drinkable water. The designed model produces 1. 5 litres of pure water from 14 litres of dirty water during six hours. The efficiency of plant is 64. 37 %...|$|R
