[...] The decision to do this was described by Human Rights Watch as “not just to prevent a demonstration, but also to physically punish those daring to protest <b>President</b> <b>Mubarak’s</b> candidacy.” [...] The tactics seemed {{to have an effect}} when Kefaya was forced to abandon its plan of inviting several prominent figures to run against the President when no names were forthcoming.

25|$|Throughout the 1980s, Mubarak {{increased}} {{the production of}} affordable housing, clothing, furniture, and medicine. By the time he became <b>President,</b> <b>Mubarak</b> {{was one of a}} few Egyptian officials who refused to visit Israel and vowed to take a less enthusiastic approach to normalizing relations with the Israeli government. Mubarak was quick to deny that his policies would result in difficulties for Egyptian-Israeli dealings in the future. Egypt's heavy dependence on US aid and its hopes for US pressure on Israel for a Palestinian settlement continued under Mubarak. He quietly improved relations with the former Soviet Union. In 1987, Mubarak won an election to a second six-year term.|$|E

25|$|In December 1999, in {{response}} to strong criticism of the Ottoman decree, <b>President</b> <b>Mubarak</b> issued a decree making the repair of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code.

The practical impact of the decree has been to facilitate significantly church repairs; however, Christians report that local permits still are subject to security authorities' approval. The approval process for church construction continued to be time consuming and insufficiently responsive to {{the wishes of the}} Christian community. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began to {{investigate}} Abdel-Rahman {{and his followers}} more closely. An Egyptian informant wearing a listening device for the FBI managed to record Abdel-Rahman saying he preferred attacks be concentrated on US military targets, but also stating acts of violence against civilian targets were not illicit. The most startling plan, the government charged, was to set off five bombs in 10 minutes, blowing up the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and a federal building housing the FBI. Government prosecutors showed videotapes of the defendants mixing bomb ingredients in a garage before their arrest in 1993. Abdel-Rahman was arrested on 24 June 1993, along with nine of his followers.
