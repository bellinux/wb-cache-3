40|$|The use of {{tilting pad}} journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) {{has increased in}} recent years due to their stabilizing effects on the rotor bearing system. Most of the studies addressing steady state and dynamic behaviors of TPJBs have been evaluated by means of thermo-hydrodynamic (THD) models, assuming nominal dimensions for the bearing, (i. e., the physical dimensions of all pads are identical and loads applied along the vertical direction). However machining errors could lead to actual bearing geometry and dimensions different from the nominal ones. In particular, for TPJB the asymmetry of the bearing geometry has not been well-investigated {{and can lead to}} an unexpected behavior of the bearing. The asymmetry of the bearing geometry can arise from large machining errors on only one or more pads, as a consequence of a pivot failure or after bad-mounting of the pads during assembly. These conditions can sometimes be detected by high values of the pad temperature, as measured by the temperature probes installed on the bearing pads, or by the abnormal vibration caused by pad-flutter phenomena. In this paper the authors investigate large machining errors on the pad thickness for a five-pad TPJB and analyze their effects on the bearing operating characteristics. Pad thickness errors correspond to a different preload factor or clearance for each pad. A sensitivity analysis was performed for several combinations of pad thickness using a THD model and the behavior of the bearing was analyzed, including dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients, clearance <b>profile,</b> <b>shaft</b> locus, minimum oil-film thickness, power loss, flow rate, and maximum pressure. The experimental case of a five pads TPJB with an intentional large machining error on the thickness of the pads is also described in the paper. The bearing has a nominal diameter of 100 mm, a diameter to length ratio (L/D) equal to 0. 7 and can run at up to 3000 rpm. The experimental measurements are compared with the results obtained from the analytical model. The results show that the effects of asymmetry of the bearing geometry are more evident if the direction of the static load applied on the rotor bearing system, which is different from the vertical load, is also considered. For instance, the shape of shaft locus obtained by experimental tests changing the static load direction at a constant speed is an irregular pentagon if it is compared to the case of the nominal bearing. Based on our findings, we concludes that the machining error on the pads has a large influence on the shaft locus, minimum oil-film thickness and maximum pressure on pads, especially at high rotational speed, but has little effect on the flow rate and power loss. In addition, this error significantly affects the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients, both in terms of rotational speed and load direction...|$|R

Results indicate that, for two-lobule gears, the maximum and minimum values of the polar radii, the velocity at the contact point, and the gear ratio are the same for both profiles.

Part of the problem lies in the unknown nature of many of the rock types and formations that overlie or underlie the conglomerate reef bands within the rockmass. One of these little known rock types is the highly altered Westonaria Formation Lavas (WAF), which has impacted significantly on the stability, production sustainability and the rock engineering designs at many of the mines in the area. The Ya Rona Shaft Pillar Extraction is one of the mining operations where WAF has determined the course of many interventions. Failure of the WAF has occurred at mines that had not identified it as a potential hazard, which has led to large-scale fall-outs, significant damage to excavations, particularly shafts, and more importantly, operational downtime.

To determine the optimal parameters for the profile shape, an analytical expression was derived that related the tolerance between the nut and shaft to the angular backlash, which was validated using SolidWorks. A deterministic design process was then followed to size the actuators and transmissions for such drive mechanisms given a set of specifications for cannula/stylet force and speed. Specifically, the gear train was designed to ensure sufficient force for deploying a pre-curved needle from a cannula and into a gelatinous solid based on previously collected experimental data. Using this process, Faulhaber AM 1524 micro-stepper motors with 15 A planetary gearheads were selected that could provide 10 N and 20 N of force to both the cannula and stylet (in line with the screws) at a speed of 7 mm/s. Accuracy and repeatability of the drive mechanism were measured in a bench-top experiment using calipers and a protractor and yielded sub-mm values for translation and approximately two degrees of play for rotation. Targeting experiments were also performed in ballistics gelatin and ex-vivo tissue samples where the distal tip of the stylet was recorded with a camera and CT scanner and demonstrated that the device is ready for testing with an integrated thermal ablation system. by Carmen Marten-Ellis Graves.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{diagnostics}} of ball bearings in direct-drive motors. These specific AC brushless motors are increasing their importance in automation machineries because they can work with a built-in flexibility. In particular the angular displacement of the shaft is continuously monitored by an embedded encoder while the control system allows to perform complex motion profiles such as polynomial ones, even with the inversion of the rotating direction. Direct-drive motors avoid {{the presence of a}} mechanical cams or gearboxes between the motor and the load with a subsequent money-saving. On the other side, unfortunately, the diagnostics of ball bearing in those motors is not trivial. In fact most of the solutions proposed in the literature require a constant frequency rotation of the shaft since the characteristic fault frequencies are directly proportional to speed of the motor. It follows that in a varying speed application the fault characteristic frequencies change instantaneously as the rotational frequency does. Moreover the direct link between the motor and load introduces dynamical effects on the vibration signal of the bearing by means of the load variations. In this paper an industrial application is considered, where the direct drive motors are used in the kinematic chain of an automated packaging machine performing a cyclic polynomial profile. The basic idea is to focus on signal segmentation using the position <b>profile</b> of the <b>shaft</b> – directly measured by the encoder – as trigger. Next the single cycles of the machine is analysed in time domain, again using encoder signal machine contribution is deleted. Feature extraction for damage detection is done by applying the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), the STFT for each cycle is averaged in time-frequency domain in order to enhance fault signature. For Averaged Cyclic STFT, the Spectral Kurtosis is used to select the optimal frequency band. To support this decision an Energy Distribution in frequency domain is used. Finally, the sum of STFT coefficients is used as a simple indicators of damage. Detection of the status of the bearing can be done automaticall...|$|R

This second type of cell may exhibit none, one or several sparsely branched axon like processes which terminate {{in the vicinity of}} the cell body.

R. The portions of the dendrites from which these vesicle containing processes issue also show clusters of vesicles, ribosomes and an orderly array of microtubules. Golgi impregnated axons are followed from the optic tract and seen terminating as irregular enlargements (2 - 6 μ) on proximal dendrites of relay cells and on distal dendrites of the PA neuron. The intimate contact of the terminal branches of an optic collateral with a distal PA dendrite is carefully illustrated. Small calibered axons are likewise traced from the internal medullary lamina and seen to end by means of end knobs on distal dendrites of both types of neurons. Electron microscopic observations substantiate the Golgi images and reveal 3 different types (I, II, III) of endings in the geniculate neuropil. The large type I endings correspond to the retinal afferents which generally make asymmetric synaptic contact with type II profiles and/or with clusters of microspines on the TSR dendrites. Type II, thought to be the spheroidal dendritic appendages of the PA neurons, form symmetrical synaptic contacts with profiles of its own kind or more commonly with dendrites of the TSR neuron. The type III ending, probably cortical in origin, establishes asymmetrical synaptic contacts with small dendritic profiles. Only profiles of types I and II endings, together with those of other dendritic profiles, form part of the nest like junctions known as the synaptic glomeruli.
