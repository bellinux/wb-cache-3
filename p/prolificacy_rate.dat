The best extender identified in vitro was then compared with fresh semen to determine fertility and <b>prolificacy</b> <b>rates</b> in vivo. Eight semen pools were split into four subsamples and each of them was diluted to a ratio of 1 : 10 (volume:volume) with four different extenders (Lepus ®, Cortalap ®, TCG and Merk III ®) and stored at 5 °C for 72 h. Sperm motility, viability, sperm membrane and acrosome integrity were evaluated in both fresh and chilled semen at 4, 24, 48 and 72 h of storage. The results showed that Cortalap ® was the best extender to preserve the quality of rabbit semen in vitro over 72 h in comparison with the other extenders (P< 0. 05).

Therefore, 80 adult goats were assigned to 2 groups (n= 40), the first one was exposed to artificial long days (16 L: 8 D) and the second one was placed under natural photoperiod during 70 days. After this treatment and for 14 days, the groups were subdivided in 2 subgroups (n= 40) in order to one of them receive nutritional supplementation 7 days before and after buck introduction on the flock. The artificial light treatment did not have influence (p> 0, 05) on the male effect response in any of the reproductive parameters and reproductive efficiency.

Here the current performance of ten goat holdings in the northern region of Morocco, classified as either commercial milk producers, commercial cheese producers or non-commercial dairy producers, was recorded, based on the Food and Agricultural Organisation and International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (FAO-CIHEAM) technical and economic indicators, to assess whether intensification of dairy production was financially viable.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of different levels of concentrate supplementation containing 18 % CP and 3. 15 Mcal/kg/DM during creep feeding of lambs on their weight and performance at different ages, the onset of puberty and reproductive performance. Thirty-six Suffolk lambswere used, divided into three levels of concentrate intake (1, 2. 5 and 4 % of body weight). The animals were fed from birth to weaning. Feed was supplied once a day and daily leftovers were recorded. The lambs were identified, weighed at birth, 30 days and 60 days of age, when they were weaned. There was no significant difference in body weight and average daily weight gain at 30 and 60 days of age. The intake levels did not affect the parameters measured. The daily supplementation with 4 % concentrate provided better reproductive performance in the first and second year of mating, but did not increase the number of lambs per birth.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} {{possibility}} that bovine somatotropin (BST) treatment after artificial insemination (AI) may improve the fertility by the stimulation of corpus luteum (CL) function in seasonally anestrous ewes. The experiment was conducted at the Tawa Field Station, Shibecha-cho in Hokkaido, Japan, during the non-breeding season (May, 1995). Eighty-nine mature (2 to 3 years old) Suffolk and Suffolk-crossed ewes were treated with controlled internal drug release devices containing 0. 3 g progesterone (CIDR-G) for 12 days. Ewes were injected intramuscularly with 500 IU PMSG the day before CIDR removal. Eighty-seven ewes were assigned to an insemination of frozen semen on a fixed-time basis (42 to 50 h) after removal of CIDR. On the 11 th day after AI (13 days after CIDR removal), 43 inseminated ewes were received 100 mg of recombinant BST, while the remaining 44 ewes were given vehicle as controls. The BST administration appeared to reduce pregnancy (65. 1 % vs. 72. 7 %) and lambing (51. 2 vs. 65. 9 %) <b>rates,</b> <b>prolificacy</b> (145. 5 % vs. 165. 5 %) and proportion of ewes rearing more than two lambs (47. 6 % vs. 60. 7 %), as compared with controls, {{although there was no}} signifiant difference. BST-treated ewes had higher plasma GH concentrations (endogenous GH plus exogenous BST) at Day 19 (8 days after BST treatment) as compared with controls in both pregnant and non-pregnant ewes (P< 0. 05). Also, in the control group, plasma GH concentration of pregnant ewes was higher than that of non-pregnant ewes (P< 0. 05). Plasma progesterone (P) and estradiol- 17 β (E) cencentrations at Day 19 were lower in BST-treated ewes than that of control ewes (P< 0. 05).

30|$|Rabbit {{has been}} {{identified}} as an animal with enormous potential because of its unique attributes such as high <b>prolificacy,</b> rapid growth <b>rate,</b> small body size, short generation interval, and encouraging forage utilizing ability (Akinfala, Matanmi, and Aderibigbe, 2003). This has caused the increase in growth of rabbit industries in many African countries, and subsequently, the feeding challenges being faced by the rabbit’s breeders. This created the need for a search for alternative feed resources that support the normal health and enhances the performance of the rabbits. The aim of livestock farmer is to produce the animal protein in the shortest possible time to meet the demand for animal protein. To achieve this aim, the use of antibiotic growth promoter in livestock production to promote growth by enhancing feed utilization and inhibition of pathogens activities are being considered by the farmers (Akanmu and Adeyemo, 2012). However, the awareness of possible microbial resistances in farm animals and the eventual antibiotic residue in animal products later formed a major discouragement for the use of antibiotic growth promoter for animal production (Falcao-e-Cuhna et al. 2007). This thereafter fuelled the search for {{and the use of the}} alternative to antibiotic growth promoters or complementary medicines to enhance performance, immunomodulation, and general health maintenance in animal production. Herbs of medicinal values are currently in increasing demand as they are being found suitable for the animal with the benefits of low cost and total safety (Dhama et al. 2015). Medicinal plant parts, when incorporated in the rabbit diets, could serve as protein source suitable for replacing in full or part the conventional and expensive protein feedstuff and also as a phytobiotic growth promoter (Oloruntola et al. 2016). Herbs in monogastric diets are known for impacting the metabolism by combating microbial activities and stress (Dhama et al. 2015) through the prevention of pathogens colonization and enhancement of the digestive enzymes production and activities by the phytogenic components of the plants’ parts (Dhama et al. 2015; Langhout, 2000). Numerous plants possess anti-microbial traits which are synthesized during secondary metabolism of the plant (Rusenova and Parvanov, 2009).|$|R

Thereafter, both groups were fed according to needs. Maternal body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and Non Esterified Fatty Acids (NEFA), progesterone, leptin and cortisol plasma concentrations were monitored weekly during the restriction period and the following month, then monthly until weaning. Lambs were weighed weekly until weaning at 22 kg BW, then monthly. Plasma leptin was monitored monthly in lambs. The BW, BCS, and leptin concentrations were significantly decreased, whereas NEFA and cortisol concentrations were increased in R dams. Maximum progesterone concentration was higher in R ewes that had a high (10 - 25 %) vs. low (0 - 10 %) BW loss during restriction (27. 9 +/- 2. 59 vs. 20. 8 +/- 2. 00 ng/mL, P < 0. 05). Overall, gestation was significantly longer in the R group (151. 0 +/- 0. 3 vs. 149. 4 +/- 0. 4 days, P < 0. 001).

The effects of tethering or herding on flock productivity were investigated, from March 2001 to March 2003, using 24 goat flocks which were selected from 3 flock sizes (i. e. 1 to 5, 6 to 10 and > 10 goats/flock). Productivity was analysed in terms of kidding pattern, kidding <b>rates,</b> <b>prolificacy,</b> kidding interval, off-take and death rates. The major findings were that kidding patterns were similar under both management systems with two major peaks from March to April and from September to December and kidding rates were low and were not affected by management system (P> 0. 05). Prolificacy was also not affected by management system (P> 0. 05). Kidding intervals were long but similar (P> 0. 05) between the 2 management systems. The sales, slaughters and death rates were low for both systems. It was concluded that the productivity of goats reared under herding or tethering was similar. However, {{there was a need}} to reduce reproductive wastage and form goat marketing centres so as to increase sales. In the second study, the effect of supplementary feeding, with sunflower cake, on doe fertility was investigated using 36 goat flocks which were randomly allocated to 3 treatment groups (i. e. Group 1 no supplementary feed, in Group 2 the does were offered 270 g/ day of hand pressed sunflower cake during the first 60 days of lactation and in Group 3 the does received 270 g/ day of the sunflower cake from late pregnancy and continued through the first 60 days of lactation). Fertility was analysed in terms of kidding <b>rate,</b> kidding interval, <b>prolificacy</b> and age at first kidding. The major findings were that kidding rates were low and not affected by the treatments (P> 0. 05). The kidding rates ranged from 2. 84 â€žb 1. 21 to 5. 08 â€žb 1. 21 and from 1. 61 â€žb 1. 21 to 5. 60 â€žb 1. 40 parturitions/ 100 does/doe year in the control and supplemented flocks, respectively. Age at first kidding was not affected by treatment group (P> 0. 05).
