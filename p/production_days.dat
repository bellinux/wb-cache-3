500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in seven days, {{starting}} on August 26, 1997. The MTA gave permission for filming {{to take place}} in one of their subways, but only allowed shooting to take place between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. when the trains were not running. The restrictive hours, short preparation time, confining shooting space and excessive heat due to lack of ventilation created additional stresses to the crew of more than 100 people during the filming of the episode. The tight schedule and lack of rehearsal time was difficult on the actors, but D'Onofrio said that it added [...] "a certain velocity and energy" [...] to the shoot, which made the dialogue from the actors feel less rehearsed and more spontaneous. Yoshimura served as the on-set consulting editor during filming along with fellow producer David Simon, who wrote the book , from which the series was adapted. The cast and crew shot between seven and nine pages of the script each of the seven <b>production</b> <b>days.</b> Fleder said he was impressed by this pace because he usually shoots between one and two pages per day during his movies, and he said that the actors on Homicide: Life on the Street were better prepared and more cooperative than his usual film actors.|$|E

40|$|Influence of {{pelleting}} {{calf feed}} mixtures supplemented with bentoni on microbiological and mycotoxicological properties was investigated. Microbiological and mycotoxicological quality was investigated at the <b>production</b> <b>day</b> (day 0) and after 45 days of storage. Total count of microorganisms in the pelleted mixture, {{at the day}} 0 (280. 000 /g), was several times lower than in the powdered mixture (2. 000. 000 /g). Similar results were obtained at day 45 when {{the total number of}} microorganisms in the pelleted mixture was 270. 000 /g and 1. 800. 000 /g in the powdered mixture. Number of yeasts and molds at the <b>production</b> <b>day</b> in the pelleted mixture was 650 /g, and in the powdered mixture it was 27. 000 /g. Similar results were obtained 45 days later when the number of yeasts and molds in the pelleted mixture was 540 /g, and 16. 000 /g in the powdered mixture. There were 6 species identified in the pelleted mixture, and 9 species in the powdered mixture at the <b>day</b> of <b>production.</b> Similar mold species ratio in the pelleted (11) and powdered mixture (13) was found at day 45. In the examined samples representatives of Fusarium genus - F. subglutinans i F. verticillioides dominated. Number of sultite-redzcing clostridia in the mixtures, in both observed periods, was similar (below 1000 /g of sample). By mycotoxicological analysis of mixtures at the <b>production</b> <b>day,</b> only trichotecene (T- 2 toxin) presence was found in amount of 0, 337 mg/kg.

40|$|Eight {{commercial}} probiotic {{fermented milk}} products (six full fat and two low fat) from Al-Ahsa markets were evaluated for chemical, microbiological and sensory properties. The chemical composition parameters ranged from 0. 9 - 1. 2 % fat (low fat products), 3. 0 - 3. 9 % fat (full fat products), 3. 1 - 4. 7 % protein, 0. 7 - 1. 2 % ash and 7. 5 - 3. 7 % carbohydrate {{in all the}} milk products. The pH values of all the products decreased significantly from the <b>production</b> <b>day</b> {{to the end of}} storage period. With respect to the microbiological side, the coliform bacteria, moulds and yeasts counts were not detected in all the products during the refrigerated storage at 5 ± 1 °C. However, seven out of eight products contained over 10 6 cfu mL - 1 of bifidobacteria on the <b>production</b> <b>day.</b> Only two of these products maintained 10 6 cfu mL - 1 viable count of bifidobacteria till the end of cold storage period. On the other hand, three out of eight products showed the highest number of L. acidophilus viable count (above 10 8 cfu mL - 1) on <b>production</b> <b>day.</b> The results of sensory evaluation showed that all the tested products obtained high scores for flavor, appearance, texture or consistency and smell (odor) properties during the storage period. These results suggest that for optimum benefits, the probiotic fermented milk products with live probiotic bacteria should be consumed within one week of their production date. The research provided useful information to the dairy industries to develop new technology to ensure the supply of high quality milk products to the consumers...|$|R
