40|$|European {{legislation}} currently {{does not}} clearly determine in what language <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> terms must be drafted {{in order to}} be validly incorporated into consumer contracts so they can be relied upon by a trader. This may be particularly problematic {{in the case of a}} cross-border contract as parties may not speak the same language. In this paper, I indicate to what extent the transparency requirement may play a role in determining the language in which the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> terms are to be drafted. Finally, on the basis of experiments I conducted with colleagues, I conclude that traders should be required to provide the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> terms in the contracting language, but that there is no need to require them to provide the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> terms in the consumer’s mother tongue...|$|R

In this setup, {{the introduction of a}} <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> statically expands the volume of trade but it hampers legal and contractual innovation by crowding out the use of non-standard contracts. We rationalize the large scale standardization effort (by commercial codification and private standards) that occurred in Civil and Common Law systems in the XIX century during a period of booming commerce and long distance trade...|$|R

40|$|In German {{electricity}} submarkets {{for residential}} customers <b>standard</b> <b>contracts</b> offered by former monopolists {{are the more}} costly option for customers who have not switched to an alternative contract yet. As most German households are served with this contract type we follow the Limit Pricing theory and show that <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> price {{could be used as}} an instrument to affect competition, in terms of market entries, in the related market. We theoretically derive the optimal price-setting behavior of a price-discriminating incumbent provider and show that under particular circumstances reducing the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> price could increases the incumbent’s profit. We then analyze our theoretical findings employing data for German retail electricity submarkets using simultaneous equation approach and can find support for our hypothesis. In particular for customers with low consumption and high relative switching costs the results show that the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> price can affect market entry whereas for high consumption level customers we have to reject our hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we intend}} to make a brief {{analysis}} of some issues relating to the unfair terms within the contracts concluded in the banking activity by the credit institutions with the consumers. The contracts concluded by the credit institutions with the consumers are <b>contracts</b> containing <b>pre-formulated</b> <b>standard</b> terms, meaning that they are set out prior to {{the conclusion of the}} contract and submitted to the consumer, substantially reducing the possibility to negotiate them. On the other hand, due to the highly technical nature of the banking regulations and the terminology used by them, in the bank contracts there are several terms for whose understanding the consumer needs specialized knowledge. Precisely for this reason, the legislator regulates a number of conditions relating to the negotiation and conclusion of the contracts between the professionals and the consumers, as well as the identification and finding of the unfair terms within the contracts. At the same time, in the content of the bank contracts may also be identified certain terms {{that are part of the}} examples listed in the Appendix to the Law no. 193 / 2000...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{regulation}} in <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> {{terms in the}} proposal for a Commono European Sales Law (CESL) is compared with {{the regulation}} in the Unfair Terms Directive, the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) and the Vienna Sales Convention (CISG). The paper starts with {{an overview of the}} content of Chapter 8 CESL. Next, the matter of the incorporation of <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> terms is dealt with, in particular with a view to commercial contracts. Section IV is dedicated to a discussion of the limitations for the unfairness test. The principle of transparency constitutes the subject-matter of section V, whereas section VI deals with the unfairness test and section VII with the question whether the unfairness test is to be applied by courts of their own motion in commercial contracts as well as in consumer contracts. I conclude that with regard to standard terms regulation the CESL offers an improvement in many regards to the existing international legal instruments with regard to <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> terms regulation. This applies in particular with regard to the clearly underdeveloped rules of the CISG. This is particularly relevant since both the CESL and the CISG are optional instruments intended to be applied to cross-border sales contracts. At least with regard to <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> terms regulation, the CESL is to be preferred over the clearly underdeveloped rules of the CISG...|$|R
