5|$|These laws put U.S.-flagged vessels at an {{economic}} disadvantage against countries lacking such safeguards. By moving their ships to the <b>Panamanian</b> flag, owners could avoid providing these protections. Belen Quezada, the first foreign ship flagged in the <b>Panamanian</b> registry, was employed in running illegal alcohol between Canada and the United States during Prohibition. In addition to sidestepping the Seamen's Act, Panamanian-flagged ships in this early period paid sailors on the Japanese wage scale, which was {{much lower than}} that of western merchant powers.|$|E
5|$|Using {{economic}} sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted {{a campaign to}} drive <b>Panamanian</b> ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor. In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the <b>Panamanian</b> army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore <b>Panamanian</b> civil liberties. Although the mission was controversial, U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.|$|E

5|$|Arias {{returned}} to Panama {{in the early}} 1960s to work for political reform, soon joining the small Christian Democratic Party of Panama. In 1972, he left Panama for some time with his family, becoming a dean and later vice president at Florida International University in Miami, Florida in the US. In 1980, however, he declined an offer to become provost, and instead {{returned to}} <b>Panamanian</b> politics.|$|E
5|$|During his presidency, Endara {{abolished}} the <b>Panamanian</b> military {{and replaced it}} with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates. His administration was marked by internal fighting and corruption scandals, and his popularity plummeted. He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares on September 1, 1994.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in her career, U-38 would head to sea with a new commander, Korvettenkapitän Heinrich Schuch. She left on 6 August, for a five-week patrol in the North Atlantic. During this time one ship was hit, the <b>Panamanian</b> steam {{freighter}} SS Longtanker on 18 August. U-38 returned to Lorient on 14 September 1941.|$|E

5|$|He later founded his own {{political}} party, the Moral Vanguard of the Fatherland, and in 2009 was again {{a candidate for the}} <b>Panamanian</b> general elections. Ricardo Martinelli of the Democratic Change party won the election with 61% of the vote, while PRD candidate Balbina Herrera won 37%. Endara placed a distant third, with 2% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, a U.S. {{federal judge}} {{approved}} the French government's request to extradite Noriega to France after his release. Noriega appealed his extradition because he claimed France would not honor his legal {{status as a}} prisoner of war. In 1999, the <b>Panamanian</b> government sought the extradition of Noriega to face murder charges in Panama {{because he had been}} found guilty in absentia in 1995 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 1989, Endara ran as the candidate of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition (ADOC), a coalition of parties opposed to military ruler Manuel Noriega. His rival was Carlos Duque, a candidate selected by Noriega. The US government contributed $10 million to <b>Panamanian</b> opposition campaigns, though it was unknown whether Endara received any of this money.|$|E

5|$|Moscoso is the {{daughter}} of a schoolteacher and was born into a poor family in Pedasí, Panama as the youngest of six children. She later worked as a secretary and joined the 1968 presidential campaign of Arnulfo Arias; Arias had already served two partial terms as president, both times being deposed by the <b>Panamanian</b> military. He won the presidency but was again deposed by the military, this time after only nine days in office.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{is rare in}} Panama. <b>Panamanian</b> Oryzomys {{were first}} {{described}} by Goldman in 1912, who introduced the name Oryzomys gatunensis for a specimen from Gatún in the Canal Zone. In 1918, Goldman kept the animal as a separate species, remarking that it was similar to richmondi, but distinctive in the well-developed ridges along {{the margins of the}} interorbital region, the short interparietal bone (part of the roof of the braincase), and the long nasal bones. In 1937, Bole described another species of <b>Panamanian</b> Oryzomys, Oryzomys azuerensis from Paracoté, Veraguas Province. It is a brown form, lacking the reddish tones of nearby populations, and has a broad skull with a short rostrum (front part) and ridges on the interorbital region like those of gatunensis. Although Goldman recommended to him that gatunensis and azuerensis both be treated as subspecies of couesi, Bole described azuerensis as a species because it did not seem intermediate between the geographically closest forms, gatunensis and couesi, and was separated by a large gap from the nearest known populations of O.couesi in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 review of <b>Panamanian</b> mammals, Charles Handley reduced both gatunensis and azuerensis to subspecies of the marsh rice rat (in which O.couesi was included at the time), and when O.couesi was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it. Specimens from near the type locality of azuerensis differ by about 7% in their Cytb sequences from other O.couesi, which suggests that they may represent a separate species. However, Hanson and colleagues did not reinstate azuerensis as a species, because they could not examine samples of gatunensis.|$|E
5|$|Rather than become president, Noriega {{preferred}} to remain behind the scenes, {{and avoid the}} public scrutiny {{that came with the}} post. He did not have a particular social or economic ideology, and used military nationalism to unify his supporters. The Partido Revolucionario Democrático (Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD), which had been established by Torrijos, was used by Noriega as a political front for the National Guard. Noriega compelled the <b>Panamanian</b> Congress to pass Law 20, which was supposedly aimed at protecting the Panama Canal from communists, and allowed a huge influx of U.S. weapons to the <b>Panamanian</b> military. The law also tripled the size of the military forces, and gave the National Guard control over immigration, customs, commercial transportation, railroads, and airports. Noriega's period in power saw significant capital flight from Panama; according to Kempe, this was at least in part because wealthy individuals worried their wealth would be seized by Noriega's administration.|$|E

5|$|Seen as a restorer of democracy, Endara {{was later}} noted for having defended {{freedom of speech}} and {{democratic}} institutions. He also oversaw a reform of the <b>Panamanian</b> Defense Forces, purging Noriega loyalists, asserting the primacy of the civilian government, and returning the group from military to a national police force. In October 1994, the National Assembly passed an amendment abolishing the military at Endara's urging, becoming the second Latin American country to do so.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{served as}} a collier under the Red Ensign from 29 January 1918 {{until the end of}} the war under the {{management}} of F. C. Strick and Co. She was sold in 1922 to S.N. Vlassopoulos of Greece and was renamed Ithaki. The ship was sold to a Romanian company in 1939 and renamed Moldova; she was then transferred to <b>Panamanian</b> registry in 1942 with the same name. Moldova was sold in 1949 to Wallem & Co. and renamed Jagharat in 1954. She resumed her former name of Moldova in 1955 and arrived at Hong Kong to be scrapped on 8 November 1958.|$|E
5|$|Arias' {{maternal}} {{family was}} from Nicaragua, having left during political upheaval there before his birth. One of Arias' great uncles {{ran for president}} in Panama, while another was {{a supporter of the}} Nicaraguan revolutionary Sandino, a family history that gave Arias an early interest in politics. His father, an engineer, died when Arias was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his mother, aunt, and grandmother. His mother later remarried to a <b>Panamanian</b> ambassador to the United States.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2007, the National Assembly {{declared}} December 20 to be {{an official}} day of mourning for those <b>Panamanians</b> killed during the 1989 invasion by the United States. González supported the action, stating that [...] "All political sectors have wanted to cast a blanket of forgetfulness ... Maybe out of shame or for other reasons, but it isn't fair {{to all of those}} <b>Panamanians</b> that still lie in common graves." ...|$|R
5000|$|President Johnson named Vaughn US Ambassador to Panama in 1964 {{after the}} two nations broke off {{diplomatic}} relations because of nationalistic rioting in Panama. The Senate approved Vaughn's appointment on April 7, 1964. [...] Vaughn arrived in Panama on April 17, 1964 {{to take up the}} post of Ambassador, now vacant for six months. [...] His arrival was welcomed by <b>Panamanians</b> who knew and liked Vaughn from his previous work in Panama with the US AID mission. [...] Vaughn had previously arranged for about 1,000 young <b>Panamanians</b> to go to the United States for post-graduate study. [...] In the airport lounge, ten young <b>Panamanians</b> unfurled a 25 ft long sign greeting Vaughn. [...] "Jack, the scholarship holders remember your work and greet you," [...] the sign read.|$|R

5|$|El Occidente {{was handed}} over to the War Shipping Administration at Galveston on 7 July and {{assigned}} to United States Lines, Inc., for operation. The cargo ship was placed under <b>Panamanian</b> registry by U.S. Lines. Little is known of El Occidentes movements over the six months, but on 30 January 1942, she left Boston for Halifax loaded with a general cargo. Arriving at Halifax on 1 February, she joined Convoy HX 174 and headed for Liverpool on 7 February, arriving at her destination on 21 February.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Endara {{broke with}} the Arnulfista party over {{differences}} of opinion with the party's leader, <b>Panamanian</b> president Mireya Moscoso, and accused the party of corruption. He ran in the 2004 presidential election as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, {{on a platform of}} reducing crime and government corruption. His primary rival was Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Martín Torrijos, son of the former military dictator Omar Torrijos. Martín Torrijos ran on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Ruben Blades. Endara finished second, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos' 47%.|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} Canal Zone Police {{version is}} that the police did not shoot directly at anybody, but only fired over the heads or {{at the feet of}} rioters. The police version was disputed by independent investigators, who found that the police fired directly into the crowds and killed Arosemena {{and a number of other}} <b>Panamanians.</b> DENI ballistics experts claim that six <b>Panamanians</b> were killed by [...]38 caliber Smith & Wesson police revolvers fired by the Canal Zone Police.|$|R
