5|$|Since the {{completion}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in 1977, the government of the state of Alaska has been reliant on taxes paid by oil producers and shippers. Prior to 1976, Alaska's <b>personal</b> <b>income</b> tax rate was 14.5 percent—the highest in the United States. The gross state product was $8billion, and Alaskans earned $5 billion in <b>personal</b> <b>income.</b> Thirty years after the pipeline began operating, the state had no <b>personal</b> <b>income</b> tax, the gross state product was $39billion, and Alaskans earned $25billion in <b>personal</b> <b>income.</b> Alaska moved from the most heavily taxed state to the most tax-free state.|$|E

We find, first, that the labour share remains an important determinant of overall inequality patterns, and, second, that stronger unions and a more generous unemployment benefit tend to reduce income inequality.

40|$|We {{examine what}} determines {{differences}} across countries {{and over time}} {{in the distribution of}} <b>personal</b> <b>incomes</b> in the OECD. We first model the wage determination process and show that unemployment, the labour share, and the wage differential are all functions of labour market institutions. Next we show that in a model economy with only four types of agents - capitalists, skilled and unskilled workers, and unemployed - the Gini coefficient of <b>personal</b> <b>incomes</b> can be expressed {{as a function of the}} above three variables. Labour market institutions hence affect income inequality, though the sign of their impact is ambiguous. Stronger unions and/or a more generous unemployment benefit tend to reduce inequality through reduced wage differentials, a higher labour share, and also higher unemployment. We then use a panel of OECD countries for the period 1970 - 96 to examine these effects. We find, first, that the labour share remains an important aspect of overall inequality patterns, and, second, that stronger unions and a more generous unemployment benefit tend to reduce income inequality.
