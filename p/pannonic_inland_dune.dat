40|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> of {{the young}} moraine area (=area {{formerly}} covered by the Weichselian ice cap) of the former GDR, south of the Pomeranian terminal moraine, have never {{been the subject of}} an overall treatment, that means, a review of existing publications is missing. In this article a review of literature from 1945 onwards is presented, with emphasis on the dating of the <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on this subject. Most authors accept a periglacial genesis of the majority of the <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> ("Altdünen"). During the Holocene a transformation of a part of those Late Glacial continental dunes took place ("Jungdünen mit Altdünenkern"), and also new forms developed ("Jungdünen"). The grain-size distribution, forms and geographical distribution of the <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> in the study area are relatively well described by Seeler (1962), Noack (1965) and others. The <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> were mainly formed by westerly winds. They can reach heights from 15 up to 25 m. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Within Central Europe, therefore, <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> {{exclude the}} belts of coastal dunes on the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts. Unlike their coastal cousins, <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> are aeolian {{formations}} of sand (dunes) transported and then deposited by wind. They were predominantly created under cold climatic, periglacial {{conditions at the}} end of the Weichselian and Würm ice ages, i.e. roughly more than 10,000 years ago.

40|$|Question How does pioneer {{vegetation}} of acid <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> {{respond to}} addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ? Location Two <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> reserves in The Netherlands with {{low and high}} N deposition. Methods During 2. 5 yr, N and P addition (control, N, P, NP) took place in three different vegetation types of <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> (Polytrichum piliferum mats, Campylopus introflexus mats and lichen-dominated vegetation). In each site, changes in the vegetation were recorded in three replicate quadrats of 1 m × 1 m per treatment. Differences in element content of grasses and lichens were recorded, together with vegetation parameters, including cover and height of grasses, bryophytes and lichens. Results In the site with high N deposition, grasses were taller, had higher N:P ratios and a generally lower lichen cover than in the low-deposition area. Experimental N application resulted in higher N and lower base metal concentrations in grasses {{and an increase in}} grass cover and size. In contrast, lichens showed a general decline in the N treatment and the lichen:grass ratio decreased. The effect of N addition was larger in the low-deposition area. The P treatment had an opposite effect: lichens increased in size and cover and overgrew grasses, especially when reindeer lichens were present. This suggests that the cryptogam layer was P-limited even in the low N deposition site. Conclusions Pioneer vegetation in <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> is susceptible to N and P addition. The results provide evidence for a decrease in lichen cover due to increased N deposition...|$|R

40|$|A sedimentological, petrological and geochemical {{research}} work {{was carried out}} in order to fi nd out the origin and provenance of coastal and <b>inland</b> desert <b>dunes</b> from El Vizcaíno Desert, northwestern Mexico. Fifty four sand samples were collected from the windward, crest and slip face of coastal and desert dunes (barchan, transverse, aeolian sand sheets). Onshore winds generates fi ne, well sorted, near symmetrical dune sands with mesokurtic distributions in the El Vizcaíno Desert inherited from beach sands from the Vizcaíno bay. The coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> sands are derived from nearby sand sources like the beach sands and also from alluvial deposits originated from sedimentary-volcanic and schists, granitic and granodiorite sources. This is evidenced by the presence of high quartz content, shell debris, carbonates, mica and hornblende that are constituents of the both coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> sands and are probably derived from the action of longshore drifts and onshore winds. The El Vizcaíno coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> sands are placed in the craton interior and recycled orogen fi elds in the Q-F-L diagram suggesting intrusive, sedimentary and partly metamorphosed sources in the composition of the sand. The geochemistry of the sands supports also the maturity process of the sands mainly associated with the presence of alluvial deposits and marine-aeolian action. Additionally, the El Vizcaíno dune sand...|$|R

30|$|The {{region has}} {{a complex and}} lengthy land-use history, wherein {{extensive}} areas of wetland forests were drained and converted to productive agriculture and plantation forestry. Despite the lower productivity of plantations grown on the <b>inland</b> <b>dunes,</b> {{the fact that this}} ground remains operable by heavy equipment throughout the year makes it a valuable asset to the forest industry during periods of wet weather. As a result, loblolly pine is often the dominant tree species encountered on these sites and within adjacent upland ecotones, where this study took place. Restoration practices, including the re-introduction of fire, reduction of tree stem density, and enrichment planting with site-adapted species, are being implemented to enhance the biodiversity and habitat values of degraded <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> and affiliated uplands across the property.|$|R
40|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>dune</b> fields have {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} source of data for reconstructing paleoenvironments and climate in the western Great Lakes region of North America during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. We employ optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) methods, radiocarbon ages, soils, and landform relationships to determine the age of <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> in Ottawa County, Michigan. These dunes rest on the abandoned bed of Glacial Lake Chicago, which is thought to have been exposed after ~ 13. 6 ka. OSL analyses from two <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> yield ages ranging from 13. 3 ± 1. 1 to 11. 6 ± 0. 9 ka (uncertainty = 2 σ). Fine sand in the parabolic dunes suggests deflation of exposed glaciolacustrine nearshore sand by northwesterly and westerly winds. These new data add to a growing number of studies that demonstrate widespread eolian activity in the western Great Lakes region during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. OSL ages from dune fields in the western Great Lakes indicate peak eolian activity and dune stabilization occurred during or following the Younger Dryas and Preboreal events. Northwesterly and westerly winds suggest the limited effect of hypothesized easterly anticyclonic winds during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Rapidly changing climate and newly deglaciated surfaces provided an ideal environment for dune formation...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: Acidification; Ammophila arenaria; Campylopus introflexus; Carex arenaria; Cladonia; Invasive species; Management; Nitrogen deposition; Species diversity; Spergulo-Corynephoretum; Succession; Violo-Corynephoretum; wildfire. The {{objective}} of this thesis was to describe long-term changes in the lichen-rich dry grassland communities in calcium-poor coastal dunes (on Terschelling) and <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> (of the Kootwijkerzand) in the Netherlands. Some {{of the changes that}} have occurred since the 1970 s are due to natural succession. Others are caused by human-induced eutrophication and acidification through increased aerial inputs of nitrogen (mainly ammonia) since the 1970 s. These effects of grass and moss encroachment on lichens were studied by comparing vegetation relevés from before the 1970 s with the relevés made from 1990 onwards. In the calcium-poor coastal dunes, new succession stages have occurred in the Violo-Corynephoretum (V. -C.) where the short grass Corynephorus canescens has been replaced by tall graminoids like Ammophila arenara and Carex arenaria. In the Spergulo-Corynephoretum (S. -C.) of the non-calcareous <b>dunes</b> <b>inland,</b> it was found that   Corynephorus canescens was more vital, while Festuca ovina s. l. and Agrostis vinealis had increased. In addition, the moss Campylopus introflexus, an alien species from the southern hemisphere and adapted to acid open sand, invaded the dunes in both areas, outgrowing not only   the rare lichens from the pioneer stages but also the more common pioneer species of decalcified sand. However, where this moss is less vital as a result of desiccation or being blown over by sand, common humicolous lichens and some pioneer species may act as secondary pioneers on these withered moss carpets. Another topic covered in this thesis is evaluation of small- and large-scale management measures aiming at restoring the former sand dune landscape with its high biodiversity. Small-scale management included cutting self-sown trees, and removing the canopy has positively influenced lichen-diversity in the <b>inland</b> <b>dunes.</b> The effect of a wildfire as possible management tool in both coastal and <b>inland</b> sand <b>dune</b> vegetation was not effectfull and grass- and moss-encraochment took over. Large-scale EGM restoration management (Effect-oriented measures against acidification and eutrophication) in both the nutrient-poor coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> in the early 1990 s is evaluated using the data presented in this thesis and the recent end-evaluation of several long-term monitoring programmes. Recommendations for future restoration management to maintain or regain biodiversity in coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dunes</b> are given. Additional measures to destroy the algal crust and the other vegetation by means of tillage techniques in a scheduled maintenance traject are recommended when large scale EGM restoration is applied. This seems necessary given that the current high N emission still exceeds the critical deposition values for the coastal V. -C. and the inland S. -C. A further reduction of N emission from livestock farming should be pursued, so that the remaining biodiversity in the coastal and <b>inland</b> sand <b>dune</b> ecotope could be a source for more dispersion. This is essential not only for the lichen diversity, but also for all existing flora and fauna elements...|$|R

We highlight numerous flaws in the comments and interpretations of Baeteman and Mauz (2012) that demonstrate failure to take into account recent findings on the main sediment-transport mechanisms and morpho-sedimentary outcomes characterising the shallow, sediment-rich, mixed storm- and tide-dominated macrotidal shoreface of the southern North Sea, compounded by an inadequate understanding of morphodynamic processes and sediment-supply conditions involved in coastal progradatio...|$|R
