This paper examines the incentives created by the U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax</b> system for the legal avoidance of taxes on foreign source income. Using data from 1986 corporate tax returns, we investigate the extent to which U.

In contrast to previous work in this area, our estimates of the tax consequences of income remittances from foreign subsidiaries to parent corporations explicitly take into account the ability to use foreign tax credits generated from one source of foreign income to offset the U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax</b> liability generated by other sources of foreign income, withholding tax rates on income remittances, variations in source country corporate income tax systems, and dynamic aspects of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax</b> system.

Most Latin American countries tax only income originating within their boundaries. If other countries tax income of foreigners originating within their boundaries as heavily, there is no tax advantage to capital flight. Latin American countries thus depend on other countries for the prevention of tax-induced capital flight and the loss of public revenues, investment funds, and equity it implies. Income from a U.
