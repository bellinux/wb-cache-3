40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether damage after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest can be diminished by changing <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> components when reinstituting cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Fifteen piglets (2 - 3 months old) were cooled to 19 °C by using the alpha-stat pH strategy. Five were cooled and rewarmed without ischemia (control animals), and the other 10 piglets underwent 90 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Of these, 5 were rewarmed and reperfused without altering the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit blood prime. In the other 5 animals, the bypass blood prime was modified (leukocyte depleted, hypocalcemic, hypermagnesemic, pH-stat, normoxic, mannitol, and an Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor) during circulatory arrest before starting warm reperfusion. Oxidant injury was assessed {{on the basis of}} conjugated dienes, vascular changes on the basis of endothelin levels, myocardial function on the basis of cardiac output and dopamine need, lung injury on the basis of pulmonary vascular resistance and oxygenation, and cellular damage on the basis of release of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase. Neurologic assessment (score 0, normal; score 500, brain death) was done 6 hours after discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Compared with animals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass without ischemia (control animals), deep hypothermic circulatory arrest without modification of the reperfusate produced an oxidant injury (conjugated dienes increased 0. 78 vs 1. 71 absorbance (Abs) 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs control animals), depressed cardiac output (6. 0 vs 4. 0 L/min, P <. 05 vs control subjects), prolonged dopamine need (P <. 001 vs control subjects), elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (74 % vs 197 %, P <. 05 vs control subjects), reduced oxygenation (P <. 01 vs control subjects), increased neurologic injury (56 vs 244, P <. 001 vs control subjects), and increased release of creatine kinase (2695 vs 6974 U/L, P <. 05 vs control subjects), aspartate aminotransferase (144 vs 229 U/L), and endothelin (1. 02 vs 2. 56 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs control subjects). Conversely, the oxidant injury was markedly limited (conjugated dienes of 0. 85 ± 0. 09 Abs 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> with modification of cardiopulmonary bypass prime, resulting in increased cardiac output (5. 1 ± 0. 8 L/min), minimal dopamine need (P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> no increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (44 % ± 31 %, P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> or endothelin levels (0. 64 ± 0. 15 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> complete recovery of oxygenation (P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> reduced neurologic damage (144 ± 33, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> and lower release of aspartate aminotransferase (124 ± 23 U/L, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> and creatine kinase (3366 ± 918, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime).</b> Conclusions: A global reperfusion injury after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was identified and changed. The injury is mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals, resulting in organ and endothelial dysfunction. Modification of global organ and endothelial damage is achieved by modifying the blood prime in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to deliver a controlled global reperfusate when reinstituting bypass.

30|$|Although {{commonly}} used in pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) optimal dose and timing of steroid administration is unclear.

30|$|The use of {{corticosteroids}} as a {{means of}} diminishing the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has become a standard of practice in many institutions (Jonas 2004).

In a survey of 36 international centres 97 % of respondents used steroids in some cases and of these 83 % used a single dose (Checcia et al. 2005).

50|$|The first {{safe and}} {{successful}} {{steam power plant}} was introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide-ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged {{to come to an}} arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent. Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into {{the lower half of the}} cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity-induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the <b>pump,</b> <b>priming</b> it and preparing the pumping stroke.

The {{aim of this study}} was to find whether muscle compartment pressure was affected by the addition of albumin and mannitol to the <b>pump</b> <b>prime,</b> heparin coating or leukocyte depletion. Additionally, we studied the relationship between intraocular pressure and lower leg muscle compartment pressure. Edema during and following cardiac surgery is due to hemodynamic, osmotic and inflammatory changes, according to Starling's Law. We attempted to influence the osmotic balance and reduce the inflammatory response in order to reduce the edema. METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent cardiac surgery were randomly allocated into four groups. Group A received albumin and mannitol into the <b>pump</b> <b>prime.</b> Group B had an, heparin-coated perfusion system, Group C had a leukocyte-depletion arterial line filter and Group D was the control group, where intraocular pressure was also measured. RESULTS: Lower leg muscle compartment pressure increased significantly during and after cardiac surgery in all groups, but this increase was significantly less in Group A than in the control group 24 h after surgery. No correlation was found between muscular compartment pressure and intraocular pressure. The intraocular pressure profile is different from the muscular compartment pressure and recovers much faster. CONCLUSION: Lower leg muscle compartment pressure and intraocular pressure behave differently during and after cardiac surgery.
