50|$|Newer {{processors}} {{contain a}} dedicated stack engine to optimize stack operations. Pentium M {{was the first}} x86 processor to introduce a stack engine. In its implementation, the stack pointer is split among two registers: ESPO, which is a 32-bit register, and ESPd, an 8-bit delta value that is updated directly by stack operations. <b>PUSH,</b> <b>POP,</b> CALL and RET opcodes operate directly with the ESPd register. If ESPd is near overflow or the ESP register is referenced from other instructions (when ESPd ≠ 0), a synchronisation micro-op is inserted that updates the ESPO using the ALU and resets ESPd to 0. This design has remained largely unmodified in later Intel processors, although ESPO has been expanded to 64 bits.|$|E

After a brief showcase at SXSW in 2015, on 8 May 2015, PC Music launched a [...] "multimedia reality network" [...] called 'Pop Cube'.

In May 2016, PC Music presented 'Pop Cosmos' at the Scala in London, featuring Danny L Harle, Hannah Diamond, GFOTY, A. G. Cook, felicita, easyFun and Spinee. In July 2016 PC Music held a new one-off event called 'Pop City' at Create in Los Angeles. As well as scheduled performances from PC Music performers, the show featured guests, including Carly Rae Jespen, Charli XCX, and QT. On the 405 webzine, PC Music’s live shows have been described as being surrounded by a care-less authentic aura and have been recognised for their ″forward-thinking fearlessness to <b>push</b> <b>pop</b> music into new and daring areas″.|$|E

50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to be <b>pushed</b> and <b>popped</b> onto the embedded stack, the <b>pushing</b> and <b>popping</b> of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack is <b>pushed</b> and <b>popped,</b> the current stack is optionally pushed back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like are pushed on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can be pushed both {{above and below the}} current stack.|$|R

5000|$|Cleanup Stack is {{a concept}} widely used in Symbian OS. It is most {{suitable}} to use in places where dynamic memory is used (allocated) in programming. The problem with dynamic memory is the sole discretion of the underlying OS whether the request for memory allocation shall succeed or not. Applications (Requester of memory) {{must be prepared to}} handle the rejection. In large programs dynamic memory is used almost everywhere. If an application frequently adds the code to handle this failure then it will increase the code size significantly. Symbian is used mostly on phones where this increase in the code size will further amplify the memory allocation failures. Symbian features an ingenious solution to that problem. When an application notes a memory allocation may fail, it places the earlier allocated memory address to a location which Symbian is aware of. That location is called Cleanup Stack. In the event of failure, Symbian knows that whatever resource is placed on the Cleanup Stack needs be freed. This way all the resources are freed when a program crashes (or Leaves). This freeing is performed automatically by the Symbian OS. Applications die peacefully without worrying who would clean up the mess left after them.Cleanup stack make an idea to keep a copy of pointer to allocated memory and all elements from the cleanup stack are popped out and destroyed by using <b>Push</b> (...) , <b>Pop</b> (...) , and PopAndDestroy (...)

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} data {{structure}} to implement deques with heap order {{that supports the}} operations find minimum, <b>push,</b> <b>pop,</b> inject, eject and concatenate two deques, each in O(1) time. 1 Introduction A deque with heap order is a deque (double-ended queue) such that each item has a real-valued key and the operation of finding an item of minimum key is allowed {{as well as the}} usual deque operations. Queues with heap order have applications in paging and river routing [3] [4] [2]. Gajeuska and Tarjan [3] have described a data structure that supports in O(1) worst case time the usual deque operations <b>push,</b> <b>pop,</b> inject, eject and the find minimum operation. They also mentioned that Kosaraju's methods [5] extend to support O(1) time concatenation of deques when the number of deques is fixed. However, for the case of a variable number of deques, they left the same as an open problem. In [1], Buchsbaum, Rajamani and Tarjan partially answered this question by describing a data structure that supports all the operations mentioned above in O(1) amortized time using the technique of bootstrapping and path compression...|$|E

Bad Bitches was covered in Paper and Posture Magazine.|$|R
50|$|Machine {{transitions}} {{are based}} on the current state and input symbol, and also the current topmost symbol of the stack. Symbols lower in the stack are not visible and have no immediate effect. Machine actions include <b>pushing,</b> <b>popping,</b> or replacing the stack top. A deterministic pushdown automaton has at most one legal transition for the same combination of input symbol, state, and top stack symbol. This is where it differs from the nondeterministic pushdown automaton.|$|R
