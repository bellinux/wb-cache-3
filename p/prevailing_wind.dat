5|$|Wind roses are tools used to {{determine}} the direction of the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind.</b> Knowledge of the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> allows the development of prevention strategies for wind erosion of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> regime within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind,</b> while birds are able to fly more independently of it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon is a {{seasonal}} <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> which lasts for several months, ushering in a region's rainy season. Regions within North America, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and East Asia are monsoon regimes.|$|E

5|$|Like {{much of the}} British Isles, Coatbridge {{experiences}} a temperate maritime climate with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> is from the west. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The city {{receives}} {{an average of}} 1064mm of rainfall annually, 68% of which falls during the northeast monsoon. Most of the precipitation occurs {{in the form of}} cyclonic storms caused by depressions in the Bay of Bengal during the northeast monsoon. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> direction is south-westerly in the morning and south-easterly in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind.</b> Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E

5|$|A monsoon is a {{seasonal}} <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> that lasts {{for several months}} within tropical regions. The term was first used in English in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and neighboring countries {{to refer to the}} big seasonal winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off a heat low over the Asian, African, and North American continents during May through July, and over Australia in December.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and {{a large proportion of the}} annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900mm (31–35in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest; the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> direction is from the south-west.|$|E
5|$|The sunniest {{time of year}} {{tends to}} be between May and August. The {{south-western}} coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually. Wales' sunniest town is Tenby, Pembrokeshire. The dullest time of year tends to be between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually.|$|E

5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind,</b> survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) that borders a humid subtropical climate or a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> patterns that blow offshore minimize {{the influence of the}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations {{that would have to}} be made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E

5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} types of monsoons in the state. The {{southwest}} monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> flow is generally southwesterly and light, below 15 knots. The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March. During this season, steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots prevail. The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 knots or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north (cold surges). The annual rainfall of this area is 2,911 millimetres. During the northeast monsoon season, Kuala Terengganu, being exposed to the coast, receives heavy rainfall. It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough. However, in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season, surprisingly east coast is always presented with clear blue sky and cooling wind.|$|E
5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
