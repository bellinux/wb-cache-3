5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note {{of the work}} in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E
5|$|The Quatermass Memoirs is a British radio drama-documentary, {{originally}} {{broadcast in}} 5 episodes on BBC Radio 3 in March 1996. Written by Nigel Kneale, {{it was born}} out of his Quatermass series of films and television serials, which had first been broadcast in the 1950s. The idea for the show appeared as BBC radio intended to create a season of programming looking back at the 1950s, and it was the final <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> Kneale completed relating to the character.|$|E

25|$|Eiseley {{published}} {{works in}} a number of different genres including poetry, autobiography, history of science, biography, and nonfictional essays. In each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> he consistently used a poetic writing style. Eiseley's style mirrors what he called the concealed essay—a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> that unites the personal dimension with more scientific thoughts. His writing was unique in that it could convey complex ideas about human origin and the relationship between humans and the natural world to a nonscientific audience. Robert G. Franke describes Eiseley’s essays as theatrical and dramatic. He also notes the influence his father’s hobby as an amateur Shakespearean actor may have had on Eiseley’s writing, pointing out that his essays often contain dramatic elements that are usually present in plays.|$|E
25|$|Many {{felt that}} Private Parts was popular playwright Michael Chiang’s best play to date; definitely, {{it was his}} most politicised.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Goncharov wrote an unusual memoir called An Uncommon Story, in which he accused his {{literary}} rivals, first and foremost Ivan Turgenev, of having plagiarized his works and prevented him from achieving European fame. Some critics claimed that the book was the product of an unstable mind, while others praised it as an eye-opening, if controversial <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> It wasn't published until 1924.|$|E

25|$|Pei Songzhi cast doubts on the Shiyu account. He {{felt that}} it was {{unlikely}} that Yu Song had to recommend Zhong Hui to Sima Shi, because Sima would most probably have already at least heard of Zhong due to the following reasons. First, Zhong Hui came from an elite family background. Second, he was already famous when he was still a youth. Third, he started serving in the Wei government as soon as he reached the age of adulthood. Pei also believed that it was impossible for anyone to be able to tell, simply by reading a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> that a person who edited a few words in it is capable of shouldering greater responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|Western Zhou dynasty {{characters}} (as {{exemplified by}} bronze inscriptions of that time) basically continue from the Shang writing system; that is, early W. Zhou forms resemble Shang bronze forms (both such as clan names, and typical writing), without any clear or sudden distinction. They are, like their Shang predecessors in all media, often irregular {{in shape and}} size, and the structures and details often vary from one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> to the next, and even within the same piece. Although most are not pictographs in function, the early Western Zhou bronze inscriptions {{have been described as}} more pictographic in flavor than those of subsequent periods. During the Western Zhou, many graphs begin to show signs of simplification and linearization (the changing of rounded elements into squared ones, solid elements into short line segments, and thick, variable-width lines into thin ones of uniform width), with the result being a decrease in pictographic quality, as depicted in the chart below.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Hoffman {{was given}} his first leading role (despite joking {{at the time}} [...] "Even if I was hired into a leading-man part, I'd {{probably}} turn it into the non-leading-man part") in Todd Louiso's tragicomedy Love Liza (2002). His brother Gordy wrote the script, which Hoffman had seen at their mother's house five years earlier, about a widower who starts sniffing gasoline to cope with his wife's suicide. He considered it the finest <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> he had ever read, [...] "incredibly humble in its exploration of grief", but critics were less enthusiastic about the production. A review for the BBC wrote that Hoffman had finally been given a part that showed [...] "what he's truly capable of", but few witnessed this as the film had a limited release and earned only US$210,000.|$|E
500|$|A {{highlight}} {{derived from}} Ephron's book {{and that was}} consistently praised was the O'Donnell portrayal {{of the role of}} the purse in the scene [...] "I Hate My Purse!". While Reiner says, [...] "There's an amusing 'I hate my purse' segment", Isherwood notes [...] "The smartest and shapeliest <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in the show is that acerbic essay by Nora Ephron about her troublesome relationship with purses...Entrusted to Ms. O'Donnell, who does it proud, the essay is a defiant denunciation of the tyranny of the pocketbook, a 'j'accuse' for the era of the 'it' bag." [...] Shaw described O'Donnell's purse performance as an aria, and Jerry Tallmer of The Villager called it [...] "one of the pillars of the show". This scene is sometimes performed alone outside of the theatre.|$|E
500|$|Blyton's first book, Child Whispers, a 24-page {{collection}} of poems, {{was published in}} 1922. It was illustrated by a schoolfriend, Phyllis Chase, who collaborated on several of her early works. Also in that year Blyton began writing in annuals for Cassell and George Newnes, and her first <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> [...] "Peronel and his Pot of Glue", was accepted for publication in Teachers' World. Her success was boosted in 1923 when her poems were published alongside those of Rudyard Kipling, Walter de la Mare and G. K. Chesterton in a special issue of Teachers' World. Blyton's educational texts were quite influential in the 1920s and '30s, her most sizeable being the three-volume The Teacher's Treasury (1926), the six-volume Modern Teaching (1928), the ten-volume Pictorial Knowledge (1930), and the four-volume Modern Teaching in the Infant School (1932).|$|E

500|$|The {{scenes with}} Puck and Beiste were much praised, {{as were the}} actors. While reviewers such as Bell and VanDerWerff criticized the {{domestic}} abuse storyline, both were far happier with {{the way it was}} ended than with how it had been introduced in [...] "Choke"—VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "the fact that both Puck and Beiste's storylines resolve {{at the same time in}} the same scene is a nice <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> with some strong acting". Votta called the pair's scenes [...] "delightful" [...] and thought they merited a [...] "road trip adventure spin-off"; Bell said that she [...] "could have seriously watched an hour dedicated to Beiste and Puck". Slezak highlighted [...] "terrific work" [...] by Jones and Salling, and the scenes with [...] "Beiste holding a sobbing Puck" [...] and confronting Cooter as [...] "pretty remarkable". Strecker called the latter scene [...] "painful to watch, in the best possible way", and Bell described Salling's performance in the former as [...] "truly incredible".|$|E
500|$|Krazy Kat {{gained an}} appreciative {{audience}} {{in the world of}} the arts. [...] The character debuted in film in 1916. [...] The first animated films starring a cat were produced by Hearst's International Film Service, though without Herriman's direct involvement. [...] In 1922, Adolph Bolm choreographed a jazz-pantomime Krazy Kat ballet written by John Alden Carpenter. It was first performed in New York in 1922 by Ballet Intime, and Herriman illustrated the libretto and designed the costumes and scenario. [...] While it was not a great success, the critics Deems Taylor, Stark Young and Henrietta Straus wrote favorably about it. [...] The strip itself was the subject of an article by literary critic Gilbert Seldes called [...] "Golla, Golla the Comic Strip's Art", which appeared in the May 1922 issue of Vanity Fair. [...] Seldes expanded this article as part of his book on the popular arts, The Seven Lively Arts (1924), in which Seldes argued against conservative tendencies that excluded artists in the popular arts, such as Herriman and Chaplin, from being considered alongside traditional artists. [...] Krazy Kat was the subject of a chapter entitled [...] "The Krazy Kat That Walks by Himself", which is the most famous <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> about the strip and the earliest example of a critic from the world of high art giving legitimacy to the comic strip medium. [...] Vanity Fair inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in the April 1923 issue.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "the main failure of Guest's {{otherwise}} excellent {{book is the}} absence of character: even his mother comes across rather as a history than a personality." [...] "My Life in Orange, though slightly patchwork in its construction, is an absorbing <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> all the more compelling for begging as many questions as it answers and for the author's refusal to ask for pity," [...] wrote Geraldine Bedell in a review of the book in The Observer. Director of the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, Christopher Cook, characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "the most extraordinary account of his [...] childhood and the bravest writing I've read in ages". Sudipta Datta of the Indian Express described the book as [...] "a postcard from the past that the Osho ashram may not rave about." [...] Datta noted though that after having been angry with his mother and Rajneesh, Guest had reconciled with his family, reclaimed his childhood and come to see Rajneesh as [...] "a loveable rogue who got away with doing his own thing". Catherine A. Powers of The Boston Globe characterized the book as a [...] "moving, superbly written account of growing up in the midst of ... cruel madness". Michael E. Young of The Dallas Morning News gave the book a favorable review, and wrote: [...] "The book offers a glimpse into the thoughts of the followers, and examines the fine line between spirituality and insanity, between religion and cult." [...] Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times characterized the book as [...] "an intriguing and often humorous mix of straightforward 1980s nostalgia and cult delusion".|$|E
