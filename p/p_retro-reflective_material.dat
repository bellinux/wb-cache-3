RysDuring {{the last}} several decades, the number of drivers {{and the number of}} senior {{citizens}} driving on U. S highways has increased significantly along with the number of traffic signs. The median age of the drivers has also increased due to the aging population. Traffic signs provide a plethora of necessary information - directions, guidance, warnings, regulations, and recreation. With today's congestion and higher speed, it's very important to recognize the need for brighter and easier to read signs to increase safety among drivers. In the recent years, there has been innovation in the field of traffic engineering, giving rise to numerous innovations in <b>retro-reflective</b> sheeting <b>materials</b> and fonts. It is important to identify the combination of font and <b>retro-reflective</b> sheeting <b>material,</b> which performs best by increasing the legibility distance between the driver and the sign during both day and night time conditions. The objective of the research was to determine the combination of font (among Clearview 5 -W, Series E-Modified and Clearview 5 -W-R) and <b>retro-reflective</b> sheeting <b>materials</b> (DG 3, Type 4 and Type 1) that produces maximum legibility distance. The objective was also to study the safety benefits of the Clearview font. Both field and computer based tests were carried out to find out which combination of font and <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>material</b> produced maximum legibility distance. From field tests {{it was found that the}} Clearview 5 -W-R font along with Type 1 reflective material produced the maximum legibility distance in day time conditions, whereas Clearview 5 -W-R along with Type 4 reflective material produced the maximum legibility distance at night conditions. It was also seen that while the Type 1 sheeting material performed well during day time, it failed to produce good results during night time. In fact it ended up as the worst performing sheeting material during night time. Based on these observations, it is recommended to use the Clearview 5 -W-R in combination with Type 4 retro-reflective sheeting as it showed the most consistent performance compared to all other combinations of fonts and DG 3 or Type 1 <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{targets are}} {{generally}} used in terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) practice for data georeferencing. This {{is because they}} are well recognized and modelled from the point cloud and their positions can be contemporarily measured by topographical techniques. The accuracy of target identification directly influences the georeferencing quality. In particular, <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>materials</b> can cause anomalies in range measurement due to the too high amplitude of the returned pulse. If the received pulse intensity exceeds the limits of the sensor dynamic range, the receiver saturates, producing a truncated pulse preventing the correct time-of-flight computation. A series of experiments was performed in order to test the performances of a specific instrument (Optech ILRIS 3 D) for the acquisition of artificial targets made of <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>material,</b> resulting in very high reflectance. Dealing with ranges lower than about 300 m, two cases were clearly observed: the wrong distance measurement of points over high reflecting surfaces and the presence of haloes around these surfaces. Neglecting these phenomena has serious implications and can lead to wrong georeferencing. Experiments were executed and data was analysed, providing a qualitative and semi-quantitative phenomenon description. Finally, the design of a target that can be easily recognized and correctly modelled was proposed...|$|R

(GSI), in conjunction with VisionTech, Inc. and Gancell Pty. Ltd., was requested to perform this task at the Yonggwangg Nuclear Power Plant in South Korea by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd. (KHNP). The environment of the reactor core, submerged and radioactive, poses a number of difficulties to the photogrammetrist. For protection in the underwater setting, a watertight canister with a quartz window was designed to house the camera. The multiple mediums of water, quartz, and air through which light must travel in its path to the camera add complexity to the traditional collinearity model of photogrammetric reconstruction. Artificial targets of either white or <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>material,</b> commonly used to signalize points of interest in industrial photogrammetry, cannot {{be placed on the}} fuel assemblies. Therefore, the detection and measurement of the natural features of the assembly itself becomes necessary. In turn, scene illumination, image exposure, and camera movement are important considerations. In the following, requirements of the measurement are outlined, along with brief descriptions of the design of the reactor core, fuel assemblies, and the underwater canister created for this application. The detection and measurement of the fuel assemblies are explained, followed by details and results of an actual measurement.

40|$|In {{creative}} collaboration, {{the primary}} focus of participants is creating “what if ” scenarios that must be jointly imagined. Collaboration in strictly Physical Reality (PR) is constrained because of the limitations the real world places on shared imagination. As dynamic as Virtual Reality (VR) environments can be, subtle human-to-human interaction is severely limited in these totally synthetic environments, which provide such poor support for the physical expression of passion and personality. Augmented Reality (AR) can add virtual assets to the physical world, yet creative interaction cries out to escape the context of the physical world. With interpersonal imaginative interaction, Augmented Virtuality (AV), the augmentation of a virtual setting with real objects, provides a means to merge a richly layered, multi-modal, 3 D real experience into a virtual environment.

40|$|Videogrammetry is a 3 -dimensional {{co-ordinate}} {{measuring technique}} that (now) uses digital image capture as the recording method. Images {{are taken from}} at least two different locations and the light-rays from the camera to the measurement object are intersected by triangulation into 3 D point coordinates. With {{a large number of}} images, the camera orientation and 3 D point locations are accurately determined {{with the use of a}} full mathematical model (bundle adjustment). Adhesive targets are commonly used for point materialization. Those targets consist of a <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>material,</b> with an adhesive backing for sticking to the structure under investigation. A drawback of these types of targets is that they can lose their adhesion and shape during thermal vacuum cycling, especially when cryogenic temperatures are involved. In addition the operation of placing and removing targets is a critical procedure that can lead to undesirable contamination and damage to the test item. Because they require to be physically attached to the surface to be measured, this can also compromise the quality assurance of the test object. Such problems were encountered during cryogenic thermal vacuum qualification testing of the ESA Planck Surveyor mission telescope reflectors. In the development described here the aim was to replace the use of adhesive targets by projected dots. The idea is not fundamentally new. Indeed a US company, Geodetic Systems Inc. (GSI) [1] proposes already a commercial target projector for videogrammetry which uses a flashlamp and is adequate for workshop and laboratory applications. Dot projection videogrammetry is also suggested as a shape measurement method of Gossamer structures, membrane reflectors, etc [...] . [2][3]. Note that there are fundamental differences in use and applications of retro-reflective targets and dot projection: • Retro-reflective targets are materialized on the test article. They appear as fiducials attached to the test article. Any relative distortion of the materialized point can be tracked with respect to the test article itself. • Projected dots are not materialized on the object. Practically a specific point cannot be tracked by this method. The dense cloud of projected dots allows sampling the surface or the shape in an arbitrary way. The Target Projector System (TPS), described here (Fig. 1), was designed and manufactured to operate in the Large Space Simulator (LSS) of ESAof ESA under thermal vacuum conditions and to have a minimized temperature exchange with its environment. It is operational over a temperature range of 90 K to 350 K, and has a wavelength of 808 nm. Qualification tests and results under vacuum, along with an assessment of the videogrammetric accuracy achievable for various configurations of this unique device are presented...|$|R

CARVE, a proprietary pavement marking visibility model, is currently being used to determine the minimum retro-reflectance requirements for pavement markings. Generally, such computer based visibility models determine the visibility of pavement markings by comparing the available luminance contrast formed between the pavement marking and the immediate surrounding road surface with a human threshold contrast value. However, {{in order to be able}} to calculate the luminance contrast between a pavement marking and the road surface, a pavement marking visibility model needs matrices of retro-reflectance as a function of the entrance angle and the observation angle, both for the pavement and the pavement markings.

40|$|Long lasting {{insecticide}} treated bed nets (LLINs) {{are a key}} tool in malaria {{control in}} sub-Saharan Africa, and their widespread distribution has contributed significantly to recent reductions in malaria prevalence. Sustaining this impact will require thorough understanding of anopheline host seeking behaviour and LLIN mode of action. However, the behaviour of anopheline mosquitoes during interactions with LLINs, and how insecticides affect that behaviour, is poorly investigated. To pursue this, novel video systems, scaled to record and track nocturnally active free-flying mosquitoes {{at different levels of}} detail, were developed and evaluated in a series of behavioural studies, primarily with insecticide susceptible Anopheles gambiae s. s [...] The spatial repellent properties of deltamethrin and DDT were investigated using two small-scale cage assays that presented mosquitoes with a human thumb bait and LLIN with (larger choice test) or without (smaller single test) an untreated control alternative. Results from single tests indicated repellency (in deltamethrin only) but the larger choice tests, (and subsequent large-scale tracking), did not. The results highlighted the limitations of such assays, and the caution required when otherwise convenient laboratory behavioural assays are used. The flight behaviour of host-seeking mosquitoes as they navigated through an open window was investigated in a laboratory environment using a novel 3 D tracking system. The study proved the principle of this 3 D tracking concept, which uses a <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>material</b> to identify a mosquito’s position during flight using a single camera. Analyses of tracks showed that mosquitoes approached windows from higher flight elevations, consistently descending to low levels following passage from the window into the room. Large scale tracking experiments used Fresnel lenses to illuminate a large field of view, and record activity of free flying An. gambiae s. s. at a human-baited bed net. These laboratory tests characterised mosquito flight into four behavioural modes, showing that insecticide treatment rapidly reduced mosquito activity around the net, and provoked a shift in flight behaviour resulting in less net contact. Highest levels of net contact were centred on the net roof above the volunteer’s torso. Insecticide treatment reduced the time a mosquito spent in contact with the net, and an individual mosquito was estimated to accumulate less than 100 seconds of direct physical contact with the LLIN during a 60 -minute test. Velocity measurements showed that mosquitoes detected nets, including unbaited untreated nets, prior to contact. The large scale tracking system was transported to, and operated successfully at an experimental hut in Tanzania, to investigate the behaviour of a wild mosquito population consisting predominantly of An. arabiensis. Experimental outcomes were similar in both settings, though field tests did not show such pronounced activity decay as was observed in laboratory tests. The large-scale system was used to explore the host seeking flight behaviour of An. gambiae s. s. {{in the absence of a}} bed net. Flight activity at a supine human host was separated into approaching or departing tracks. Flight elevation and speed were similar in both, but tortuosity was higher in tracks approaching the host. Mosquitoes showed no preferences for feeding on any part of the host’s body and bites were distributed evenly across the volunteer’s exposed skin. This study delivers the most complete characterisations of mosquito-LLIN interactions to date. The tracking systems provide a new platform for a range of further studies and the findings contribute to evidence base required for vector control tool design, research on basic host seeking behaviour and the behavioural mechanisms of insecticide resistance...|$|R
