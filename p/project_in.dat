40|$|Abstract—Software {{projects}} have crossed seas and continents looking for talented developers, moving from local developments to geographically distributed projects. This paper presents {{a case study}} analyzing the effect of distribution and time zones on communication <b>in</b> distributed <b>projects.</b> The study was performed in a university course during two semesters, where students developed projects jointly with teams located in ten different countries in South America, Europe, and Asia. The study compares {{the results of the}} <b>projects</b> distributed <b>in</b> two locations with <b>projects</b> distributed <b>in</b> three locations. It also analyzes <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> different time zone ranges. The initial results show that the amount of communication <b>in</b> <b>projects</b> distributed <b>in</b> two locations is bigger than the communication <b>in</b> <b>projects</b> distributed <b>in</b> three locations. We also found that <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> closer time zones have more communication than <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> farther time zones. Furthermore, we analyze the reply time for e-mails of <b>projects</b> distributed <b>in</b> different time zones, and discuss the challenges faced by the students during these projects.
