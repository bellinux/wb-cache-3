6000|$|The {{people of}} Waigiou are not truly indigenes of the island, which {{possesses}} no [...] "Alfuros," [...] or aboriginal inhabitants. They {{appear to be}} a mixed race, partly from Gilolo, partly from New Guinea. Malays and Alfuros from the former island have probably settled here, and many of them have taken Papuan wives from Salwatty or Dorey, while the influx of people from those places, and of slaves, has {{led to the formation of}} a tribe exhibiting almost all the transitions from a nearly pure Malayan to an entirely Papuan type. The language spoken by them is entirely Papuan, being that which is used on all the coasts of Mysol, Salwatty, the north-west of New Guinea, and the islands in the great Geelvink Bay,--a fact which indicates the way in which the coast settlements have been formed. The fact that so many of the islands between New Guinea and the Moluccas--such as Waigiou, Guebe, Poppa, Obi, Batchian, as well as the south and east peninsulas of Gilolo--possess no aboriginal tribes, but are inhabited by people who are evidently mongrels and wanderers, is a remarkable corroborative proof of the distinctness of the Malayan and Papuan races, and the separation of the geographical areas they inhabit. If these two great races were direct modifications, the one of the other, we should expect to find in the intervening region some homogeneous indigenous race presenting intermediate characters. For example, between the whitest inhabitants of Europe and the black Klings of South India, there are in the intervening districts homogeneous races which form a gradual transition from one to the other; while in America, although there is a <b>perfect</b> <b>transition</b> from the Anglo-Saxon to the negro, and from the Spaniard to the Indian, there is no homogeneous race forming a natural transition from one to the other. In the Malay Archipelago we have an excellent example of two absolutely distinct races, which appear to have approached each other, and intermingled in an unoccupied territory at a very recent epoch in the history of man; and I feel satisfied that no unprejudiced person could study them on the spot without being convinced that this is the true solution of the problem, rather than the almost universally accepted view that they are but modifications of one and the same race.|$|E

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} cold atom {{experiments}} in optical lattices, we consider a lattice {{version of the}} Landau-Zener problem. Every single site is described by a Landau-Zener problem, but due to particle tunnelling between neighboring lattice sites this onsite single particle Landau-Zener dynamics couples to the particle motion within the lattice. The lattice, apart from having a dephasing effect on single site Landau-Zener transitions, also implies, {{in the presence of}} a confining trap, an inter-site particle flow induced by the Landau-Zener sweeping. This gives rise to an interplay between intra- and inter-site dynamics. The adiabaticity constrain is therefor not simply given by the standard one; the Hamiltonian rate of change relative to the gap of the onsite problem. In experimentally realistic situations, the full system evolution is well described by Franck-Condon physics, e. g. non-adiabatic excitations are predominantly external ones characterized by large phononic vibrations in the atomic cloud, while internal excitations are very weak as close to <b>perfect</b> onsite <b>transitions</b> take place.

40|$|Recently, a {{large number}} of {{countries}} have undertaken major reforms that have led to a large {{increase in the number of}} new enterprises. After these reforms, however, it has taken a number of years before output and productivity have begun to grow. The thesis of this paper is that the process of starting new enterprises is turbulent and time-consuming and as a result, it takes time before the benefits of reform show up in increases in measured output and productivity. To establish a neoclassical benchmark for reforming economies, we ask what the path of transition looks like in a reforming economy for which the process governing the growth of new enterprises looks like it does in the U. S., a well-functioning market economy. We find that it takes 5 - 7 years until measured output and productivity begin to grow rapidly following reform. This finding suggests that, even if all other aspects of the economy are <b>perfect,</b> the <b>transition</b> following economy-wide reforms should take a substantial amount of time. ...|$|R

Second, Social Security’s privatization helps the long-run poor even absent any explicit redistribution mechanism.

Third, privatizations that features voluntary rather than compulsory exit from the old system have particularly low transition costs and particularly favorable macroeconomic and distributional consequences despite the adverse selection they entail.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Auerbach-Kotlikoff Dynamic Simulation Model {{to compare the}} {{projected}} demographic transitions in Canada and the United States. The simulation model determines the <b>perfect</b> foresight <b>transition</b> path of an economy in which individuals live to age 75. The model's preferences are life cycle augmented to include utility from bequests. In addition to handling changes in demographics and fiscal policies, the model can be run for closed or open economies. In comparing Canada with the U. S., we first simulate the U. S. demographic transition, treating the U. S. as a closed economy. The time path of interest rates obtained from the U. S. simulations are then used in the Canadian simulations. In the Canada simulations, Canada {{is assumed to be}} an open economy which takes the U. S. interest rate as given. The simulations indicate that demographics are likely to have significant effects on rates of saving and taxation in both the U. S. and Canada. However, the more abrupt demographic transition in Canada combined with the projected maturation of Canadian social security system leads to a more severe predicted long term decline in Canadian saving rates. Despite the predicted lower saving rates, capital deepening is likely to occur in both countries, and the associated increase in real wages is likely to more than offset projected higher tax rates, leaving the growth-adjusted welfare of future generations higher than that of current generations. ...|$|R

A comprehensive study of the factors determining the future development of innovation-active enterprises has been conducted in the article.

Contrary {{to the case}} of the square lattice, where the perfect nesting of the Fermi surface leads to a metal-insulator transition at arbitrarily small values of U, always accompanied by antiferromagnetic ordering, on the triangular lattice, {{due to the lack of}} <b>perfect</b> nesting, the <b>transition</b> takes place at a finite value of U, and frustration induces a non-trivial competition among different magnetic phases. Indeed, within the mean-field approximation in the slave-boson approach, as the interaction grows the paramagnetic metal turns into a metallic phase with incommensurate spiral ordering. Increasing further the interaction, a linear spin-density-wave is stabilized, and finally for strong coupling the latter phase undergoes a first-order transition towards an antiferromagnetic insulator.
