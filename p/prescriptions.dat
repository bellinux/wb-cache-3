50|$|Special <b>prescription</b> forms, {{sometimes}} called narcotic <b>prescription</b> forms, controlled <b>prescription</b> forms, psychotropic <b>prescription</b> forms or triplicate <b>prescription</b> forms (because {{they often have}} to be signed in triplicate) are forms required in some countries for the <b>prescription</b> of controlled narcotics and other psychotropic substances, for which a standard medical <b>prescription</b> is not sufficient. They exist at least in Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, India, Russia, Australia Norway, Canada and some US states.

50|$|A <b>prescription</b> drug (also <b>prescription</b> {{medication}} or <b>prescription</b> medicine) is {{a pharmaceutical}} drug that legally requires a medical <b>prescription</b> to be dispensed. In contrast, over-the-counter drugs {{can be obtained}} without a <b>prescription.</b> The reason for this difference in substance control is the potential scope of misuse, from drug abuse to practicing medicine without a license and without sufficient education.

The resulting <b>prescription</b> is marked with verifiable randomly generated <b>prescription</b> ID before it is sent to the dispensing pharmacy and this accounts for the security feature of the <b>prescription</b> system. Microsoft Office Visio 2007, PHP and My SQL database server were used to present and develop the system.

5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, <b>prescriptions</b> for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E

40|$|Context: The {{dramatic}} {{rise in the}} use of <b>prescription</b> opioids {{to treat}} non-cancer pain has been paralleled by increasing <b>prescription</b> opioid abuse. However, detailed analyses of these trends and programs to address them are lacking. Objective: To study the association between state shipments of <b>prescription</b> opioids for medical use and <b>prescription</b> opioid abuse admissions and to assess the effects of state <b>prescription</b> drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) on <b>prescription</b> opioid abuse admissions. Design and Setting: A retrospective ecological cohort study comparing state <b>prescription</b> opioid shipments (source: Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders Systems database) and inpatient admissions for <b>prescription</b> opioid abuse (source: Treatment Episode Data Set) in 14 states with PDMPs (intervention group) and 36 states without PDMPs (control group) for the period 1997 – 2003. Results: From 1997 to 2003, oxycodone, morphine, and hydrocodone shipments increased by 479 %, 100 %, and 148 % respectively. Increasing <b>prescription</b> oxycodone shipments were signifi cantly associated with increasing <b>prescription</b> opioid admission rates (p 0. 001). PDMP states had signifi cantly lower oxycodone shipments than the control group. PDMP states had less increase in <b>prescription</b> opioid admissions per year (p = 0. 063).

Our results show that increases in <b>prescription</b> drug prices reduce both the use of and spending on <b>prescription</b> drugs.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} knowledge, {{attitude}} {{and practice of}} <b>prescription</b> writing among interns in medical college. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the interns in a Medical College, after taking approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee.

A structured questionnaire was designed based on new Medical Council of India (MCI) <b>prescription</b> writing pattern to analyse the <b>prescription.</b> The data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: Among 84 interns, {{most of the participants}} had written the drug by generic name (95. 2 %) and have signed in the <b>prescription</b> sheet (98 %). None of them were aware of the latest <b>prescription</b> writing pattern recommended by Medical Council of India (MCI). The writing of generic name in capital letter was not done by 97. 6 % of interns.     Conclusion: Our study concluded that interns were not aware of new Medical Council of India (MCI) <b>prescription</b> writing pattern.
