In September 1931, Fighter Squadron began flight testing the prototype Wackett Warrigal general-purpose biplane; testing was still under way when the aircraft's undercarriage collapsed during landing, <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> its service trials until the following January.|$|E

25|$|Negative coping {{responses}} of procrastinating individuals {{tend to be}} avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and cognitive dissonance) associated with <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators at their first knowledge of achievable goals. There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian defense mechanisms, coping styles and self-handicapping.|$|E

25|$|The airport's {{value was}} {{estimated}} at NOK20 million. A sabotage of the drainage system was discovered in 1949, which explained many of the technical challenges affiliated with the runways. This was decisive in <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> the military desire {{to hang on to}} the facility. Sola Air Station took the three large hangars and a barracks into use, {{while the rest of the}} airfield was decommissioned. A NOK6.7 million estimate to bring the airport back into shape was found to be not worth the cost.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing mosquito bites {{in areas}} where the disease occurs and proper use of condoms. Efforts to prevent bites include the use of insect repellent, covering much of the body with clothing, mosquito nets, and getting rid of standing water where mosquitoes reproduce. There is no effective vaccine. Health officials recommended that women in areas affected by the 2015–16 Zika outbreak consider <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> pregnancy and that pregnant women not travel to these areas. While there is no specific treatment, paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with the symptoms. Admission to hospital is rarely necessary.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, GMG Radio {{replaced}} the station with adult contemporary station 102.2 Smooth FM. GMG cited {{a number of}} reasons for replacing Jazz FM, including poor listening figures, not making money, the 'Jazz' name <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> potential listeners as well as not enough jazz for jazz purists. The Jazz FM name was retained by GMG for the relaunched ejazz.fm website service which was renamed jazzfm.com on the same day as the launch of Smooth FM. The station broadcast on digital satellite, online and on spare DAB capacity in Yorkshire, South Wales and the Severn Estuary where 102.2 Smooth FM and the defunct Smooth Digital service would have been duplicated.|$|E

25|$|Bush's {{rookie season}} had both ups and downs, {{although}} {{as the season}} wore on he became more productive and integral to the Saints' surprising success. In {{the first game of}} Bush's NFL career, he amassed 141 total yards against the Cleveland Browns. He carried the ball fewer times than his counterpart Deuce McAllister, <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> any speculation that he would immediately supplant McAllister as the starter in New Orleans. The Saints won the game by a score of 19–14. In his team's week 9 contest against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bush finished the game with −5 yards on 11 carries despite the Saints' 31–14 victory. This effort lowered his league-worst rushing average among running backs to only 2.55 yards per carry. However, he finished the midway point of the season with 46 receptions, the most by any running back in the league.|$|E

It was Vietnam's first {{home-grown}} revolutionary party, established three years before the Indochinese Communist Party. The party advocated socialism, but at the outset there was considerable debate over its other fundamental objectives. Many wanted it to promote worldwide revolution, rather than limiting itself to campaigning for an independent Vietnamese republic; but there were fears that this would lead to accusations of communism, <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> potential Vietnamese supporters who yearned above all for independence.

[...] In one panel [...] "Saint Justin" [...] had just ejaculated all over his hand, his penis in full view and his semen-covered hand clearly visible behind it. [...] Vortex {{publisher}} Bill Marks had the panel covered up with another illustration after discussing it with Brown. [...] Brown agreed to this censorship, but was [...] "annoyed" [...] by it. [...] Marks later called it a mistake that he would not make again, and when Brown included a scene in the following issue of the Ronald Reagan penishead vomiting Marks made no objection, and all future collections of Ed have the original uncensored panel. [...] The censored portion of the panel was covered with a note delivered by a rabbit that Brown often used as a surrogate self; the message read: [...] Brown has said that perhaps 100 to 200 readers sent requests for the uncensored panel.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{under the}} new name, White Lies played their first gig at Hoxton Square's Bar & Kitchen on 28 February 2008, {{supporting}} Team Waterpolo and Semifinalists. The band admitted rehearsing for two months for the gig, as well as <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> their debut for five months to gather media hype. Following this, the band received numerous record label offers, eventually signing to Fiction Records {{a matter of days}} after their first performance. The band also signed publishing rights to Chrysalis Music Publishing. The band said they chose the name because [...] "white lies are quite dark...that's how we see ourselves" [...] and that white lies [...] "protect the upsetting truths" [...] of the band's lyrics. Receiving airtime on BBC Radio 1, Zane Lowe named [...] "Death" [...] his [...] "Hottest Record in the World" [...] on 5 February 2008, despite the song having never been officially released. Radio 1 would go on to feature the band at Radio 1's Big Weekend in May 2008, where they headlined the BBC Introducing stage.|$|E
500|$|The Civil Engineering Department {{published}} {{two independent}} reports in March 1998 revealing that the upkeep of the hillside overlooking the monastery was inadequate. [...] This was partially {{attributed to the}} government's method of cutting slopes. [...] The incident resulted in {{the closure of the}} Monastery for three years to carry out repair work on the surrounding slopes in three stages. [...] Each phase cost more than HK$1.5 million – this outlay was covered by donations from the public, since the Monastery does not charge an admission fee for visitors. [...] The lay custodians eventually requested HK$6 million. [...] By March 2000, two small slopes had been overhauled, but work on the larger, more dangerous slopes had yet to begin. [...] The Monastery blamed excessive red tape {{on the part of the}} Buildings Department for <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> approval of the reconstruction works. [...] Although the temple was partially opened again a few months after the mudslide, the entire complex was not reopened until July 31, 2000. [...] It can now choose to close in the event of heavy rain.|$|E

500|$|Casting {{calls and}} auditions for Alien {{were held in}} both New York and London. With only seven human {{characters}} in the story, Scott sought to hire strong actors so he could focus most of his energy on the film's visual style. He employed casting director Mary Selway, {{who had worked with}} him on The Duellists, to head the casting in the United Kingdom, while Mary Goldberg handled casting in the United States. In developing the story, O'Bannon had focused on writing the Alien first, <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> developing the other characters. He and Shusett had intentionally written all the roles generically: they made a note in the script that explicitly states [...] "The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women." [...] This freed Scott, Selway, and Goldberg to interpret the characters as they pleased, and to cast accordingly. They wanted the Nostromos crew to resemble working astronauts in a realistic environment, a concept summarised as [...] "truckers in space". According to Scott, this concept was inspired partly by Star Wars, which deviated from the pristine future often depicted in science fiction films of the time.|$|E
500|$|With the June issue, {{the title}} was changed to Amazing Detective Tales. [...] Gernsback merged Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories into Wonder Stories at the same time; he was {{concerned}} that the word [...] "Science" [...] was <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> some potential readers, who assumed that the magazine was, in his words, [...] "a sort of scientific periodical". [...] It {{is likely that the}} same reasoning motivated Scientific Detective Monthlys new title. [...] In the following issue, Grey was replaced as editor by David Lasser, who was already editing Gernsback's other sf titles, and an attempt was made to include more stories with science fiction elements. [...] Gernsback continued the magazine for five issues under the new title; the last issue was dated October 1930. [...] The decision to cease publication was apparently taken suddenly, as the October issue included the announcement that the format would change in November from large to standard pulp size, and listed two stories planned for the November issue. [...] Gernsback sold the title to Wallace Bamber, who published at least five more issues, starting in February 1931; no issues are known for June or July 1931, or after August.|$|E
500|$|Writing for AllMovie, Andrea LeVasseur {{rated the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, called it [...] "memorable and pivotal", and {{described}} the Red Room dream as [...] "unforgettable". Jen Chaney, writing for The Washington Post, has called the episode [...] "the best in the series". Chaney described it, and the dream sequence specifically, as having [...] "turned Twin Peaks into a water-cooler phenomenon", and noted that it may have inspired later series such as The Sopranos and Lost to [...] "feel comfortable taking risks with their audience". The Washington Post Tom Shales has described the dream sequence as [...] "the scene that separated the men from the boys", noting that it further polarized the series' audience, attracting loyal viewers and <b>putting</b> <b>off</b> others. The sequence, and the episode as a whole, attracted negative criticism from The Boston Globe Ed Siegel, who felt that the series [...] "lost its magic" [...] by this point. Siegel added that [...] "anyone with less than a semester's worth of either Postminimalism101 or Absurdism102 can come up with dancing dwarves, one-armed men, psychic detectives, psycho killers, llamas in the waiting room and hints of incest and necrophilia", and felt that a reliance on surrealism made Lynch seem to be a [...] "one trick pony".|$|E
