5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens could eat {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E
5|$|Solti {{enrolled}} at the Ernö Fodor School of Music in Budapest {{at the age of}} ten, transferring to the more prestigious Franz Liszt Academy two years later. When he was 12 he heard a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony conducted by Erich Kleiber, which gave him the ambition to become a conductor. His <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare (c.1772–1798), {{sometimes}} spelled Tarare, was a French showman and soldier, {{noted for}} his unusual eating habits. Able to eat {{vast amounts of}} meat, he was constantly hungry; his <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not provide for him, and he was turned {{out of the family}} home as a teenager. He travelled France {{in the company of a}} band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling charlatan; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.|$|E

5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern Ganja, Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home {{to take care of her}} seven children. Because his <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not afford to send him to the local gymnasium, they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.|$|E
5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American parent or <b>parents,</b> <b>could</b> still risk loss of citizenship in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was repealed at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Psychohistorians, on {{the other}} hand, suggest that social {{behavior}} such as crime and war may be a self-destructive re-enactment of earlier abuse and neglect; that unconscious flashbacks to early fears and destructive <b>parenting</b> <b>could</b> dominate individual and social behavior.|$|R
5000|$|... from 22 November 1984 loss of Australian {{citizenship}} {{by either}} <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> affect the child's citizenship. However a child would not lose Australian citizenship in this circumstance if one parent remained an Australian citizen (or was an Australian citizen at death).|$|R
50|$|The Great Purim Adventure Of Chip Malibu: One son is {{everything}} a <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> wish for; {{the other is}} a porn star: family gatherings can be such fun! It had a reading in 2004 at the Queens Theatre in the Park directed by Rob Urbinati.|$|R
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not afford a ransom.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> enjoy.|$|E
50|$|Between 1860 and 1919, some 13,500 {{children}} were {{admitted to the}} home. Few children, however, were adopted, since most were actually half-orphans, members of a family which one parent (usually the father) had deserted and which the surviving <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> not support. The asylum was used, in effect, as a boarding school.|$|R
60|$|The {{existence}} of my child? Well, {{by the time}} that she grew up, if she lived to grow up, all the trouble and scandal would be forgotten, and the effacement of a discredited <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> be no great loss to her. Moreover, my life was insured for 3000 pounds in an office that took the risk of suicide.|$|R
50|$|A Sky {{system has}} a 4-digit PIN code. The default Sky PIN code {{is the last}} four digits of the Sky viewing card. However, there are some {{disadvantages}} in the PIN system used; for example, a <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> give a 15-year-old the PIN {{in order for them}} to watch a programme rated 15, not realising that it also lets them watch programmes rated 18.|$|R

25|$|His father, brother, and a {{neighbour}} {{came out}} to look and Joseph immediately said he too could see the apparition although the adults saw nothing. The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ <b>parents,</b> <b>could</b> also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times Book Review saw {{the book}} as the {{embodiment}} of [...] "hip-hop's Horatio Alger" [...] myth: “Ice-T, in short, is someone hip-hop might have invented if he hadn’t invented himself," [...] reviewer Baz Dreisinger wrote. [...] "A goes-down-easy mélange of memoir, self-help, and amateur criminology. Ultimately, Ice showcases an eminently reasonable, positively likeable guy, the gangsta rapper even a <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> love.” ...|$|R
60|$|Elspat was now really alarmed, {{and perhaps}} wished the fatal deceit {{had been left}} unattempted. She had no hope or refuge saving in the eloquence of persuasion, of which she possessed no small share, though her total ignorance {{of the world as}} it {{actually}} existed rendered its energy unavailing. She urged her son, by every tender epithet which a <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> bestow, to take care for his own safety.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately {{the youth}} had, during his school days in New York, heard {{a lecture on}} what was best to do in just such a case, so he did not labor in ignorance. His {{treatment}} was as skillful as memory and his love for his <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> make it, and in less {{than half an hour}} he had the satisfaction of seeing his father give a gasp and open his eyes.|$|R
25|$|Bao Zheng {{was born}} into a scholar family in Luzhou. Bao's family was in the middle class. Though Bao's <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> afford to send him to school, his mother had to climb up {{mountains}} to collect firewood just before she gave birth to him. As Bao grew up among low working class, he well understood people's hardships, hated corruption and strongly desired for justice.|$|E
25|$|Blizzard {{initially}} {{responded to}} some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts, that <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> set up the system so that minors cannot post, and that posting to the forums is optional. However, due to the huge negative response, Blizzard President Michael Morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on Blizzard's forums for the time being.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{societies}} {{were one}} of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of children's societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to bed at night. As children got older, <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> go for days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the 1990 {{decision}} of Carter v Brooks, the general view of Canadian courts {{was that a}} custodial <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> move with the child unless the access <b>parent</b> <b>could</b> show that the move was harmful to the child. [...] In Carter v Brooks, the Ontario Court of Appeal changed this approach. Instead of having a presumption {{in favor of the}} custodial parent, the court held that a move would only be allowed if it was {{in the best interests of}} the child. The court rejected putting an onus on either party because it thought that the best interests of the child would best be determined if there were no starting presumptions. The interests of the custodial parent would only be relevant as far as they impacted the interests of the child. Carter made it more difficult for custodial parents to move with their children. In Ontario, the result was that only 60% of moves were allowed. [...] This case was followed in British Columbia and the effect there was likely similar.|$|R

The state of mind of the outsider was irrelevant. There could be an action in the tort of deceit, but not s.332.

25|$|It {{started with}} 200 workers, {{more than the}} {{locality}} could provide so Arkwright built housing for them nearby, {{one of the first}} manufacturers to do so. Most of the employees were women and children, the youngest being only 7 years old. Later, the minimum age was raised to 10 and the children were given 6 hours of education a week, so that they could do the record keeping their illiterate <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not.|$|E
25|$|Sandra Laing is a South African {{woman who}} was {{classified}} as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her skin colour and hair texture, although her <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> prove at least three generations of European ancestors. At age 10, she was expelled from her all-white school. The officials' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life. She {{was the subject of}} the 2008 biographical dramatic film Skin, which won numerous awards.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he began}} skating at the {{relatively}} late age of 12, Weir progressed {{quickly through the}} ranks. He performed an Axel jump in his first week on ice skates. His <b>parents</b> <b>could</b> not afford to support both his figure skating and his equestrian pursuits, so Weir gave up his pony, My Blue Shadow, and turned his focus completely to figure skating. He competed in pair skating with Jodi Rudden on the juvenile and intermediate levels, but gave it up to concentrate on single skating.|$|E
60|$|His only {{remaining}} publication was an {{edition of the}} juvenile works of the elder of his two sons, who was taken off by a consumption (November 1790), {{at the age of}} twenty-two.

At the risque of telling my reader what he may, perhaps, well remember, I cannot but relate the method which he had taken to impress on his mind, when a child, the sense of his dependence on a Supreme Being; of which Porteus well observed, that it had all the imagination of Rousseau, without his folly and extravagance.|$|R
