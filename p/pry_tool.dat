50|$|The Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger-Messer uses {{a sliding}} blade inside a metal gripframe, which was {{originally}} fitted with smooth wood scales, usually of beech or walnut. The blade {{itself is a}} relatively blunt spear-point, and the profile is flat ground, tapering to a utility edge. To open the blade using gravity, the user points the FJM downwards while flipping up the fulcrum-style operating lever, allowing gravity to draw out the blade to its fullest extent. Releasing the lever locks the blade into position. The FJM may also be opened by flipping the blade release lever while flicking the wrist holding the knife, causing the blade to extend. The FJM was also equipped with a folding marlinspike or awl. Primarily intended for untangling rope knots, {{it can also be}} used as a <b>prying</b> <b>tool.</b> The FJM's spike does not lock when opened and was never intended {{to be used as a}} combat weapon, though individual German paratroopers may have employed it as such.|$|R
