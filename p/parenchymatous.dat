500|$|Whitman died on March 26, 1892. An autopsy {{revealed}} his lungs had diminished to one-eighth their normal breathing capacity, {{a result of}} bronchial pneumonia, and that an egg-sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs. The {{cause of death was}} officially listed as [...] "pleurisy of the left side, consumption of the right lung, general miliary tuberculosis and <b>parenchymatous</b> nephritis." [...] A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; over 1,000 people visited in three hours. Whitman's oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him. Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden. Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery, with friends giving speeches, live music, and refreshments. Whitman's friend, the orator Robert Ingersoll, delivered the eulogy. Later, the remains of Whitman's parents and two of his brothers and their families were moved to the mausoleum.|$|E

6000|$|The greater {{celerity}} {{with which}} the impulse is transmitted down the long exterior tentacles than across the disc may be largely attributed to its being closely confined within the narrow pedicel, instead of radiating forth on all sides as on the disc. But besides this confinement, the exterior cells of the tentacles are fully {{twice as long as}} those of the disc; so that only half the number of transverse partitions have to be traversed in a given length of a tentacle, compared with an equal space on the disc; and there would be in the same proportion less retardation of the impulse.

60|$|With Drosera we {{have seen}} that the motor impulse [page 316] is {{transmitted}} in like manner in all directions through the cellular tissue; but that its rate is largely governed by the length of the cells and the direction of their longer axes. Thin sections of a leaf of Dionaea were made by my son, and the cells, both those of the central and of the more superficial layers, were found much elongated, with their longer axes directed towards the midrib; and it is in this direction that the motor impulse must be sent with great rapidity from one lobe to the other, as both close simultaneously. The central <b>parenchymatous</b> cells are larger, more loosely attached together, and have more delicate walls than the more superficial cells. A thick mass of cellular tissue forms the upper surface of the midrib over the great central bundle of vessels.|$|E

Filamentous algae are composed of cells that divide along a single plane, allowing only elongation to form filaments of one or more rows of cells. Algae that can divide in two planes can form sheet-like thalli or bodies. Cells that can divide in a third plane potentially allow for the organism to develop a more complex body plan, and diversification of body plans into an erect thallus of some sort and a holdfast for attaching the upright portion to the substrate.|$|E

50|$|A callus is mass of {{undifferentiated}} <b>parenchymatous</b> cells. When {{a living}} plant tissue {{is placed in}} an artificial growing medium with other conditions favorable, callus is formed. The growth of callus varies with the homogenous levels of auxin and Cyotkininn and can be manipulated by endogenous supply of these growth regulators in the culture medium. The callus growth and its organogenesis or embryogenesis can be referred into three different stages.|$|E
5000|$|The stem is quadrangular, much branched, hispid or scabrid and {{contains}} a wide stele. The epidermis {{of the stem}} is covered in a thick waxy cuticle {{and contains}} few traversed stomata.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} that Nematothallus consisted of two layers of cuticle, although fossils giving this impression may in fact represent two layers which happened to overlap one another and become stuck. It is not readily established what the cuticle represents. [...] Lang (1945) had it as an epidermal layer, similar to the waxy cuticle of plants today, covering a <b>parenchymatous</b> layer. Alternatively, Edwards (1982) proposed that the inner tissue of Nematothallus comprised stringy tubes, with the cellular patterning produced by their ends.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{members are}} non-motile. Cells may be naked and {{embedded}} in mucilage, such as Chrysosaccus, or coccoid {{and surrounded by}} a cell wall, as in Chrysosphaera.

50|$|Moldenhawer's {{contributions}} {{center on}} the microscopic examination of plant tissues, for which he devised techniques to separate the cells from the middle lamella layer that separates them.

Although Moldenhawer is not credited with the cell theory, his work provided key documentation for {{the validity of the}} theory in plants.|$|E
50|$|They {{are formed}} by the {{activity}} of fascicular cambium. During {{the process of the}} division of cambium, the cambium cuts out cells on both the outer and inner side. These cells are <b>parenchymatous.</b> Most of these cells transform into xylem and phloem. But certain cells don't transform into xylem and phloem and remain as such. These cells cut out by the cambium towards the periphery are phloem parenchyma while those towards the pith are xylem parenchyma. Both of these cells together work as secondary medullary rays.|$|E
5000|$|Pleomorphic adenoma is {{a common}} benign salivary gland {{neoplasm}} characterised by neoplastic proliferation of <b>parenchymatous</b> glandular cells along with myoepithelial components, having a malignant potentiality. It {{is the most common}} type of salivary gland tumor and the most common tumor of the parotid gland. It derives its name from the architectural pleomorphism (variable appearance) seen by light microscopy. It is also known as [...] "Mixed tumor, salivary gland type", which describes its pleomorphic appearance as opposed to its dual origin from epithelial and myoepithelial elements.|$|E
5000|$|Gametes are {{released}} together with various fragments of cytoplasm. The gametes of both sex are anatomically indistinguishable and remain {{able to move}} for periods of up to approximately 30 minutes. Fusion was never observed in clonal cultures. However, female gametophytes were identified in some fertile cultures after a volatile (volatile organic compound), scented compound was detected during a parallel investigation of pheromone production. Fertilization was a not very noticeable process by which motile (able to move) gamete (male) approached an unmoving one (female) and, following contact, the two cells fused rapidly. Many zygotes having two eyespots and two chloroplasts can be identified in this process. The development of zygotes and unfused gametes follow the same pattern leading directly {{to the formation of}} <b>parenchymatous</b> sporophytes. Germination results in a branched [...] having a terminal (not produced within the organism) hair. Cells of the filament, frequently those lying next to a hair are transformed into peaks and developed into erect, <b>parenchymatous</b> sporophytes. Numerous hairs and erect fronds were often formed on the same individual. A variable, but usually small, proportion of unfused gametes give rise to another generation of gametophytes. After gametophytes had been maintained in culture for prolonged periods, exceeding 2 years, they failed to respond to the short-day stimulus, appearing to have lost the capacity to produce gametangia.|$|E
50|$|Oxycraspedus {{utilizes}} the cones of the Monkey-puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana). Adults {{seek shelter}} in the cones - usually female one but occasionally male ones too - and larvae feed on the <b>parenchymatous</b> tissue but not the seeds. Indeed, {{by the time the}} larvae have finished their development to pupation, the host cones are typically already discarded by the plant and have shed their seeds. Very old cones that are slowly rotting on the forest floor are also taken, demonstrating the evolutionary link between Oxycorynini and the other Belidae which also feed on decaying woody tissue, but of twigs and stems.|$|E
