40|$|Title: Supplier Relationship Manager By: Andy Mols Promoters: Professor Joaquim Filipe			Corporate {{promoter}} Vitor Pedrosa					Corporate promoter Servaas Tilkin					School promoter The {{application is}} designed to improve the relations between INSTICC and their supplier. Until now nothing in this process was done automatically so this had to change. The application is mainly focussed on managing orders and payments. The {{first part of the}} program is the orders. Here the order manager can see an overview of all the orders and their state. The user can add new orders or edit them here as well. There are two different types of orders. There are singular orders and contracts. Singular orders are simple orders that do not recur. Contracts are a bit more complex. It is possible to have a contract with the water company, for example. In this example It is known they have to be paid every month but not the exact amount. The user can select a default amount, the length of the contract and the time between payments. The program will then automatically make all the payment commitments for the time of the contract (in this example every month {{until the end of the}} contract). The contract can also be with a hotel. In this case the user has to enter all the payment commitments himself because this cannot be done automatically. The second part is the payments. Here you get an overview of all the payment commitments and when they have to be paid. Here you can add or edit a payment of a commitment. A notification system is implemented in the project as well. When an order or a <b>payment</b> <b>commitment</b> is made, the payment manager gets an email informing him/her there is something that has to be paid. It is also possible to add custom notifications. The program has to be able to store four types of documents on a server, namely an invoice, a proof of payment from the bank, a receipt from the supplier and a general proof from the entire order (if necessary). These files are transferred to the server with a WCF service. The program also has to check the privileges of the user to see what rights he has within the program. It is possible that a user is allowed to edit but not delete an order. Every action is logged and can be viewed by an admin. The admin can also change a user 2 ̆ 7 s privileges, view all documents and change the settings for the notifications...|$|E
40|$|There {{has existed}} since ancient times the need, {{particularly}} {{in the area of}} commercial traffic, to be able to transfer a commitment to pay a debt to a third party. A singular succession of a debt, whilst maintaining the obliga-tion, whereby the liability is transferred to a succeeding debtor, was not considered possible under Justinian Law (Codex Justinianus) and in the Ius Commune. In these legal systems the obligation was considered to be a personal engagement between creditor and debtor, and a succeeding debtor could only bind himself on the basis of an independent obligation to the creditor. According to Justinian Law, the creation of an obligation for the succeeding debtor instead of the original debtor could be achieved if the succeeding debtor in a legal proceeding acted as procurator in rem suam for the original debtor. If the succeeding debtor in this procedure would enter into litis contestatio with the creditor, then, from that point on, the original debtor would be freed from his obligation, and any judgement would be issued against the succeeding debtor. Because the succeeding debtor had accepted the liability in his own interest (in rem suam), he could not recover from the debtor in the event of any required payment to the creditor. Although a debtor could only be freed from his obligation to a creditor, if that creditor and a succeeding debtor entered into litis contestatio; C. 2, 3, 2 shows that the debtor could plead a defense against the creditor if the latter had implied his agreement to the transfer of debt by bringing legal action against the succeeding debtor. In the second place, under Justinian Law, a succeeding debtor could be legally bound instead of the original debtor by novation. The original obligation would be discharged through novation, which meant that all accessory rights and defenses would also be cancelled. If parties wanted to call on these accessory rights and defenses after novation, then it would be necessary that they be re-established. Only in the event of already established rights of pledge and mortgage would it be possible to maintain such rights, with retention of rank, for the new obligation. Lastly, under Justinian Law, it was possible to use delegation to transfer a commitment to pay a debt to a third party. In this case the debtor, i. e. the delegator, ordered the succeeding debtor, i. e. the declared debtor or delegated party, to undertake to the creditor, i. e. the delegatee, in the delegator/debtor’s place, to satisfy the debt. The succeeding debtor could create an undertaking to the creditor by entering either into a stipulatio or a litis contestatio. This stipulation entered into on the basis of delegation did not necessarily {{have to be on the}} basis of novation. The stipulation only served as novation if this appeared from the parties’ intentions. The original debtor was freed from any obligation to the creditor, even if the stipulation did not serve as novation, because the transfer of a liability by delegation was considered payment in full by the delegator/debtor to the creditor/ delegatee. Because the succeeding debtor in the case of a litis contestatio, or novation, or delegation, had an undertaking to the creditor on the grounds of a new obligation, this meant that in none of these cases there was question of a singular succession of debt. Following Justinian Law, it was also assumed in Mediaeval Law, ancient French Law, and Roman-Dutch Law that a succeeding debtor could only create an undertaking, instead of the original debtor, by entering either into a litis contestatio, or novation, or delegation. Litis contestatio was described on the basis of the glossaries as necessitating a renewal of a debt obligation. However, novation entered freely into by the parties was considered a voluntary renewal of the debt obligation. An important distinction in legal effect was that all accessory rights and defenses were cancelled in the event of voluntary novation, while they continued to exist in the event of a renewal of the debt obliga-tion being necessitated, i. e. in the case of litis contestatio. If a succeeding debtor entered into a litis contestatio with the creditor, then this was not considered a necessary, but a voluntary method of novation, on the basis of the glossaries. This consequently meant that in this case accessory rights and defenses also were cancelled. Novation of a liability could be created by an agreement between creditor and succeeding debtor (expromission) or by way of a tripartite agreement, including the original debtor. Although changes in the area of novation and litis contestatio in the Ius Commune, when compared to Justinian Law were not significant, the application of delegation did undergo far-reaching changes. On the basis of the glossaries, delegation was viewed as a particular method of novation. Delegation was always considered to be coupled with novation. Since Donellus it had been the general view that delegation could only be used to replace the debtor in an obligation, and not the creditor. This restricted the application of delegation to the transfer of debts. The position on delegation did not undergo any change in ancient French Law and Roman-Dutch Law until the introduction of the Code Civil and the OBW, respectively. Entering into novation or delegation would cancel the original obligation, thus freeing the debtor. The risk that the succeeding debtor would not pay would lie with the creditor. Because creditors would often not wish to assume this result, in practice it was usually considered sufficient if the original debtor ordered the succeeding debtor to pay the creditor on behalf of the original debtor. In such case the succeeding debtor did not enter into a renewal of the debt obligation. This legal concept was given existence in Roman-Dutch Law next to delegation and was referred to as ‘assignatio’ or ‘aenwijzing’ (assignment). Roman-Dutch Law agreed that the creditor could accept the assignment, giving him the right to seek repayment directly from the succeeding debtor. The practice of having the creditor accept the assignment can be considered as a particular application of a stipulation on behalf of a third party; a concept that was also gradually accepted under Roman-Dutch Law. Ancient French Law did recognize the assignment, but not the possibility for a creditor to acquire any rights from the assignment with respect to a succeeding debtor. In the event it was the parties’ intention to create such rights with respect to the succeeding debtor, in addition to the original debtor, for the creditor, then a tripartite agreement was called for. This agreement was substantially similar to delegation, albeit without the effect of novation. This type of agreement creating an undertaking of the succeeding debtor, in addition to those of the original debtor, was referred to as a ‘délégation imparfait’. The Code Civil and the OBW did not contemplate the possibility of singular succession of a debt. The usual manner of creating singular succession of a debt under the OBW was by way of novation of a liability. Both expromission and delegation were provided for in the OBW. Dutch case law in force under the OBW, in making a determination of the legal effect of agreements intended to transfer a liability, would look at the administration of novation and delegation under the law. However, in those cases were it had clearly been the intention of the parties that existing accessory rights or defenses were to remain in force, as in the case of a transfer of a mortgage, then the agreement could not be considered a novation. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands handed down a decision (HR 17 February 1843, W 410) shortly after adoption of the OBW, stating that, in order to determine the legal effect of an agreement entered into to transfer a liability between debtor and declared debtor, a connection could be drawn to the regulations covering stipulation on behalf of a third party, as provided for in article 1353 OBW. Although the Supreme Court made no reference to that effect, this decision in fact continued the practice dating from Roman-Dutch Law with respect to the possibility of assuming the assignatio. Nevertheless, neither novation nor a stipulation on behalf of a third party would in all cases meet with the requirements of everyday life. For example, agreements intended to transfer a <b>payment</b> <b>commitment,</b> such as would be the case with the transfer of a sole proprietorship, in many cases were intended to create an undertaking from the succeeding debtor to replace the original debtor for the creditor with respect to the same obligation. Gradually literature and case law accepted the concept that such a replacement of the original debtor in an obligation should be possible. This development stemmed from the German science of law During the second half of the 19 th Century the Pandektists were able to let go of the centuries’ old idea that an obligation was inseparable from the actual person of the debtor. This development had been given force by Delbrück, who was of the opinion that an obligation was not so much determined by the personal relationship between debtor and creditor, but more determined by the claim and debt that arises from it as an independent asset. Even though his view of the obligation was not adopted, Delbrück’s studies did create the impetus for a changed view of obligations. In responding to Delbrück’s study that same year, it was the opinion of Windscheid that the obligation creates a relationship between two people aimed at a certain performance to be undertaken by the debtor. This performance usually can also be undertaken by another party without the performance being changed in any meaningful way. According to Windscheid, in all these cases the debtor of the obligation can be replaced without this act changing the obligation. It is the view of Windscheid therefore that the obligation is determined by its performance, and this was the ruling view in the German science of law since the end of the 19 th Century. Windscheid’s conclusion, that a debtor can be replaced by a third party without canceling the obligation, was generally accepted. This development allowed for the transfer of a liability, in the meaning of singular succession of a debt, to be recognized in the German science of law before the end of the 19 th Century. It was recognized that replacing the debtor might have an influence on the ability to collect on the claim. For this reason a change of debtor can not take place without the cooperation of the creditor. This issue provoked the question in German science of law, whether a creditor shall be a party to the transfer of the liability, or whether it suffices for him to consent to the transfer (the decision theory). Following custom as it existed in practice, most legal authors deemed that cooperation of the creditor could be limited to providing his consent to an agreement between original debtor and declared debtor. German Law concurred with this view in § 415 BGB. The agreement to transfer the liability, according to § 415 BGB, can be entered into by original debtor and declared debtor and becomes effective if the creditor provides his consent. By providing this consent, the creditor does not become a party to the agreement, according to German law. Separately, § 414 BGB provides that a transfer of a liability can also be effected by an agreement between the creditor and the declared debtor. In practice this type of agreement is less important. Although the Dutch science of law followed its German counterpart in paying attention to the doctrine of liability transfer, there was no true debate on the question whether a transfer of a liability could be adopted within the framework of the OBW. At the time when Meijers commenced designing a new Civil Code, there existed no consensus on this issue. While referring to the need evidenced by actual practice, Meijers incorporated a transfer of a liability in the draft of the new Civil Code. In drafting the provisions he was influenced by German law. Novation was omitted from the new Civil Code, because, according to Meijers, there no longer was a need for it. In fact, the regulations for a transfer of a liability differ from novation on two fundamental issues, allowing the regulations to better accord to the needs of daily practice. Firstly, the parties, when agreeing that the declared debtor will discharge the debt instead of the debtor, usually only intend to replace the debtor, without canceling the obligation including all related rights and defenses. This result can be achieved by transfer of a liability, but not with novation. Secondly, article 6 : 155 of the Dutch Civil Code has been drafted to provide that a transfer of a liability is effected by an agreement between debtor and declared debtor, without the creditor becom-ing a party to the agreement. But in the case of novation, the creditor has to, and had to, be a party to the agreement. It is usual practice, however, that an agreement for the transfer of a liability is made between debtor and his successor, while it suffices for the creditor to provide his consent to the agreement. The regulations covering the transfer of a liability for this reason accords better with reality in practice than the regulations for novation. The agreement to transfer a liability is an obligatory arrangement between debtor and declared debtor. The actual transfer of the liability only takes place when the creditor, after being notified, has consented to the agree-ment. The function of the creditor’s consent is comparable to the notice of assignment to the assigned debtor upon transfer of a claim. It is my opinion that, for this reason, it can be stated that the creditor, while not a party to the obligatory agreement, does become a party to the delivery act that causes the debt to actually transfer to the assets of the declared debtor. Although not provided for in the Civil Code, and although Meijers in fact expressly excluded this as a possibility, it is my opinion that the transfer of a liability can also be effected by an agreement between creditor and declared debtor. This ties into the possibility, expressly permitted in the OBW, of effecting novation of a liability by way of expromission and with the possibility, also recognized by the Civil Code, of having a third party discharge a debt. In an agreement between creditor and declared debtor the obligatory agreement and the delivery act coincide. The liability transfers to the declared debtor at the time the agreement becomes effective, i. e. when executed. Article 6 : 155 through 6 : 158 of the Dutch Civil Code has not copied the German regulations verbatim, but nevertheless both sets of regulations are in effect largely similar. An important difference between the regulations is that in German law consent of the creditor is given retroactive force, whilst this retroactive force is expressly denied in Dutch law. To achieve that the parties are not dependent on consent from the creditor to determine the moment when the liability transfers, Dutch law has determined that debt, as it pertains to the relationship between debtor and declared debtor, transfers simultaneously with the agreement for the transfer of the liability being executed. From the point of view of Dutch Law, the consequences of the transfer have therefore been made relative; as between declared debtor and original debtor, the moment in time the liability transfers is different from that at which it transfers in the relationship between declared debtor and creditor. Creating such a relative transfer of a liability however denies the nature of the obligation and is therefore impossible. That is the reason why transfer of a liability, as between debtor and declared debtor, occurs only when the creditor has consented. The debt is transferred in its then existing capacity as it results from the obligation between debtor and creditor at the moment of transfer. Both German and Dutch Law apply the rule that transfer of a debt is dependent upon the validity of the agreement governing the transfer of the liability. This means that if such agreement is invalid, then the debt has not transferred to the declared debtor. The declared debtor can raise the defense against the creditor that the debt, because the agreement transferring the liability is invalid, did not transfer to him. Because the agreement to transfer the debt can be viewed as title of transfer, this means that a transfer of a liability, contrary to the law’s intention, in fact constitutes a causal legal act. Intrinsically, a transfer of a liability in this regard does not differ substantially in its effect from novation. In the case of novation an invalid agreement to transfer a liability will create a bar to establishing a new obligation for the succeeding debtor. A creditor can be prejudiced by an invalid agreement to transfer a liability, because, for example, he has neglected to take legal action against the debtor. Both German and Dutch Law contain no specific provisions to protect the position of the creditor. It is my opinion that a creditor, who has, in good faith, relied on the validity of a transfer of a liability, can lodge an appeal on the basis of article 3 : 36 of the Dutch Civil Code. This means that an invalid transfer cannot be raised as a defense, and that he can hold the declared debtor responsible for payment of the debt. Deficiencies in the underlying legal relationship between debtor and declared debtor do not however affect the validity of the transfer of the liability. This also accords with the general principles of Dutch property laws, providing that the motivation to enter into a legal proceeding does not affect its validity. In this regard, regulations governing the transfer of liabilities do not only accord with those of German Law, but also accord with what was the rule with respect to delegation under Justinian Law and with respect to novation as governed by the OBW. ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographyExecutive Summary World {{economic}} growth gained momentum in 1999 increasing by 3. 3 per cent, impelled by vibrant {{activity in the}} United States and Asia. The robust United States expansion continued with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing by 4. 2 per cent. The European Area with growth of 2. 3 per cent experienced similar dynamism. In both of these economies strong GDP growth was matched by firm gains in employment. Growth was also more robust in developing countries, as a whole, but showed important disparity by region. Buoyed by competitive exchange rates and strong demand in the United States and the European Area, growth rebounded strongly in the Asia-Pacific region. This contrasted with declining growth performance in Africa, the Middle East and Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa continued to be imperiled by declining commodity prices, poor investor confidence and disruptions occasioned by war and adverse weather. Meanwhile, growth slipped in Latin America and the Caribbean, as the impetus in Mexico, Central America and a few Caribbean countries was dampened by sluggish output growth and export performance in the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) subregion. Growth rates of 0. 5 per cent in Brazil and a decline of 3. 5 per cent in Argentina, contrasted with 3. 5 per cent growth in Mexico. Caribbean countries' growth performance was strongly influenced by the export multiplier. Growth in the Dominican Republic (8. 2 per cent), Belize (6. 2 per cent) and Trinidad and Tobago (4. 2 per cent) was stimulated by their ability {{to take advantage of}} the booming United States market, while Jamaica (- 0. 4 per cent), the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Suriname, whose exports were relatively uncompetitive, recorded weaker growth. OECS banana exports were hard hit, contracting by almost 8 per cent in 1999. Inflation was also subdued in most regions, except the Countries in Transition, where bottlenecks led to a doubling of the rate. World trade rebounded in 1999, and was indeed the main engine of growth. The impetus for the improvement in trade was largely provided by the Asian economies that staged v-shaped recoveries. Merchandise trade also picked up in Latin America and the Caribbean, bolstered by the competitive strength of Mexico and Central America. By contrast, merchandise exports declined in Africa and the Transition economies by 15. 5 per cent and 1. 5 per cent, respectively, precipitated by weakened commodity demand and prices. In the services sector, tourism gained momentum, growing by 4. 1 per cent, up from 3. 1 per cent in 1998. The United States continued to garner the lion's share of tourism receipts. This suggests that developing countries, such as those in the Caribbean, need to diversify and revitalize their tourism product and service to improve their market share in the sector. There was a flurry of activity on the institutional and trade negotiation fronts in 1999, aimed mainly at promoting regionalism and financial regulation. The World Trade Organization (WTO) held its Third Ministerial Meeting in Seattle, Washington, to advance the millennium round of trade negotiations, with the main focus on the liberalisation of agriculture and services, the unfinished agenda from the Uruguay Round and also new issues. However, the meeting was largely unsuccessful due to disagreements among developing and developed countries over the vital issues for focus and disruptive protests by labour and environmental lobby groups. A crowning achievement of European integration, the euro, was launched as the future currency of the integration bloc. Notably, the groundwork for the African Caribbean Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) Partnership Agreement, the successor to the Lomé ‰V Agreement, was laid in 1999, and the agreement was signed in June of 2000. The agreement provides for a strengthened partnership based on poverty reduction and structured integration of the ACP countries into the world economy. In addition, the preferential access to the United States market was extended to the Caribbean through the Caribbean Basin Trade Pact (CBTPA) that was passed by the United States Congress in May 2000. This should provide important market access for competitive textile, apparel, fish and other products from the Caribbean. Financial reforms centred on strengthening financial institutions and regulatory arrangements to limit the prospect of future crises. The Financial Stability Forum was mandated to undertake work in this area. Financial conditions also improved, buttressed by strengthened investor confidence and equity prices. However, net private capital flows seem still to be affected by some investor uncertainty and, probably, better discrimination between countries with high and low risk profiles. World saving was stable at roughly 23. 2 per cent of GDP in 1999. Saving in advanced economies declined slightly to 22. 1 per cent of GDP influenced by robust spending in the United States, the EU and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Developing countries' savings also fell marginally to 25. 4 per cent of GDP, as the increase in the rate in the Middle East and Africa was offset by the decline in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Developed countries' investment was up slightly, while in developing countries, investment declined marginally. Reflecting in part saving, investment and exports, the current account deficit of developing countries narrowed substantially by 63 per cent. Capital flows to developing countries slipped by almost 9. 0 per cent in 1999. Net resource flows to Latin America and the Caribbean contracted by about 30 per cent, and could not be compensated for by higher flows to Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The welcome increase in flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, however, was unevenly distributed, with the lion's share going to South Africa, attracted by its privatisation programmes and other reforms. Growth in the external debt of developing countries slowed to 1. 6 per cent in 1999. The carry over from declining oil prices in 1998, led to the fastest growth in debt in the Middle East and Europe (3. 9 per cent). Africa's debt grew by 2. 3 per cent, largely on account of higher debt accumulation in North Africa to counter the effects of sluggish oil prices early in the year. External debt in Latin America and the Caribbean was up, by only 0. 5 per cent. Private debt declined in line with lower <b>payments</b> <b>commitments</b> as a result of sluggish MERCOSUR trade. The debt relief initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) was extended in 1999. Countries such as Bolivia, Guyana, Mali and Mozambique benefited under the programme of debt write-offs. Debt reduction in Guyana, for instance, has enabled higher social spending...|$|R
40|$|Background: Neonatal {{mortality}} (death {{within the}} first 28 days of life), presently accounts for 41 % of the global burden of under- 5 deaths. Estimates indicate that {{about two-thirds of the}} 3. 1 million neonatal deaths could be averted with an increased implementation of existing evidence-based practices. Neonatal hypothermia, defined as body temperature < 36. 5 °C, contributes to the burden of neonatal mortality and can easily be avoided and managed by practicing delayed bathing and by applying skin-to-skin care of the newborn. However, neonatal care routines in many low-income countries do not yet adhere to these evidence-based practices. In addition, misconceptions - such as beliefs that skin-to-skin care enhances vertical HIV transmission and that early bathing is required continue to exist. These misconceptions further delay knowledge translation. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework is a conceptual framework that posits three interacting cornerstones: (1) Evidence, (2) Facilitation and (3) Context, that, taken together, influence implementation of new knowledge. Improved understanding of how contextual factors in healthcare organizations influence knowledge translation has {{led to the development of}} context assessment tools for high-income settings. There are no tools available for this purpose in low- and middle-income settings. Aims: To increase the body of knowledge on thermal response in newborns and mothers to inform evidence-based clinical practices, explore perceptions around these practices amongst newly delivered mothers and, furthermore, to explore the perceived influence and relevance of factors in the organizational context on the implementation of evidence-based practices in low- and middle-income settings. Methods: The studies employed both quantitative (I, III, V) and qualitative (II, IV-V) methods. Studies I- III were undertaken in Uganda and focused on generating evidence around thermal control of the newborn. Neonatal rectal and tympanic temperatures were measured at 5, 60, 70 and 90 minutes postpartum amongst 249 mother-newborns pairs. All newborns were subjected to skin-to-skin care. The pairs were randomized to either bathing in lukewarm water at 60 minutes (n= 126) or into continuous skin-to-skin care (n= 123) throughout the study period (I). In order to explore perceptions of skin-to-skin care, 30 purposively sampled women having participated in Study I were invited to participate in focus group discussions (II). In order to deepen the understanding of how skin-to-skin care affects the maternal temperature, maternal breast and axillary temperatures were assessed at fixed intervals postpartum whilst practising skin-to-skin care of the newborns (III). Studies IV-V focused on generating a better understanding of factors in the organizational context that influence the implementation of new knowledge. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were undertaken amongst health workers and managers in Uganda (IV) and content validity of available tools and developed items were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively amongst identified experts in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua (V). Descriptive statistics, chi-square test and logistic (I) and linear (III) regression analysis methods were applied to model the relationship between the dependent variable, temperature, and the explanatory variables. Content analysis was applied to the qualitative studies (II, IV-V). Rated content validity of context concepts were assessed by calculating content-validity index (CVI) (V). Results: The effect of bathing resulted in a significant increase in point-prevalence of hypothermia at 70 minutes postpartum amongst newborns having been exposed to bathing compared to those who were not (p= 0. 78). Conclusions: Continuous skin-to-skin care reduces the prevalence of hypothermia but its application does not prevent the negative thermal effect of early bathing. There are misconceptions about thermal care of the newborn and there is a need to clarify how patient preferences are to be perceived as evidence in the PARIHS framework. In the studied healthcare settings, resources, community engagement and informal <b>payment</b> and <b>commitment</b> are relevant aspects of context, in addition to leadership, culture and evaluation, as suggested in the PARIHS framework. There is a need to adapt the PARIHS framework and tools to assess context and commitment to fit low- and middle-income settings...|$|R
40|$|With {{over 500}} {{millions}} of citizens, the European Union (EU) {{as a whole}} generates, in 2009, an estimated 28 % share of the nominal gross world product and about 21. 3 % of the gross world product. Compared to the EU average, the United States per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is 35 % higher and the Japanese per capita GDP is approximately 15 % higher. However, there are substantial economical disparities within the EU. On the high end, Inner London has a per capita GDP equal to EUR 83, 200 (334 % of the EU 27 average), while the poorest region Severozapaden, in Bulgaria, has a per capita GDP of only EUR 6, 400 (26 % of the EU 27 average). Regional policy {{has been at the}} heart of EU policies since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The Treaty’s preamble refers to the need “to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing among the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions”. To this goal {{there are a number of}} Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds supporting development of poor regions. Nowadays with the current financial crisis, EU is also facing a new range of challenges owing to the enlargement of the Union which is actually strengthening European economic stability and welfare. In this thesis we will try to answer to the following questions: Which are the determinants of productivity dynamics of EU regions? Which policy was adopted by the EU in the last thirty years to achieve its goals of convergence and competitiveness of European regions? Has this policy been effective? In particular, the thesis is organized in three chapters. Chapter 1 traces the history of the EU regional policy explaining how it has evolved from 1957 to 2006. We discuss how the use as unit of observation of the so called NUTS 2 regions (see [URL] can be not appropriate for the type of issues under scrutiny. Then we show how we built our database on Structural and Cohesion Funds for the first three programming periods (i. e. 1975 - 1988, 1989 - 1993 and 1994 - 1999), for which no databases are directly available by the European Commission. In this we paid particular attention to the reallocation across regions when information was available only at multiregional or country level, in the light of the constant changes that the EU regional policy underwent from 1975 to 1999. We find that Structural and Cohesion Funds mainly flowed to regions with lower per capita income and, within the Objective 2 regions, with higher unemployment rate and employment share in the industrial sector. However, recipients were not always regions with the least favourable economic conditions and there exists a significantly share of funds allocated independently of the eligibility criteria. Moreover, we find that over time there is an increasing discrepancy between the funds committed and those actually spent by the regions. Finally, taking the ratio of <b>payments</b> on <b>commitments</b> as a measure of the administrative capacity for using EU funds, we find that countries greatly differ in their efficiency in managing the funds. Chapter 2 analyzes the impact of the European Union regional policy on the productivity growth of European regions over the period 1980 - 2002. In particular, we separately consider three programming periods (1975 - 1988, 1989 - 1993 and 1994 - 1999), and study the effects of various types of funds on labour productivity (i. e. Structural, Cohesion, Objective 1, etc.). In order to capture the main features of the funds, i. e. their size and composition, we also propose a simple growth model, which is subsequently utilized as a guide to the empirical analysis. In all the three programming periods we find that, on average, funding had a positive and concave effect on productivity growth. In particular, a share of funds on GVA of 10 % is estimated to raise the regional growth rate of about 0. 9 % per year. However, by separately considering the three programming periods and the composition of the funds according to different “objectives”, we find that: i) only the funds allocated in the second and third programming periods, when their amount remarkably increased, had a significant impact; and ii) only Objective 1 and Cohesion funds had a positive and significant impact, while the impact of funds devoted to Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 appears negative or non significant. The results are robust to funds’ endogeneity and spatial dependence. Chapter 3 analyzes the determinants of the distribution dynamics of labour productivity of European regions over a shorter period, i. e. 1992 - 2002. We propose a novel methodology which combines the growth regression approach `a la Barro and Sala-i-Martin, in a semiparametric framework, with the stochastic kernel approach `a la Quah. In particular, the distributional impact of a given variable is evaluated by the comparison of actual and counterfactual distributions and the related actual and counterfactual stochastic kernels and ergodic distributions. Counterfactual distribution is calculated by the estimated growth regression, taking the variable to sample average for all regions. The methodology also allows for measuring the marginal effect of the variable on distribution and for testing for possible presence of distributional effects in the residuals of growth regression. We find that initial productivity accounts for a large decrease in the dispersion of productivity. Instead, country unexplained component (country dummies) has an ambiguous effect (benefiting regions around but below the average but hurting regions far below), while employment growth has not any distributional effect. Objective 1 and Cohesion Funds have a reducing-dispersion effect, but their very limited size produces a negligible effect on the overall distribution. This also holds for structural change, as measured by the change in the share of Agriculture sector on total GVA, and Wholesales and Retail; on the opposite Hotel and Other Market Services result enhancing-dispersion sectors. Finally, financial sector has an ambiguous effect, mostly benefiting regions with productivity around but below the average. No variable considered in the analysis appears to affect the polarization of productivity, but initial productivity...|$|R
