The muscular tails of many shrimp are edible to humans, and they are widely caught and farmed for human consumption. Commercial shrimp species support an industry worth 50 billion dollars a year, and in 2010 the total commercial production of shrimp was nearly 7 million tonnes. Shrimp farming became more prevalent during the 1980s, particularly in China, and by 2007 the harvest from shrimp farms exceeded the capture of wild shrimp.

We model the optimal allocation of surface water and pollution rights along a river with water quality constraints. Due to cumulative effects, the shadow values of water and pollution rights are contingent on location. It is shown that a Nash equilibrium in a market for tradable surface water rights in conjunction with a market for <b>pollution</b> <b>damages</b> implements the optimal solution.

40|$|Currently, in the United States, on-road {{vehicles}} are primarily powered by petroleum fuels (gasoline and diesel). These vehicles have caused serious climate change effects from emissions {{of greenhouse gas}} (GHG) and health and environmental impacts from criteria air pollutant (CAP). The recent success of shale gas development has brought industry interest in using natural gas to power on-road vehicles. In addition to low costs and wide availability of this national fuel source, natural gas is a common feedstock to produce alternative fuels. The question arises of whether using natural gas for transportation could help or hinder the environment. In this dissertation, I study the economic and environmental effects {{of a wide range}} of natural gas fuel pathways for a selection of light duty (LDV) and medium and heavy duty (MHDV) vehicle types. I choose to focus on two environmental metrics: GHGs and CAPs emitted over the life cycle of each potential pathway for natural gas use. First in Chapters 2 and 3, I use life-cycle analysis to understand the emissions of GHGs from different natural gas pathway for LDVs and MHDVs. Then in Chapter 4 I focus on the CAP emissions from these vehicles. Overall, I find that none of the natural gas pathways eliminate life cycle air emissions. In fact, only a few pathways reduce life cycle GHG emissions and/or life cycle air <b>pollution</b> <b>damages</b> compared to baseline petroleum fuels (gasoline for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and diesel for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs)). For the cases of light duty vehicles (LDVs) and transit buses, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by natural gas-based electricity provide significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions and life cycle air <b>pollution</b> <b>damages</b> (for almost all counties) compared to the baseline petroleum fuels. However, the actual electricity that charges BEVs may not be natural gas-based electricity in most parts of the U. S. When powered by U. S. grid electricity (using average emission factors for 2010 and 2014), BEVs reduce life cycle GHG emissions to a lesser extent but increase life cycle air <b>pollution</b> <b>damages</b> significantly. Compressed natural gas (CNG), while reducing GHG emissions and CAP emissions (except CO) at tailpipe, are more likely to increase life cycle GHG emissions and increase life cycle air <b>pollution</b> <b>damages</b> in the majority of U. S. counties. For heavy-duty trucks, CNG sparking-ignition (SI) trucks and liquefied natural gas (LNG) high-pressure direct ignition (HPDI) trucks have mixed environmental impacts. While they are unlikely to reduce life cycle GHG emissions compared to diesel, they reduce life cycle air <b>pollution</b> <b>damages</b> in 76 - 99...|$|R

40|$|When {{setting the}} {{stringency}} of environmental regulations of the intensive livestock industry, governments make a trade-off between rural {{economic development and}} environmental quality. This trade-off represents the weight the government places on social welfare relative to the profitability of the intensive livestock industry. The impact of the weight the government places on rural economic development on the formation of environmental regulations in the US intensive livestock industry is examined in this thesis. 	A political economy model explaining the formation of environmental regulations {{in the presence of}} a special interest lobby group is developed. The theoretical model finds that the incumbent government sets policy in response to the marginal disutility from pollution, the intensity of <b>pollution</b> <b>damages,</b> and according to the weight the government places on rural economic development. 	The theoretical model is tested using a cross-sectional analysis of 1997 intensive livestock industry environmental regulations across US states.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} optimal corrective {{taxation and}} optimal income redistribution. Under general utility functions, the Pigouvian pollution tax is higher if <b>pollution</b> <b>damages</b> disproportionally hurt the poor due to equity weighting of <b>pollution</b> <b>damages.</b> Moreover, optimal <b>pollution</b> taxes {{should be set}} below the Pigouvian tax if the poor spend a disproportionate fraction of their income on polluting goods. However, if preferences for commodities are of the Gorman (1961) polar form, optimal pollution taxes should follow the first-best rule for the Pigouvian corrective tax even if {{the government wants to}} redistribute income and the poor spend a disproportional part of their income on polluting goods. The often-used quasi-linear, CES and Stone-Geary utility functions all belong to the Gorman polar class. If preferences are Gorman polar, and if pollution taxes are not optimized, Pareto-improving green tax reforms exist that move the pollution tax closer to the Pigouvian tax. Simulations demonstrate that optimal corrective taxes should be Pigouvian if the demand for polluting goods is derived from a LES demand system, but deviate from the Pigouvian taxes if demand for polluting goods demand is derived from a PIGLOG demand system...|$|R
