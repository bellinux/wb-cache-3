25|$|The Shorenstein Company owned Washington Harbour {{for two and}} a half years. In March 2003, it {{sold the}} complex to Broadway Real Estate Partners for $185 million.

Another 75 percent of the space was leased until 2007, and rents were no longer the highest in the area but in line with other downtown properties.

25|$|The {{concession}} contracts fixed a 22 <b>percent</b> <b>annual</b> {{rate of return}} for the private operators. The net profit of Palyja varied between Rupiahs 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. Palyja’s financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rupiahs 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rupiahs 142 billion (USD 16 million). However, these profits {{are based on the}} assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies.|$|E

Twenty-one days later, GM agreed to a very similar contract. GM agreed to close no more plants, institute no more layoffs (so long as sales volumes did not decrease), the same wage and lump-sum package, the same profit sharing arrangement, similar work team and job classification study committees, and establish quality improvement committees in all plants. Both contracts were easily approved by the membership.|$|E

A {{significant portion of the}} traffic consisted of tourists, in part from cruise ships docked in Flåm.

The same year, Breikvam Station became unmanned.
