40|$|Fibroadenoma and <b>phyllodes</b> tumor are fibroepithelial breast tumors. These {{tumors are}} biphasic, i. e. they are {{composed}} of stroma and epithelium. The behavior of fibroadenomas is benign, whereas <b>phyllodes</b> tumors can recur and even metastasize. Classification criteria for both tumors show considerable overlap, though. Further, morphological observations have suggested that fibroadenoma may progress to <b>phyllodes</b> tumor. The aim of this thesis can be summarized as a study of tumorigenesis and progression in fibroepithelial tumors, i. e. progression in fibroadenomas and progression in grade of <b>phyllodes</b> tumors. By a comprehensive study of its histology, we identified several regions of phylloid-like stromal progression in fibroadenomas. We subjected these areas to clonality analysis and demonstrated that they are monoclonal. Further, monoclonal epithelial progression to carcinoma in situ was found in fibroadenomas as well. We therefore demonstrated that fibroadenoma may show both epithelial (to carcinoma) and stromal (to <b>phyllodes</b> tumor) progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying development of fibroepithelial tumors are largely unknown. We showed that, in <b>phyllodes</b> tumors, stromal progression is driven by cell cycle deregulation and EGFR overexpression. In addition, stromal p 53 expression {{turned out to be}} the strongest single prognosticator in <b>phyllodes</b> tumors. In the epithelial component of <b>phyllodes</b> tumors and in fibroadenomas these carcinogenic changes were absent. Deregulation of the cell cycle machinery may lead to loss of genetic integrity. We obtained copy number profiles of fibroepithelial tumors and demonstrated genomic instability in <b>phyllodes</b> tumors, but not in fibroadenomas. Although not related to grade, it seems that genomic instability plays a role in development of <b>phyllodes</b> tumors. Little information is available on the cytokines involved in neovascularization of fibroepithelial tumors. We found that HIF- 1 α expression, a pivotal angiogenic factor, correlates with tumor grade and predicts prognosis in <b>phyllodes</b> tumors. Surprisingly, <b>phyllodes</b> tumor epithelium showed HIF- 1 α expression as well, which most likely reflects relatively distant microvasculature causing mild hypoxia. Although similar quantities of microvessels are found in fibroadenomas as compared to <b>phyllodes</b> tumors, HIF- 1 α does not seem to play a role here. Finally, we compared gene expression profiles of fibroadenomas and <b>phyllodes</b> tumors. We found many novel genes which may contribute to genesis and progression of fibroepithelial tumors. As compared to fibroadenomas, <b>phyllodes</b> tumors showed altered expression of factors involved in transcription, cell adhesion, apoptosis, Wnt signalling, cellular integrity and extracellular matrix degradation. CTAG 1, a gene of unknown function, showed a nearly 50 -fold upregulation in <b>phyllodes</b> tumors which suggests that it may aid diagnostics. In this thesis we demonstrated that benign fibroadenoma may progress to the unpredictable <b>phyllodes</b> tumor. Further, we studied several major carcinogenic phenomena and found important roles for cell cycle deregulation, EGFR overexpression, angiogenic factors and genomic instability in <b>phyllodes</b> tumor genesis and progression. Although fibroadenoma and <b>phyllodes</b> tumor share morphological similarities, both tumors are different molecular entities. This thesis contains no data supportive of an active role of the epithelium in fibroepithelial tumors genesis., as had been suggested previously by some authors...|$|R

50|$|Acacia saligna grows as a small, dense, {{spreading}} {{tree with}} a short trunk and a weeping habit. It grows up to eight metres tall.

40|$|<b>Phyllodes</b> tumors and fibroadenomas are {{the most}} common benign breast tumors. They arise from intralobular fibrous tissue as a unique lesion and after a period of time they {{differentiate}} in two direction: to fibroadenoma and to <b>phyllodes</b> tumors. Fibroadenomas grow up to 2 – 3 cm and then stop growing but <b>phyllodes</b> tumors grow continually and sometimes are to 40 cm big. Both these lesions have two components, epithelial and stromal. Clinically fibroadenomas are well circumscibed, hard, oval, movable lesions. They can be solitary, multiple, unilateral and bilateral. They are hormone dependent changes, because they change their own consistency during menstrual cycle and gravidity. The most commonly used histological classification is in two types: pericanalicular and intracanalicular type. <b>Phyllodes</b> tumors make about 1 % of all breast tumors. This tumor has many synonyms. It starts as fibroadenoma in intralobular stromal component. It has continuous growth and biologically it can be benign, borderline and malignant. The first description is from Miller (1838). The main goal is to find the divergence point when the developing is direct to fibroadenoma or <b>phyllodes</b> tumor. The second goal is to investigate the fate of epithelial and stromal component in these two lesions. Retrospective analysis is made of all fibroadenomas and <b>phyllodes</b> tumors in Pathology Department of Medical Center »Be`anijska kosa« in the period from 1998 to 2006. In this period, 2919 women were operated for breast changes. 343 fibroadenoma (24, 4 %), were diagnosed, benign <b>phyllodes</b> tumor in 95 women (6. 7 %) and malignant <b>phyllodes</b> in 4 cases or 0. 2 %. All slides from these patients were analysed for many different histological parameters and immunohistological investigation for steroid receptors was also used, c-erbB 2 (Her 2 /Neu), PCNA (proliferative cellular nuclear antigen) and Ki- 67, androgen receptor and p 53. All data were statistically investigated (Odds ratio, confidence interval, Fisher exact test, Wilcoxon sum test and Kendall test). It was concluded that fibroadenomas and <b>phyllodes</b> tumors arise from intralobular fibrous tissue, both changes have very close histology in the beginning and divergent growth starts later. Differences are present in stromal component. <b>Phyllodes</b> tumor has two component stroma. Stromal cells in <b>phyllodes</b> tumors are more PCNA positive than in fibroadenomas, also Ki- 67 and androgen receptors are more positive in <b>phyllodes</b> tumors.

40|$|Introduction: Originally {{described}} in 1838 by Muller, <b>phyllodes</b> tumor {{is a rare}} fibroepithelial neoplasm which represents roughly 0. 3 – 0. 9 % of all breast cancers. <b>Phyllodes</b> tumor are divided into benign, borderline and malignant histologic categories. Malignant <b>phyllodes</b> tumor represent anywhere from 10 – 30 % of all <b>phyllodes</b> tumors. This group has both the potential to recur locally and metastasize, however not all malignant <b>phyllodes</b> behave this way. The challenge lays in predicting which tumor will recur locally or metastasize. Distinguishing this subset of malignant <b>phyllodes</b> tumor is paramount. Presentation of case: We present a case of malignant <b>phyllodes</b> which presented with metastatic disease.

The patient initially presented with a large mass which encompassed her whole right breast. On surgical pathology the mass measured roughly 31  cm in diameter and weighed over 10  kg. Within 5 weeks from surgery the patient had suffered brain metastases and also 6 local recurrent tumors. The patient passed roughly 11 weeks after her first visit to our office.
