25|$|In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts {{and his new}} ally, The Undertaker, {{made their}} {{presence}} known by hiding a live snake {{in one of the}} newly married couple's wedding presents; Elizabeth was frightened when she opened the gift box, and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to the Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. Meanwhile, Roberts cut a series of promos berating Savage. The feud began to boil over during a television taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling October 21 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage – who was providing TV commentary – into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm, according to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the <b>Pick</b> <b>Your</b> Poison DVD that the snake was holding on with the fangs and that Jake had a hard time getting the snake off Randy. Sid Justice was originally supposed to be the victim of the snake bite, but due to a biceps injury, Savage accepted to be snake bitten.|$|E

500|$|Biographer Karen Hollinger {{described}} the early 1990s as {{a downturn in}} the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly {{to the lack of}} options available to an actress in her forties. Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, [...] "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to <b>pick</b> <b>your</b> parts with great care." [...] At the Screen Actor's Guild National Women's Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women's work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry. She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle {{cartoonist}} Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the [...] "first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, {{on the advice of}} the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence {{on the part of the}} creative community, saying [...] "No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am", but nevertheless added, [...] "It's tricky.

2500|$|The underage {{depiction}} of Kasumi and a feature in Dead or Alive: Dimensions called Figure Modewhich allows players to capture {{images of the}} characters from all angles and store themwere linked to Nintendo's decision to not sell the game in Sweden, allegedly due to the country's strict child pornography laws. Hearing of the Nordic ban and that Dimensions was being sold in Australia with a PG classification, the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor and the Australian Classification Board re-examined the game and revoked its classification, although Nintendo Australia assured the board that the game contained no material which could be considered child pornography. Upon re-submission, the game was awarded the stronger (but not age-restricted) M classification and was re-released shortly after. The game's cover art, which featured a high-kicking Kasumi, was slightly altered for the United States release. Reports indicating it was done to appease the ESRB appeared, but a Tecmo Koei spokesperson claimed that [...] "this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion.
