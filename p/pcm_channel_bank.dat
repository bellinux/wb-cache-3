50|$|In addition, the {{standard}} specifies that all result bits are inverted before the octet is transmitted. Thus, a silent μ-law encoded <b>PCM</b> <b>channel</b> has the 8 bit samples coded 0xFF instead of 0x00 in the octets.|$|R
50|$|Software mixing is {{available}} allowing {{for up to}} 8 <b>PCM</b> <b>channels</b> through drivers such as PCM8 and Rydeen. Later in the systems life an expansion card, called Mercury Unit, was released that provided stereo 16-bit 44kHz output.|$|R

40|$|A non-maximally {{decimated}} filterbank {{structure for}} pre-equalizing channels with Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) is investigated. The impulse {{response of the}} channel is as-sumed to be known at the transmitter. Compared with the classical Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding technique, the proposed pre-equalizer compensates for the channel without {{increasing the number of}} the received signal lev-els (channel alphabet). The proposed technique does not require the channel to be minimum-phase. The filterbank structure adds redundancy to the input signal to compen-sate for the channel ISI while keeping the transmitted pow-er bounded. The proposed pre-equalization is particularly useful for data transmission over voice-band <b>PCM</b> <b>channels.</b> The up-stream <b>PCM</b> <b>channel</b> is bandlimited, causing severe ISI at the output of the front-end receiver filter. By using the pre-equalizer at the transmitter, channel ISI can be mitigated. ...|$|R

It then continues with enhanced versions of the game's music which utilized stereophonic sound and additional <b>PCM</b> <b>channels.</b> The remainder of the CD features music from the arcade version.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{standard}} specifies that all resulting even bits (LSB is even) are inverted before the octet is transmitted. This {{is to provide}} plenty of 0/1 transitions to facilitate the clock recovery process in the PCM receivers. Thus, a silent A-law encoded <b>PCM</b> <b>channel</b> has the 8 bit samples coded 0xD5 instead of 0x80 in the octets.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the {{high-end}} OPN chips have dedicated ADPCM channels for playing sampled audio, the YM2612 does not. However, its sixth channel {{can act as}} a surrogate <b>PCM</b> <b>channel</b> by means of the 'DAC Enable' register, allowing the chip to play 8-bit PCM sound samples. This replaces (disables) FM output for that <b>channel.</b> <b>PCM</b> data is written to the channel via an 8-bit register. Unlike the other OPNs with ADPCM, the YM2612 does not provide any timing or buffering of samples, so all frequency control and buffering must be done in software by the host processor.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1982 / Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThese hybrid TM {{system design}} {{procedures}} indicate how <b>PCM</b> <b>channel</b> performance comparable with that obtainable from an optimally designed PCM/FM transmission {{system may be}} obtained even though numerous subcarrier channels {{are included in the}} system. Optimal design goals are those that permit satisfactory telemetry system operation with a minimum of transmitted power. By careful control of the transmitter modulation levels and the use of predetection filtering during playback, a lowering of the <b>PCM</b> <b>channel’s</b> threshold, equivalent to at least quadrupling the transmitter power over conventional practices, is obtained. This report briefly discusses the design objectives of FM/FM and PCM/FM systems followed by a more detailed discussion of hybrid systems using FM subcarriers above the PCM signal on the baseband. A simplified, but comprehensive, discussion of FM sidebands is presented in the appendices to aid in understanding the limits and restrictions in this hybrid TM system design procedure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An optical {{synchronization}} {{technique is}} described for the demultiplexer of a wideband optical data transmission system. In this system, the closely spaced optical pulses of interleaved <b>PCM</b> <b>channels</b> are “space sorted ” by a coincidence detection technique using an optical reference waveform {{generated in the}} receiver. For synchronization of the reference waveform with a spatial waveform produced by the received laser beam in the demultiplexer, a number of pulses on these two optical waveforms are coded with a pseudo-random sequence. Acquisition of the coded waveforms for synchronization is indicated in an optical matched filter. For automatic track-ing, a synchronization error-control circuit is added. This communication suggests an optical correlation method for synchronization in an optical data transmission system in which many pulse-code modulated (<b>PCM)</b> <b>channels</b> are time-multiplexed [1 - 31. In the particular type of system discussed here, the sequence of data pulses transmitted during each time frame is derived from one pulse of a mode-locked laser[4]. Each time frame contains pulses used for the acquisition and error control of synchronization {{as well as the}} pulses that are singl...|$|R
50|$|In 1962, {{engineers}} from Bell Labs {{developed the}} first D1 <b>channel</b> <b>banks,</b> which combined 24 digitized voice calls over a four-wire copper trunk between Bell central office analogue switches. A <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> sliced a 1.544 Mbit/s digital signal into 8,000 separate frames, each composed of 24 contiguous bytes. Each byte represented a single telephone call encoded into a {{constant bit rate}} signal of 64 kbit/s. <b>Channel</b> <b>banks</b> used the fixed position (temporal alignment) of one byte in the frame to identify the call it belonged to.|$|R
40|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion {{processes}} {{are controlled by}} numerous factors and as such are both temporally and spatially variable. The significance of <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion to the sediment budget is difficult to quantify without extensive fieldwork/data analysis. In this study, the importance of key physical factors controlling <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion, including <b>channel</b> slope, upstream catchment area, channel confinement, and sinuosity were explored using regression analysis. The resulting analysis {{can be used in}} practical studies to provide a first approximation of bank erosion rates (in catchments similar to those investigated). A dataset of <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion rates covering eight contrasting river catchments across England and Wales, over a time period of up to 150 years was created using a modified GIS methodology. The best predictors were found to upstream area, channel confinement and sinuosity with respect to dimensionless width averaged retreat rates (m m- 1 yr- 1). Notwithstanding these relationships, the results highlight the variability of the magnitude of sediment production by <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion both within and between catchments...|$|R
50|$|Audio can {{be stored}} in either of two forms: 16-bit Linear PCM stereo at 48 kHz {{sampling}} rate (768 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 Mbit/s stereo), or four nonlinear 12-bit <b>PCM</b> <b>channels</b> at 32 kHz sampling rate (384 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 MBit/s for four channels). In addition, the DV specification also supports 16-bit audio at 44.1 kHz (706 kbit/s per channel, 1.4 Mbit/s stereo), the same sampling rate used for CD audio. In practice, the 48 kHz stereo mode is used almost exclusively.|$|R

40|$|Blind {{equalization}} {{has important}} applications to wireless communication and cable HDTV. It {{is known that}} {{the output of the}} <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> has sufficient information for blind identification, and hence also for blind equalization. It may be surprising to find that the composite output of the equalizer bank indeed has sufficient information for blind equalization, though it might not have sufficient for blind identification. Specially, if the zero-mean transmitted signal is temporally uncorrelated and if the <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> has no common nonzero zeros, the equalizer <b>bank</b> equalizes the <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> if, and only if, its composite output is temporally uncorrelated.
