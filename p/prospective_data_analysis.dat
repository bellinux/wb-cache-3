40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} fracture {{patterns in}} bicondylar tibial plateau fractures {{and their impact}} on treatment strategy. DESIGN: <b>Prospective</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> with documentation of initial injury and treatment strategy, computed tomography scans, conventional x-rays, long-term evaluation of radiographs, and functional assessments. SETTING: Level 1 regional trauma center. PATIENTS: Prospective data acquisition of 14 consecutive patients (10 male and 4 female) with a bicondylar tibial plateau fracture (AO Type C). INTERVENTION: Application of a stepwise reconstruction strategy of the tibial plateau starting with the reposition and fixation of the posteromedial split fragment using a 3. 5 buttress plate, followed by reposition and grafting of the lateral compartment and lateral fixation with a 3. 5 plate in 90 degree to the medial fixation device. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: All patients were evaluated with full-length standing film, standardized x-rays, Lysholm score for functional assessment, and patient's self-appraisal. RESULTS: Most of the complex bicondylar fractures follow a regular pattern in that the medial compartment is split in a mediolateral direction with a posteromedial main fragment, combined with various amounts of multifragmental lateral compartment depression. The technique introduced allows for accurate and stable reduction and fixation of this fracture type. The final Lysholm knee score showed an average of 83. 5 points (range: 64. 5 - 92). CONCLUSIONS: Complex bicondylar tibial plateau fractures follow a regular pattern, which is not represented in existing 2 -dimensional fracture classifications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This is a {{recommended}} management algorithm {{from the}} Western Trauma Association addressing the diagnostic evaluation {{and management of}} esophageal injuries in adult patients. Because there is a paucity of published prospective randomized clinical trials that have generated Class I data, the recommendations herein are based primarily on published observational studies and expert opinion of Western Trauma Association members. The algorithms and accompanying comments represent a safe and sensible approach that can be followed at most trauma centers. We recognize {{that there will be}} patient, personnel, institutional, and situational factors that may warrant or require deviation from the recommended algorithm. We encourage institutions to use this guideline to formulate their own local protocols. The algorithm contains letters at decision points; the corresponding paragraphs in the text elaborate on the thought process and cite pertinent literature. The annotated algorithm is intended to (a) serve as a quick bedside reference for clinicians; (b) foster more detailed patient care protocols that will allow for <b>prospective</b> <b>data</b> collection and <b>analysis</b> to identify best practices; and (c) generate research projects to answer specific questions concerning decision making in the management of adults with esophageal injuries...|$|R

40|$|Background : Minimally {{invasive}} parathyroidectomy (MIP) {{is widely}} used worldwide {{for the treatment of}} primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). It is usually combined with a perioperative adjunct for high success rate. Aim : To demonstrate that MIP can be successfully performed in a selected group of patients with presumabally solitary adenoma as the cause of pHPT without using any perioperative adjuncts. Settings and Design : A <b>prospective</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> of two surgeons&#x 2032; series from a teaching hospital in Turkey. Materials and Methods : Of the 47 patients referred with a diagnosis of pHPT during January 2004 -May 2008, 30 (63 &#x 0025;) patients with sporadic pHPT with presumed solitary adenoma were included for analysis. These patients underwent MIP via focused lateral (n = 24) or anterior (n = 6) approach. Preoperative localization was done using 99 mTc-labelled sestamibi scan and ultrasonography. Only patients with concordant tests for single adenoma were selected for MIP. Serum parathyroid hormone and calcium levels were measured postoperatively and at follow-up visits. Statistical Analysis : Parametric data presented were analyzed with Excel XP (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Results : Barring one patient, all other patients were initially biochemically cured by MIP. One patient remained hypercalcemic, who was found to have a second adenoma at the second operation. During a mean follow-up of 16 (3 - 55) months, all patients were normocalcemic with a mean serum calcium level of 9. 4 (8. 9 - 10. 2) mg/dl. Parathormone levels were persistantly elevated only in one patient (3. 4 &#x 0025;). No postoperative permanent complication was encountered.

The {{aim of this}} prospective study is to investigate the incidence of right-sided (non-appendiceal) colonic tumors in patients presenting with clinical features of acute appendicitis. MethodsA <b>prospective</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> of 1662 patients using appendectomy database was performed from 2005 to 2011. Patients above age 40 years or older were included. Patients were compared for demographic data, clinical presentation, radiological findings, operative technique & findings, histo-pathological findings and postoperative complications. The primary outcome was incidence of right-sided colonic (non-appendiceal) tumors presenting with features of acute appendicitis. Secondary outcomes measured were, role of diagnostic radiology, negative appendectomy rate, length of stay and changing trends in operative techniques. ResultsFrom 1662 patients initially reviewed, only 179 patients (10. 77 %) age 40 years or above mean (56  ±  11. 75), median 54 (40 – 89), with clinical features of acute appendicitis {{were included in the}} final analysis. F:M ratio was (1 : 1. 06). CT scan showed in only 1 patient (1. 25 %, OR =  0. 806, p =  0. 695), suspicion of cecal tumor and underwent right hemicolectomy. Histological examination of specimen showed, 2 patients (1. 11 %, OR =  1. 10, p =  0. 47) had primary appendiceal tumors, in which one patient was histologically reported as appendiceal mucocele (mucinous cystadenoma with low-grade dysplasia), while the other one had appendeceal carcinoid (Goblet cell carcinoid).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{assessing}} {{quality of}} care in developing countries, retrospectively collected data are usually used given their availability. Retrospective data however suffer from such biases as recall bias and non-response bias. Comparing results obtained using prospectively and retrospectively collected data will help validate {{the use of the}} easily available retrospective data in assessing {{quality of care}} in past and future studies. METHODS: Prospective and retrospective datasets were obtained from a cluster randomized trial of a multifaceted intervention aimed at improving paediatric inpatient care conducted in eight rural Kenyan district hospitals by improving management of children admitted with pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea and/or dehydration. Four hospitals received a full intervention and four a partial intervention. Data were collected through 3 two weeks surveys conducted at baseline, after 6 and 18 months. Retrospective data was sampled from paediatric medical records of patients discharged in the preceding six months of the survey while prospective data was collected from patients discharged during the two week period of each survey. Risk Differences during post-intervention period of 16 quality of care indicators were analyzed separately for prospective and retrospective datasets and later plotted side by side for comparison. RESULTS: For the prospective data there was strong evidence of an intervention effect for 8 of the indicators and weaker evidence of an effect for one indicator, with magnitude of effect sizes varying from 23 % to 60 % difference. For the retrospective data, 10 process (these include the 8 indicators found to be statistically significant in <b>prospective</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysis)</b> indicators had statistically significant differences with magnitude of effects varying from 10 % to 42 %. The bar-graph comparing results from the prospective and retrospective datasets showed similarity in terms of magnitude of effects and statistical significance for all except two indicators. CONCLUSION: Multifaceted interventions can help improve adoption of clinical guidelines and hence improve the quality of care. The similar inference reached after analyses based on prospective assessment of case management is a useful finding as it supports the utility of work based on examination of retrospectively assembled case records allowing longer time periods to be studied while constraining costs.

A {{low level of}} sow retention in the herd is a cause for both economic as well as welfare concerns. The {{results of the study}} confirmed that a low lactation feed intake, incidence of lameness or health problems, as well as sow-level characteristics such as higher parity and fewer piglets born alive per litter may adversely affect sow longevity. Sows retained with periparturient health problems had reduced longevity and fewer live-born piglets, and fewer such sows had another farrowing. A <b>prospective</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> indicated that the overall performance of lame sows {{in terms of the number}} of pigs born alive during the period of the study was less, compared with that for non-lame sows. Retaining sows with less severe lameness may enable the producer to meet immediate production targets. The findings suggest that sow removal decisions should be judiciously evaluated after farrowing considering the potential long-term losses. Lameness in swine herds should be minimized and if treatment is not an option lame sows should be culled as soon as possible to reduce long-term losses. The results also confirmed the high prevalence of claw lesions in breeding female pigs and their association with lameness, specifically, white line and side wall lesions. The results indicate the possibility of nutritional intervention in minimizing claw lesions. However, there are other factors associated with claw lesion development in pigs. The quality of the floor as well as different bio-mechanical factors operating in lesion development are important here. The space between slats, roughness of the surface, and edge design are critical in claw lesion development. Those factors have not been addressed in this study. Further studies are required to understand the mechanism of lesion development in relation to the housing and management systems in place. This information is vital in formulating the appropriate intervention strategy to minimize the incidence of lameness and to improve sow longevity and performance. The studies in this thesis included data from single herds and therefore the generalization of the results may be restricted owing to the wide variations in management, housing and in genetic lines of sows...|$|E

Introduction: The commonly advocated tools for self report outcome measurement of cervical disability are the NDI (Neck Disability Index) and FRI (Functional Rater Index). They have established psychometric properties but their clinical utility is criticised due to time requirements and errors in both completion and scoring. The Spinal Disability Questionnaire (SDQ) was developed to improve these characteristics. Methods: Subjects from a sample of convenience were recruited through four physiotherapy practices. Inclusion criteria were neck pain with or without limb pain or headache and there was no duration limit (n = 71). Development methodology, peer review and sample testing gave logic and content validity while head-to-head comparison provided construct and criterion validity. Subgroups provided test-retest reliability, responsiveness and change score through <b>prospective</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> (n = 46). Results: Pilot data demonstrated sound psychometric properties for the SDQ with test-retest reliability (ICC = 0. 89) and Internal Consistency (CA = 0. 89). Error range (MDC 90 = 16. 3 %) and responsiveness (SRM = 1. 132) were both preferable to the concurrent scores of the FRI and NDI and criterion correlation was established between all tools (r > 0. 75). The SDQ’s practical clinical utility and characteristics of completion and scoring times and reduced user error were preferable as was distribution range. Conclusions: The SDQ is a viable outcome tool for determination of cervical disability in a clinical setting.

Methods. <b>Prospective</b> <b>data</b> collection and <b>analysis</b> of octogenarians having liver resection between 1999 and 2004. Retrospective detailed case note analysis was performed to determine peri-operative mortality and morbidity. Comparison were made to other large series of liver resection in younger patient cohorts. The primary outcome measure was 30 day mortality and secondarily a detailed analysis of post-operative complications was performed. Results. A total 15 octogenarians (median age 82) were identified from the database. Ther was 1 peri-operative mortality. The remaining patients were all alive at 1, 3 and 6 month follow-ups with a median follow-up of 18 months. The commonest indication for liver resection was metastatic colorectal cancer (n= 1).

They share overlapping clinical and histopathologic findings. The {{goal of this}} dissertation has been to fmd reliably distinguishing features between these two conditions. Toward this goal, three different studies were conducted. Study 1 was a retrospective cross-sectional data analytic review of histologic features from patients identified by diagnosis of LPP or CCCA. Horizontal sections at level of the infundibulum, isthmus and inferior from scalp biopsies of 24 patients (19 CCCA and 5 LPP) were analyzed. The findings of unaffected follicular units, retained sebaceous glands and mild perifollicular inflammation were found to favor the diagnosis of CCCA. Dilated eccrine glands and heavy perifollicular inflammation were found to favor the diagnosis of LPP. Study 2 was a <b>prospective</b> cross-sectional <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> study designed to identify and compare direct immunohistochemical findings in patients with LPP or CCCA. Vertical frozen sections of scalp biopsies from eleven patients (4 CCCA and 7 LPP) were stained with IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3 and fibrinogen. No DIF finding that reliably distinguishes LPP from CCCA was found. The presence of a positive DIF was significantly correlated {{with the amount of}} inflammation. Study 3 investigated and compared T lymphocyte subsets, including T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, Th 17 lymphocytes and regulatory T cells between LPP and CCCA cases. Subjects in this study were identical to study 2. There were no significantly distinctive T lymphocyte populations that differentiate between CCCA and LPP. There were higher numbers and percentages of CD 8 positive cells in LPP compared to CCCA. The CD 4 :CD 8 ratios were decreased in LPP and increased with duration of disease approaching proportions found in the normal hair follicle and CCCA. There were higher CD 1 a:CD 3 ratios in LPP compared to CCCA. The CD 1 a:CD 3 ratios in LPP decrease over time, approaching those found in CCCA.
