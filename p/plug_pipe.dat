Locations for future operations at ORNL include the South and North Tank Farms and various Federal Facilities Agreement tanks. The goal of this report is to identify future needs for development of remote tools and systems to isolate inactive waste storage tanks. Remote tools have been developed to support waste-retrieval and tank-isolation operations at the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAATs) at ORNL. The tools developed for in-tank remote operations include a pipe-cutting tool (a modified band saw), a pipe-cleaning tool (a modified drill with a wire brush), and a <b>pipe</b> <b>plug.</b> A review of the planned future operations revealed several desirable modifications to improve the efficiency, operability, and flexibility of the existing tank-isolation tools. For example, the pipe-cutting tool needs improvements to provide better alignment, a blade-cutting-release device, improved tire replacement, sensors to prevent operation of the saw when the blade stops, blade speed controls, and force feedback sensors. In addition, the need to test the existing <b>pipe</b> <b>plug</b> for use on corroded piping was identified. The <b>pipe</b> <b>plug</b> has been used on only relatively clean in-tank stainless steel (SS) piping to date. However, there may be a need later to use the plug on corroded SS and other types of pipes. Improvements to the <b>pipe</b> <b>plug</b> for use on flush wall pipes and small-diameter openings in tanks are also desirable. Besides tank isolation, those performing tank closures may need to use cutting and capping equipment on buried pipes. The current cutting and capping equipment may have to be modified for deployment systems other than the Modified Light Duty Utility Arm, for which they were initially designed. Improved cutting and other remote systems may also be needed to dispose of contaminated equipment and tank shells. These requirements will be defined jointly by the U. S. Department of Energy, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the state of Tennessee as part of the overall remedial decision for the ORNL Bethel Valley area...|$|R

30|$|The {{phenomenon}} is well-known, but {{little is known}} about the mechanism of soil <b>plug</b> formation inside <b>pipe</b> piles, especially for the sleeve driven by vibratory hammers. The formation of a soil plug depends upon a number of factors, e.g. installation method, pile diameter, penetration depth, soil density, whereas the investigation on the influencing factors are still not complete. A lot of researches were conducted to evaluate the soil <b>plugging</b> effect during <b>pipe</b> pile driving. Based on the principle of static equilibrium, Randolph et al. (1991) developed the concept of active height of soil plug and established the one-dimensional static equilibrium equation. Holeyman et al. (2013) presented another analytic expression of the shaft resistance of vibratory driven pile taking account of the soil damping. The limitation of the 1  g model test (O’Neill and Raines 1991) is the same with that of the soil samples under low stress, therefore, the ideal stress condition required by the investigation of the soil plug can be achieved by the use of the geotechnical centrifuge. Nicola and Randolph (1997) analyzed the behavior of soil <b>plug</b> during <b>pipe</b> pile driving by model tests. It was found that the height of soil plug decreased with the increase in the relative compactness of the sands during pile jacking, but increased with the relative compactness of the sands during impact pile driving. Experimental studies of Xing et al. (2012) indicated that the height of soil <b>plug</b> inside impact-driven <b>pipe</b> pile increased as the pipe wall thickness decreased. The distribution of the shaft resistance was nonlinear along the pile length, and depended on the impact force and soil conditions. Tan and Lin (2013) found that the soil plug developed from partially plugged mode in the upper soft cohesive soils into fully plugged mode in the underlying medium dense to dense cohesionless soil layers, and the external shaft resistance was about two-thirds of shaft resistance through a series of steel pipe pile static penetration tests. Liyanapathirana et al. (2000) analyzed the behavior of the soil plug during impact pile driving with Eulerian finite element method, and their researches showed that the degree of soil plug inside the sleeve developed from unplugged mode to partially plugged mode. Thongmunee et al. (2011) analyzed the mechanism and influence of soil plugging bearing capacity performance by discrete element method, and their simulated results were consistent with the experimentation results.|$|R
40|$|Remediation {{of highly}} {{radioactive}} waste {{is a major}} technical and programmatic challenge for the DOE. Rapid, on-line physical characterization of highly concentrated slurries {{is required for the}} safe and efficient remediation of 90 million gallons of high level radioactive waste (HLW), sodium bearing waste, and mixed waste. The research presented here, describes a collaborative effort between Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and the University of Washington (UW) to directly address the need for rapid on-line characterization of the physical properties of HLW slurries during all phases of the remediation process, from in-tank characterization of sediments to monitoring of the concentration, particle size, and degree of agglomeration and gelation of slurries during transport. Near-surface characterization of the slurry flow in the particle size range from nanometer to micrometer is examined using optical low coherence reflectometry. Volumetric characterization at depths in the slurry flow, up to several centimeters in the particle size range from the micrometer to millimeter, is realized by utilizing ultrasonic backscatter and diffuses fields. One of the strengths, the teaming up of significant talents in both experimental and theoretical optics and in ultrasonics, provides a synergistic approach to integrate these complimentary techniques. One of the benefits of this combined approach is the physical characterization of HLW over a concentration and particle size range that is broader than can be achieved with today's technology. This will avoid a costly increase in waste stream volume due to excess dilution, and will lessen chance of <b>plugging</b> <b>pipes</b> that could shut down expensive processing lines...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of preparation and characterization of chemical plugs based on selected Hanford Site waste simulants. Included are the results of chemical plug bench testing conducted in support of the M 1 /M 6 Flow Loop Chemical Plugging/Unplugging Test (TP-RPP-WTP- 495 Rev A). These results support the proposed plug simulants for the chemical plugging/ unplugging tests. Based on the available simulant data, a set of simulants was identified that would likely result in chemical plugs. The three types of chemical plugs that were generated and tested in this task consisted of: 1. Aluminum hydroxide (NAH), 2. Sodium aluminosilicate (NAS), and 3. Sodium aluminum phosphate (NAP). While both solvents, namely 2 molar (2 M) nitric acid (HNO 3) and 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 60 °C, used in these tests were effective in dissolving the chemical plugs, the 2 M nitric acid was significantly more effective in dissolving the NAH and NAS plugs. The caustic was only slightly more effecting at dissolving the NAP plug. In the bench-scale dissolution tests, hot (60 °C) 2 M nitric acid was the most effective solvent in that it completely dissolved both NAH and NAS chemical plugs much faster (1. 5 – 2 x) than 2 M sodium hydroxide. So unless there are operational benefits for the use of caustic verses nitric acid, 2 M nitric acid heated to 60 °C C should be the solvent of choice for dissolving these chemical plugs. Flow-loop testing was planned to identify a combination of parameters such as pressure, flush solution, composition, and temperature that would effectively dissolve and flush each type of chemical plug from preformed chemical plugs in 3 -inch-diameter and 4 -feet-long pipe sections. However, based on a review {{of the results of the}} bench-top tests and technical discussions, the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Research and Technology (R&T), Engineering and Mechanical Systems (EMS), and Operations concluded that flow-loop testing of the chemically <b>plugged</b> <b>pipe</b> sections would not provide any additional information or useful data. The decision was communicated through a Sub Contract Change Notice (SCN- 070) that included a revised scope as follows: • Photographing the chemical <b>plugs</b> in the <b>pipes</b> before extrusion to compare the morphology of aged gels with that of fresh gels. • Setting up an extrusion apparatus and extruding the chemical plugs. • Documenting the qualitative observations on the efforts to remove the chemical plug materials from the pipe sections. • Performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of extruded gel samples to detect any crystallization of gel during storage. • Disposing of the extruded gel as a waste. • Documenting the analytical results in a test report. There were no significant morphological differences between the fresh and aged plugs except for an overgrowth of small transparent crystals on the surface of the aged NAS gel plug. An initial pressure of 15 KPa for the NAS plug and from ~ 2 to 6 KPa for the NAH plug. Following extrusion, the NAP plug sections were thixotropic. The bulk of all the aged gel plugs consisted of amorphous material with nitratine constituting the crystalline phase.

40|$|Summary: This work {{is focused}} on the {{evaluation}} of the performance of a small-scale inflatable, or plug, placed in a confined space provided by a circular rigid pipe as a way to contain the propagation of floods. The rigid pipe is a simplified and scaled approximation of an actual tunnel section. The evaluations were conducted using an inflatable plug made of a single layer of coated Vectran ® fabric. Friction coefficients of the system were calculated for three different materials lining the pipe so a comparison could be made. These friction coefficients were also compared to laboratory friction machine testing of the same lining materials. This comparison showed that the friction coefficients of the pipe-plug system were lower than the laboratory friction machine tests. Rates of water leakage around the plug were also studied. The leakage rates were recorded for several different plug pressures while varying the tunnel pressure accordingly. It was observed that as pressure differential decreased between the <b>plug</b> and <b>pipe,</b> the leakage rate increased.

These typically involved installation of free-flowing mufflers, which if at a legal noise level still allowed low frequency sounds to pass, giving a characteristic rumbling dual exhaust sound to these systems. In the 1950s shortcut exhaust outlets with manually removed covers were added to street machines in emulation of vehicles intended for high speed straight line racing on dry lake beds, typically located just behind the front wheel, although chromed external runners sometimes extended to just forward of the rear wheel.

40|$|Besides {{producing}} a carbon-neutral gas suitable for several applications, gasification of biomass in fluidized beds also {{leads to the}} formation of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (tars). When condensing the gas, tars are <b>plugging</b> <b>pipes</b> and other process equipment which increases the need of high-cost gas cleaning systems. The aim of this thesis was to improve the understanding of how tar compounds can be decomposed by using catalytically active bed materials. Earlier studies concluded a significant increase of reactivity by using bed material with outer layers rich in calcium. In this study, several materials with outer calcium-enriched layers were compared with fresh, non-coated, materials. The materials catalytic performances were investigated in a fluidized bed lab-scale reactor by applying two reactions; water-gas shift and steam reforming of a model tar compound. The materials investigated in the water-gas shift reaction were two fresh samples and five coated samples. The fresh samples were silatherm (aluminosilicate) and k feldspar (potassium aluminum silicate), and the coated materials were three samples of quartz sand and two samples of impurities. The quartz sand samples were gathered from different fluidized bed combustion plants while the impurities samples were gathered from one fluidized bed gasification plant and further separated from olivine particles. 1 H-indene was used as model tar compound in the steam reforming reaction, where four bed material samples with varying calcium-layer thickness were investigated. From the experiments with water-gas shift reaction the catalytic enhancement was proved by using calcium-enriched materials. Similar gas compositions could be measured for two of the three quartz sand samples. The third sample showed a lower catalytic activity due to a thinner outer layer of calcium. The two samples of impurities showed the highest catalytic activity of all investigated materials. At a temperature of 850 °C the maximum carbon conversion was 42 % for one of the impurities samples. At the same temperature the corresponding CO conversion for k-feldspar was 0, 6 %. Silatherm had a slightly increased CO conversion compared to k-feldspar, but the catalytic performances of the fresh materials are significantly lower compared to the coated materials. In the steam reforming reaction, 98, 9 % of 1 H-indene were decomposed in the reaction when a calcium oxide was used as bed material. In contrary, 0 % of 1 H-indene was decomposed when feldspar was used. From the experimental results it can be concluded that the materials coated with outer layers rich in calcium had excellent catalytic performance compared to the fresh materials. Although further investigations must be conducted, it can be confirmed that calcium is a component which significantly increases the decomposition of tars in fluidized bed gasification processes.
