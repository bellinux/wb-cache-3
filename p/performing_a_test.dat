The train was {{eventually}} brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the weight distribution on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E

The test flight was the aircraft's first powered flight in nine months, and was to include the first flight testing of a new, more powerful and steadier-thrust hybrid rocket engine whose fuel grain was composed of nylon instead of rubber. The flight was the aircraft's 55th, and its 35th free flight. VSS Enterprise was piloted by Peter Siebold and Michael Alsbury.|$|E
2500|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to tattoo pigments, while uncommon, {{are most often}} seen with red, yellow, and occasionally white. [...] Reactions can be triggered by exposure to sunlight. People who are sensitive or allergic to certain metals may react to pigments in the skin with swelling and/or itching, and/or oozing of clear fluid called serum. Such reactions are quite rare, however, and some artists will recommend <b>performing</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> patch. Because the mercury and Azo-chemicals in red dyes are more commonly allergenic than other pigments, allergic reactions are most often seen in red tattoos. [...] Less frequent allergic {{reactions to}} black, purple, and green pigments have also been noted.|$|E

It is also used in challenge tests with allergen when nasal patency is measured before and after application of allergen onto the nasal mucosa. Increased resistance on rhinomanometry after allergen application is an objective mean in proving allergy to airborne allergens when other allergy tests fail.|$|E
