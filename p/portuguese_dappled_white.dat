50|$|Euchloe crameri, {{the western}} <b>dappled</b> <b>white,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Pieridae family. Its range is mainly western southern Europe, being usually found in Portugal, Spain, France and North Africa {{but it has}} been seen as far east as Italy.|$|R
50|$|Euchloe is a genus of pierid {{butterflies}} {{from the}} orangetip tribe (Anthocharini). They are Holarctic in distribution, with most species in Europe, Central Asia, and North America. Like other Anthocharini, the American species are usually called marbles; the Old World species {{are known as}} <b>dappled</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|R
50|$|Euchloe simplonia, the {{mountain}} <b>dappled</b> <b>white,</b> is a butterfly found in {{the mountain}}ous regions of Western Europe and Northern Africa. Its main foods are Sinapis, Isatis, Aethionema, Iberis and Biscutella species. Though data are lacking, {{it is believed that}} the species is restricted to a small area of the western Alps and is endangered in Europe. The species is closely related to Euchloe naina, and cross-breeding experiments suggest that E. nania may be a subspecies, though this is contested on morphological grounds.|$|R
5000|$|Gray or grey is a coat {{color of}} horses {{characterized}} by progressive silvering of the colored hairs of the coat. Most gray horses have black skin and dark eyes; unlike many depigmentation genes, gray {{does not affect}} skin or eye color. Their adult hair coat is <b>white,</b> <b>dappled,</b> or <b>white</b> intermingled with hairs of other colors. Gray horses may be born any base color, depending on other color genes present. White hairs begin to appear at or shortly after birth and become progressively lighter as the horse ages. Graying can occur at different ratesâ€”very quickly on one horse and very slowly on another.|$|R
60|$|The prairie {{was bright}} with sunshine, and the boisterous west wind {{was cut off}} by a bluff where Harding sat amid a litter of {{dismantled}} machinery. Behind him the newly opened birch leaves showed specks of glowing green, and a jack-rabbit, which had put off its winter coat and was now <b>dappled</b> <b>white</b> and gray, fed quietly, with a watchful eye turned toward the unconscious man; in front, the vast sweep of grass that flashed with a silvery gleam as it bowed to the wind was broken by the warm chocolate hue of a broad strip of plowing. The rows of clods, with their polished faces, stretched across the foreground; and on their outer edge Devine, dressed in overalls {{the color of the}} soil, drove a team of big, red oxen.|$|R
5000|$|The Book of Zechariah twice {{mentions}} coloured horses; in {{the first}} passage there are three colours (red, <b>dappled,</b> and <b>white),</b> {{and in the second}} there are four teams of horses (red, black, <b>white,</b> and finally <b>dappled)</b> pulling chariots. The second set of horses are referred to as [...] "the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing {{in the presence of the}} Lord of the whole world." [...] They are described as patrolling the earth and keeping it peaceful.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coloring}} and marking variations are infinite, of course, {{and include}} all the variations found among actual horses. Breyer also releases models in more unrealistic colors - [...] "decorator models". The original four decorator colors were produced in the 1960s : Wedgwood (light blue with white mane and tail, intended to suggest the colors of Wedgwood china), Copenhagen (<b>dappled</b> blue with <b>white</b> mane and tail), Florentine (<b>dappled</b> gold with <b>white</b> mane and tail), and Gold Charm (solid gold body with white mane and tail). A woodgrain finish was also produced. Later Breyer introduced a [...] "bronze" [...] finish and more recently [...] "silver filigree" [...] which is basically silver Florentine. The original four decorator colors are still occasionally used in limited run editions but the original decorators are now highly sought after by collectors. Several more recent decorator models have scenes and images painted on them, especially those done in the Halloween line, and a few have been cast in a translucent form of cellulose acetate to look like blown glass, known as [...] "clearware". The company recently introduced a metallic [...] "two-color" [...] paint with a very flashy effect. Models painted with this paint are typically limited edition.|$|R
50|$|Silver Swallow is a {{thoroughbred}} race horse by Alphabet Soup (Cozzene) out of Topsom (Red Ransom) who {{is known}} for her coat coloration, a nearly <b>white</b> <b>dappled</b> grey, as well as her repeated second-place finishes in several prominent stakes races in the Southern California racing circuit. Bred by Robert L Dodd and foaled in Florida on April 14, 2004, Silver Swallow was purchased at the Keeneland September 2005 Auction for $55,000. She is currently co-owned by Irwin Molasky and trainer Bruce Headley.|$|R

There are also Boot Heads, <b>Dappled</b> Eggs, Great <b>Whites,</b> Black Stones, Married Couples, Spotted Dog Eyes, and more names than I can count on my fingers, some that only a real enthusiast can identify.

50|$|The {{bateleur}} is a colourful {{species with}} a very short tail (ecaudatus is Latin for tailless) which, together with its white underwing coverts, makes it unmistakable in flight. The tail is so small the bird's legs protrude slightly beyond the tail during flight. The bateleur is sexually dimorphic; both adults have black plumage, a chestnut mantle and tail, grey shoulders, tawny wing coverts, and red facial skin, bill and legs. The female additionally has tawny secondary wing feathers. Less commonly, the mantle may be white. Immature birds are brown with <b>white</b> <b>dappling</b> and have greenish facial skin. It takes them {{seven or eight years}} to reach full maturity.|$|R
60|$|The {{spring was}} {{pleasant}} there. It {{was a day}} upon which one felt it good merely to live. The young green of the trees was exquisite against the sky; and the sky, pale and blue, was <b>dappled</b> with little <b>white</b> clouds. At {{the end of the}} ornamental water was the gray mass of the Horse Guards. The ordered elegance of the scene had the charm of an eighteenth-century picture. It reminded you not of Watteau, whose landscapes are so idyllic that they recall only the woodland glens seen in dreams, but of the more prosaic Jean-Baptiste Pater. Philip's heart was filled with lightness. He realised, what he had only read before, that art (for there was art {{in the manner in which}} he looked upon nature) might liberate the soul from pain.|$|R
60|$|When the khans and chieftains {{began to}} assemble, there came first {{the sons of}} the king, {{returning}} from the various expeditions on which their father had sent them, and bringing with them magnificent presents. These presents, of course, consisted of the treasures and other valuables which they had taken in plunder from the various cities which had fallen into their hands. The presents which Jughi brought exceeded in value those of all the others. Among the rest, there was a herd of horses one hundred thousand in number. These horses had, of course, been seized in the pastures of the conquered countries, and were now brought to the emperor to be used by him in mounting his troops. They were arrayed in bands according to the color, <b>white,</b> <b>dappled</b> gray, bay, black, and spotted, of each kind an equal number.|$|R
5000|$|Eyeless white hamsters, genetically WhWh, {{occur when}} 2 hamsters are bred that carry the White Bellied Gene (Wh). White bellied is a {{specific}} gene {{and should not be}} confused with hamsters which have white fur on their bellies ie white banded hamsters (Baba or BaBa), dominant spotted hamsters, (Dsds) or recessive <b>dapples</b> (rdrd). Eyeless <b>white</b> hamsters are more correctly called Anophthalmic whites and can survive well in spite of this. Hamsters don't rely on their eyesight as much as other mammals. They live below ground during the day and are active at twilight and near dawn so it doesn't affect them much. The hamster relies heavily on scent and the detection of vibrations, as well as sound to some extent. Despite the fact Hamsters can live easily with this mutation, it is a mutation that should never be produced.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My hope, my heaven, {{my trust}} must be, [...] My gentle guide, in {{following}} thee!'-- [...] He crossed the threshold,--and a clang [...] Of angry steel that instant rang. [...] To his bold brow his spirit rushed, [...] But soon for vain alarm he blushed [...] When {{on the floor}} he saw displayed, [...] Cause of the din, a naked blade [...] Dropped from the sheath, that careless flung [...] Upon a stag's huge antlers swung; [...] For all around, the walls to grace, [...] Hung trophies of the fight or chase: [...] A target there, a bugle here, [...] A battle-axe, a hunting-spear, [...] And broadswords, bows, and arrows store, [...] With the tusked trophies of the boar. [...] Here grins the wolf as when he died, [...] And there the wild-cat's brindled hide [...] The frontlet of the elk adorns, [...] Or mantles o'er the bison's horns; [...] Pennons and flags defaced and stained, [...] That blackening streaks of blood retained, [...] And deer-skins, <b>dappled,</b> dun, and <b>white,</b> [...] With otter's fur and seal's unite, [...] In rude and uncouth tapestry all, [...] To garnish forth the sylvan hall.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course it}} is hard for me now to say how much I saw at that time, because my {{impressions}} were corrected by subsequent observation. First of all impressions was its enormous size; the girth of its body was some fourscore feet, its length perhaps two hundred. Its sides rose and fell with its laboured breathing. I perceived that its gigantic, flabby body lay along the ground, and that its skin was of a corrugated <b>white,</b> <b>dappling</b> into blackness along the backbone. But of its feet we saw nothing. I think also that we saw then the profile at least of the almost brainless head, with its fat-encumbered neck, its slobbering omnivorous mouth, its little nostrils, and tight shut eyes. (For the mooncalf invariably shuts its eyes {{in the presence of the}} sun.) We had a glimpse of a vast red pit as it opened its mouth to bleat and bellow again; we had a breath from the pit, and then the monster heeled over like a ship, dragged forward along the ground, creasing all its leathery skin, rolled again, and so wallowed past us, smashing a path amidst the scrub, and was speedily hidden from our eyes by the dense interlacings beyond. Another appeared more distantly, and then another, and then, as though he was guiding these animated lumps of provender to their pasture, a Selenite came momentarily into ken. My grip upon Cavor's foot became convulsive at the sight of him, and we remained motionless and peering long after he had passed out of our range.|$|R
2500|$|The Luncheon on the Grass is the {{greatest}} work of Ã‰douard Manet, {{one in which he}} realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. [...] We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. [...] There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. [...] This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. [...] My God! [...] What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! [...] That has never been seen. [...] And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. [...] But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. [...] The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. [...] Painters, especially Ã‰douard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. [...] Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. [...] That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable <b>dapple</b> of <b>white</b> in the milieu of green leaves. [...] It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.|$|R
