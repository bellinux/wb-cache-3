Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure (atlante) at the base, holding the weight on its shoulders. On each <b>pillar</b> <b>stand</b> statues of Adam and Eve– Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis, depicting the Fall of Man. Two are of Adam and Eve; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil.

5000|$|They are {{the tallest}} {{standing}} stones in Wales, nearly [...] In 1723 Henry Rowlands described them {{as part of}} a ruinous circle of eight stones, some [...] across. An account of 1797 says that [...] "ignorant country people supposing money was hid under them tore them up" [...] and today only two stones, one slab and one <b>pillar,</b> <b>stand</b> in a modern field bank. Nothing else is visible on the ground, but a 2008 excavation found three pits of standing stones, two containing stone stumps, consistent with the record by Rowlands. Further excavations in 2010 identified the pits of three more removed standing stones, making seven identified in all of the eight expected to make up the original circle.|$|E
