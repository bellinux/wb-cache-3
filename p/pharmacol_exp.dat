40|$|Variation in the {{formation}} and disposition of the hydroxylamine of (SMX-HA) is thought {{to play an important}} role in the pathogenesis of sulfamethoxazole(SMX) -induced idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. We hypothesized that, in analogy to carcinogenic arylamines, SMX-HA might be further converted to an electrophilic N-acetoxy metabolite which could play a role in mediating SMX toxicity. Accordingly, we chemically synthesized N-acetoxy-SMX, and examined the characteristics of its formation, metabolism, cytotoxicity and mutagenicity in human and bacterial test systems. The human arylamine N-acetyltransferases, (NAT) 1 and NAT 2, were capable of converting SMX-HA to N-acetoxy-SMX. NAT 1 and NAT 2 possessed similar affinities for SMX-HA (apparent K-m values of 650 and 520 mu M, respectively), but the apparent maximal velocity of the NAT 1 -mediated acetylation was higher than that of NAT 2. (1332 vs. 37 nmol/min/U of immunoreactive NAT protein). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 12, 000 x g supernatant fractions converted N-acetoxy-SMX mainly back to SMX-HA, and also to a lesser extent to SMX, at clinically relevant concentrations. Similar pathways were observed in human hepatic cytosolic fractions. In a cytotoxicity assay, N-acetoxy-SMX was significantly more toxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells than SMX-HA (16. 6 vs. 11. 5 % dead cells at a concentration of 300 mu M). N-acetoxy-SMX was weakly mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 strain in the Ames test. These data suggest that the N-acetoxy metabolites of sulfonamides could potentially play a role in mediating sulfonamide idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions.

Because aminoglycoside accumulation in kidney cortex involves their segregation in lysosomes, we have examined the possibility of formation of intracellular aminoglycoside-polyaspartic acid complexes that would render the drug less toxic. We found that in vitro polyaspartic acid (MW 9 - 15, 000) 1) binds gentamicin with an optimum at acidic pH (5. 4), 2) displaces it from negatively charged liposomes and 3) restores the activity of gentamicin-inhibited lysosomal phospholipase A 1 toward phosphatidylcholine included in negatively charged liposomes. In parallel, we also observed that at pH 7. 0, polyaspartic acid binds and displaces gentamicin from purified brush-border membrane vesicles, causing an apparent decrease of affinity of gentamicin for these membranes, which was falsely interpreted by Williams et al., J. <b>Pharmacol.</b> <b>Exp.</b> Ther. 237 : 919, 1986 as "competition for a common membrane binding site. " Assuming that, after its administration in vivo, polyaspartic acid gains access to lysosomes of proximal tubular cells, as many low molecular weight proteins and polypeptides do, our results suggest that protection against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity is obtained by the binding of the aminoglycoside to the polyanion in lysosomes, preventing thereby the development of phospholipidosis and therefore interfering with the cascade of events leading from drug accumulation to nephrotoxicity...|$|E

A model, employing open-chested, anesthetized dogs, {{was developed to}} facilitate the study of myocardial drug disposition. Propranolol was employed as a model compound for initial investigation. Propranolol was administered as either a single i. v. bolus of 0. 5 mg/kg or by a stepwise infusion protocol employing three rates: 2. 6, 6. 5 and 1 2. 0 sg/kg/min. Blood and myocardial biopsy samples were obtained at specified times and the concentration of propranolol in tissue homoge-nates and plasma was determined by a high-pressure liquid chromotographic procedure. The concentration-time data ob-tamed from the i. v. bolus studies were fitted to a three-com...|$|E
40|$|Physiologic {{effects and}} plasma {{kinetics}} of phenylethanolamine and its N-methyl homolog in the dog. J. <b>Pharmacol.</b> <b>Exp.</b> Ther. 217 : 379 - 385, 1981. Single i. v. {{doses of the}} endogenous trace amine phenyletha-nolamine (PEOH) and its N-methyl homolog (NMPEOH) were administered to separate groups of five dogs. The dose- and time-related effects of these compounds were measured on pupillary diameter, heart rate and body temperature. Blood samples were obtained concurrently with the physiologic mea-sures and plasma levels of PEOH and NMPEOH were deter-mined by gas chromatography. Both compounds dilated pupils, decreased heart rate and tended to lower body temperature. NMPEOH was approximately 1. 25 times more potent than PEOH in dilating pupils. The plasma pharmacokinetics of both PEOH and NMPEOH could be described by a biexponentia...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological and {{behavioral}} {{studies suggest that}} spinal -and -opioid antinociceptive systems are functionally associ-ated with ovarian sex steroids. These interactions can be dem-onstrated specifically during pregnancy or hormone-simulated pregnancy (HSP). The analgesia associated with both condi-tions can be abolished by blockade of either spinal -opioid receptors or -opioid receptors (DOR). Furthermore, both dynorphin (DYN) release (J <b>Pharmacol</b> <b>Exp</b> Ther 298 : 1213 – 1220, 2001) and the processing of the DYN precursor (J Neu-rochem 65 : 1374 – 1380, 1995) are significantly increased in the spinal cord during HSP. We undertook the current study to determine whether DYN, DOR, and estrogen receptor (ER) share anatomical relationships that permit their direct interac-tion. Coexpression of DOR or ER by DYN neurons was as...|$|E
