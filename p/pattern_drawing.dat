6000|$|... 235. Or take up, for {{instance}} of higher effort, the 'Cornhill Magazine' for this month, July, 1876. It has a vignette of Venice for an illuminated letter. That is what your decorative art has become, by help of Kensington! The letter {{to be produced}} is a T. There is a gondola {{in the front of}} the design, with the canopy slipped back to the stern like a saddle over a horse's tail. There is another in the middle distance, all gone to seed at the prow, with its gondolier emaciated into an oar, at the stern; then there is a Church of the Salute, and a Ducal Palace,--in which I beg you to observe all the felicity and dexterity of modern cheap engraving; finally, over the Ducal Palace there is something, I know not in the least what meant for, like an umbrella dropping out of a balloon, which is the ornamental letter T. Opposite this ornamental design, there is an engraving of two young ladies and a parasol, between two trunks of trees. The white face and black feet of the principal young lady, being the points of the design, are done with as much care,--not with as much dexterity,--as an ordinary sketch of Du Maurier's in Punch. The young lady's dress, the next attraction, is done in cheap white and black cutting, with considerably less skill than that of any ordinary tailor's or milliner's shop-book <b>pattern</b> <b>drawing.</b> For the other young lady, and the landscape, take your magnifying glass, and look at the hacked wood that forms the entire shaded surface--one mass of idiotic scrabble, without the remotest attempt to express a single leaf, flower, or clod of earth. It is such landscape as the public sees out of its railroad window at sixty miles of it in the hour--and good enough for such a public.|$|E

He summed up his schooling as ‘reading, writing, arithmetic never could learn, and English Grammar imperfectly with a slight knowledge of Geography, and a considerable stock of Biblical History. Whatever the shortcomings of a parish-school education it must have provided Smith with the basic tool of literacy. His wide knowledge of English poetry in particular was commented on by many of the literary and academic figures whom he encountered in later life.|$|E

50|$|The rosette seeker, {{also known}} as a pseudoimager, uses much of the {{mechanical}} layout of the con-scan system, but adds another mirror or prism to create a more complex <b>pattern</b> <b>drawing</b> out a rosette. Compared to the fixed angle of the con-scan, the rosette pattern causes the image to scan to greater angles. Sensors on the drive shafts are fed to a mixer that produces a sample FM signal. Mixing this signal with the one from the seeker removes the motion, producing an output signal identical to that from the con-scan. A major advantage is that the rosette seeker scans out a wider portion of the sky, making it much more difficult for the target {{to move out of the}} field of view.|$|E
50|$|In the video, {{directed}} by Simon Brand, {{a piece of}} paper drops mysteriously in front of an elderly Japanese woman walking on a city sidewalk. She picks it up, immediately recognizes it (a drawing of a spiral <b>pattern</b> <b>drawing</b> similar to a nautilus shell), and promptly boards a bus heading out of the city to the beach. While on board, she reverts to being a young woman, then decides to disembark the slow-moving bus and travel to the beach by bicycle. When she finally arrives at the beach, she finds a familiar young man standing {{in the center of the}} same spiral pattern from the paper, drawn in large scale on the sand, and they begin to dance passionately together, first on the ground and later while floating through the air. At the end of the video, both the woman and her dance partner have reverted to their old age, but continue to dance on the beach.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} children’s stories that contain feminist themes are Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women and Frank L. Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this <b>pattern.</b> <b>Drawing</b> attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of {{the earliest}} forms of the feminist movement. Little Women, a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, Matilda Gage, an important figure in the suffragist movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, Dorothy who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author Tove Jansson's Moomin series which features strong and individualized female characters. In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of feminist children's literature as well as a rise in gender neutrality in children's literature.|$|E

5000|$|Production of Benjarong is {{a process}} known to only small {{communities}} of Thai artists which have passed down the knowledge from generation to generation. The artisan who makes Benjarong {{has to be very}} skillful and careful. The production process is needs a skilled labor. How the Benjarong is made and how the patterns are painted, are glamorous and all considered as the masterpieces. In the porcelain selection, only white porcelain (Bone China and Royal Porcelain) which had been fired at the proper temperature (1150-1280 degree Celsius) for many hours, are selected. White ware must not have any flaw. After we get all required white wares, cleaning is the next process. During this process, it is necessary to avoid oily surface from sweaty and dirty hand. In drawing process, we use hypodermic syringe or paint brush to draw line. The process begins with drawing the circular guide lines on the Thai porcelain on a turning wheel, which is manually controlled. While drawing on the design, the artist will keep the sample pattern in front of him so he can draw the pattern correctly. The initial <b>pattern</b> <b>drawing</b> is very crucial to how the design will turn out, so it will be done by the well-experienced artist (usually drawn by a master craftsman). This is the reason why the pattern is drawn in very fine lines on each Benjarong. In painting process, there are various colors of paint but basically we use five main colors (black, green, yellow, red and white). The specialized paint for Benjarong needs a skillful painter. The paint is made from mineral colors and must be well crushed and mixed with water in proper ratio. The crushing equipment is ceramic or equivalent material mortar. The paint should not be too thick or thin. If the paint is too thick, it will not be completely fired and the color will not be shown as expected. If the paint is too thin, the color will fade. Also, the paint must not overlap with any line of the other color. At the final stage of painting, the 18 karat gold might be added to the rims {{in order to make it}} look glamorous. The next step after painting is firing. Painted wares will be put in the kiln. The spaces between them are 0.5 - 1 cm unless you want the painted wares to touch each other and might get damaged to pattern that painted after firing. The temperature in the kiln is controlled between 800 to 1000◦C and takes about 10 hours firing time. The Benjarong must be put in the kiln five times. After finished firing, the Benjarong will be cooled down; then take it off from the kiln. Once the Benjarong has been fired, it can be seen as three dimensional bubble of paint on the surface, which is the reason why Benjarong is unique. At the end of production, there will a quality control. The slightest mistake in any process would ruin the design and fame of Benjarong. Any mistake is unacceptable. Benjarong supposed to be perfect in every respect. If the mistake is found, it will be sent back to the studio or might throw it away. In fact, this is very rare to happen because during each stage the artists take good care of each individual piece. (Blobiztar Company Limited) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{commercial}} aircraft industry {{is no stranger}} to trade friction, which has brought bitter international disputes over industrial policy to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Yet despite the fact that several countries, notably China, Japan and Russia have stated their intentions to develop aircraft that can compete with other countries, these efforts have not led to a trade dispute. What explains this <b>pattern?</b> <b>Drawing</b> on sources such as the Global Trade Alert database, this paper argues that that the complexity of the aircraft industry generates considerable barriers to entry. Moreover, emerging aerospace states have not repeated earlier efforts of direct subsidy, but rather, they have sought to position themselves in the global aerospace value chain, with selective government interventions designed to help national champions accumulate the necessary technical experience though collaboration with incumbent firms. However, the very diversity of government supports may make protectionist measures more difficult to identify...|$|E

40|$|When {{designing}} economic policies, {{policy makers}} {{work with the}} assumption that targeted beneficiaries would respond in a manner that would lead to success of the policy. However, the responses of beneficiaries do not always follow the expected <b>pattern.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on Thaler and Sunstein’s (2008) and Asante’s (2003) theses, this paper projects the view that economic policies that fail to take account of the psychology of the target people fail. The position in this paper is based on the premises that human beings, as choice architects, are not necessarily rational beings always acting in their self-interests and that culture, traditions, and national aspirations influence the success of economic policies. It is argued that inertia (the unwillingness to move or change the status quo) is related to how individuals living in poverty respond to policies intended to alleviate their conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by the {{emergence}} of multicore architectures, and the reality that parallelism is rarely used for analysis in observational astronomy, we demonstrate how general users may employ tightly-coupled multiprocessors in scriptable research calculations while requiring no special knowledge of parallel programming. Our method rests on the observation that much of the appeal of high-level vectorized languages like IDL or MatLab stems from relatively simple internal loops over regular array structures, and that these loops are highly amenable to automatic parallelization with OpenMP. We discuss how ISIS, an open-source astrophysical analysis system embedding the S-Lang numerical language, was easily adapted to exploit this <b>pattern.</b> <b>Drawing</b> from a common astrophysical problem, model fitting, we present beneficial speedups for several machine and compiler configurations.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{issues of}} leadership and leadership development by reflecting {{on the notion of}} the refrain as <b>pattern.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on our research of leadership within UK further education (FE) we examine how tracing ‘patterns of leadership’ can provide an insight into the practical accomplishment of leadership in FE as everyday ‘ordinary’ work. In an era of increased change and uncertainty about the character of leadership within the sector, we use our ethnographic data and interdisciplinary backgrounds to consider leadership development as essentially a design problem through adopting and adapting the notion of patterns that emerge in the architectural work of Christopher Alexander and the organizational studies of Tom Erickson. In doing so we point to the comforting effect of both the refrain and the pattern to repeat, return, renew, react, refine, reconstruct and resolve. We conclude by suggesting some {{of the ways in which}} the documenting and describing of such patterns of leadership can be used as ‘teachable moments’ for the design and deployment of programmes of leadership development and training...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{last two}} decades have seen a rising {{interest}} in (a) {{the notion of a}} scientific phenomenon as distinct from theories and data, and (b) the intricacies of experimentally producing and stabilizing phenomena. This paper develops an anal-ysis of the stabilization of phenomena that integrates two aspects that have largely been treated separately in the literature: one concerns the skills required for empir-ical work; the other concerns the strategies by which claims about phenomena are validated. I argue that in order {{to make sense of the}} process of stabilization, we need to distinguish between two types of phenomena: phenomena as patterns in the data (“surface regularities”) and phenomena as underlying (or “hidden”) regularities. I show that the epistemic relationships that data bear to each of these types of phenom-ena are different: Data patterns are instantiated by individual data, whereas underlying regularities are indicated by individual data, insofar as they instantiate a data <b>pattern.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on an example from memory research, I argue that neither of these two kinds of phenomenon can be stabilized in isolation. I conclude that what is stabilized when phenomena are stabilized is the fit between surface regularities and hidden regularities...|$|E
