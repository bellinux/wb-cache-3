We find that the magnetic edge states of the Dirac fermions, formed along {{the boundary between the}} two domains, have features strongly dependent on whether B_ 0 is parallel or antiparallel to B_ 1. In the parallel case, when the Zeeman spin splitting can be ignored, the magnetic edge states originating from the n= 0 Landau levels of the two domains have dispersionless energy levels, contrary to those from the n 0 levels. Here, n is the graphene Landau-level index. They become dispersive as the Zeeman splitting becomes finite or as an electrostatic step potential is additionally applied. In the antiparallel case, the n= 0 magnetic edge states split into electron-like and hole-like current-carrying states. The energy gap between the electron-like and hole-like states can be created by the Zeeman splitting or by the step potential. These features are attributed {{to the fact that the}} pseudo-spin of the magnetic edge states couples to the direction of the magnetic field. We propose an Aharonov-Bohm interferometry setup in a graphene ribbon for experimental study of the magnetic edge states. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

There are four mean-field regimes on the parameter plane of g_e and g_z, where g_e is the interspecies spin-exchange interaction strength, while g_z {{is the difference between}} the interaction strength of interspecies scattering without spin-exchange of equal spins and that of unequal spins. Two regimes, with |g_z| > |g_e|, correspond to ground states with the total spins of the two species parallel or antiparallel along z direction, and the low energy excitations are equivalent to those of two-component spinless Bosons. The other two regimes, with |g_e| > |g_z|, correspond to ground states with the total spins of the two species parallel or antiparallel <b>on</b> <b>xy</b> <b>plane,</b> and the low energy excitations are described by a sine-Gordon model coupled with a free scalar field, where the effective fields are combinations of the phases of the original four Boson fields.

At 290 K, CaFeO_ 3 undergoes a metal-insulator transition and a charge disproportionation reaction 2 Fe^ 4 +→Fe^ 5 ++Fe^ 3 +.

Furthermore, we show that the rock-salt ordering of the Fe^ 5 + and Fe^ 3 + cations can be enhanced when the B-site dopants are arranged in a (111) plane due to a collective steric effect that facilitates the size discrepancy between the Fe^ 5 +O_ 6 and Fe^ 3 +O_ 6 octahedra and therefore {{gives rise to a}} larger band gap. The enhanced charge disproportionation in these solid solutions is verified by rigorously calculating the oxidation states of the Fe cations with different octahedral cage sizes.
