5000|$|The ornate <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles geoffroyi ornatus), is a {{subspecies}} of Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> {{a type of}} New World monkey, from Central America, {{native to}} Costa Rica and Panama. [...] Other common names for this subspecies include the brilliant <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> the common <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> the red <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> the <b>Panama</b> <b>spider</b> ape, and the Azuero <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> the latter two of which were previously thought to be distinct subspecies panamensis and azuerensis, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The red-faced <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles paniscus) {{also known}} as the Guiana <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> or red-faced black <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> is a species of <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> found in the rain forests in {{northern}} South America.|$|R
50|$|Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles geoffroyi), {{also known}} as the black-handed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> is a species of <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> a type of New World monkey, from Central America, parts of Mexico and {{possibly}} a small portion of Colombia. There are at least five subspecies. Some primatologists classify the black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (A. fusciceps), found in Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador as the same species as Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Colombian <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles fusciceps rufiventris), is a {{subspecies}} of the Black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> {{a type of}} New World monkey, {{found in}} Colombia and Panama. [...] Some authorities, such as Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), do not recognize the Black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> as a distinct species and so treat the Colombian <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> as a subspecies of Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to external appearance, the Peruvian <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> {{differs from the}} red-faced <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> {{by the number of}} chromosomes (2n = 32 in the red-faced vs. 2n = 34 in the Peruvian) in {{addition to}} several specific chromosomal differences. The two species have been interbred in captivity, resulting in offspring with reduced fertility (but not sterility). [...] There are several related species such as the Central American <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> or Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (A. geoffroyi), and the brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (A. hybridus) and the species' closest relative the white-bellied <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (A. belzebuth). All of these have a prehensile tail, a thumbless hand, and other characteristics that are found in all <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> or {{variegated}} <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles hybridus) is {{a critically}} endangered species of <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> {{a type of}} New World monkey, from forests in northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela.|$|R
50|$|Its taxonomic {{history has}} been confusing, {{and in the past}} it has been treated as a {{subspecies}} of either the Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> or the white-fronted <b>spider</b> <b>monkey.</b> Like all <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys,</b> it has very long, spindly limbs and a lengthy prehensile tail which can almost be called a fifth limb. The brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> has a whitish belly and patch on the forehead, and - highly unusual among <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> - the eyes are sometimes pale blue.|$|R
50|$|Agreement {{over the}} number of <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> species is not universal. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) based their {{classification}} on fur color, and Groves (1989) based his on fur color and geographic distribution. Kellogg and Goldman differentiated Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> from other species by its dark black head, hands and wrists. Recent studies use mitochondrial DNA to help differentiate species. Such studies by Collins and Daubach (2000, 2001, 2006) indicate the Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> is {{more closely related to}} the white-fronted <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> A. belzebuth, and the brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> A. hybridus, than it is to the red-faced <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> A. paniscus. According to these studies, A. paniscus branched off from the other <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> approximately 3.27 million years ago and the <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> branched off from the woolly monkeys and muiriquis 3.59 million years ago. Older studies by Porter, et al. indicate the howler monkeys are believed to have branched off from the other Atelides over 10 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> mainly forage in the {{canopies}} {{of forests}} and rely mostly on their senses of sight, smell, taste, and touch to find food. Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> are mainly herbivores and frugivores. A main {{component of the}} brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkey’s</b> diet is ripe fruit. 83% of their diet is lipid rich fruits. However, in drier seasons where fruit is less abundant, brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> feed on leaves, seeds, flowers, bark, honey, decaying wood, and occasionally insects such as termites and caterpillars. Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> feed on different species of figs year around. Scientists have observed <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> eating soil and clay, and hypothesized that {{the reasons for this}} behavior could be to obtain minerals from the soil, for phosphorus, or in order to maintain a pH-balance in their digestive system. Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> find water to drink on the forest floor at “salado sites.” Competition for food occurs between <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> and other frugivorous primates.|$|R
5000|$|Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> {{belongs to}} the New World monkey family Atelidae, which {{contains}} the <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys,</b> woolly monkeys, muriquis and howler monkeys. It {{is a member of}} the subfamily Atelinae, which includes the <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys,</b> woolly monkeys and muriquis, and of the genus Ateles, which contains all the <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The genus name Ateles means [...] "imperfect", a reference to the vestigial thumb. The species name geoffroyi is in honor of French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.|$|R
5000|$|The hooded <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles geoffroyi grisescens [...] ), is a {{subspecies}} of Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> {{a type of}} New World monkey, from Central America, {{native to}} Panama. [...] It also might {{be found in a}} small portion of Colombia adjacent to Panama. [...] In western Colombia and northeast Panama it is replaced by the Black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> A. fusciceps. [...] In western Panama, it is replaced by another subspecies of Geoffroy's Spider <b>Monkey,</b> the Ornate <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> A. g. ornatus. [...] The Hooded <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> has long, tawny fur.|$|R
50|$|Endangered mammals include black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles fusciceps), Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles geoffroyi) and red-crested tree-rat (Santamartamys rufodorsalis).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing much of the monkey's nutritional needs, fruit and leaves provide much of its water requirements. Like other <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys,</b> Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> drinks water from tree holes and bromeliads in trees, but unlike other <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys,</b> it also drinks from terrestrial water sources.|$|R

50|$|The brown-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles fusciceps fusciceps), is a {{critically}} endangered subspecies of the black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> {{a type of}} New World monkey, found in northwestern Ecuador.|$|R
50|$|Some {{authorities}} {{also recognize}} A. g. azuerensis and A. g. frontatus as valid subspecies. The black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> Ateles fusciceps, {{is considered by}} authorities such as Groves (1989) and Rylands et al. (2006) to be a separate species from Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey.</b> Other authorities, including Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), condider A. fusciceps to be synonymous with A. geoffroyi. Under this treatment, the two subspecies of the black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> represent additional subspecies of Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> A. g. fusciceps and A. g. rufiventris.|$|R
50|$|The white-bellied <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles belzebuth), {{also known}} as the white-fronted or {{long-haired}} <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> is an endangered species of <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> a type of New World monkey. It is found in the north-western Amazon in Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Brazil, ranging as far south as the lower Ucayali River and as far east as the Branco River. In the past, the Peruvian, brown and white-cheeked <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> have been treated as subspecies of A. belzebuth. As presently defined, the white-bellied <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> is monotypic. It has a whitish belly and a pale patch on the forehead, which, despite its common name, often is orange-buff. They live in groups of 20 to 40 individuals, splitting into small parties of 1 to 9 when in activity.|$|R
50|$|Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> {{lives in}} {{various types of}} forest, {{including}} rains, semideciduous and mangrove forests. Higher densities of Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> are generally found in areas containing evergreen forest.|$|R
5000|$|Its type {{locality}} is at 1500 m in the Hacienda Chinipamba, Imbabura Province in North-West Ecuador. [...] It inhabits areas {{west of the}} Andes Mountains.

50|$|The black-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles fusciceps) is {{a species}} of <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> a type of New World monkey, from Central and South America. It is found in Colombia, Nicaragua and Panama. Although primatologists such as Colin Groves (1989) follow Kellogg and Goldman (1944) in {{treating}} A. fusciceps as a separate species, other authors, including Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005) treat it as a subspecies of Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to walking or running on four limbs and climbing, Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> uses several forms of suspensory locomotion. Brachiation, or swinging from the arms with {{assistance from the}} prehensile tail, {{is the most common}} form of suspensory locomotion. Less common forms include swinging while suspended by the tail, and walking on four limbs under a branch. Studies have indicated the Geoffroy's <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> uses suspensory locomotion less frequently than other <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> species.|$|R
50|$|Other mammals include white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), common agouti (Dasyprocta genus), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), jaguar (Panthera onca), {{capybara}} (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), spiny tree-rat (Echimys genera) and Ega long-tongued bat (Scleronycteris ega).

40|$|The Colombian black <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles fusciceps rufiventris) is {{critically}} endangered. The wild population is still decreasing and {{today there are}} no records of the actual population size. Enrichment makes the animals keep their natural behaviours, which makes an eventual reintroduction to nature easier. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate three different food enrichments for Colombian black <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The purpose was also to try to come up with new ideas for enrichment suitable for the lifestyle and behaviour of <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The attractiveness of branch balls, food puzzles for dogs and ice blocks, all filled with treats, was compared in order to determine the best enrichment for the <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The food puzzles were used for the longest period of time and during a bigger proportion of time than the ice blocks, followed by the branch balls. But the branch balls made the frequencies of behaviours come the closest to those of wild <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The literature study indicates that food enrichment is the most appreciated form of enrichment by <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys.</b> When empty, food enrichments lose their attractiveness. Though, in the end, a mix of different kinds of enrichment is what should be strived for, in order to fulfil all the needs of the <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys,</b> which increases their welfare and chances to later reproduce and survive in the wild...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Gibbons and <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{have similar}} diets, body size, and {{locomotor}} patterns. They are therefore {{expected to be}} subject to similar socioecological ru es. However their grouping pat-terns differ. Gibbons live in small stable groups, whereas pider monkey form unstable sub-groups that vary from small to large during different seasons. If similar principles apply to the two species, food abundance should vary more for <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> than for gibbons; food density should be simi-lar for the two species when <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> sub-groups are the same size as gibbon groups; and the highest level of food abundance should be higher for <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> than for gibbons. These predic-tions are upheld for a comparison of particular populations of Hylobates muelleri and Ateles geoffroyi...|$|R
