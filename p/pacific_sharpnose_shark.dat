Among the primary species in observed landings were the scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini (15. 2 %, n 5148), Pacific angel shark, Squatina californica (11. 6 %, n 5 113), blue shark, Prionace glauca (11. 4 %, n 5 111), <b>Pacific</b> <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark,</b> Rhizoprionodon longurio (11. 3 %, n 5 110), and pygmy devil ray, Mobula munkiana (8. 6 %, n 5 84) ...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a lack}} {{of basic}} {{biological}} information on the shark species caught in the region around the "Tres Marias " Islands and Isabel Island in the Central Mexican Pacific. Intensive monitoring was undertaken from October 1995 to March 1996 of shark landings by the artisanal fleet at La Cruz de Huanacaxtle, Nayarit, that fished south of "Tres Marias " Islands and, from November 2000 to February 2001, of landings by another fleet that fished around Isabel Island and close to the "Tres Marias". Smooth hammerhead Sphyrna zygaena (35 %), silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis (27 %) and blue shark Prionace glauca (25 %) were the most important species of 2 004 sharks observed at La Cruz de Huanacaxtle. At Isabel Island, the most important species of 7 464 sharks sampled were S. lewini (49 %) and <b>Pacific</b> <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark</b> Rhizoprionodon longurio (45 %).

40|$|Obtaining {{accurate}} species-specific landings data is {{an essential}} step toward achieving sustainable shark fisheries. Globally distributed <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks</b> (genus Rhizoprionodon) exhibit life-history characteristics (rapid growth, early maturity, annual reproduction) that suggests {{that they could be}} fished in a sustainable manner assuming an investment in monitoring, assessment and careful management. However, obtaining species-specific landings data for <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks</b> is problematic because they are morphologically very similar to one another. Moreover, <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks</b> may also be confused with other small sharks (either small species or juveniles of large species) once they are processed (i. e., the head and fins are removed). Here we present a highly streamlined molecular genetics approach based on seven species-specific PCR primers in a multiplex format that can simultaneously discriminate body parts from the seven described <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark</b> species commonly occurring in coastal fisheries worldwide. The species-specific primers are based on nucleotide sequence differences among species in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 locus (ITS 2).

40|$|Some {{biological}} {{aspects of}} the sharks Rhizoprionodon lalandii (Brazilian <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark)</b> and R. porosus (Caribbean <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark),</b> such as maturity and sexual segregation, biological indexes(gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, and condition factor), and stomach contents were studied. Between September and December 2007 a follow-up of the captures of those sharks by the artisan fishing carried on around Isla Fuerte was made. 49 individuals of the Caribbean <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark</b> were analyzed, 55 % of them immature or juvenile; as well as 39 specimens of the Brazilian <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark,</b> 59 % of them immature individuals. Rhizoprionondon porosus showed a sex ratio (male:female) 9 : 1 and R. lalandii 1 : 9, giving evidence of sexual segregation. A significant correlation exists between the gonadosomatic index and the condition factor (r= 0. 93, p= 0. 002, n= 7) for the females of the Brazilian <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark</b> in stage 4 of maturity.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation, though not as much as the grey <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark</b> (R. oligolinx) or Australian <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark</b> (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations. Moreover, fishing pressure in the region has increased substantially since the assessments were conducted.|$|R

40|$|Sharks are {{considered}} top predators in many marine ecosystems, and {{can play an}} important role in structuring those communities. As a result, it is necessary to understand the factors that influence their abundance and distribution. This is particularly important as fishery managers develop fishery management plans for sharks that identify areas that serve as essential fish habitat (EFH). This includes nursery habitat where sharks are born and juveniles spend the early part of their life. However, our understanding of shark habitat use in the northeast Florida waters is limited. The goal of this thesis was to characterize the abundance and distribution of sharks in northeast Florida estuaries, and to examine the effect of abiotic and biotic factors affecting shark habitat use. A bottom longline survey conducted from 2009 – 2011 indicated that 11 shark species use the estuarine waters of northeast Florida during summer months. Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), and sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) were the most abundant species and made up 87. 1 % of the total catch. Month, bottom water temperature, and depth were the most important factors determining the presence and abundance of these species. This study also examined the role of prey abundance in determining the abundance of Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks.</b> The probability of catching an Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark,</b> and the abundance of Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks,</b> were most influenced by site. Neither potential prey abundance nor preferred prey abundance were not significant factors effecting Atlantic sharpnose abundance. This may be a result of prey sampling not providing an accurate measure of the true availability of prey resources. Other factors, such as predation risk, may better explain habitat use patterns of Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks.</b> Continued sampling will give a better understanding of the factors influencing shark habitat use in this area...|$|R

40|$|Coastal habitat use and {{residency}} of {{a coastal}} bay by juvenile Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks,</b> Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, were examined by acoustic monitoring, gillnet sampling, and conventional tag–recapture. Acoustic monitoring data {{were used to}} define the residency and movement patterns of sharks within Crooked Island Sound, Florida. Over 3 years, sharks were monitored for periods of 1 – 37 days, with individuals regularly {{moving in and out}} of the study site. Individual sharks were continuously present within the study site for periods of 1 – 35 days. Patterns of movement could not be correlated with time of day. Home range sizes were typically small (average[*]=[*] 1. 29 km 2) and did not vary on a yearly basis. Gillnet sampling revealed that juvenile Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks</b> were present in all habitat types found within Crooked Island Sound, and peaks in abundance varied depending on month within a year. Although telemetry data showed that most individuals remained within the study site for short periods of time before emigrating, conventional tag–recapture data indicates some individuals return to Crooked Island Sound after extended absences (maximum length[*]=[*] 1, 352 days). Although conventional shark nursery theory suggests small sharks remain in shallow coastal waters to avoid predation, juvenile Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks</b> frequently exited from protected areas and appear to move through deeper waters to adjacent coastal bays and estuaries.

5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including ponyfishes, grunters, tunas, and herring.

This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks</b> (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|R
