40|$|Due to {{the urgency}} of not losing more urban high school {{students}} to academic failure and dropping out, the most promising reform efforts must be investigated. One of the most promising ways of creating successful high school reform that has been advocated is through restructuring schools into community-like organizations, often called <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> Yet, limited empirical research has been conducted concerning <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities,</b> especially in urban high schools. Thus, this research sought to understand how two urban high schools, one comprehensive high school in a large urban center and one small career academy high school in a medium-sized urban center, implemented <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> as a leadership-initiated reform strategy for math and science teaching. Year-long interactions with each high school including in-depth observations and eighteen interviews, nine personnel from each site, revealed that certain organizational structures (e. g. social and human resources, structural conditions) must be in place for <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> to have {{the potential to be a}} successful reform effort. Specifically, the way in which leadership supports <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> through structure, pressure, and support was important.

40|$|There {{has been}} a shift in {{education}} as the focus has moved from the centrality of teaching {{to the importance of}} learning (Aseltine, Judith, & Rigazio-DiGilio, 2006). The enhancement of educational experiences and learning of students is a goal shared by instructional supervision (Nolan & Hoover, 2004) and <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> (DuFour & DuFour, 2003). As the need for professional development activities, such as instructional supervision and <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities,</b> to support <b>professional</b> growth continues, how these activities are implemented within a school division remains a critical concern. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the links between <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> and instructional supervisory practice as catalysts for authentic professional growth. The result of this study suggests that a zone of authentic professional growth occurs when the activities of <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> and instructional supervision as activities of professional development and reflective practice are aligned. In an era of greater accountability in education school divisions have attempted to support their professional staff with limited resources. Connecting activities to support the goals of the school division, such as professional growth and student learning, is one means of maximizing the use of the resources. There has been considerable research into instructional supervision and <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> however little has been done regarding the connection and implications of these professional activities on each other. The research questions of the study focused on gathering the level of agreement of teachers and in-school administrators regarding qualities of effective instructional supervision and successful <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> An additional research question focused on what were the criteria of successful <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> that related to effective instructional supervisory practice. The study used mixed research methodology to collect information about one school division. A survey was utilized to collect the perceptions of teachers and in-school administrators regarding successful <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> and effective instructional supervision. The data collected from the survey was analyzed by two interpretation panels, one consisting of teachers and the other consisting of in-school administrators. From the analysis provided by the panels and the survey data collected, it was found that from the perceptions of teachers and in-school administrators in one school system, <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> can contain specific qualities that support effective instructional supervision. The combination of these two professional activities can become a catalyst for authentic professional growth for teachers and in-school administrators. The findings of the study highlights the eight preconditions necessary for an environment or zone of authentic professional growth through the use of <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> to support instructional supervision. Implications, based on key findings, of the study include the need to manage time effectively, and to provide sufficient resources to support instructional supervision through <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> The school system also needs to develop a culture in which there exists a common understanding of instructional supervision and <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> It was found that ownership and shared leadership are vital to creating an environment which can embrace the collaborative culture necessary for successful <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> and effective instructional supervision...|$|R

This study draws on qualitative research methods and uses a case study approach. Ten teachers in two community high schools participated in semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions.

The research question that guided the data collection was: What are the formal and informal learning experiences of teachers in community high schools that may provide the basis for developing <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> for teachers’ <b>learning?</b> The key findings of this research include the potential teaching and learning experiences of the teachers in these two community high schools, which could be further improved, in order to develop effective <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> Shared values and norms; collaborative practices and structures; reflective practices; and a focus on student learning lend support to <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> The findings also highlight existing obstacles and hindrances to teachers’ learning experiences and practices that need to be addressed, in order for <b>professional</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> to be established successfully in these schools.
