5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted {{a small company}} (run by his cousins, and which initially catered only to fan club members) to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings and badges for six pence, eventually selling 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the Beatles' popularity grew. When Beatlemania stormed the UK in 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies wanting to use The Beatles' name and images on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and a huge variety of assorted merchandise. Epstein was adamant that the Beatles would not directly endorse any product, but through NEMS Enterprises he would grant discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce a quality <b>product</b> <b>at</b> a fair price, although many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E
5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the <b>product</b> <b>at</b> −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E
5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a <b>product</b> <b>at</b> a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{contribution}} of agricultural sector to the state economy was on the decline in 2012–13, through {{the strength of the}} allied livestock sector, it has picked up from 7.03% (2011–12) to 7.2%. In the 2013–14 fiscal period, {{the contribution}} has been estimated at a high of 7.75%. The total growth of the farm sector has recorded a 4.39% increase in 2012–13, over a paltry 1.3% growth in the previous fiscal year.

5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent <b>product.</b> <b>At</b> this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein <b>product</b> <b>at</b> the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E

5|$|Home Pong was {{an instant}} success {{following}} its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000units were sold that holiday season. The game became Sears' most successful <b>product</b> <b>at</b> the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones {{to capitalize on the}} home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's Pong consoles are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare. Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, McCann {{launched}} a multi-platform global advertising campaign titled Believe, that included sixminutes of live-action sequences called Landfall, {{to promote the}} latest game in the Halo series, Halo 3. Landfall was directed by Neill Blomkamp who also agreed to direct a full length Halo film, but it was cancelled due to funding disagreements. Believe proved a critical and financial hit. Over £84 million of sales were made {{on the first day}} of release alone, the highest-grossing opening sale of an entertainment <b>product</b> <b>at</b> the time. Believe received dozens of awards from the advertising community, including eight Clio Awards, Best in Show at the ANDY Awards, and two Grand Prix (for Film and Integrated campaigns) at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry. According to the Gunn Report, Believe was the second-most-awarded integrated advertising campaign of 2008, behind Earth Hour for the World Wide Fund for Nature.|$|E
5|$|In this {{situation}} one Ivaylo, {{a native of}} north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note, attached to the Svarlig gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated {{that he was a}} swineherd who took care of pigs for money. However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock <b>product</b> <b>at</b> the time and the possessor of a large herd could {{have been part of the}} elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.|$|E
