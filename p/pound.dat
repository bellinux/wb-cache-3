5|$|From the <b>pound</b> {{down to the}} scruple, the English apothecaries' {{system was}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system except that the troy <b>pound</b> and its subdivisions were {{slightly}} heavier than the Roman <b>pound</b> and its subdivisions. Similar systems were used all over Europe, but with considerable local variation described below under Variants.|$|E
5|$|In 1414, {{six years}} before the Treaty of Troyes, a statute of Henry V of England gave {{directions}} to the goldsmiths {{in terms of the}} troy <b>pound.</b> (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear in the statute of weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy <b>pound</b> was used for weighing metals and spices. After the abolishment of the Tower <b>pound</b> in 1527 by Henry VIII of England, the troy <b>pound</b> was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy <b>pound</b> until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bavaria legally {{defined the}} apothecaries' <b>pound</b> as 360.00g (an ounce of 30.00g). In 1815, Nuremberg lost {{its status as}} a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries' <b>pound</b> was no longer the {{official}} apothecaries' <b>pound</b> in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' <b>pound</b> was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of Bavaria, became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of Bavaria, and with a long delay. The apothecaries' <b>pound</b> of 360g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.|$|E

5|$|It was at Pennsylvania in 1901 that <b>Pound</b> met Hilda Doolittle (later {{known as}} the poet H.D.), his first serious romance, {{according}} to <b>Pound</b> scholar Ira Nadel. In 1911 she followed <b>Pound</b> to London and became involved in developing the Imagism movement. Between 1905 and 1907 <b>Pound</b> wrote several poems for her, 25 of which he hand-bound and called Hilda's Book, and in 1908 he asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for permission to marry her, but Doolittle dismissed <b>Pound</b> as a nomad. <b>Pound</b> was seeing two other women at the same time—Viola Baxter and Mary Moore—later dedicating a book of poetry, Personae (1909), to the latter. He asked Moore to marry him too, but she turned him down.|$|E

5|$|Empress Maria Theresia of Austria {{reformed}} {{the measures}} and weights of the Habsburg monarchy in 1761.

It was defined as 3/4 of the unusually heavy Habsburg civil <b>pound</b> (defined as 6/5 of the civil <b>pound</b> of Cologne) and corresponded to a record ounce weight of 35g.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} {{horoscope}} suggested {{a return to}} Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. <b>Pound</b> was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, <b>Pound</b> met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to <b>Pound.</b> A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E

The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, <b>Pound</b> told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E

5|$|<b>Pound</b> lock: Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that <b>pound</b> locks {{may have been used}} in antiquity by the Ptolemaic Greeks and the Romans.
