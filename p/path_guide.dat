5000|$|Srygley {{wrote for}} a time for the Old <b>Path</b> <b>Guide,</b> a {{religious}} paper owned and edited by F. G. Allen. The Kentucky paper was founded in order to occupy a moderate ground between the extreme liberal and conservative papers which dominated in the North and South following the Civil War. [...] Thus, when the controversial issue of missionary societies erupted in the church, Srygley wrote {{on the side of}} moderation and refused to condemn the societies.|$|E
5000|$|Poor health {{eventually}} required Srygley to {{move from}} Kentucky to Tennessee where in 1889 he became a front page editor for the Gospel Advocate. [...] The Gospel Advocate, under the editorship of David Lipscomb, was the leading paper in the conservative wing of the southern movement which would eventually {{become known as the}} Churches of Christ. [...] Thus, Srygley found his views about missionary societies espoused while he wrote for the Old <b>Path</b> <b>Guide</b> challenged. Srygley refused, when asked, to write against missionaries societies, promising only to investigate the matter biblically and then speak his conscience. In the end, he concluded that missionary societies were wrong and spent the rest of his career opposing them.|$|E
30|$|A {{combination}} of a predicted user position with prebuffering of data associated with physical locations bears many advantages in increased throughput of mobile devices. An interesting solution (Microsoft US patent [9]) in this field needs to know all information (AP location, SS power, etc.) of all wireless base stations in mobile device before the localization process can be started (see the Location Manager module [10]). Moreover, the Moving Direction Estimator module is also situated in a mobile device application. These two facts present limitations to changing wireless base stations structure or to computing power consumption. Another solution (HP US patent [11]) represents a similar concept.

Cobots {{can assist}} a human by {{mechanically}} constraining motion to software-defined <b>guide</b> <b>paths.</b> The Learning Cobot we introduced in [1] provides simple design tools for ergonomic <b>guide</b> <b>paths.</b> Walk-Through-Programming (WTP) lets the operator trace out a path {{in free mode}} and use a B-spline approximation of this <b>path</b> as a <b>guide</b> <b>path</b> for subsequent movements. <b>Guide</b> <b>paths</b> can also be designed by placing B-spline control points by mouse in a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI). This paper presents psychophysical experiments to evaluate these tools. User satisfaction was our evaluation criterion, as it encompasses analytical criteria like effort and motion jerkiness but is finer. The results demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} Learning Cobot, and the necessity of using the WTP and GUI together. With the WTP the operator can design ergonomic <b>guide</b> <b>paths</b> well, i. e., with haptic feedback alone, but operators prefer also to have the GUI to visualize the path. Using the Learning Cobot, operators can gradually learn ergonomic <b>guide</b> <b>paths</b> and adapt to changes in the environment or in the task. ...|$|R

We look at the modified base-line perceptron predictor, then at the history and address based path perceptron, and finally we look at a history based <b>path</b> <b>guided</b> perceptron combined with a local predictor.

40|$|The Minima Hopping global {{optimization}} method uses physically realizable {{molecular dynamics}} moves {{in combination with}} an energy feedback that guarantees the escape from any potential energy funnel. For the purpose of finding reactions pathways, we argue that Minima Hopping is particularly suitable as a guide through the potential energy landscape and as a generator for pairs of minima {{that can be used}} as input structures for methods capable of finding transition states between two minima. For Lennard-Jones benchmark systems we compared this Minima Hopping <b>guided</b> <b>path</b> search method to a known approach for the exploration of potential energy landscapes that is based on deterministic mode-following. Although we used a stabilized mode-following technique that reliably allows to follow distinct directions when escaping from a local minimum, we observed that Minima Hopping <b>guided</b> <b>path</b> search is far superior in finding lowest-barrier reaction pathways. We therefore suggest that Minima Hopping <b>guided</b> <b>path</b> search {{can be used as a}} simple and efficient way to identify energetically low-lying chemical reaction pathways. Finally we applied the Minima Hopping <b>guided</b> <b>path</b> search approach to 75 -atom and 102 -atom Lennard Jones systems. For the 75 -atom system we found pathways whose highest energies are significantly lower than the highest energy along the previously published lowest-barrier pathway. Furthermore, many of these pathways contain a smaller number of intermediate transition states than the previously publish lowest-barrier pathway. In case of the 102 -atom system Minima Hopping <b>guided</b> <b>path</b> search found a previously unknown and energetically low-lying funnel. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
