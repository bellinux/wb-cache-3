Koch) is often encountered during seed collection, {{which should be}} removed from the seed lots to ensure <b>precision</b> <b>sowing</b> in the nursery or out in the field. The aims of this study were to evaluate different modelling approaches and to examine the sensitivity of the change in detection system (Silicon-detector in the shorter vis-a-vis InGsAs-detector in the longer NIR regions) for discriminating non-viable seeds from viable seeds by Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR reflectance spectra were collected from single seeds, and discriminant models were developed by Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures - Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) using the entire or selected NIR regions. Both modelling approaches resulted in 98 % and 100 % classification accuracy for viable and non-viable seeds in the test set, respectively. However, OPLS-DA models were superb in terms of model parsimony and information quality. Modelling in the shorter and longer wavelength region also resulted in similar classification accuracy, suggesting that prediction of class membership is insensitive to change in the detection system. The origins of spectral differences between non-viable and viable seeds were attributed to differences in seed coat chemical composition, mainly terpenoids that were dominant in non-viable seeds and storage reserves in viable seeds. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that NIR spectroscopy has great potential as seed sorting technology to upgrade seed lot quality that ensures <b>precision</b> <b>sowing...</b>|$|E
40|$|Silphium perfoliatum, a {{perennial}} composite from North America, {{has been found}} as a promising plant species during the search for alternative biogas substrates. Until now Silphium perfoliatum has been established by the time- and cost-intensive transplanting method. The <b>precision</b> <b>sowing</b> of Silphium perfoliatum reduces the process costs significantly. However, the bulky seed with mildness germination power complicates a well distributed and adequate plant establishment. In field tests a modified precision seeder was used for sowing Silphium perfoliatum which is primarily used for maize sowing.

40|$|The {{object of}} the study was to compare the {{classical}} method of planting (small-plot complete seeder) and precise seeding for a given distance (prototype seed sowing machine FARMET for sowing with fertilizer under the heel) for winter wheat. Chosen were various seeding rates for precision and classic sowing machine into the cereals. Tested were sowing rates from 1. 0 to 4. 5 MKS. The experiment was done in the period 2014, 2015 at the research station CUA in Prague-Uhříněves. The chosen variety was forage winter wheat Penalty quality C from PROBIO of 2014. For the basis of the hypothesis was selected seed rate of 2. 0 MKS in <b>precision</b> <b>sowing</b> against 3. 5 MKS in a classical way of sowing. The goal was to determine whether the reduced seed rate during sowing precise manner provides the same yield as a recommended seed rate of a traditional methods of seeding. The forecrop was a spring barley. Soil was prepared using the minimize blade cultivator before sowing of the wheat. Some variants of the experiments were fertilized at planting to promote germination. These variants were fertilized with 150 kg N / ha freely to the soil before sowing or 150 kg N / ha under the heel when sowing fertilizer Nitrophoska perfect. Furthermore, all plots were fertilized with 140 kg N / ha in three divided doses in a LAD 27, without distinction. Dry summer in 2015 hadn´t a devastating effect on wheat and most variants of the experiment gave a very good yield.

In order to monitor the sliding of the ground wheel, a monitoring system composed of hardware and software was designed based on ATMEGA 16 Microcomputer. In the system, the practical and the theoretical driving distance of the ground wheel were measured by the photoelectric sensor and rotary encoder respectively, then the sliding can be calculated and displayed on the LED. The system could achieve the data of sliding when the planter worked, and this could insure that the driver may recognize the working conditions at any moment.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{dependence}} on local expert knowledge, {{which is important}} for large-scale crop modelling studies, we analyzed sowing dates and rules for maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.)) at three locations in Burkina Faso with strongly decreasing rainfall amounts from south to north. We tested in total 22 methods to derive optimal sowing dates that result in highest water-limited yields and lowest yield variation in a reproducible and objective way. The WOFOST crop growth simulation model was used. We found that sowing dates {{that are based on}} local expert knowledge, may work quite well for Burkina Faso and for West Africa in general. However, when no a priori information is available, maize should be sown between Julian days 160 and 200, with application of the following criteria: (a) cumulative rainfall in the sowing window is = 3 cm or available soil moisture content is > 2 cm in the moderately dry central part of Burkina Faso, (b) cumulative rainfall in this period is = 2 cm or available soil moisture content is > 1 cm in the more humid regions {{in the southern part of}} Burkina Faso. Sorghum should also be sown between Julian days 160 and 200 with application of the following criteria: (a) in the dry northern part of Burkina Faso the long duration sorghum variety should be sown when cumulative rainfall is = 2 cm in the sowing window, and the short duration sorghum variety should be sown later when cumulative rainfall is = 3 cm, (b) in central Burkina Faso sowing should start when cumulative rainfall in this period is = 2 cm or when available soil moisture content is > 1 cm. Sowing date rules are shown to be generally crop and location specific and are not generic for West Africa. However, the required <b>precision</b> of the <b>sowing</b> rules appears to rapidly decrease with increasing duration and intensity of the rainy season. Sowing delay as a result of, for example, labour constraints, has a disastrous effect on rainfed maize and sorghum yields, particularly in the northern part of West Africa with low rainfall. Optimization of sowing dates can also be done by simulating crop yields in a time window of two months around a predefined sowing date. Using these optimized dates appears to result in a good estimate of the maximal mean rainfed yield level...|$|R

The advantage of planting corn with precision seeder includes saving seeds, fewer working hours, achieves more uniform spacing {{in the row}} and depth of planting, and for these reasons {{it follows that the}} crop will be uniform in height and strength, which is a prerequisite for high yields. It was performed a field testing of three seed in sowing maize at three different speeds of sowing. Tests were carried out to determine and compare the quality of three planters with under pressure. Seeders worked in similar conditions but third seeder noted presence of crust on the soil surface. They were tested at a speed of 6, 8 and 10 km/h. At a speed of 6 km/h all three planters worked with a coefficient of variation less than 25 % and with values ​​from 19. 25 to 22. 72 %, which meets the criteria of quality planting. The percentage of pairwise from 1. 66 to 2. 64 %. The percentage of empty spaces were from 4. 24 to 4. 93 %.

40|$|<b>Precision</b> <b>sowing</b> is {{commonly}} used at forest tree nurseries {{in order to improve}} the growing space uniformity of seedlings in the beds. Temple-Inland Forest Products Corporation recently purchased a vacuum sower and requested a study be conducted comparing their new sower with a drill sower on the morphological characteristics of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) at lifting. The study was conducted in 2000 and repeated in 2001. The seed were sown using the two sower types to achieve four densities of 161, 215, 269, and 323 seedlings/m 2 • Two half-sibling families were tested in 2000, and one halfsibling family was tested in 2001. For both studies, the experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications. Cultural practices used to grow the seedlings were typical for the nursery. The seedlings were hand-lifted mid-winter for measurements of stem height, root-collar diameter, and oven-dry biomass. For the 2001 study, seedlings were handplanted 1 week after lifting in a clearcut near Etoile, TX. The mean morphology of the seedlings was similar when comparing the two sowers. When averaged for all densities, more seedlings with small root-collar diameters (s; 3 mm) were sampled in the 2000 study from the drill sower plots than from the vacuum sower plots. For the 2001 study, slightly more seedlings with small diameters were sampled from the vacuum sower plots. At typical operational densities of 215 and 269 seedlings/m 2, the use of the vacuum sower resulted in more seedlings at lifting, fewer small-diameter seedlings, and more large-diameter seedlings (~ 5 mm). As seedbed density was reduced, mean seedling root-collar diameter and oven-dry biomass increased. Seedlings grown in the nursery at 161 seedlings/m 2 were taller after the first and second growing season following planting...|$|E

The planters play {{an important}} role in agriculture because they create the right conditions for the seeding process is done correctly. One of the factors that contribute to successful crop establishment is the distribution uniformity and depth of deposition of seeds at sowing, these factors ensure adequate plant population. It is very difficult to determine all the points that influence agricultural operations, so the tools of qualities present themselves as an alternative to ensure proper performance of the process in terms of the critical factors in this sense the CEP assists in quality control in the process steps especially in repetitive processes, it aims to ensure stable and continuous process improvement. This study aimed to assess the depth and uniformity of seed corn and rice based on two theoretical speeds shift 4 and 7 km. h- 1 for the precision seeders mechanical and pneumatic and speed of 4 km and 8 km. h- 1 for seed drills. The experiment was conducted in the experimental area of the Department of Agricultural Engineering, Federal University of CearÃ, Campus do Pici, Fortaleza, CearÃ. The soil where the experiment was conducted was classified as Typic yellow. The <b>precision</b> <b>sowing</b> machines were set to a spacing of 14 cm between maize and depth of 5 cm, because the seed drills was adjusted to the density of rice seed 80 g / m depth of 3 cm.

40|$|Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} grown cereal in the Czech Republic. The sowing area covers about 795 000 hectares. Quality seed is a good basis {{for the formation of}} stand structure during development, which is reflected in the yield and quality of production. The structure of the stand is shaped primarily by the number of plants per unit area, thereby the amount of seed rate. In traditional agricultural practice, the amount of seed rate is determined mainly by sowing date and agricultural production area. It is used convertion MKZ to weight in kg. Required quantity of seed is therefore given in kg and not in seed number. Commonly used seeding-machines moreover, are not able to precisely follow the seed sown. The aim of this study was based on field experiments to assess the effect of different seeding rates in <b>precision</b> <b>sowing</b> on wheat yield. It is known that wheat plants have exceptional compensation capability, which consists mainly in tillering. When precise positioning of seeds per unit area, which maximally eliminates competition between plants, therefore, even in reduced seed rate should not shown to decrease yield. It was also evaluated the effect of the application of fertilizer during sowing into the zone of plant roots. Field experiments were carried out in the years 2014 / 2015 in the locality Budihostice (Central Bohemia), GPS coordinates 50 ° 17 ' 48. 664 "N, 14 ° 14 ' 36. 130 " E. For seeding carried out 3. 10. 2014 was used test modular drill Farmet with width of 1. 5 m and with the use of precision seeding. The zonal application to a depth of 85 and 180 mm at seeding was used NPK fertilizer (15 / 15 / 15) in a uniform dose of 80 kg/ha. Seed rate in the experimental plots ranged from 200 to 350 grains per m 2. Control variant representing conventionally planting was established with a seed rate of 450 grains per m 2. Total was based six variants without fertilization, six variants with the location of the fertilizer to a depth loosening of 85 and 180 mm and the control variant. Harvest was 30. 7. 2015. Differences in the number of plants are primarily reflected in the number of ears on a single plant. This factor was the most important yield-forming element. Lower yield compared with the control variant, which achieved yield 9, 509 t/ha, was set on plots with the number of plants under 200 pieces per m 2. In areas with a number of plants more than 200 pieces per m 2 was beyond one variant set higher yield. Variants with the number of plants more than 230 pieces per m 2 and fertilization achieved a higher yield than areas without fertilization. These differences were not statistically significant. Influence of zonal fertilization was not surely proved. The experiments have shown that reducing the number of plants per unit area may be due stand compensation capability provide similar yields as conventional variant...|$|E
