25|$|The {{battles over}} the Arakan in 1943 {{represented}} the last large-scale {{use of the}} Hurricane as a pure day fighter. But they were still used in the fighter-bomber role in Burma {{until the end of}} the war and they were occasionally caught up in air combat as well. For example, on 15 February 1944, Flg Off Jagadish Chandra Verma of No 6 Sqdn of the Royal Indian Air Force shot down a Japanese Ki-43 Oscar: it was the only RIAF victory of the war. The Hurricane remained in service as a fighter-bomber over the Balkans and at home as well where it was used mainly for second-line tasks and occasionally flown by ace pilots. For example, in mid-1944, ace Sqdn Leader 'Jas' Storrar flew No 1687 Hurricane to deliver <b>priority</b> <b>mail</b> to Allied armies in France during the Normandy invasion.|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 1958, to {{coincide}} with the 1958 celebration of the November 1957 opening, the United States Postal Service (USPS) released a 3¢ commemorative stamp featuring the recently completed bridge. [...] It was entitled [...] "Connecting the Peninsulas of Michigan" [...] and 107,195,200copies were issued. The USPS again honored the Mackinac Bridge as the subject of its 2010 <b>priority</b> <b>mail</b> $4.90 stamp, which went on sale February 3. [...] The bridge authority and MDOT unveiled the stamp, which featured a [...] "seagull’s-eye view" [...] of the landmark, with a passing freighter below.

In the opening bout, Rumble had also won the Cruiserweight and X-Division titles in a five-way match between TNT, [...] "Black Lotus" [...] Matt Ledge, Paul Hudson and Cameron Matthews. On the undercard, Antonio Thomas defeated [...] "Future Legend" [...] Luke Robinson. Earlier in the night, two different matches were held to determine the opponents of NWA New England Heavyweight Champion Louis Ortiz in the main event. Wagner Brown defeated Beau Douglas and Scott Hanson in a triple threat match, and [...] "Boston Bad Boy" [...] Jason Rumble won a Royal Rumble-styled battle royal. Although Rumble had been eliminated, along with Todd Hanson, Johnny Fabulous distracted the referees while Rumble snuck back in and eliminated the last man Beau Douglas. Rumble ended up winning the match making Ortiz submit to an Elevated Boston crab. At {{the start of the}} match, the referee was seen taking money from Johnny Fabulous in exchange for a <b>priority</b> <b>mail</b> envelope alleged to have medical records related to an injury Ortiz had recently suffered. He was also observed making deliberate [...] "slow counts" [...] throughout the match. At the end of the night, Rumble walked away holding three championship titles.|$|E
50|$|The {{first test}} of a {{microprocessor-based}} retrofit control system was done on a Santa Fe SD40-2 in April 1988. During this test, the fundamental concepts of the controller were successfully proven. This led to the first installation, also with the Santa Fe Railroad, on a newly rebuilt SD40-2 in December 1988. After three months, the unit was released for full revenue service including a high <b>priority</b> intercontinental <b>mail</b> service with highly variable weather conditions. On one route the locomotive went from subzero blizzard conditions in the Rocky Mountains, to 50 degrees Celsius in an Arizona desert within a 24-hour period.|$|R

The USPS provides much of this service by contracting with a private parcel service, FedEx.|$|R

50|$|The {{group was}} formed in October 1943 as the 31st Transport Group in England when the support {{requirements}} for Eighth and Ninth Air Forces expanded beyond the capability of the 27th Air Transport Group. It was assigned a combination of transport squadrons for delivering high <b>priority</b> cargo and <b>mail</b> and ferrying squadrons to deliver aircraft from depots to combat bases. The group was initially activated at Camp Griffiss, which was the headquarters of Eighth Air Force and its VIII Air Force Service Command, but the group moved {{in a few days}} to RAF Grove, where one of the largest depots in the European Theater was located.|$|R
50|$|The {{return address}} {{has been used}} on U. S. postage since the 1880s. As {{pressure}} printing became more commonplace during the early 1900s, labels became cheaper and more easily distributed. The profession involved with producing these labels was known as lithography. During the 1950s in the United States, more and more mail was not arriving at intended recipients, {{and as a result}} of the lack of a return address, said mail ended up in the dead letter office. With this rise in dead mail, the post office pleaded for people to use a return address. Even after this, the public still tended to neglect adding a return address. This prompted the postmaster to inform the public that mail without a return address would be less of a <b>priority</b> than <b>mail</b> with a return address. Still, the public did not widely use a return address until the 1960s when companies began to offer deals for preprinted return labels such as 2,500 labels for $2.00. They became more popular with the invention of label dispensers. With the invention of the personal computer, software enabled people to print their own labels. As e-mail began to overtake written mail, the return address became automatic in an e-mail.|$|R

We’re supposed to have the highest <b>priority</b> on <b>mail</b> coming in and not such a high <b>priority</b> on <b>mail</b> going out so I imagine that the situation should be even worse with you. I’m not angry and if you’re not angry, everything is Jake. Sweetheart, I am writing practically every day so I’m {{taking care of my}} end of the deal. I love you so very much, my dearest, and regardless of whatever happens you find your way into my thoughts. I don’t know how you do it, perhaps you can tell me. Nothing new or exciting happened today, just old stuff. We’ve got a darling little den here—pictures on the wall, library cases, carpets on the floor—oh so ducky! We played bridge last night until 9 : 00 p. m. and then went to bed. Golly, these 10 - 12 hr. nights are just too, too, divine. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving Day and believe it or not, we’re going to have a real genuine turkey. Of course, it won’t have any trimmings at the Mess. The Sgt. said that he’s going to do the best he can to roast it. Our food has been unbelievably good here considering our proximity to the action. I’ve no complaints and I know that we are 10, 000 % better off than so many of our boys here. Actually, sweets, we have a “bed of roses. ” Each night we have a pack of mail that we all pitch in and censor. Then we brew us some coffee on our elegant stove, bring out our excellent tableware and eat our snack. I still haven’t received the camera as well as other packages which I presume everybody has sent me (at least their letters intimate such). Sweetheart, when you eat your Thanksgiving meal tomorrow, I shall be at your side enjoying that delicious meal right with you. Actually, darling, I’m glad I’m here and doing something “constructive” for the war effort. The cartoon was cute and I got a “kick” out of it. As I said before, I don’t give a damn for promotions, etc. I’m happy. What a choicy bit of gossip [...] ”meow. ” Listen we shouldn’t talk—who knows what people were saying about us, my dear.

2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of postage stamps, mail in the UK was {{paid for by the}} recipient, a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem: the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by [...] the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items, and senders had no incentive to restrict the number, size, or weight of items sent, whether or not they would ultimately be paid for. The postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner, with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced. Concurrently with the first stamps, the UK offered wrappers for mail. [...] Later related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaid-postage envelopes, post cards, lettercards, aerogrammes, postage meters, and, more recently, specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the U.S. postal service for <b>priority</b> or express <b>mailing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Following the {{incidents}} of 9 / 11, the FAA imposed new restrictions on cargo {{to be carried}} aboard commercial aircraft. This had broad and immediate impact on the U. S.

50|$|FISCSI Mildenhall is a Navy Detachment of Fleet Industrial Supply Center Sigonella, Italy. The {{detachment}} {{was originally}} an aviation command known as Naval Air Facility Mildenhall, supporting Commander, US Naval Forces Europe (COMUSNAVEUR) headquarters in London. As NAF Mildenhall, the command {{was home to}} three Navy UC-12 Huron aircraft, and provided support for transient US Navy and US Marine Corps aircraft. With {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, the frequency of US naval aircraft transiting RAF Mildenhall dissipated, and with COMUSNAVEUR's subsequent relocation to Naples, Italy, the command's UC-12 aircraft were also reassigned. After being at RAF Mildenhall for more than 40 years, NAF Mildenhall was disestablished in 2005, downsized and then re-established as FISCSI Det Mildenhall. The mission of FISCSI Det Mildenhall is U.S. Navy fleet support in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe.

40|$|The problem {{argued in}} the {{literature}} of direct mailing decisions generally contains three parts: 1) forecasting customers' future purchase/non-purchase responses; 2) evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies for increasing customers purchase responses; 3) prioritising the customers in terms of their values. A significant body of the literature has been dedicated to the first two components, and in particular, to purchase/non-purchase prediction modelling. However, in the current paper, we do not address these two components, but rather we focus on the third component. To this end, data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique and particularly cross-efficiency formulation of the best practice frontier Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) (Charnes et al., 1978) (BPF-CCR) is used to determine those customers who should be put on the first <b>priorities</b> of marketing <b>mailing</b> list.

There are many measures that the USPS has identified and/or undertaken since the onset of the aforementioned situations. Some of these measures were permanent and some temporary. While the USPS is different in some respects from other businesses or organizations in general, there are certainly many parallels as well. In lights of this, there may be valuable lessons to be learned from the experiences and actions of the U. S. Postal Service.
