The sky is blank {{except for}} cumulus clouds to the left, and cumuo-cirrus to the right, of the Sugarloaf {{mountain}} itself, which occupies the centre background, {{with the sun}} shining on it from behind and somewhat {{to the left of}} Martens' vantage point. The view of the mountain is framed by a hilly shoreline scene. From left to centre, the midground shows the steadily falling contour of a densely wooded hill, with what may be an indication of cultivation terraces on the lower more distant slopes. At the foot of the hill in front of the possible terraces stands a large building, three storeys high in the middle, with single-storey extensions to either side. The central and right-hand parts of the ground floor are obscured by the low trees growing between it and the shoreline. The visible left-hand part shows four windows facing the viewer and three other windows facing left. On the second storey five windows face the viewer, and on the top floor two windows face the viewer above the gable ends of the second storey. The left-hand portion of the building has a greater expanse of roughly flat ground between it and the shoreline {{than the rest of the}} building. From centre to right in the midground, a hill rises steeply from between the hill on the left and the Sugarloaf, with indications of groups of trees growing on its sides at all heights. At its foot on the shoreline stands a small single-storey building with four windows; another small and more distant building appears in the fold between the two hills. The midground [...] foreground from the left centre to right-hand edge of the picture is occupied by a bay or inlet of calm water, on the nearside of which in the right centre there are three figures, the leftmost standing holding a basket on her head, the second seated with what may be a fishing rod, and the rightmost more distant standing apparently at the water's edge. What appear to be four fixed fishing rods are visible in the right foreground. From the foreground near the left-hand edge of the picture, a hillock rises abruptly to the same visual height as the hill in the left midground; at its foot at the water's edge a reed-like or rush-like stalk projects to a height of some 4 m; there are other smaller shrubs on the slopes of the hillock no more than 2 m tall, with distinctive large <b>palmate</b> or pinnate <b>leaf</b> shapes.
