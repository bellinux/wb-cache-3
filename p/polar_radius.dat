For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination which model is correct. The fluid interior structure of Uranus means {{that it has no}} solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.

For robot pose estimation, the heading rotation angle is estimated by correspondences establishing results and further corrected by an absolute-value function, and then the geometric property of PMWN called projected circle is used to estimate the robot translation. The extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of PMWN-based approach.
