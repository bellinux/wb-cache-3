25|$|N'Ko {{literature}} is evolving into a literary language, termed kangbe 'clear language', {{that is based}} on a compromise dialect of several Manding languages. Mande speakers use kangbe to communicate in writing. For example, the word for 'name' in Bamanan is tɔgɔ and in Maninka it is toh. In written communication each person will write it tô in N’Ko, and yet read and <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> as in their own language.|$|E
25|$|It is {{so called}} because its oldest known {{manuscript}} was bought for the abbey of Santa Croce Avellana by St. Peter Damian (died 1073), probably {{dates from the}} middle of the sixth century. It follows neither chronological nor logical order, and seems to have grown to its present shape according as the compiler met with the materials that he has transmitted to us. Nevertheless, Girolamo Ballerini and Pietro Ballerini <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> a valuable collection because of the great number of early canonical documents (nearly 200) that are found in no other collection.|$|E
25|$|Jordan's first band, drawn {{mainly from}} members of the Jesse Stone band, was {{originally}} a nine-piece group, but he soon scaled it down to a sextet after landing a residency at the Elks Rendezvous club, at 464 Lenox Avenue, in Harlem. The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing, as Louie Jordan's Elks Rendez-vous Band, his name was spelled Louie so people would know not to <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> Lewis.|$|E

25|$|When {{my husband}} was {{translating}} the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, {{and when he came}} to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> for him.|$|E
25|$|Graham Waterhouse {{composed}} Der Handschuh in 2005, {{as a kind}} of melodrama in {{the tradition}} of spoken narrative to instrumental accompaniment, such as ballads by Robert Schumann and Richard Strauss, a crucial scene of Weber's opera Der Freischütz and 20th century settings by Schoenberg, William Walton, Henze and Poulenc's L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant. It is the composer's first major work for the combination of Sprechstimme (speaking voice) and his instrument, the cello. Until then he had occasionally set texts to music for the unusual scoring. In 1995 he wrote Vezza, a limerick on whether/weather as a German might <b>pronounce</b> <b>it,</b> recorded in 2002 with the composer speaking and playing. In 2001 he set Flohlied (Song of the Flea), the satirical song from Goethe's Faust I, to music, published by Heinrichshofen's Verlag. The final poem of his song cycle Sechs späteste Lieder (six latest songs, 2003) after Friedrich Hölderlin for mezzo-soprano and cello is spoken.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{variation}} in the pronunciation of the first consonant of certain clusters, most commonly C or P in cç, ct, pç and pt. These consonants may be variably elided or conserved. For some words, this variation may exist inside a country, sometimes in all of them; for others, the variation is dialectal, with the consonant being always pronounced in one country and always elided in the other. This variation affects 0.5% of the language's vocabulary, or 575 words out of 110,000. In most cases, Brazilians variably conserve the consonant while speakers elsewhere have invariably ceased to <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> (for example, detector in Brazil versus detetor in Portugal). The inverse situation is rarer, occurring in words such as fa(c)to and conta(c)to (consonants never pronounced in Brazil, pronounced elsewhere). Until 2009, this reality could not be apprehended from the spelling: while Brazilians did not write consonants that were no longer pronounced, the spelling of the other countries retained them in many words as silent letters, usually when there was still a vestige of their presence in the pronunciation of the preceding vowel. This could give the false impression that European Portuguese was phonologically more conservative in this aspect, when in fact it was Brazilian Portuguese that retained more consonants in pronunciation.|$|E

I gave him a quick call {{and asked him if}} he could get on the record, and he recorded it and sent it over. As I expected, there was nothing I needed to change. It sounded perfect. He put my name in there, which is great – so people know to <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> now properly, hopefully." [...] The version featuring Ludacris was originally released digitally as the b-side to [...] "No Other One" [...] in November 2009, before in the United States in February 2010.|$|E
500|$|When the {{finished}} script was {{submitted to the}} Sebor-Bor production company, it was approved at first, {{only to have the}} chief of the script department <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> the dullest thing he'd read in years and urge Forman not to proceed with the project, since it would spoil the good reputation the director had established with Black Peter. In Forman's words: [...] "It wasn't arty enough, but, on the other hand, it didn't have enough commercial appeal either. It would offend and irritate the public, he told me, because it made fun of the common man, who would be disgusted by it." [...] Despite this objection, Vlastimil Harnach, the head of the studio, approved proceeding with the film in part because, due to the political and cultural thaw in Czechoslovakia at the time, decision makers were anxious to avoid the appearance of overt administrative interference in the creative process.|$|E
500|$|In November 1924, Fitzgerald {{wrote to}} Perkins that [...] "I have now decided {{to stick to}} the title I put on the book...

A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925, on March 19: 'CRAZY ABOUT TITLE UNDER THE RED WHITE AND BLUE STOP [...] WOULD DELAY BE'}} Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change. The Great Gatsby was published on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald remarked that [...] "the title is only fair, rather bad than good." ...|$|E

500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would {{have any idea what}} we were talking about. This was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> correctly, and the inclusion of the El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
500|$|The band {{completed}} the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing {{together for the}} first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs. After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only. One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a [...] "lead balloon", an idiom for disastrous results. The group dropped the 'a' in lead at the suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> [...] "leed". The word [...] "balloon" [...] was replaced by [...] "zeppelin", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought [...] "the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace" [...] to Page's mind.|$|E
