5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} its lower {{stratosphere}} is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet <b>photolysis</b> of methane, such as ethane and ethyne. The stratosphere {{is also home}} to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo <b>photolysis</b> in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, M. Räsänen and co-workers, {{scientists}} at the University of Helsinki in Finland, announced the preparation of xenon dihydride (HXeH), and later xenon hydride-hydroxide (HXeOH), hydroxenoacetylene (HXeCCH), and other Xe-containing molecules. In 2008, Khriachtchev et al. reported the preparation of HXeOXeH by the <b>photolysis</b> of water within a cryogenic xenon matrix. Deuterated molecules, HXeOD and DXeOH, have also been produced.|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane <b>photolysis</b> in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 2013, propene was {{detected}} in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, using its composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS). This {{is the first time}} propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft's first close flyby of Titan in 1980, during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up Titan's brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun's ultraviolet <b>photolysis</b> of methane.|$|E
5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by <b>photolysis</b> of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of the <b>photolysis</b> of TNT {{has been}} seen due to the color change to pink of the wastewaters when exposed to sunlight. <b>Photolysis</b> was more rapid in river water than in {{distilled}} water. Ultimately, <b>photolysis</b> affects the fate of TNT primarily in the aquatic environment but could also affect the reaction when exposed to sunlight on the soil surface.|$|E

25|$|In semibullvalene (C8H8), one {{ethylene}} arm {{is replaced}} by a single bond. The compound was first prepared by <b>photolysis</b> of barrelene in isopentane with acetone as a photosensitizer in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{constraints}} are available, {{with the}} current loss mostly due to low gravity and solar wind aided by <b>photolysis.</b> The loss of Titan's early atmosphere can be estimated with the 14N–15N isotopic ratio, because the lighter 14N is preferentially lost from the upper atmosphere under <b>photolysis</b> and heating. Because Titan's original 14N–15N ratio is poorly constrained, the early atmosphere may have had more N2 by factors ranging from 1.5 to 100 with certainty only in the lower factor. Because N2 is the primary component (98%) of Titan's atmosphere, the isotopic ratio suggests {{that much of the}} atmosphere has been lost over geologic time. Nevertheless, atmospheric pressure on its surface remains nearly 1.5 times that of Earth as it began with a proportionally greater volatile budget than Earth or Mars. It is possible that most of the atmospheric loss was within 50million years of accretion, from a highly energetic escape of light atoms carrying away {{a large portion of the}} atmosphere (hydrodynamic blow off event). Such an event could be driven by heating and <b>photolysis</b> effects of the early Sun's higher output of X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) photons.|$|E
25|$|Imidazole can be {{synthesized}} by the <b>photolysis</b> of 1-vinyltetrazole. This reaction {{will give}} substantial yields {{only if the}} 1-vinyltetrazole is made efficiently from an organotin compound, such as 2-tributylstannyltetrazole. The reaction, shown below, produces imidazole when R1 = R2 = R3 = hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|Nitrene {{addition}} to alkenes is a well-established method for {{the synthesis of}} aziridines. <b>Photolysis</b> or thermolysis of azides are good ways to generate nitrenes. Nitrenes can also be prepared in situ from iodosobenzene diacetate and sulfonamides, or the ethoxycarbonylnitrene from the N-sulfonyloxy precursor.|$|E
25|$|Sydney Chapman, a {{mathematician}} from Eccles, in 1930 explained the ozone-oxygen cycle in the stratosphere, {{being the first}} to propose that atmospheric oxygen or ozone molecules absorb (harmful UVB and UVC) ultraviolet wavelengths of light in <b>photolysis,</b> to produce reactive single atoms which accumulate to form the ozone layer.|$|E
25|$|Solutions of C60 can be oxygenated to the epoxide C60O. Ozonation of C60 in 1,2-xylene at 257K {{gives an}} {{intermediate}} ozonide C60O3, {{which can be}} decomposed into 2 forms of C60O. Decomposition of C60O3 at 296K gives the epoxide, but <b>photolysis</b> gives a product in which the O atom bridges a 5,6-edige.|$|E
25|$|The shorter {{bands of}} UVC, {{as well as}} even more-energetic UV {{radiation}} produced by the Sun, are absorbed by oxygen and generate the ozone in the ozone layer when single oxygen atoms produced by UV <b>photolysis</b> of dioxygen react with more dioxygen. The ozone layer is especially important in blocking most UVB and the remaining part of UVC not already blocked by ordinary oxygen in air.|$|E
25|$|The protons {{from the}} {{oxidized}} water molecules are {{released into the}} thylakoid lumen, thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient {{is the driving force}} for ATP synthesis via photophosphorylation and coupling the absorption of light energy and <b>photolysis</b> of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis. The O2 remaining after oxidation of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is, {{along with}} aldehydes, {{part of the}} series of cycles of chemical reactions that form photochemical smog. It reacts with hydroxyl radical (•OH) to produce a radical intermediate •HOCO, which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to O2 to form peroxy radical (HO2•) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with nitrogen oxide (NO) to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and hydroxyl radical. NO2 gives O(3P) via <b>photolysis,</b> thereby forming O3 following reaction with O2.|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} marine debris is plastic. Plastics {{accumulate}} because they typically do not biodegrade {{as many other}} substances do. They photodegrade on exposure to sunlight, although they do so only under dry conditions, as water inhibits <b>photolysis.</b> In a 2014 study using computers models, scientists from the group 5 Gyres, estimate 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic weighing 269,000 tons dispersed in oceans in similar amount in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and one-hundredth of them in particles in the scale of a sand-size.|$|E
25|$|A planet cannot have a hydrosphere—a key {{ingredient}} {{for the formation}} of carbon-based life—unless there is a source for water within its stellar system. The origin of water on Earth is still not completely understood; possible sources include the result of impacts with icy bodies, outgassing, mineralization, leakage from hydrous minerals from the lithosphere, and <b>photolysis.</b> For an extrasolar system, an icy body from beyond the frost line could migrate into the habitable zone of its star, creating an ocean planet with seas hundreds of kilometers deep such as GJ 1214 b or Kepler-22b may be.|$|E
25|$|The {{stratosphere}} is {{the middle}} layer of the Uranian atmosphere, in which temperature generally increases with altitude from 53K in the tropopause to between 800 and 850K at the base thermosphere. The heating of the stratosphere {{is caused by the}} downward heat conduction from the hot thermosphere as well as by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane <b>photolysis.</b> The methane enters the stratosphere through the cold tropopause, where its mixing ratio relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation. It decreases further to about 10−7 at the altitude corresponding to pressure of 0.1mbar.|$|E
25|$|Ozone reacts {{directly}} with some hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and thus begins their removal from the air, but {{the products are}} themselves key components of smog. Ozone <b>photolysis</b> by UV light leads to production of the hydroxyl radical HO• and this plays {{a part in the}} removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also {{the first step in the}} creation of components of smog such as peroxyacyl nitrates, which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO2•.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{possible}} to do some types of research using an irradiator much like that used for gamma sterilization, it is common in some areas of science to use a time resolved experiment where a material is subjected to a pulse of radiation (normally electrons from a LINAC). After the pulse of radiation, the concentration of different substances within the material are measured by emission spectroscopy or Absorption spectroscopy, hence the rates of reactions can be determined. This allows the relative abilities of substances to react with the reactive species generated by the action of radiation on the solvent (commonly water) to be measured. This experiment is known as pulse radiolysis which is closely related to Flash <b>photolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} phase III {{clinical}} trials are reached, {{the formulation of}} the drug should {{have been developed to}} be close to the preparation that will ultimately be used in the market. A knowledge of stability is essential by this stage, and conditions must have been developed to ensure that the drug is stable in the preparation. If the drug proves unstable, it will invalidate the results from clinical trials since {{it would be impossible to}} know what the administered dose actually was. Stability studies are carried out to test whether temperature, humidity, oxidation, or <b>photolysis</b> (ultraviolet light or visible light) have any effect, and the preparation is analysed to see if any degradation products have been formed.|$|E
25|$|Beckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925. In 1926 {{the couple}} {{moved back to}} California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became {{interested}} in ultraviolet <b>photolysis</b> and worked with his doctoral advisor, Roscoe G. Dickinson, on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple, converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a galvanometer. After receiving a Ph.D. in photochemistry in 1928 for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor {{and then as a}} professor. Linus Pauling, another of Roscoe G. Dickinson's graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.|$|E
25|$|One {{insight into}} the {{reaction}} mechanism for this photoreaction is given by an isotope scrambling experiment. The 6 vinylic protons in barrelene 1 are more acidic than the two bridgehead protons and therefore they can be replaced by deuterium with N-deuteriocyclohexylamide. <b>Photolysis</b> of 2 results in the initial formation of an biradical intermediate with a cyclopropane ring formed. This product rearranges to a second intermediate with a more favorable allylic radical as two mesomers. Intersystem crossing and radical recombination results in equal quantities of semibullvalenes 3 and 4. The new proton distribution with allylic, vinylic and cyclopropanyl protons determined with proton NMR confirms this model. As noted, the conversion of barrelene to semibullvalene is a di-pi-methane rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|DDT is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, <b>photolysis</b> and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E
25|$|Because Callisto and Ganymede are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} Titan, {{it is unclear}} why their atmospheres are insignificant relative to Titan's. Nevertheless, the origin of Titan's N2 via geologically ancient <b>photolysis</b> of accreted and degassed NH3, as opposed to degassing of N2 from accretionary clathrates, {{may be the key}} to a correct inference. Had N2 been released from clathrates, 36Ar and 38Ar that are inert primordial isotopes of the Solar System should also be present in the atmosphere, but neither has been detected in significant quantities. The insignificant concentration of 36Ar and 38Ar also indicates that the ~40K temperature required to trap them and N2 in clathrates did not exist in the Saturnian subnebula. Instead, the temperature may have been higher than 75K, limiting even the accumulation of NH3 as hydrates. Temperatures would have been even higher in the Jovian subnebula due to the greater gravitational potential energy release, mass, and proximity to the Sun, greatly reducing the NH3 inventory accreted by Callisto and Ganymede. The resulting N2 atmospheres may have been too thin to survive the atmospheric erosion effects that Titan has withstood.|$|E

Anion channels have several major functions in controlling stomatal closing: (a) They allow release of anions, such as chloride and malate from guard cells, which is needed for stomatal closing. (b) Anion channels are activated by signals that cause stomatal closing, for example by intracellular calcium and ABA. The resulting release of negatively charged anions from guard cells results in an electrical shift of the membrane to more positive voltages (depolarization) at the intracellular surface of the guard cell plasma membrane. This electrical depolarization of guard cells leads to activation of the outward potassium channels {{and the release of}} potassium through these channels. At least two major types of anion channels have been characterized in the plasma membrane: S-type anion channels and R-type anion channels.|$|E
