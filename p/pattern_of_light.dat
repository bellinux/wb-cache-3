5|$|The DU {{spectrophotometer}} or Beckman DU, {{introduced in}} 1941, {{was the first}} commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. This model of spectrophotometer enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its absorption spectrum, the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> absorbed at different wavelengths. Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{good deal}} of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E

25|$|The Desert Battle Dress Uniform was {{designed}} in 1976 {{and uses a}} camouflage pattern known as the Six-Color Desert Pattern or colloquially as Chocolate-Chip Camouflage and Cookie Dough Camouflage. The camouflage received its nickname because it resembles chocolate-chip cookie dough. It {{is made up of}} a base <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> tan overlaid with broad swathes of pale green and wide two-tone bands of brown. Clusters of black-on-white spots are scattered over, to mimic the appearance of pebbles and their shadows.|$|E
25|$|In {{species such}} as the Coleopteran family Lampyridae, the males fly in the {{darkness}} and emit a species-species specific <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> flashes, which are answered by perching receptive females. The color and temporal variation of the flash {{contribute to the success}} in attracting females. Acoustic signals are produced by many groups including several orthopeteran species, neuropterida, cicadas, flies, cave planthroppers, leaf hoppers, and tree hoppers. In crickets and other Orthopeterans, loudness and/or uninterrupted songs often attract more females. In other insects, females may choose a mate in relation to aspects of his songs. In any case, it is possible that females compare the songs of several males before making a choice.|$|E
25|$|In the double-slit experiment, as {{originally}} performed by Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel in 1827, {{a beam of}} light is directed through two narrow, closely spaced slits, producing an interference <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark bands on a screen. If one of the slits is covered up, one might naively expect that the intensity of the fringes due to interference would be halved everywhere. In fact, a much simpler pattern is seen, a simple diffraction pattern. Closing one slit results in a much simpler pattern diametrically opposite the open slit. Exactly the same behavior can be demonstrated in water waves, and so the double-slit experiment was seen as a demonstration of the wave nature of light.|$|E
50|$|Light refracted or {{reflected}} causes patterns called caustics, usually {{visible as}} concentrated patches <b>of</b> <b>light</b> on nearby surfaces. For example, as light rays {{pass through a}} wine glass sitting on a table, they are refracted and <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are visible on the table.

25|$|Because of the {{brightness}} of Australian sunlight, it was decided {{at the time of}} construction to glaze the clerestorey with yellow glass. This glazing has darkened over the years, permitting little light to enter. The yellow glazing contrasts with the predominantly blue stained glass of the lower windows. To counteract the darkness, the cathedral installed extensive lighting in the 1970s, designed to give more-or-less equal illumination to all parts of the buildings. The interior is lit with a diffuse yellow glow, which, like the upper windows, is in contrast to the effects of the natural light which penetrates through the white areas of the stained glass. The installed lighting counteracts the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade that would normally exists in a cathedral of the Gothic style by illuminating most brightly those parts of the structure which would normally be subdued.|$|E
25|$|The Gamma Cygni Nebula (IC 1318) {{includes}} both bright and dark nebulae {{in an area}} of over 4 degrees. DWB 87 is another of the many bright emission nebulae in Cygnus, 7.8 by 4.3 arcminutes. It is in the Gamma Cygni area. Two other emission nebulae include Sharpless 2-112 and Sharpless 2-115. When viewed in an amateur telescope, Sharpless 2–112 appears to be in a teardrop shape. More of the nebula's eastern portion is visible with an O III (doubly ionized oxygen) filter. There is an orange star of magnitude 10 nearby and a star of magnitude 9 near the nebula's northwest edge. Further to the northwest, there is a dark rift and another bright patch. The whole nebula measures 15 arcminutes in diameter. Sharpless 2–115 is another emission nebula with a complex <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark patches. Two pairs of stars appear in the nebula; it is larger near the southwestern pair. The open cluster Berkeley 90 is embedded in this large nebula, which measures 30 by 20 arcminutes.|$|E

500|$|There {{are five}} stages to the {{waterspout}} life cycle. [...] Initially, a prominent circular, light-colored disk {{appears on the}} surface of the water, surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape. After the formation of these colored disks on the water, a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark-colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface. [...] Then, a dense [...] of sea spray, called a cascade, appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an eye. [...] Eventually, the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud. [...] The spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves. [...] Eventually, the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens, ending the waterspout's life cycle.|$|E
500|$|Whale {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by German Expressionism. He was a particular admirer of the films of Paul Leni, combining as they did elements of gothic horror and comedy. This influence was most evident in Bride of Frankenstein. Expressionist influence is also in evidence in Frankenstein, drawn {{in part from the}} work of Paul Wegener and his films The Golem (1915) and [...] (1920) along with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) from Robert Wiene, which Whale reportedly screened repeatedly while preparing to shoot Frankenstein. Frankenstein roughly alternates between distorted expressionistic shots and more conventional styles, with the character of Dr. Waldman serving as [...] "a bridge between everyday and expressionist spaces". Expressionist influence is also evident in the acting, costuming and the design of the Monster. Whale and makeup artist Jack Pierce may also have been influenced by the Bauhaus school of design. The expressionist influence lasted throughout Whale's career, with Whale's final film, Hello Out There, praised by Sight & Sound as [...] "a virtuoso <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade, a piece of fully blown expressionist filmmaking plonked down unceremoniously in the midst of neo-realism's heyday".|$|E

500|$|Titan, at 5,150km diameter, is {{the second}} largest moon in the Solar System and Saturn's largest. Out of all the large moons, Titan {{is the only one}} with a dense (surface {{pressure}} of 1.5atm), cold atmosphere, primarily made of nitrogen with a small fraction of methane. The dense atmosphere frequently produces bright white convective clouds, especially over the south pole region. On June 6, 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan. On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. The surface of Titan, which is difficult to observe due to persistent atmospheric haze, shows only a few impact craters and is probably very young. It contains a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark regions, flow channels and possibly cryovolcanos. Some dark regions are covered by longitudinal dune fields shaped by tidal winds, where sand is made of frozen water or hydrocarbons. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan's north and south polar regions. The largest lake, Kraken Mare, is larger than the Caspian Sea. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt {{to the surface of the}} moon and lead to cryovolcanism. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be [...] "as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea".|$|E
2500|$|Direction {{refers to}} the shape, quality and {{evenness}} of a lamp's output. [...] The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> an instrument makes is largely determined by three factors. [...] The first are {{the specifics of the}} lamp, reflector and lens assembly. [...] Different mounting positions for the lamp (axial, base up, base down), different sizes and shapes of reflector {{and the nature of the}} lens (or lenses) being used can all affect the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> [...] Secondly, the specifics of how the lamp is focused affect its pattern. [...] In ellipsoidal reflector spotlights (ERS) or profile spotlights, there are two beams of light emitted from the lamp. [...] When the cones of both intersect at the throw distance (the distance to the stage), the lamp has a sharply defined 'hard' edge. [...] When the two cones do not intersect at that distance, the edge is fuzzy and 'soft'. [...] Depending on which beam (direct or reflected) is outside the other, the pattern may be 'thin and soft' or 'fat and soft'. Lastly, a gobo or break up pattern may be applied to ERSs and similar instruments. [...] This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. [...] It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. [...] Gobos, or templates, [...] come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.|$|E
2500|$|Phryganoporus candidus, {{sometimes}} called the foliage webbing spider, is a spider widespread, but endemic in Australia. [...] It is up to 10mm long, silvery grey to brown with a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark brown markings on the abdomen. Unlike most other spiders, P. candidus lives socially at one stage: Spiderlings live together in a nest built on foliage until they reach the subadult stage. The males even stay into the adult stage and only then leave. This communal nest has an inner retreat area, many entrance holes opening into a network of interconnecting passages, and an outer area made out of cribellate silk for prey capture. One nest can in extreme cases house more than 600 spiders. Nests of this size attract many arthropod parasites. [...] The species name is derived from Latin candidus [...] "shining white", referring {{to the color of}} the legs.|$|E
40|$|Light is {{all around}} us – even when {{we do not see}} it. Our eyes do not detect the higher energy and shorter-than-visible-wavelength {{ultraviolet}} radiation, yet we know it is there from the sunburn we receive in Arizona. We know that window glass can block ultraviolet rays so we do not get a burn while driving with the windows rolled up. Our eyes do not detect the low-energy, long-wavelength infrared (IR) radiation but we know it exists from discussions of war applications and televised images of guided weapons targets. We also know about radio waves from the little boxes that talk to us and x-rays from the dentist's office. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light,</b> Chasing the Spectrum from Aristotle to LEDs, written by Steve Beeson and Jim Mayer starts with the visible – the straight path <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> It continues with chapters detailing reflection (mirrors, storefront windows) and refraction (eyeglasses, binoculars). Color is then introduced with the query "Why is the sky blue?" After answering that and other similar questions ("Why is snow white?"), the book goes beyond the visible to the infrared and ultraviolet. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light’s</b> many colorful photos and figures further aid in the reader’s grasp of the concepts discussed. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> is a descriptive, rather than technical, book with the mathematics behind light included in the appendices.
