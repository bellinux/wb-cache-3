50|$|Density of loading {{refers to}} the mass of an {{explosive}} per unit volume. Several methods of loading are available, including pellet loading, cast loading, and <b>press</b> <b>loading,</b> the choice being determined by {{the characteristics of the}} explosive. Dependent upon the method employed, an average density of the loaded charge can be obtained that is within 80-99% of the theoretical maximum density of the explosive. High load density can reduce sensitivity by making the mass more resistant to internal friction. However, if density is increased to the extent that individual crystals are crushed, the explosive may become more sensitive. Increased load density also permits the use of more explosive, thereby increasing the power of the warhead. It is possible to compress an explosive beyond a point of sensitivity, known also as dead-pressing, in which the material is no longer capable of being reliably initiated, if at all.|$|E

A Ceramification System Test Facility (CSTF) is being built at LLNL, while the actual Plutonium Immobilization Plant (PIP) will be built at Savannah River Site (SRS). The materials are formed into ceramic-based pucks in {{what is called the}} First Stage Immobilization (FSI) process. The FSI puck handling system will provide automatic conveyance of pucks through several process steps beginning with removing the ''green'' pucks from the forming <b>press,</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading the pucks into/from a sintering furnace, and ending with loading the sintered pucks into transport cans for removal from the CSTF glovebox.

Ancillary equipment is also being developed and integrated with the puck handling system to determine the mass and geometric properties of both the green and sintered pucks. Although the CSTF is intended to demonstrate equipment that is prototypical of plant systems, significant differences exist between the envisioned plant and the LLNL CSTF with respect to their respective puck handling systems. LLNL and SRS both recognize this disparity, and although the CSTF puck handling system will not be plant prototypic in overall form, it will, however, be useful in addressing several plant-relevant puck-handling issues. Thus, the CSTF puck handling system will provide both short-term benefits for operation of the CSTF itself at LLNL, and support an overall project goal of demonstrating plant prototypic equipment for the SRS facility...|$|E

This paper deals with a process whereby a preheated thermoplastic plain-woven carbon fiber fabric sheet is formed into a circular cup by a mechanical servo-press. The effects of press parameters, specifically the bottom dead center and slide speed in the forming of CFRTP cup, on the <b>press</b> <b>load,</b> pressure, internal temperature, shape accuracy, and internal structure have been investigated. A plain-woven carbon-fiber-reinforced PA 6 thermoplastic sheet was used. The sheet consisted of four layers of woven 3 K carbon and had a thickness of 1 mm. The sheet was heated to 320 °C under a halogen heater so that it would be around the recommended temperature for forming 260 °C after transfer to the mold. The sheet was pressed into a circular cup shape by a cold mold while the periphery was cramped by a heated holder so as not to cool the sheet before it was pulled into the mold cave. Die clearance was designed considering the thickness increase due to the fiber concentration during the forming. By increasing the slide stroke to the bottom dead center, the applied <b>press</b> <b>load</b> was increased and the internal structure was improved, showing no voids. By increasing the slide speed, the final <b>press</b> <b>load</b> was reduced and shape accuracy was improved through a good pressure distribution on the mold. Measurement of the surface temperature of the sheet during the forming revealed that it remained in the melting region of the resin in the case of fast slide speed, but dropped below the melting temperature in the case of low slide speed. This difference apparently led to spring-in or spring-back after the forming. The experimental results indicate that appropriate balance among press speed, bottom dead center, and sheet temperature is important in the high-cycle forming of CFRTP. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.

40|$|The under-drive {{brake piston}} is an {{essential}} part in the automatic transmissions of automobiles. This component is manufactured by forging after blanking from S 55 C plate with a thickness of 6 mm. It is difficult to design the plate forging process using a thick plate approach since there will be limited material flow as well as large <b>press</b> <b>loads.</b> Furthermore, the under-drive brake piston has a complex shape with a right angle step, which often results in die unfill and abrupt increase in <b>press</b> <b>load.</b> To overcome these obstacles, a separate die for filling material sufficiently to the corner of the right angle step is proposed. However, this approach induces an uncontrolled workpiece surface between the dies, resulting in flash. This excess flash degrades the tool life in the final machining after cold forging as well as increases the cycle time to obtain the net-shape of the part. In the current study, we propose an optimum process design using a conventional die shaped with the benefit of finite element analysis. This approach enhanced the process efficiency without sacrificing the dimensional accuracy in the forged part.

During the remaining sessions they performed eccentric-only repetitions to failure using supra-maximal loads equivalent to 110 %, 120 % and 130 % of their 1 -RM value with a constant cadence (30 repsmin- 1). Force plates and a three dimensional motion analysis system were used during these final three sessions in order to evaluate kinematic and kinetic variables. More repetitions were completed during the 110 % 1 -RM condition compared to the 130 % 1 -RM condition (p= 0. 01). Mean total work (p= 0. 046) as well as vertical force (p= 0. 049), vertical work (p= 0. 017), and vertical power output (p= 0. 05) were significantly greater during the 130 % 1 -RM condition compared to the 110 % 1 -RM condition.

40|$|In this paper, Finite Element {{method and}} {{full-scale}} experiments {{have been used}} to study a hot forging method for fabrication of a spindle using reduced initial stock size. The forging sequence is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the hot rolled cylindrical billet is pre-formed and pierced in a closed die using a spherical nosed punch to within 20 mm of its base. This process of piercing or impact extrusion leads to high strains within the work piece but requires high <b>press</b> <b>loads.</b> In the second stage, the resulting cylinder is placed in a die with a flange chamber and upset forged to form a flange. The stock mass is optimized for complete die filling. Process parameters such as effective strain distribution, material flow and forging load in different stages of the process are analyzed. It is concluded from the simulations that minor modifications of piercing punch geometry to reduce contact between the punch and emerging vertical walls of the cylinder appreciably reduces the piercing load. In the flange chamber, a die surfaces angle of 52 ° instead of 45 ° is proposed to ensure effective material flow and exert sufficient tool pressure to achieve complete cavity filling.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to test reports that size and arrangement manipulations of weight plates (i. e., inducing a size-weight illusion [SWI]) would have an effect on athletic weightlifting performance. The participants were 72 experienced, weight-trained collegiate American football players. Across 3 weeks, each athlete performed three different repetitions-to-fatigue bench press tests (NFL- 225, SWI- 225, and SWI- 215). A multiple regression revealed a positive association between participants' strength relative to the test load and repetitions for NFL- 225 and SWI- 215, but no association with SWI- 225. To explore these results, players were ranked into quartiles based on their one-repetition maximum relative to 102. 27 [*]kg (225 [*]lb), and a 3 [*]×[*] 4 repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted. The primary finding was a significant Test Condition[*]×[*]Quartile interaction (p[*]=[*]. 004).

The Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) along {{the front of a}} semi elliptical crack, initiated from the external surface of a hollow axle, are calculated for bending and <b>press</b> fit <b>loading</b> separately and for a combination of them. In correspondence of the latter loading condition, a crack propagation is also simulated, with the crack growth rates calculated using the NASGRO 3 formula, calibrated for the material under analysis (steel ASTM A 469). The J-integral and COD approaches are selected for SIFs calculation in DBEM environment, where the crack path is assessed by the minimum strain energy density criterion (MSED). In correspondence of the initial crack scenario, SIFs along the crack front are also calculated by the Finite Element (FE) code ZENCRACK, using COD, in order to provide, by a cross comparison with DBEM, an assessment on the level of accuracy obtained. Due to the symmetry of the bending problem a pure mode I crack propagation is realised with no kinking of the propagating crack whereas for <b>press</b> fit <b>loading</b> the crack propagation becomes mixed mode. The crack growth analysis is nonlinear because of normal gap elements used to model the press fit condition with added friction, and is developed in an iterative-incremental procedure. From the analysis of the SIFs results related to the initial cracked configuration, it is possible {{to assess the impact of}} the press fit condition when superimposed to the bending load case...|$|R
50|$|Generally, the slurry {{that will}} be {{separated}} is injected {{into the center of}} the press and each chamber of the press is filled. Optimal filling time will ensure the last chamber of the <b>press</b> is <b>loaded</b> before the mud in the first chamber begins to cake. As the chambers fill, pressure inside the system will increase due to the formation of thick sludge. Then, the liquid is strained through filter cloths by force using compressed air or water. Pressurized water requires more time to pass through the chambers compared to pressurized air, but the use of water could be more cost-efficient in certain cases, such as if water was re-used from a previous process.|$|R
