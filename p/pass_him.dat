5|$|After losing 10th {{place in}} the Constructors' Championship to Caterham, Marussia's {{director}} of engineering Nikolai Fomenko accused driver Charles Pic of deliberately letting Vitaly Petrov <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> due to Pic having already {{signed a contract with}} Caterham for next season. However, no actions were taken following these accusations.|$|E

5|$|After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's {{relationship}} with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a pedestrian bridge (above the ground, {{and over the}} fences of the mansion) {{so he could see}} her at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although this may have been justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E

50|$|Then, on lap 36, {{he began}} to drop back with {{hydraulic}} troubles. Senna, Brundle, Schumacher and Berger all <b>passed</b> <b>him.</b> He trolled round and retired in the pits on lap 41. Patrese led but then Senna began to close in. Patrese also began to suffer from hydraulic troubles and Senna <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> on lap 49. On the next lap, both Brundle and Schumacher found a way through. Patrese held fourth until the last lap when Berger <b>passed</b> <b>him.</b> Senna won from Brundle, Schumacher, Berger, the hobbling Patrese and de Cesaris.|$|R
60|$|As Lothair rose, Miss Arundel <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> with {{streaming}} eyes.|$|R
5|$|Although Vettel and Alonso {{were on the}} grids' front row, both {{drivers were}} passed by Massa {{at the start of}} the race. Alonso and Massa traded the fastest times in the first twelve laps of the race until the pit stop period. Massa {{struggled}} with tyre temperatures and was challenged by Alonso on the 21st lap but fended off his efforts to move into the lead. Massa pulled away slightly from Alonso until the former came across slower cars which reduced the time deficit between them. Alonso took over the first position after Massa was issued with team orders by Ferrari which Alonso to <b>pass</b> <b>him.</b> Massa resisted pressure from Vettel while Alonso maintained the lead throughout the remainder of the race and clinched the 23rd victory of his career.|$|E
5|$|As Rosberg was {{comfortably in}} the lead, still 18 seconds ahead of Vettel, Verstappen took ninth place from Massa going into turn one on lap 46. Red Bull {{teammate}} Ricciardo also gained a place, at Hülkenberg's expense, {{at the same}} spot three laps later. With Räikkönen facing a five-second time penalty for crossing the pit exit line, Pérez behind him {{would not have to}} <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> to achieve third place as long as he stayed within five seconds of him. Pérez nevertheless made the move on the final lap to finish in the final podium position. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg crossed the line to win the Grand Prix, more than 16 seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn {{to take the lead}} as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not <b>pass</b> <b>him.</b> Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E
60|$|Brother Higgs, <b>passing</b> <b>him</b> {{some more}} beef, pressed for details.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look 'ere, where 'e comes, Bill 'Awkins! [...] Now what in {{the devil}} will you say?"

60|$|She <b>passed</b> <b>him,</b> {{and picking}} up her skirts, paused in the window.|$|R
5|$|Häkkinen {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Michael Schumacher {{on the front}} row of the grid. Michael Schumacher attempted to defend his lead off the line by moving into Häkkinen's path, but Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher heading into the first corner, with Coulthard withstanding Williams driver Ralf Schumacher attempts to <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> to maintain third position. Michael Schumacher managed to close the gap to his title rival by lap 31 and passed Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops. This allowed him to maintain a 1.9-second gap between himself and Häkkinen {{towards the end of the}} race to secure his eighth victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> {{going into the}} first corner. Further around the lap, a collision involving four cars prompted the deployment of the safety car and a fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti {{was struck by a}} flying wheel. When the safety car pulled into the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Häkkinen and kept the lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to <b>pass</b> <b>him,</b> while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|E
60|$|John Drayton {{sat down}} and {{accepted}} the cigar which Weiss <b>passed</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|The kick made Jackson lose ground, {{and like}} a flash Dick <b>passed</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|As he <b>passed</b> <b>him,</b> La Boulaye laid a detaining hand {{upon his}} arm.|$|R
5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding {{up the rest of the}} field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to <b>pass</b> <b>him.</b> A glass bottle appeared on the outside of the track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E
5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as good as he hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
5|$|Gidley {{lost control}} of the {{rear-end}} of his car exiting turn 11 while accelerating and hit the outside wall which broke his right-front suspension on the same lap. He stopped on the frontstretch and retired from the race. Gidley was unhurt. The ninth period of yellow flags were shown on lap 73 to allow track officials to recover Gidley's damaged car. The race resumed on lap 76 with Andretti leading the field. The tenth caution was necessitated when de Ferran went to the inside of turn three and came across the front wing of da Matta. Jourdain was collected, and Kanaan spun to avoid the two drivers who temporarily blocked the track. De Ferran, da Matta and Jourdain retired, while Kanaan continued without damaging his car. Andretti retained his lead at the lap-79 restart, Fittipaldi was passed by Fernández for fourth position in the first turn. Zanardi moved from eighth to sixth by lap 82, while Fernández got ahead of Junqueira for third on the same lap. Between the 85th and 86th laps, Fittipaldi drove aggressively in an attempt to move in front of Junqueira for fourth but was unable to <b>pass</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|But {{she broke}} from <b>him,</b> and <b>passed</b> <b>him,</b> and fled down the lane.|$|R
60|$|With those words, she <b>passed</b> <b>him,</b> {{and laid}} {{her hand on}} the door.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{consecutive}} 100-yard receiving games (three), until Michael Irvin <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> in 1995 with four.|$|R
5|$|Hamilton {{set a new}} fastest lap of {{the race}} on lap 47 to reduce the time deficit to Vettel to 7.9 seconds. Petrov began to {{challenge}} de la Rosa for 12th place on the same lap. Hülkenberg's right rear tyre delaminated on lap 50, causing damage to his car's exhaust system and became the race's final retirement. Kobayashi made his only pit stop of the event on lap 53 and rejoined in ninth position behind Alonso. Button was worried about a possible post-race time penalty and pushed hard to record the overall fastest lap of the race, a 1:38.766, on the 54th lap. Alonso challenged Buemi for seventh place on lap 55 {{but was unable to}} <b>pass</b> <b>him.</b> Kobayashi ran closely behind Alonso and passed him around the inside for eighth when Alonso ran wide at turn 17 on the following lap. Buemi was overtaken by Kobayashi at the final corner on the last lap of the race to clinch seventh.|$|E
5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} {{beside the}} barriers of the circuit on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into the pit lane {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to the pit lane on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to <b>pass</b> <b>him.</b> Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced wide in avoidance. Later on Alesi collided with Diniz and struck the barriers, having lost his car's two left wheels. The safety car was once again deployed as carbon fibre was scattered across the grass.|$|E
5|$|On lap 37, Trulli and Nico Rosberg were {{battling for}} {{position}} going into turn 1. Both span {{off the track}} in almost synchronised fashion without touching each other. This occurrence amused reporters due to it resembling a form of dance. Both drivers were able to keep going. Also on this lap Anthony Davidson made an unscheduled pit stop. He claimed after the race that a beaver had damaged his front wing although Canadian reports said it {{more likely to have}} been a groundhog. One lap later David Coulthard was forced to retire due to a gearbox problem. Ralf Schumacher also stopped on this lap and this allowed Massa, Fisichella and Sato to move ahead of both of them. Räikkönen had his second pit stop on lap 52 at the same time as Alonso. The latter was able to <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> just after they had exited the pits side-by-side. This moved him into 5th.|$|E
60|$|She <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> a telegram. It {{was from}} Paris, {{and it was}} signed Gilbert Deyes.|$|R
60|$|MISS T. (Aside.) I haven't <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> {{more than}} fifty times. (Aloud.) Nearly every day.|$|R
60|$|The Red Rogue gladly granted them admittance, {{and they}} <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> {{and entered the}} great hall.|$|R
5|$|Tagliani ran {{in sixth}} gear after his team {{ordered him to}} {{conserve}} fuel {{and was unable to}} generate enough heat into his tires to challenge Andretti on the restarts. On lap 87, Fittipaldi tried an overtaking manoevure on Junqueira around the outside of turn three which resulted in Fittipaldi and Junqueira making contact and both drivers slid into the outside tire barrier. Andretti's lead of 7.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when the eleventh (and final) caution was displayed on the next lap to allow course officials to extract Fittipaldi's and Junquiera's cars from the track. Racing resumed on lap 90 with Andretti retaining the first position and pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Fernández's radio had malfunctioned and was in another gear in an attempt to save fuel which allowed Tagliani to <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> for second. However, Tagliani was unable to close the gap to Andretti because of the presence of Junqueira's lapped car which cost him more than two seconds. He drove on the track's dirty side on the backstraight and his tires were cleaned in the next five turns on the track.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} behind the safety {{car with the}} drivers in the positions held before the suspension. The safety car remained out for fourteen laps, during which the standing water was reduced as the cars circulated the track. Schumacher, Liuzzi and Yamamoto left the circuit during this period but were all able to rejoin. Di Grassi made a pit stop for new tyres three times under safety car and Senna made a pit stop {{at the end of}} the first lap. Once the safety car drove into the pit lane, cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel maintained his pole-position lead going into the first turn with Webber close behind. Further back, Schumacher passed Kubica for eighth place. Senna and Trulli spun off onto the run-off area but both drivers were able to continue. Rosberg passed Hamilton by taking the inside line to take fourth place at the third corner. Button tried to overtake Massa heading into turn four but ran wide. He momentarily lost the advantage and fended off Schumacher's attempts to <b>pass</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alonso lapped {{consistently}} {{in the low}} 1:19 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap of the race on lap41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12seconds. Räikkönen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop {{for the second time}} on lap43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of understeer over the team radio, made his second stop on lap46, two laps ahead of Räikkönen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to <b>pass</b> <b>him</b> and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap52, Räikkönen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but Räikkönen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the racing line as Räikkönen left the track at the run-off area. Räikkönen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from Räikkönen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.|$|E
60|$|Sam <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> {{with a cold}} {{face and}} hurried through the door leading to the companion-way.|$|R
60|$|Desmond {{was waiting}} for her when she came out, but she <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> with a gesture.|$|R
2500|$|After leading three laps, Ragan {{was passed}} by Kurt Busch. Two laps later, Joey Logano passed Kurt Busch for the lead. Logano led until lap 19, when Jeff Burton <b>passed</b> <b>him.</b> A lap later, the {{aforementioned}} competition caution was thrown. Robby Gordon stayed out of pit road to receive the lead, but two laps later Kurt Busch <b>passed</b> <b>him</b> {{when he was going}} to pit road.|$|R
