Upon her return she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. Renown became the flagship of the BCS when Hood was refitting between 1929 and 1931. Hood reassumed the role as flagship after she was recommissioned and Renown was paid off for a refit of her own. A High-Angle Control System Mark I was fitted with a director {{on the roof of the}} fore-top that replaced the high-angle rangefinder and the conning tower platform was enlarged to accommodate a pair of Mk V octuple mountings for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun The Mk V mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 80°. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] to a distance of [...] The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute. Only one mount was initially available, however, and it, along with its director, was fitted on the starboard side. Renown had her midships triple 4-inch mount removed to make room for an aircraft catapult that was not fitted until 1933. The <b>port</b> <b>Mark</b> V 2-pounder mount was finally fitted, albeit without its director, that same year. The ship now carried a Fairey III floatplane for reconnaissance purposes. The flying-off platform was also removed.|$|E
60|$|It {{was decided}} that Mark should {{continue}} in the Rancocus for another voyage. It was known the ship was to proceed {{to some of the}} islands of the Pacific, in quest of a cargo of sandal-wood and bêche-le-mar, for the Chinese market, and that her next absence from home would be longer, even, than her last. By the time the vessel returned, Mark would be of age, and fit to command a ship himself, should it be thought expedient for him to continue in his profession. During the period the vessel still remained in <b>port,</b> <b>Mark</b> was to pay occasional visits to his wife, though not to live with her; but the young couple might correspond by letter, as often as they pleased. Such was an outline of the treaty made between the high contracting parties.|$|E

50|$|Ahead of the torpedoes on PT-109 {{were two}} depth charges, omitted on most PTs, {{one on each}} side, about the same {{diameter}} as the torpedoes. These were designed to be used against submarines, but were sometimes used by PT commanders to confuse and discourage pursuing destroyers. At one point, the <b>port</b> <b>Mark</b> 6 depth charge was knocked through the foredeck by the port forward torpedo when the torpedo was inadvertently launched while PT 109 maneuvered in high seas during a storm with Kennedy's squadron commander, Lt. Alvin Cluster, at the wheel. Cluster had asked Kennedy for a turn at PT 109's wheel, as he had only had experience with the older, Elco 77-foot PTs. The torpedo stayed in the tube, half in and half out on a hot run, its propellers spinning, until Kennedy's executive officer Ensign Leonard Thom deactivated it. PT 109 returned to Tulagi for repairs to the foredeck and {{the replacement of the}} depth charge.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This article aims at {{clarifying}} {{the issues and}} innovations of the new port legislation {{taking into account the}} factors involved in the regulatory process. The purpose is to investigate the extent to which innovations fit the port structure for a better functioning of ports. Methodology/approach/design – It adopted an inductive method of approach supported by a set of data {{in order to try to}} discover and confirm the hypothesis of regulation applied to performance parameters, as prescribed in the new <b>port</b> <b>mark,</b> also considering legislation in its moral context. Findings – The new Port Law sheds light on prospects of economic growth, although its exact impact is still uncertain, since the barriers to development are mainly attributed to the high cost and low efficiency in operations. Practical implications – It aims at collaborating with the port sector, not only through a collaborator point of view, but also as an academic view assisted by studies related to the topic. Originality/value – Its importance lies, methodologically, on conceptualizing the key terms used in the equilibrium analysis and on the early extension of port contracts, emphasizing the normative propositions of the new port regulatory framework that takes into account efficiency and also the possible negative effects, including the regulatory capture...|$|E

5|$|Savary's {{return to}} <b>port</b> <b>marked</b> {{the end of}} the last attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland. French losses in the operation were so severe that a repeat effort was never seriously contemplated. Similarly, the huge Irish losses during the rebellion, combined with British reprisals against the Irish populace, ended any hopes of reigniting the uprising in the near future. Most serious of all for the United Irishmen was the arrest of Wolfe Tone himself, who was discovered among the prisoners taken from Hoche at Buncrana. Tone was charged with treason and sentenced to death, though he committed suicide in Dublin before the sentence could be carried out.|$|R
