40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discusses}} the disturbance estimation problem for continuous-time multivariable dynamical systems with arbitrarily relative degrees. The disturbances, which are assumed bounded, {{refer to the}} combination of the external disturbances, the nonlinearities and the model uncertainties of the system. First, the disturbance observer is proposed for multivariable minimum <b>phase</b> <b>systems.</b> Then, the proposed formulation is extended to nonminimum <b>phase</b> <b>systems,</b> where the nonminimum <b>phase</b> <b>systems</b> are approximated by minimum <b>phase</b> <b>systems</b> based on the least square approximation technique. The estimation error of the disturbances is controlled by the design parameters.
