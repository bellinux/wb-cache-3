5|$|The same {{social forces}} that had built these resorts {{in the nineteenth}} century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth. Transport links {{continued}} to improve and it became possible to travel overseas quickly and affordably. The Belgian coast at Ostend became popular with Northern working-class tourists {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, and the introduction of <b>package</b> <b>holidays</b> in the 1970s was the death of most Northern seaside resorts. Blackpool has maintained a focus on tourism, and remains one of the most visited towns in England, but visitor numbers are far below their peak and the town's economy has suffered – both employment rates and average earnings remain below the regional average.|$|E

2500|$|During the Victorian era Penarth was {{a highly}} popular holiday destination, {{promoted}} nationally as [...] "The Garden by the Sea" [...] and was packed by visitors from the Midlands and the West Country as well as day trippers from the South Wales valleys, mostly arriving by train. Today, the town, with its traditional seafront, {{continues to be a}} regular summer holiday destination (predominantly for older visitors), but their numbers are much lower than was common from Victorian times until the 1960s, when cheap overseas <b>package</b> <b>holidays</b> were introduced.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the boom}} times of tourism in the 1950s {{there was not}} a large enough local {{workforce}} to service the needs of the tourism industry during the summer months. Many local businesses advertised in Northern cities such Manchester and Liverpool to allieviate this problem. This 'inward migration' caused social problems and friction between these people and those with a long history of residence. At its peak over 10,000 holidaymakers used the railway each Saturday during peak season, and passenger ferries brought still more. [...] When the tourism market faltered with the arrival of cheap foreign <b>package</b> <b>holidays</b> in the 1960s, and the closure of the railway, unemployment levels rose. In 2001, Ilfracombe Central Ward was designated the most deprived super output area in Devon.|$|E
2500|$|Winter {{operation}} ceased from 1954, {{although the}} line did reopen temporarily {{in the winter}} of 1980 {{to cash in on the}} large numbers of sightseers who had come to look at the Athina B, a freighter that had beached near the Palace Pier. [...] Two-car multiple operation was introduced in 1964. In recent years there has been a decline in visitor numbers due to <b>package</b> <b>holidays</b> abroad. In 1995 the Volk's Electric Railway Association was formed to help the operator of the line (Brighton & Hove City Council) promote and operate the line. And in 2003 the Volks Railway Institute of Science and Technology was formed to promote the educational and science side of the Victorian railway to schools and special interest groups.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1960s, however, Fleetwood {{began to}} decline economically. The last ferry to the Isle of Man sailed in 1961. The sailings have been revived {{periodically}} since. The main railway station was closed in 1966 {{as a result of}} the Beeching cuts, and the passenger terminus was moved to Wyre Dock railway station. This in turn was closed in 1970, as the branch line from Poulton was taken out of service. Additional light industry developed along the former railway bed. The rise of <b>package</b> <b>holidays</b> abroad led to fewer visitors generally to British resort towns. As Blackpool expanded its attractions, fewer day visitors came to Fleetwood, and as transport became more efficient, more overnight visitors became day visitors. The Hillhouse plant was heavily cut back, and was finally closed in 1999. Most serious, however, was the collapse of the fishing industry, which was largely destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the Cod Wars, a dispute over fishing rights between Iceland and the UK. As Fleetwood's trawlers mainly fished the North Atlantic in search of cod, the loss of the fishing grounds hit the town hard. The last deep sea trawler left the town in 1982 and now only inshore fishing boats fish out of the port, although trawlers registered in other places can still be seen taking advantage of the fish market. Fish is still a big industry in the town, though the jobs are mainly in processing rather than fishing. A pair of bronze [...] on the promenade by the pier depicts the idea of families welcoming back the fishermen from sea.|$|E

40|$|Tour {{operators}} in Europe and Switzerland face multiple challenges. Yet, against all expectations, they {{more or less}} manage to maintain their overall market share. This paper explores {{why this is so}} by exploring determinants which predict <b>packaged</b> <b>holiday</b> purchases (as opposed to independent travel) by means of a binary logistic regression. The case is a mature outbound market — Switzerland. The results somewhat contrast with previous research, and reveal that choosing a <b>packaged</b> <b>holiday</b> cannot be predicted by socio-demographics, but rather by a given travel situation. Lack of familiarity with the destination, small travel groups, the travel motivations diversion/experience of something new, enjoyment of comfort and pampering, and the search for self-time increase the likelihood of people taking up a <b>packaged</b> <b>holiday...</b>|$|R
