50|$|The second {{economic}} {{boom in the}} history of Ribeirão Preto occurred after the oil crisis (1973 and 1979) of the 1970s. The increase in the oil price obliged Brazil to look for alternative means of fueling and the solution found was the alcohol fuel program, or Pro-Álcool as it is called. Pró-Álcool {{led to the development of}} a technology which allows the use of ethanol (sugarcane alcohol) either as automotive fuel or as a gasoline additive. The latter improves performance and substitutes lead thus decreasing <b>polluting</b> <b>emissions.</b> Due to the Pró-Álcool program, farmers from the region of Ribeirão Preto were encouraged by government subsidies to grow sugarcane. The high productivity of the land around Ribeirão Preto rapidly placed the region as the largest alcohol and sugar producer of the world, being responsible for 30 percent of Brazil’s sugarcane alcohol fuel.|$|E
50|$|The Brazilian Environmental Policy (1981) was {{the first}} real {{breakthrough}} concerning environmental protection and sustainability. Before this, there were <b>polluting</b> <b>emissions</b> guidelines that allowed industries to pollute {{to a certain extent}} without being liable to any environmental damage. However, after this policy was passed, strict liability was applied which determined that industries were accountable for all the pollution they were causing. Therefore, from then onwards, polluters would be responsible for all the damage they caused. Just after this policy was implemented, laws were introduced that authorised public prosecutors to act in defence of the environment, and later on, another law was introduced which allowed NGOs to do the same. The Brazilian Ministry of the Environment is the agency in charge of coordinating, supervising and controlling the Brazilian Environmental Policy. It is also responsible for promoting the use of sustainable natural resources and applying sustainable development within the formulation and implementation of national policies.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} three {{scenarios}} of biomass production, conversion and utilization of different biofuels (sunflower crude oil, sunflower refined oil and sunflower methyl-ester) {{in a rural}} context are compared. The analysis is referred to the district of Pisa, in Italy. Technical feasibility was analysed by comparing process schemes and safety issues, while environmental impacts were studied by applying the methodology of life cycle assessment. Scenarios involving upgrading of crude sunflower oil (refined oil and biodiesel) require complex plants and the management of dangerous materials, and they produce considerable amounts of wastewater. These scenarios need larger plant size, more complex organization (farm cooperatives) and higher costs than the simple mechanical operations associated with crude oil production. On the other hand the use of low-quality fuels in internal combustion engines can lead to short engine lifetime and high pollutant emissions. The life cycle analysis shows that the biofuel upgrading processes (refining and transesterification) and oil transport have a low influence on the environmental impact, compared to seed cultivation, {{which is the most}} impacting step. However fuel upgrading allows a significant reduction in <b>polluting</b> <b>emission</b> during combustion; as a consequence biodiesel results the most sustainable biofuel.

His eco-aesthetic {{does not have the}} shape or form that in any way resemble existent architectural styles. This aesthetic is an independent aesthetic that encompasses eco-design holistically and which comes from an interpretation, an understanding and the inclusion of ecological constituents and processes of its locality in its built form. This can be regarded as an emergent ecological aesthetic, where its shapes and forms have a nexus with adjoining ecosystems, which harmonise with the site's ecology, enhance local biodiversity, besides having other eco performance features such denying negative consequences, avert <b>polluting</b> <b>emissions,</b> be more energy and water efficient and carbon neutral than conventional buildings, and other eco-design attributes.

40|$|<b>Polluting</b> <b>emissions</b> {{depend on}} vehicle {{characteristics}} and on traffi c conditions expected after {{the construction of}} a road project. Nevertheless, in the assessment of new projects, the task of road designer becomes uncertain when the reduction in <b>polluting</b> <b>emissions</b> has to be evaluated. Moreover, vehicle emissions are highly linked to modal vehicle activity, but current emission rate models do not properly predict on-road vehicle emissions produced by modal traffi c events, as those occurring at intersections. Modal emission models require the analysis of modal activity at a microscale level in order to evaluate emission factors by a single mode (idle, acceleration, deceleration, and cruise). This evaluation can be standardised with reference to the type of road, volume-to-capacity ratio and fl eet composition. On the contrary, the mesoscopic level for vehicle modal activities, as it is usual in traffi c analysis, will result appropriate to reach correct emission estimates. In order to explain factors affecting <b>polluting</b> <b>emissions,</b> a research programme targeted {{to the development of a}} methodology to be applied to traffi c studies has been undertaken.

30|$|Also, the {{existence}} of unidirectional causality from industrial output to electricity consumption and non-existence of causal relationship between agricultural output and electricity consumption could help policymakers in designing their conservation electricity policies without much fear of deteriorating real output in the industrial sector or agricultural one, and some efforts for energy conservation activities have been adopted by several Egyptian institutions as those applied in the industrial sector and led to about 25 % of energy saving besides removing, gradually, the historical energy subsidies [11]. Although several energy conservation policies have been adopted in Egypt, still more efforts are needed.

Moreover, incentives for encouraging usage of electricity-efficient tools and efficient utilization of natural gas and full utilization of hydropower in an attempt to minimize the dependence on oil sources can be adopted [11]. The government also must encourage private-sector companies to invest into clean technologies and renewable energy resources, as Egypt has enormous renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy but investing in them needs huge funds.|$|R
40|$|National audienceCoal power {{stations}} {{as well as}} waste incinerators produce humid acid gases which condensate in industrial chimneys. These condensates may cause corrosion of the internal cladding made of stainless steels, nickel base alloys or non metallic materials. In the aim of <b>polluting</b> <b>emission</b> reduction and material optimal choice, {{it is necessary to}} determine all the phenomena which occur throughout the chimney such as condensation and dissolution of acid gases (in this particular case, sulphur dioxide SO 2). The production of energy from fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc.) brings about the emission of gas containing sulphur compounds (SO 2, SO 3) as well as chlorine and fluorine compounds. To avoid this atmospheric pollution and its harmful effects (acid rains, impact on the health) due to hydrochloric, sulphuric and hydrofluoric acids produced in the presence of air, it is necessary to steam these flue gases. Nevertheless, a considerable quantity of residual acid gases remains in the gas discharge which also contains large amounts of water vapour. Thus, condensation may occur and by the way an acid attack of the internal cladding of the chimney. This results in high costs of maintenance and a reduction of their structural stability. The knowledge of the phenomena of heat and mass transfer during the condensation of these acid gases in chimney is essential for their conception and materials choice...|$|R
