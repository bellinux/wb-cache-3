40|$|Abstract- The <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> {{technology}} is widely {{adopted in the}} fiber-optical transmission equipments based on TDM(Time Division Multiplexing), such as PDH, SDH/SONET. A variety of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms for Ethernet networks and the progress of standardization are summarized in the document. There are several kinds of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms for Ethernet networks, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP and etc. However, since Ethernet signal move through detour route, it causes much time to recover. Accordingly, {{it is difficult to}} secure a usability of Ethernet networks and QOS(Quality of Service). Also, if the <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> protocol standardized by IEEE and ITU-T is used, it remains a inherent network <b>switching</b> time for <b>protection.</b> Therefore, a specific <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithm for Ethernet are needed for seamless and stable operation of Ethernet networks service for Distribution Automation System(DAS). A reliable protection algorithm with no switching delay time is very important to implement Self-healing service for DAS. This study of FPGA based <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithm for Ethernet networks shows that in case of faults occurrence on distribution power network, immediate fault isolation and restoration are conducted through interaction with distribution equipments using P 2 P(Peer to Peer) communication for protection coordination.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{reliable}} services MPLS network uses set of procedures (fault detection, fault notification and fault recovery) which provide appropriate protection to the traffic carried in active LSP (Label Switching Path). When fault occur in active LSP, the recovery scheme must re-direct the affected traffic to the recovery path which bypass the fault. The two basic recovery mechanism defined by IETF used to re-direct affected traffic is rerouting and <b>protection</b> <b>switching.</b> In <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> number of faults can be handled simultaneously in the active and recovery path and is faster as compared to rerouting switching.

40|$|MPLS-based {{recovery}} {{is intended to}} effect rapid and complete restoration of traffic affected by a fault in an MPLS network. Two MPLS-based recovery models have been proposed: IP re-routing which establishes recovery paths on demand, and <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> which works with pre-established recovery paths. IP re-routing is robust and frugal since no resources are pre-committed but is inherently slower than <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> which is intended to offer high reliability to premium services where fault recovery {{takes place at the}} 100 ms time scale.

All fiber links interconnecting the optical switches are assumed to be bidirectional. In the scenario considered, the layout of the protection fibers and the setup of the <b>protection</b> <b>switches</b> is implemented in nonreal time, during the setup of the network.

40|$|Kinesin cytoskeletal motors {{convert the}} energy of ATP {{hydrolysis}} into stepping movement along microtubules. A partial model of this process has been derived from crystal structures, which show that movement of the motor domain relative to its major microtubule binding element, the switch II helix, is coupled to docking of kinesin’s neck linker element along the motor domain. This docking would displace the cargo {{in the direction of}} travel and so contribute to a step. However, the crystal structures do not reveal how ATP binding and hydrolysis govern this series of events. We used cryoelectron microscopy to derive 8 – 9  Å-resolution maps of four nucleotide states encompassing the microtubule-attached kinetic cycle of a kinesin motor. The exceptionally high quality of these maps allowed us to build in crystallographically determined conformations of kinesin’s key subcomponents, yielding novel arrangements of kinesin’s switch II helix and nucleotide-sensing <b>switch</b> <b>loops.</b> The resulting atomic models reveal a seesaw mechanism in which the <b>switch</b> <b>loops,</b> triggered by ATP binding, propel their side of the motor domain down and thereby elicit docking of the neck linker {{on the opposite side of}} the seesaw. Microtubules engage the seesaw mechanism by stabilizing the formation of extra turns at the N terminus of the switch II helix, which then serve as an anchor for the <b>switch</b> <b>loops</b> as they modulate the seesaw angle. These observations explain how microtubules activate kinesin’s ATP-sensing machinery to promote cargo displacement and inform the mechanism of kinesin’s ancestral relative, myosin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} {{network reach}} and customer base of next-generation time and wavelength division multiplexed PON (TWDM-PONs) have necessitated rapid fault detection and subsequent restoration {{of services to}} its users. However, direct application of existing solutions for conventional PONs to TWDM-PONs is unsuitable as these schemes rely on the loss of signal (LOS) of upstream transmissions to trigger <b>protection</b> <b>switching.</b> As TWDM-PONs are required to potentially use sleep/doze mode optical network units (ONU), the loss of upstream transmission from a sleeping or dozing ONU could erroneously trigger <b>protection</b> <b>switching.</b> Further, TWDM-PONs require its monitoring modules for fiber/device fault detection {{to be more sensitive}} than those typically deployed in conventional PONs. To address the above issues, three survivable architectures that are compliant with TWDM-PON specifications are presented in this work. These architectures combine rapid detection and <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> against multipoint failure, and most importantly do not rely on upstream transmissions for LOS activation. Survivability analyses as well as evaluations of the additional costs incurred to achieve survivability are performed and compared to the unprotected TWDM-PON.
