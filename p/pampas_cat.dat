60|$|Concealment, {{more or less}} complete, {{is useful}} to many animals, and {{absolutely}} essential to some. Those which have numerous enemies from which they cannot escape by rapidity of motion, find safety in concealment. Those which prey upon others must also be so constituted as not to alarm them by their presence or their approach, or they would soon die of hunger. Now it is remarkable in how many cases nature gives this boon to the animal, by colouring it with such tints as may best serve to enable it to escape from its enemies or to entrap its prey. Desert animals as a rule are desert-coloured. The lion is a typical example of this, and must be almost invisible when crouched upon the sand or among desert rocks and stones. Antelopes are all more or less sandy-coloured. The camel is pre-eminently so. The Egyptian cat and the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> are sandy or earth-coloured. The Australian kangaroos are of the same tints, and the original colour of the wild horse {{is supposed to have}} been a sandy or clay-colour.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the desert}} {{regions of the}} earth we find an even more general {{accordance}} of colour with surroundings. The lion, the camel, and all the desert antelopes have {{more or less the}} colour of the sand or rock among which they live. The Egyptian cat and the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> are sandy or earth coloured. The Australian kangaroos are of similar tints, and the original colour of the wild horse is supposed to have been sandy or clay coloured. Birds are equally well protected by assimilative hues; the larks, quails, goatsuckers, and grouse which abound in the North African and Asiatic deserts are all tinted or mottled so as closely to resemble the average colour of the soil in the districts they inhabit. Canon Tristram, who knows these regions and their natural history so well, says, in an often quoted passage: [...] "In the desert, where neither trees, brushwood, nor even undulations of the surface afford the slightest protection to its foes, a modification of colour which shall be assimilated to that of the surrounding country is absolutely necessary. Hence, without exception, the upper plumage of every bird, whether lark, chat, sylvain, or sand-grouse, and also the fur of all the smaller mammals, and the skin of all the snakes and lizards, is of one uniform isabelline or sand colour." ...|$|E

50|$|There was a {{proposal}} to divide <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> into three distinct species, based primarily on differences in pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements. Accordingly, three species were recognised in the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World: the colocolo (L. colocolo), the Pantanal cat (L. braccatus), and the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> (L. pajeros) with a more restricted definition. This split at species level was not supported by subsequent genetic work, although some geographical substructure was recognised, and some authorities continued to recognise the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> as a single species.In the recent revision of felid taxonomy by the Cat Specialist Group the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> is recognised as a single species with seven subspecies.|$|E

50|$|When the Pantanal and <b>Pampas</b> <b>cats</b> {{are treated}} as a {{separate}} species, the colocolo has two subspecies: L. c. colocolo and L. c. wolffsohni.|$|R
5000|$|The IUCN {{has only}} rated the [...] "combined" [...] species (including Pantanal and <b>Pampas</b> <b>cats),</b> {{in which case}} the {{colocolo}} is considered Near Threatened. Whether the colocolo will receive a higher rating if the Pantanal and <b>Pampas</b> <b>cats</b> are treated as separate species is unclear, but it may be Endangered, and its range is smaller than that of the kodkod, rated as Vulnerable by the IUCN. However, unlike the kodkod, the colocolo is not associated with the highly threatened temperate rainforests found in the region.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{revision}} of this branch of Felidae in recent years. Leopardus was previously regarded as a subgenus of the genus Felis. The Pantanal and <b>Pampas</b> <b>cats</b> were previously considered subspecies of the colocolo.|$|R

Jaguars, Pumas, <b>Pampas</b> <b>Cats,</b> Ocelots, Lesser Anteaters and more are also found here in healthy populations. Otuquis National Park is a birder's paradise when literally millions of birds flock here to feed on the huge swarms of bait fish.|$|R
2500|$|Natural {{enemies of}} this stork include boa constrictors and crested {{caracaras}} (Polyborus plancus), {{both of which}} eat this species’ eggs. Both of these predatory species can probably also eat maguari stork chicks that {{are no more than}} a few weeks old. Many other potential predators such as jaguars, crocodilians, <b>Pampas</b> <b>cats</b> and maned wolves could also access ground nests. [...] Although these animals are known to opportunistically feed on birds, no instances of predation on maguari storks have been hitherto recorded; but such predation is considered likely.|$|R

50|$|Six {{different}} species of carnivores live in the Andes Mountain range. Three of these species are cats, the Andean cat, the <b>pampas</b> <b>cat,</b> and the puma. The puma is a large predator, while the Andean and <b>Pampas</b> <b>Cat</b> are medium-sized predators. These two medium-sized predators are very much alike. They both hunt within the same territory. They hunt the same prey, the mountain viscacha (Lagidium viscacia). The viscacha makes up 93.9% of the biomass consumed in the Andean cat's diet while the <b>Pampas</b> <b>Cat</b> depends on it for 74.8% of its biomass consumption. Both of these cats depend on a specific prey {{to make up a}} large portion of their dietary needs. In some areas, the mountain viscacha will make up 53% of the Andean cat's prey items. This is because the other prey items are so significantly smaller that even though the Andean cat will successfully hunt, kill, and eat a mountain viscacha half the time, the mountain viscacha is so much larger than the other food items, it makes up more substance. They also hunt frequently during the same periods. During one study, both the Andean cat and the <b>Pampas</b> <b>Cat</b> were seen most frequently during moonless nights; the second most sightings of these cats were during full moons. These two cats both hunt the same prey, making it more difficult for them to find food, essentially creating a race to find the prey before the other does.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{being named}} after the Pampas, the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> occurs {{in a wide range}} of {{habitats}} in northwestern Argentina, Bolivia, western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. It inhabits elevations between 1800 and 5000 m in páramo, marginally also in puna and locally in dry forest. Where its range overlaps with the Andean mountain cat in northwestern Argentina, it occurs at lower altitudes on average. In central to northwestern Argentina, the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> is found at elevations below 1240 m in grassland, mesophytic and dry forest, and shrubland. In southern Argentina and far southern Chile, it is found in Patagonian steppes and shrubland at altitudes below 1100 m.|$|E
50|$|Based on two specimens, the {{subspecies}} L. p. steinbachi {{is larger}} and paler than P. l. garleppi. However, this is labelled with uncertainty {{due to the}} very small sample, and some treat it as a synonym of L. p. garleppi. Uncertainty also exists for the subspecies L. p. budini, which appears to resemble L. p. crespoi, and was described from lowlands of northwestern Argentina, but may actually be from humid forests in the region. Some recognise it, while other do not. Populations in southern Chile and {{the southern part of}} Argentina, included in the nominate in the above list, have been recognised as the subspecies L. p. crucinus based on the large size (the largest <b>Pampas</b> <b>cats)</b> and dull pelage.|$|R
50|$|The {{culpeo fox}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator {{that will take}} any variety of prey. This fox mainly feeds on rodents and lagomorphs (especially the introduced European rabbit and European hare); however, it occasionally feeds on domestic livestock and young guanacos. Culpeos are considered beneficial because they are significant predators of the rabbits introduced in 1915; such introduced rabbit populations {{are believed to have}} allowed culpeos to spread from the Andean foothills across the Patagonian plain. They sometimes take young lambs up to a week old. In limited studies, the larger culpeo appears to dominate potential competitors, including South American gray foxes, Geoffroy's <b>cats,</b> <b>Pampas</b> <b>cats,</b> grisons and various raptorial birds. Its range also overlaps that of the much larger puma, but the size difference ensures that the two species have limited competition.|$|R
50|$|Herbivores of the pampas are the pampas deer, guanaco, gray brocket, dwarf mara, plains viscacha, Brazilian guinea pig, {{southern}} mountain cavy and coypu. The biggest predator of {{the region}} is the puma followed by the maned wolf, <b>pampas</b> fox, geoffreys <b>cat,</b> lesser grison {{as well as the}} omnivorous white-eared opossum and molinas hog-nosed skunk.|$|R
50|$|The Pantanal cat (Leopardus colocola braccatus) is a <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> subspecies, a small {{wild cat}} native to South America. It {{is named after}} the Pantanal {{wetlands}} in central South America, where it inhabits mainly grassland, shrubland, savannas and deciduous forests.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> (Leopardus colocola), {{also known}} as the {{colocolo}} or Pantanal cat over parts of its range, is a small wild cat native to South America. It is named after the Pampas, but occurs in grassland, shrubland, and dry forest at elevations up to 5000 m.|$|E
5000|$|The Mitsubishi Pajero {{had to be}} renamed to Montero in Spain and Spanish-speaking {{countries}} in Latin America, since pajero is a Spanish slang term for one who masturbates (with similar connotations as the British slang term wanker).

40|$|Dermatophytes are fungi {{that cause}} {{superficial}} mycoses in animals and humans. While {{studies have shown}} that domestic cats (Felis catus) are often asymptomatic carriers of dermatophytes, and thus a significant source of infection, this aspect has not been studied in relation to their wild relatives. The present study was aimed at determining the presence of dermatophytes on the haircoat of healthy wild felids, kept in captivity at "Fundação Parque Zoológico de São Paulo". Samples were taken from 130 adult animals of both sexes: 25 lions (Panthera leo), 12 tigers (Panthera tigris), 6 jaguars (Panthera onca), 4 leopards (Panthera pardus), 2 snow leopards (Panthera uncia), 2 pumas (Puma concolor), 2 cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), 1 ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), 28 tiger cats (Leopardus tigrinus), 10 margays (Leopardus wiedii), 8 geoffroy's cats (Leopardus geoffroyi), 22 jaguarundis (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) and 8 <b>pampas</b> <b>cats</b> (Oncifelis colocolo). The samples were obtained by rubbing the haircoat of the animals with squares of sterile carpet, and then seeded onto Petri dishes containing Mycobiotic agar (Difco™). The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 4 weeks. The isolates were subcultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 mg/L) and cultured on slides for posterior identification by their macro- and microscopic characteristics. Microsporum gypseum was isolated from two apparently healthy lionesses (1. 6 %), both kept in terrariums. The most prevalent contaminants were of the genera Penicillium (27. 9 %); Cladosporium (24. 5 %); Acremonium (12. 1 %); Scopulariopsis and Chrysosporium (9. 8 %); and Aspergillus (5. 3 %). The occurrence of dermatophytes in the haircoat of healthy wild felids, maintained in captivity, confirms their status as asymptomatic carriers and characterizes them as sources of infection for other animals and for humans...|$|R

50|$|Several mammal species {{more common}} in the tropics are at the {{southern}} limit of their territory in the ecoregion. There appear to be a variety of feline species including cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> (Leopardus pajeros), Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi) and jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi). Endangered mammals include the Bolivian chinchilla rat (Abrocoma boliviensis) and short-tailed chinchilla (Chinchilla chinchilla).|$|E
50|$|The Andean {{mountain}} cat and <b>pampas</b> <b>cat</b> look similar. This {{makes it difficult}} to identify which cat is observed and makes correct estimations of populations problematic. This can be especially difficult when attempting to gain correct information from the observations of individuals that have seen one of these cats but are not aware to look for specific features to distinguish between the two.|$|E
50|$|The {{flood plain}} {{of the river}} {{is part of the}} Paraná Delta and Islands Ecoregion. The {{original}} ecosystem, especially in the Lower Delta, has been heavily modified by deforestation, hunting, fishing and the introduction of foreign species of flora, as well as damaged by domestic and industrial pollution. It hosts species such as the marsh deer, the capybara, the neotropical river otter, the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat,</b> the jaguar, the coypu and the red-faced guan, some of them endangered.|$|E
50|$|As {{traditionally}} defined, the colocolo {{occurs in}} the widest range of habitats of any small South American felid. This, combined with distinct differences in pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, {{was the basis for}} splitting the Pantanal cat and <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> from the colocolo. Based on genetic divergence, the splits within the colocolo group are estimated to have occurred about 1.7 million years ago (Mya). This divergence was lower than that found within Geoffroy's cat (about 2 Mya) or the oncilla (about 3.7 Mya; this very high divergence -far higher than other species in the genus- has resulted in some suggesting more than one species is involved in the oncilla). Furthermore, the distribution pattern within the colocolo group based on genetics did not completely match that based on pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, and supported some of the traditional subspecific division rather than species division. While the population in northern Chile has been placed in L. colocolo based on cranial measurements, genetics associate it with Pampas cats from Bolivia, and while the population in western Argentina has been placed in the <b>Pampas</b> <b>cat</b> based on pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, genetics associate it with the colocolo. More recent genetic analysis also supports maintaining the Pantanal and Pampas cats as subspecies of the colocolo.|$|E
