25|$|On 20 December 1985, France {{ratified}} Additional <b>Protocol</b> <b>number</b> 6 to the European Convention to Safeguard Human Rights {{and fundamental}} liberties.

25|$|On 3 May 2002, France and 30 other {{countries}} signed <b>Protocol</b> <b>number</b> 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights. This forbids {{the death penalty}} in all circumstances, even in times of war. It went into effect on 1 July 2003, after having been ratified by 10 states.|$|E

25|$|Fourteen parishes {{appealed to}} the Congregation for Clergy.

The other parishes, which petitioned the Congregation for the Clergy, have decrees specific to their appeals. Appeals of twelve parishes were upheld and two were denied.|$|E
25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with <b>protocol</b> <b>number</b> 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other routing protocols, OSPF {{does not}} carry data via a {{transport}} protocol, {{such as the}} User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
