5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been <b>pushed</b> <b>past</b> the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes into}} the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he <b>pushed</b> <b>past</b> Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms. However, due to the difficult shooting angle, Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh Wicks parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target. In the 18th minute, Seattle midfielder Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate Freddie Ljungberg, whose shot on goal was barely saved by Wicks, who kicked out a foot to block the shot. Just before halftime, Le Toux crossed to an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of Wicks, who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0. Seattle outshot D.C. 9–6 in the first half.|$|E

Although Pardew apologised for his actions, he was fined £100,000 by Newcastle United and given a formal warning.

25|$|In the meantime, {{the men on}} the barges {{that had}} been <b>pushed</b> <b>past</b> the entry point by the river's current had {{struggled}} to bring them back to a landing. More citizens rushed out to defend the city against the new group of marauders. Schenck's force, divided and beset at all sides, was pushed back to the river. Several of the soldiers managed to push the barges into the river, and pull some of their comrades to safety, but it was difficult work: the darkness and the swiftness of the current made steadying the barges difficult, and the angry citizens of Nijmegen were firing arrows and small arms at the marauders. Eventually the soldiers forwent the ropes and scaling hooks, and simply jumped into the river, hoping to swim to the barges.|$|E
25|$|At about 10:30p.m., Powell {{was escorted}} to the Seward {{residence}} on Lafayette Square near the White House by David Herold. Seward {{had been injured}} in a carriage accident on April 5, and suffered a concussion, broken jaw, broken right arm, and many serious bruises. Local newspapers reported that Seward was at home convalescing, so Powell and Herold knew where to find him. Powell was armed with a Whitney revolver and large knife, and wore black pants, a long overcoat, a grey vest, a grey dress coat, and a hat with a wide brim. Herold waited outside, holding Powell's horse. Powell knocked and rang the bell, and the door was answered by William Bell, Seward's African American butler. Holding up a small bottle, Powell claimed that Seward's physician, Dr. T.S. Verdi, had sent some medicine to the house. Bell was suspicious, as Dr. Verdi had departed the home only an hour earlier and left instructions for Seward not to be disturbed. Bell asked Powell to wait, but Powell <b>pushed</b> <b>past</b> him and began mounting {{the stairs to the}} second-floor bedrooms.|$|E
25|$|Despite Advani's arrest, the kar sevaks or activists {{accompanying}} the yatra continued on towards Ayodhya. Mulayam Singh Yadav, the Chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, ordered {{the arrest of}} all activists bound to Ayodhya, and 150,000 individuals were jailed. However, {{a large number of}} activists succeeded in reaching Ayodhya. Guha estimates this number at 75,000, while Christophe Jaffrelot states that it was 40,000. The town also held 20,000 security personnel, brought there by the state government. On 30 October a large number of activists <b>pushed</b> <b>past</b> the cordon of security officers, and moved towards the Babri Masjid. Although they were intercepted by more security forces, they succeeded in avoiding these, and reached the mosque. There, one volunteer placed a saffron flag on top of the mosque, while other activists attempted to tear the building down using tools like axes and hammers. The security personnel responded by initially using tear gas to expel the kar sevaks, and later using actual ammunition. The kar sevaks were pushed away from the mosque, but a pitched battle with security followed, which lasted three days, and led to the death of 20 VHP volunteers.|$|E

25|$|England {{managed to}} push {{on with the}} job of {{restoring}} some pride to their innings {{on the morning of}} the fifth day, thanks largely to the heroics of Jack Russell. From his overnight 47 not out, Russell soon <b>pushed</b> <b>past</b> fifty, and his partner Emburey looked as though he wasn't going to surrender his wicket easily either. They batted throughout the morning adding to their overnight partnership of 64. Russell looked confident, and it seemed Australia's bowlers were lost for ideas on how to remove the pair. The looked as though they were willing to bat the day out and save the match. They soon took England past Australia's total, and set about building a lead, but with less than a days play remaining, an English victory looked out of the question. Emburey brought up his fifty, his first of the series. The pair looked to be quite comfortable, however soon after they had taken England past 200, Australia finally got the breakthrough they had sought. Alderman produced a brilliant outswinger which cut off the pitch, collecting the top of Emburey's off-stump, clean bowled for a well made 64.|$|E

Coahuayana saw {{at least three}} villages and 200 homes flooded after a river overflowed its banks, while a stretch of highway connecting Acapulco to Zihuatanejo was washed out. Some minor flooding was reported in Acapulco. In the state of Oaxaca, mudslides were observed and at least 50 families had to be evacuated after the Perros River overflowed its banks. Around 800 people were evacuated across the state of Colima, where a storm-total rain amount of 22.32in (567mm) fell in Tecomán. Water systems in Manzanillo were damaged. Widespread flooding was observed, with water up to 7ft (2m) in some locations. In Jalisco, at least 8,000 residents were cut-off {{from the rest of}} the state, and up to 90% of the farmland near the municipalities of Autlán, Cihuatlán, and Casimiro Castillo was inundated as at least eight rivers overflowed. Up to 250 dwellings were destroyed across southwestern portions of Mexico. Over 4,000 additional people were injured, while up to 500 heads of cattle died in floodwaters. In Chiapas, dams exceeded 9ft (3m) their normal levels and other water systems were <b>pushed</b> <b>past</b> their intended usage due to the already severe rainy season. A state of emergency was declared in six states. Across the Baja California peninsula, shacks and hotels were filled with water, even as the rainfall was generally regarded as beneficial. In the aftermath of the cyclone, army jeeps transported supplies to flooded homes. [...] At least 10 people were killed, including six deaths in Morelos, two deaths in Colima, and one death each in Chiapas and Michoacán. The remnants of Greg swept into northern California by September8, producing more lightning activity than the region had experienced in at least two decades, as well as damaging a house after a tree struck by lightning fell on it. The thunderstorms downed power poles, cutting power to 55,000 residents, and sparked four wildfires across Monterey County. Some locations received up to 0.25in (6.4mm) of rain.|$|E
