500|$|The methods {{available}} for this relied on demolition and water. By law, {{the tower of}} every parish church had to hold equipment for these efforts: long ladders, leather buckets, axes, and [...] "firehooks" [...] for pulling down buildings (see illustration right, see also <b>pike</b> <b>pole).</b> Sometimes taller buildings were levelled to the ground quickly and effectively by means of controlled gunpowder explosions. This drastic method of creating firebreaks was increasingly used {{towards the end of}} the Great Fire, and modern historians believe that it was what finally won the struggle.|$|E

60|$|The {{suggestion}} was thought {{a good one}} and several started to dig the hole immediately. It was made four feet deep and the <b>pike</b> <b>pole</b> was jammed through the soil at as low a point as possible. At first no water came, but presently a few drops showed themselves and then followed a stream the size of one's little finger.|$|E

5000|$|In the past, <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> {{were used}} for ice fishing, known as bagrenye ryby ( [...] "fish pike-poling"; [...] means [...] "pike pole" [...] in Russian). A number of ethnographers note that this way was {{specific}} to the Ural River. When fish starts to hybernate, fisherman artels in large numbers put <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> into ice holes in places known for big fish to crowd, so that a dense forest is made of <b>pike</b> <b>poles.</b> When drifting fish hits a pole, a fisherman feels this and pulls the catch out.|$|R

5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times. They were granted in 1987. The arms show two gold-colored hooks for log driving (or [...] "brøtningshaker") {{on a blue}} background. They were designed by Dag Magne Staurheim. The municipality of Nordre Land has rich traditions {{within the field of}} log driving, to which the vast number of log dams within the area bear witness. Tools were required for the log driving, and the local blacksmiths made <b>pike</b> <b>poles.</b> Every blacksmith created his own shape or design for the poles, {{and one of the most}} famous <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> in Nordre Land was the design made by the blacksmith Kristian Halden. In addition to <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> he made knives. The poles and knives were named [...] "Hæillhakar" [...] and [...] "Hæillakniver" [...] by the locals. It is the [...] "Halden Pole" [...] which has been the model for the municipal arms of Nordre Land.|$|R

50|$|A {{boat hook}} {{is part of}} boating equipment. Its most common use is as a docking and {{undocking}} aid. It may be similar to a <b>pike</b> <b>pole,</b> however it must have a blunt tip, for pushing during undocking, with a hook for docking. In addition, it may have a line attached to the other end, which may have a ring for this purpose.|$|E

5000|$|A pickaroon (or picaroon) is a wood-handled (may {{be other}} {{materials}} also), metal-topped log handling tool. [...] It is distinguished from a <b>pike</b> <b>pole</b> {{by having a}} shorter handle, no metal point, and an opposite curve to its hook (toward the handle rather than away); and from both a cant hook and peavey by having a fixed hook facing its handle rather than a pivoting one facing away.|$|E
50|$|The pole's {{original}} use in {{the fire}} service was to pull down walls and neighboring buildings to stop a fire's spread. Modern firefighting pike poles are usually of fiberglass, 4-12' long, and used to search for fires hidden behind walls and ceilings, to pull items from intense heat and flames, and to ventilate structures by breaking windows. Also known as a ceiling hook of the day, the <b>pike</b> <b>pole</b> is the 'hook' referred to in 'hook and ladder' truck.|$|E

50|$|In lumbering {{they are}} used to control logs {{floating}} on a river in a log drive and constructing log rafts. <b>Pike</b> <b>poles</b> used in log rafting were originally made of wood, typically spruce or fir. In the mid-1960s they began to be made of aluminum tubing plugged with a wooden knob to maintain buoyancy. Specialized logging tools of similar appearance are peavey and cant hook.|$|R
5000|$|A {{larger group}} of less {{experienced}} men {{brought up the}} rear, pushing along the straggler logs that were stuck on the banks and in trees. They spent more time wading in icy water than balancing on moving logs. They were called the [...] "rear crew." [...] Other men worked with them from the bank, pushing logs away with <b>pike</b> <b>poles.</b> Others worked with horses and oxen to pull in the logs that had strayed furthest out into the flats.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately all {{the water}} {{possible}} had been brought into the fort and clothes were soaked in this and used for beating out the flames. It was hard work, and soon the women were as smoke-begrimed as the men. To save the children all their dresses were wet down so that the sparks might have no effect. Where the burning arrows fell among the baggage, and water was not handy, the sod was dug up with spades and <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> and thrown on as a blanket.|$|R

However, Bugs tries {{to point out that}} a tidal wave is heading for the island, but Sam told him to [...] "Shuddup, and start simmerin!!!". Before Sam can do anything, the tidal wave sweeps across the island, leaving Bugs safe in his pot, but the island is gone, because it got swallowed by the waves. Sam, now being chased by Dopey Dick, swims to the pot, yelling for Bugs to pull him in. Bugs uses a <b>pike</b> <b>pole</b> to start pulling Sam in, but then tells Sam that hell only keep him up if they make a deal. After a quick [...] "No deals!", Sam eventually relents. The deal is that Bugs will keep Sam {{on the end of the}} pole to keep Sam above water, while Sam paddles. Sam looks back and sees the shark behind them and starts paddling faster, eventually going in the direction of San Francisco - which, according to a floating marker, is 2,736 miles away, with [...] "California, Here I Come" [...] playing in the underscore.|$|E
50|$|The 1835 Russian Encyclopedic Lexicon {{describes}} {{a tradition of}} Ural Cossacks ice fishing for sturgeon. The pike-pole ice fishing of sturgeon was traditionally allowed some time after the Orthodox Christmas. On the day of bagrenye, the Cossacks would break the river ice at the known sturgeon hibernating locations, and pull out the disturbed fish with the <b>pike</b> <b>poles.</b> A successful Cossack would sometimes catch as many as 50 sturgeon. Occasionally a beluga was caught, and pulled out by a crowd. Only active-duty Cossacks were allowed {{to take part in}} this enterprise.|$|R
25|$|Eight hundred troops—fifteen militia {{groups and}} eight army reserve units—were summoned to Toronto {{to assist with}} the cleanup. Local members of the navy {{assisted}} by providing boats and 100 men. The army donated 900 blankets, 350 mattresses, 175 double decker beds, and 150 stretchers in the relief effort. Tools such as bulldozers, crowbars, flamethrowers, <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> were used to search for bodies. The length of time for which the militia, composed of civilians could help was limited, as their employers could not afford keep paying them during their absence. Most stayed for two weeks, but some remained, while others continued to volunteer during their time off.|$|R
5000|$|Standing in {{the west}} end of Church Square Park at Garden Street and 5th Street, the Firemen's Monument sits atop a 20-foot granite {{pedestal}} that features emblems of a ladder, <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> and a fire hose on its face. The statue itself is approximately 8 feet tall and features a mustached firemen in uniform, holding a small child in nightdress in his left arm and a lantern in his right hand. Similar statues have been noted as being modeled after statues of the Virgin Mary cradling the baby Jesus. The monument reads: text-transform: uppercase; Erected by the citizens of Hoboken, N.J. in honor of the volunteer fire dept. May 30th 1891.|$|R
5000|$|Spoliation is the {{destruction}} or alteration of evidence through intention or ignorance. The mere act of extinguishing a fire can destroy potential evidence of arsonor what {{is also known}} as an [...] "Incendiary fire." [...] Firefighters are educated that the stream of their fire hose or the use of a <b>Pike</b> <b>Pole</b> can destroy evidence and efforts are made to do what is required to extinguish the fire, while not destroying clues to the fires' origin. A fire investigation was once compromised by a fire fighter turning off the knobs on a gas stove in the interests of safety after a house fire was knocked down. In the following investigation the homeowners daughter was accused by her father of leaving the stove on after she left the house but there was then no way to accurately determine the position of the burner knobs on the stove. Though there were no criminal issues involved in this fire, this incident of spoliation created a lack of closure for the family and feelings of distrust and animosity within the family members. -FIRE INVESTIGATION by Russell Chandler.

5000|$|Bateaux ferried log drivers using <b>pike</b> <b>poles</b> to {{dislodge}} stranded logs while maneuvering with the log drive. A wannigan was a kitchen {{built on a}} raft which followed the drivers down the river. The wannigan served four meals a day to fuel the men working in cold water. It also provided tents and blankets for the night if no better accommodations were available. [...] A commissary wagon carrying clothing, plug tobacco and patent medicines for purchase by the log drivers was also called a wangan. The logging company wangan train, called a Mary Anne, was a caravan of wagons pulled by four- or six-horse teams where roads followed the river to transport the tents, blankets, food, stoves, and tools needed by the log drivers.|$|R
50|$|Placing a decapitated {{head on a}} spike (or <b>pike</b> or <b>pole)</b> is {{a custom}} used {{sometimes}} in human history and in culture. The symbolic value may change over time. It may give a warning to spectators. The head may be a human head or an animal head.|$|R
5000|$|The Grand was {{important}} to the rapid development of West-Central Michigan during the 1850s to 1880s, as logs from Michigan's rich pine and oak forests floated down the Grand River for milling. After the Civil War, many soldiers found jobs as lumberjacks cutting logs and guiding them down the river with <b>pike</b> <b>poles,</b> peaveys, and cant hooks. The men wore bright red flannel, felt clothes, and spiked boots to hold them onto the floating logs; these boots chewed up the wooden sidewalks and flooring of the local bars, leading one hotel owner to supply carpet slippers to all river drivers who entered his hotel. The [...] "jacks" [...] earned $1 to $3 per day and all the [...] "vittles" [...] they could eat, which was usually a considerable amount.|$|R

50|$|This river {{has been}} used as a {{transportation}} corridor for thousands of years, first by First Nations and later in the 19th century by fur traders. During the late 19th and mid 20th centuries, it was used to transport timber from logging camps in the upper Sudbury District to Georgian Bay, where they were towed by tugs to sawmills on the Great Lakes. Until the mid-1960s pulp wood, mainly jack pine, was driven down the river to the paper mill at Espanola. A diesel tug towed large rafts of logs the length of Agnew Lake to big Eddy dam where they were sluiced down a flume by crews with hand held <b>pike</b> <b>poles.</b> Secondary flumes took them past the High Falls and Nairn Falls power plants and on to Espanola. The sap and bark from the pulp logs was a major pollution source in the lower river.|$|R
