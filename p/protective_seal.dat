40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test {{different}} sealer removal protocols following root canal filling before adhesive seal of access cavities. Material and methods: Forty single root teeth were selected for the study, prepared to size 60 taper. 02, and filled with AH plus and a single gutta-percha cone size 55 taper. 02. Excess sealer was removed with: ethanol-moisturised foam pellet (group 1), pellet and additional etch-and-rinse procedure (group 2), pellet and additional preparation with a water-cooled diamond bur (group 3) or by etch-and-rinse following temporary filling for one week (group 4).

40|$|Technologies for the 3 D {{integration}} {{are described}} within this paper {{with respect to}} devices that have to retain a specific minimum wafer thickness for handling purposes (CMOS) and integrity of mechanical elements (MEMS). This implies Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) with large dimensions and high aspect ratios (HAR). Moreover, as a main objective, the aspired TSV technology had to be universal and scalable with the designated utilization in a MEMS/CMOS foundry. Two TSV approaches are investigated and discussed, in which the TSVs were fabricated either before or after wafer thinning. One distinctive feature is an incomplete TSV Cu-filling, which avoids long processing and complex process control, while minimizing the thermomechanical stress between Cu and Si and related adverse effects in the device. However, the incomplete filling also includes various challenges regarding process integration. A method based on pattern plating is described, in which TSVs are metalized {{at the same time}} as the redistribution layer and which eliminates the need for additional planarization and patterning steps.

40|$|The {{ability to}} scale up the {{production}} of chemically modified forms of graphene has led to intense interest in the manufacture and commercialization of graphene-based materials. Free-standing film-like materials comprised of stacked and overlapped platelets of graphene oxide (G-O) or thermally and electrically conductive reduced graphene oxide (rG-O) are potentially useful in various applications including filtration membranes, mechanical <b>seals,</b> <b>protective</b> layers, heating elements and components of batteries or supercapacitors {{as well as in}} electronics and optoelectronics. The advances in these applications require efficient and low-cost protocols for fabricating certain types of layered materials and, as such, protocols are urgently needed for the reduced forms of G-O. Here we report an efficient and straightforward method to thermally reduce thin films of stacked G-O platelets while still maintaining their structural integrity. By rapidly heating confined G-O films on a hot plate set to 400 degrees C under an atmosphere of air, G-O films were readily converted to intact, electrically conductive, reduced thin films. The structure and degree of reduction of the resulting free-standing rG-O films were found to be comparable to those obtained by slow annealing at the same temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|GOAL Intracochlear sound {{pressure}} (ICSP) measurements {{are limited by}} the small dimensions of the human inner ear and the requirements imposed by the liquid medium. A robust intracochlear acoustic receiver (ICAR) for repeated use with a simple data acquisition system that provides the required high sensitivity and small dimensions does not yet exist. The work described in this report aims to fill this gap and presents a new MEMS condenser microphone (CMIC) based ICAR concept suitable for ICSP measurements in human temporal bones. METHODS The ICAR head consisted of a passive <b>protective</b> diaphragm (PD) <b>sealing</b> the MEMS CMIC against the liquid medium, enabling insertion into the inner ear.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Dental {{implants}} {{anchor in}} bone through a tight fit and osseo-integratable {{properties of the}} implant surfaces, while a <b>protective</b> soft tissue <b>seal</b> around the implants neck is needed to prevent bacterial destruction of the bone-implant interface. This tissue seal needs to form in the unsterile, oral environment. We aim to identify surface properties of dental implant materials (titanium, titanium-zirconium alloy and zirconium-oxides) that determine {{the outcome of this}} "race-for-the-surface" between human-gingival-fibroblasts and different supra-gingival bacterial strains. METHODS: Biofilms of three streptococcal species or a Staphylococcus aureus strain were grown in mono-cultures on the different implant materials in a parallel-plate-flow-chamber and their biovolume evaluated using confocal-scanning-laser-microscopy. Similarly, adhesion, spreading and growth of human-gingival-fibroblasts were evaluated. Co-culture experiments with bacteria and human-gingival-fibroblasts were carried out to evaluate tissue interaction with bacterially contaminated implant surfaces. Implant surfaces were characterized by their hydrophobicity, roughness and elemental composition. RESULTS: Biofilm formation occurred on all implant materials, and neither roughness nor hydrophobicity had a decisive influence on biofilm formation. Zirconium-oxide attracted most biofilm. All implant materials were covered by human-gingival-fibroblasts for 80 - 90 % of their surface areas. Human-gingival-fibroblasts lost the race-for-the-surface against all bacterial strains on nearly all implant materials, except on the smoothest titanium variants. SIGNIFICANCE: Smooth titanium implant surfaces provide the best opportunities for a soft tissue seal to form on bacterially contaminated implant surfaces. This conclusion could only be reached in co-culture studies and coincides with the results from the few clinical studies carried out to this end...|$|R

Previous studies have identified cyanoacrylate (CA) TAs as the most promising colonic anastomotic sealants. This study investigates the <b>protective</b> effects of <b>sealing</b> colonic anastomoses with various CAs. Fifty-five Wistar rats underwent laparotomy and transection of the proximal colon. An anastomosis was created with 4 interrupted sutures followed by either application of Histoacryl Flexible, Omnex, Glubran 2, or no TA seal. An additional control group was included with a 12 -suture anastomosis and no TA seal. After 7 days, the rats were sacrificed and scored for the presence of AL as the main outcome. Secondary outcomes were the occurrence of bowel obstruction, adhesions, and anastomotic bursting pressure. Histological evaluation was performed. The highest AL rate was found in the Glubran 2 group (7 / 11), followed by the 4 -sutures group without TA (5 / 11), and the Omnex group (5 / 11). Histoacryl Flexible showed the lowest AL rate (2 / 11). In the control group, only one rat showed signs of AL. Histologically, the highest influx of inflammatory cells was found in the 4 -suture group without TA and for Omnex and Glubran 2. Histoacryl Flexible caused more mature collagen deposition when compared to the other TA groups. Histoacryl Flexible showed the lowest leakage rate compared to the other TA groups and to the 4 -suture control group. Glubran 2 showed the highest AL rate and a high inflammatory response.

The PDMS gutter layer is mainly used for preventing the pore penetration of PEBA 1657 solution and the PDMS <b>protective</b> layer for <b>sealing</b> the defects of PEBA 1657 selective layer. The prepared multilayer PEI/PDMS/PEBA 1657 /PDMS composite membranes display high permeance and high selectivity for CO 2 separation. For the nonpolar gases He, H- 2, O- 2 and N- 2, the gas permeance decreases with the increasing molecule size. But for the polar gases CO 2, H 2 S and SO 2, their permeance is {{higher than that of}} nonpolar gases. Due to CO 2 induced plasticization effect, the pressure dependence of CO 2 permeance is expressed empirically by an exponential equation. And the temperature dependence of gas permeance is correlated with different Arrhenius equation below and above the melting of PEO segments. Compared with N- 2, H- 2 and CH 4, CO 2 has lower value of the apparent activation energy of permeation (E-p) because of its higher inherent condensability and the special interaction with polymer chain. Due to CO 2 induced plasticization effect, the diffusion activation energy (E-d) of CO 2 decreases with the increase of CO 2 pressure, resulting in the decrease of E-p. As for CO 2 /N- 2 gas mixture, the pressure ratio strongly influences the CO 2 concentration in the permeate side, and a high pressure ratio is always desirable to obtain high CO 2 concentration for flue gas.
