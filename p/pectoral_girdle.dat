5|$|The bowfin is an {{actinopterygii}} {{which means}} that the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle.The <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> is attached to the skull. The pectoral girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> is well known. Both {{the left}} and right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The {{scapular}} blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Since Patagosaurus {{is known}} from many specimens, {{including}} at least one juvenile, its anatomy and growth are fairly well understood. Both ages exhibit the typical features of a sauropod, a long neck, small head, a long tail, and being quadrupedal. The juvenile exhibits features different from the adult in regions like the mandible, <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> pelvis and hindlimb, although overall their anatomy is quite similar. The many known specimens help fill in gaps in the anatomy of the genus, such as the forelimb and skull. Parts of the skeleton, like the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> tibia and pubis, are more robust, while others, like the forelimb and ischium, are more gracile. The material of Patagosaurus is similar to closely related taxa like Cetiosaurus and Volkheimeria, more primitive genera such as Barapasaurus and Amygdalodon, and more derived sauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> are to {{the upper}} limbs as the pelvic girdle is to the lower limbs; the girdles are {{the parts of the}} appendicular {{skeleton}} that anchor the appendages to the axial skeleton.|$|R
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E
50|$|The appendicular {{skeleton}} (126 bones) {{is formed}} by the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles,</b> the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle or pelvis, and the lower limbs. Their functions are to make locomotion possible {{and to protect the}} major organs of digestion, excretion and reproduction.|$|R
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other {{flapping}} theropods, implying that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry for walking evolved from the nerves governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily functioning as anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This type of movement, as well as changes to the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising then out of water.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
50|$|The ray-finned fishes are {{so called}} because their fins are webs of skin {{supported}} by bony or horny spines ("rays"), {{as opposed to}} the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish). These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton (e.g., pelvic and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles).</b>|$|R
50|$|Bony {{fish are}} {{characterized}} by a relatively stable pattern of cranial bones, rooted, medial insertion of mandibular muscle in the lower jaw. The head and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> are covered with large dermal bones. The eyeball {{is supported by a}} sclerotic ring of four small bones, but this characteristic has been lost or modified in many modern species. The labyrinth in the inner ear contains large otoliths. The braincase, or neurocranium, is frequently divided into anterior and posterior sections divided by a fissure.|$|R

5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone {{at the back of the}} skull, the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull, the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back of the skull, small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{had about}} {{nineteen}} presynsacral vertebrae (those {{of the neck}} and thorax, including three fused into a notarium), sixteen synsacral vertebrae (those of the lumbar region and sacrum), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a pygostyle. The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the sternum through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small {{in relation to the}} body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly pneumatic, broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.|$|E
50|$|The {{shells of}} cyamodontoids {{differ from those}} of turtles in several ways. Turtle shells are fused to their skeletons in several regions, {{including}} the vertebrae, ribs, gastralia (belly ribs), and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles,</b> but cyamodontoid shells overly skeletal bones without any fusion. Turtle shells are also composed of two layers of osteoderms, while cyamodontoid shells only have one layer. Cyamodontoids typically have more osteoderms forming their carapaces and plastrons (upper and lower shells) than do turtles, and the osteoderms have less well-defined shapes than the geometric scutes of turtles.|$|R
5000|$|Diadectids {{have large}} bodies with {{relatively}} short limbs. The rib cage is barrel-shaped {{to accommodate a}} large digestive tract necessary for the digestion of cellulose in plants. The skulls of diadectids are wide and deep with blunt snouts. The internal nares (holes for the nostrils) are also short. Paleontologist E.C. Case compared diadectids to turtles in 1907, noting their large <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles,</b> short, strong limbs, and robust skulls. Case described them as [...] "lowly, sluggish, inoffensive herbivorous reptiles, clad in an armor of plate {{to protect them from}} the fiercely carnivorous pelycosaurs." ...|$|R
50|$|Cuyosuchus is an extinct genus of archosauriform reptile. Its fossils {{have been}} found in Late Triassic-aged rocks of the Cacheuta Formation, Mendoza, Argentina. Cuyosuchus is based on MCNAM 2669, a partial postcranial {{skeleton}} including 26 vertebrae {{from all parts of the}} spinal column, ribs, partial <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles,</b> part of the pelvis, upper arms and part of the lower arms, the left thigh bone and shin, pitted armor scutes, and fragments. It was described in 1961 by Osvaldo Reig; the type species is C. huenei. Although originally described as a proterosuchid, restudy by Julia Desojo and colleagues in 2003 found that it could not be assigned to any family.|$|R
5|$|The {{pharyngeal}} jaws of teleosts, {{a second}} set of jaws contained within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, loops of bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium, <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> and hyoid bar. Their function is limited to merely transporting food, and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the British amateur {{palaeontologist}} Reginald W. Hooley described {{two more}} specimens of O. latidens, {{collected from the}} sea after a rock fall near Atherfield Point on the Isle of Wight in 1904. The first of these, NHMUK R3877, was collected as three blocks and consists of a skull, neck and trunk vertebrae, a shoulder blade, an ischium, {{and parts of the}} forelimbs. The second specimen, NHMUK R3878, was collected in one block, and includes parts of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> and forelimbs. These specimens represent the most complete remains of Cretaceous pterosaurs found in England, and NHMUK R3877 was one of the only known three-dimensionally preserved pterosaur skeletons for much of the 20th century (pterosaurs bones are often flattened compression fossils). Hooley discussed O. latidens in detail, and placed the genus Ornithodesmus in its own family, Ornithodesmidae. His article ended with a discussion wherein it was noted that the palaeontologist Charles William Andrews had expressed doubts as to whether O. latidens belonged in the genus Ornithodesmus, as the vertebrae of the specimen that genus was based on differed markedly from those of Hooley's specimen. The American palaeontologist Samuel W. Williston subsequently reviewed Hooley's article, disagreeing with some of his conclusions about the anatomy and classification of the animal. After Hooley's monograph, little was written about the animal {{for the rest of the}} 20th century, and no similar pterosaurs were found for decades.|$|E
5|$|Most aquatic stereospondyls have {{flattened}} heads. When feeding, {{they probably}} opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws. The jaw {{mechanics of the}} plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known, {{and is one of}} the most highly adapted. Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto-occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck. As the skull is raised, the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward. Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls, but they are not as well adapted for such movement. D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls. He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus, a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax, was able to make the same movement. Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959, suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way. At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles, but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle.</b> Plagiosuchus, a close relative of Gerrothorax, also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to. Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull, suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Juvenile Rhamphorhynchus had {{relatively}} short skulls with large eyes, and the toothless beak-like {{tips of the}} jaws were shorter in juveniles than adults, with rounded, blunt lower jaw tips eventually becoming slender and pointed as the animals grew. Adult Rhamphorhynchus also developed a strong upward [...] "hook" [...] {{at the end of}} the lower jaw. The number of teeth remained constant from juvenile to adult, though the teeth became {{relatively short}}er and stockier as the animals grew, possibly to accommodate larger and more powerful prey. The pelvic and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> fused as the animals aged, with full pectoral fusion attained by one year of age.|$|R
50|$|Amphisbaena ridleyi has a stout {{head with}} a broad snout, not set off from the neck. Most of the skull is solid bone, {{and they have a}} {{distinctive}} single median tooth in the upper jaw. They have no outer ears, and the eyes are deeply recessed and covered with skin and scales. The body is elongated, and the tail truncates in a manner that vaguely resembles the head. They lack legs but have remnants of the pelvic and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> embedded within their body musculature. Their tail is only loosely attached to their bodies, and they move using an accordion-like motion, in which the skin moves and the body seemingly just drags along behind it. They are also able to effectively perform this locomotion in reverse.|$|R
5000|$|Merriamosauria is an extinct clade of ichthyosaurs. It {{was named}} by Ryosuke Motani in his 1999 {{analysis}} of the relationships of ichthyopterygian marine reptiles and was defined in phylogenetic terms as a stem-based taxon including [...] "the last common ancestor of Shastasaurus pacificus and Ichthyosaurus communis, {{and all of its}} descendants." [...] The name honours John Campbell Merriam. Based on this definition, Merriamosauria includes most ichthyosaurs except for several Triassic groups such as the clade Mixosauria, the family Cymbospondylidae, and perhaps the family Toretocnemidae. Merriamosaurs are characterized by features in their <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> and limb bones, including an extensive connection between the scapula and the coracoid bone, the absence of the first metacarpal and the absence of a pisiform bone.|$|R
25|$|Larson et al. {{also studied}} the {{relatively}} short clavicle and the unusual {{formation of the}} <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle.</b> They compared their finding with the skeleton of Nariokotome Boy (variously classified as H.nbsp&ergaster or H.nbsp&erectus), and suggested that the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle</b> of H.nbsp&floresiensis was a transitional stage in human shoulder evolution.|$|E
25|$|The chest {{consists}} of the furcula (wishbone) and coracoid (collar bone), which, together with the scapula (see below), form the <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle.</b> The side of the chest is formed by the ribs, which meet at the sternum (mid-line of the chest).|$|E
25|$|Comparisons of {{bird and}} dinosaur skeletons, {{as well as}} {{cladistic}} analysis, strengthens {{the case for the}} link, particularly for a branch of theropods called maniraptors. Skeletal similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdle,</b> shoulder blade, clavicle, and breast bone.|$|E

25|$|An {{ecological}} {{switch from}} a predatory to herbivorous lifestyle {{was likely to}} have been a driving and influential force in directing the morphological adaptations of therizinosaurians. This is perhaps even more so true for therizinosaurids, which seem to have further adapted their pelvic and <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> to increase their upright reach, an adaption believed to have aided in a life of herbivory. Moreover, understanding the feeding patterns of these dinosaurs is important for understanding their morphology and how herbivory emerged within Theropoda. While a majority of theropod dinosaurs were carnivorous, a few select groups either transitioned or returned to an herbivorous lifestyle. Of the groups thought to have returned to herbivory, therizinosaurians are thought to have made the switch first, and are subsequently the most widely regarded candidate for the emergence of herbivory within Theropoda.|$|R
25|$|Its overall {{proportions}} {{are comparable}} to Tianyuraptor, a dromaeosaurid from the same formation, and it bears many anatomical similarities to the other Liaoning dromaeosaurids. The skull is well-preserved and similar in shape to that of Tianyuraptor and the related Sinornithosaurus. Its sacrum consists of six vertebrae, four of which are clearly fused, and its tail includes the network of bony support rods typical of dromaeosaurs, as well as middle caudal (tail) vertebrae that are somewhat elongated compared to most other dromaeosaurs. Both <b>pectoral</b> <b>girdles</b> are preserved and the specimen shows non-fused sternal plates. Its leg proportions are similar to other Liaoning dromaeosaurs, with its tibiotarsus longer than the femur {{at a ratio of}} around 1.30. This large ratio is typical of Liaoning dromaeosaurs but differs from most other dinosaurs in this group.|$|R
