The houses, which used the same design as published in [...] "A Home in a Prairie Town" [...] from the Ladies' Home Journal, were set {{toward the center of}} the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the Wasmuth Portfolio in 1910.|$|E

5000|$|Cluster Development, {{also known}} as {{conservation}} development, is a site planning approach that is an alternative to conventional subdivision development. It is a practice of Low Impact Development that groups residential properties in a <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> closer together in order to utilize {{the rest of the}} land for open space, recreation or agriculture. Cluster development differs from a planned unit development (PUD) {{due to the fact that}} a PUD contains a mix of residential, commercial, industrial, or other uses, whereas the cluster development primarily focuses on residential area.|$|E
5000|$|Western Romance {{languages}} {{are one of}} the two subdivisions of a <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the Romance languages based on the La Spezia-Rimini line. They include the Gallo-Romance and Iberian-Romance branches as well as northern Italian. The subdivision is based solely {{on the use of the}} [...] "s" [...] for pluralization and the weakening of some consonants, but that makes the categorization highly problematic because there is much higher lexical similarity between all dialects of Italian and French than between French and Spanish. There is also much higher morphological similarity between Spanish and Italian dialects than between Italian and French.|$|E

50|$|The urban planner {{will also}} be {{responsible}} for implementing the planning instruments. This is achieved through a permit process, where the proponent of a proposed development, a change in land use, or the <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> of an allotment {{will be required to}} obtain a permit, approval, licence, or consent for the proposed development or change of use. An urban planner will be tasked with considering the proposal and determining whether it complies with the intent and the specific provisions of the applicable planning instruments and zoning plans. Depending on the jurisdiction, the urban planner may have authority to determine the proposal; otherwise the planner will present a recommendation to the decision-maker, often a panel of non-planners (for example, the elected council of a local government).|$|E
50|$|For {{financial}} reasons, {{however, the}} prospects remained bleak until 1902 when William L. Elder, an Indianapolis realtor and land developer, {{came to the}} rescue. Four miles south of Downtown Indianapolis, near {{the intersection of the}} Pennsylvania Railroad and the Indianapolis, Columbus & Southern Traction Line, Elder was planning to develop a subdivision named Marion Heights. When he became aware of the effort to found a college, he offered to change the name of his <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> to University Heights; to name all the streets of the subdivision for United Brethren bishops, past or present; to donate 8 acre of land for the college campus; and to erect $40,000 worth of campus buildings. In return he asked the college’s trustees to sell the remaining 446 building lots for him.|$|E

5000|$|The Regions of Niger are {{subdivided}} into 63 Departments (départements). Before the devolution program on 1999-2005, these Departments were styled arrondissements. Confusingly, {{the next level}} up (Regions) had, before 2002-2005 been styled Departments. Prior to a revision in 2011, there had been 36 Departments. A draft law in August 2011 would expand that number to 63. [...] Until 2010, Arrondissements remained a <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> of Departments, though none were used. The decentralisation process, begun in the 1995-1999 period replaced appointed Prefects at Departmental/Arrondisement level with elected councils, first elected in 1999. These were the first local elections held {{in the history of}} Niger. Officials elected at Commune level are then selected as representatives at Departmental, Regional, and National level councils and administration. The Ministry of Decentralisation was created to oversee this task, and to create a national consultative council of local officials.|$|E
50|$|Even after {{fertilizers}} containing {{these elements}} became available, studies {{made by the}} Victorian government during the 1950s and 1960s showed that the Little Desert was not capable of becoming productive farmland and would fetch only low prices if cleared for agriculture. Local opposition to selling the land for farming was intense, and quickly gathered support around Victoria. The Bolte Government was initially unmoved by environmental concerns. Public outrage over the <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> resulted in the responsible minister losing his safe seat in a by-election. The Little Desert debate galvanised Victoria's conservation movement into forming a peak body, the Conservation Council of Victoria and the conservative Victorian government of Henry Bolte to adopt environmental policies, such as establishing the Land Conservation Council to systematically and independently review all future public land use across the state. The architect of the Land Conservation Council was the newly appointed Minister of Lands, Conservation and Soldier Settlement, William Borthwick who supported retaining the area as a nature reserve.|$|E
50|$|The area now {{covered by}} this {{district}} was first {{developed as a}} series of modest estates and stylish homes in the 1850s. These properties were subdivided and built more densely in the late 19th century, when streetcar lines made the area convenient for workers employed downtown. The property developed by Lay was originally an estate owned by Samuel Brooks, a doctor, and then George Fisk, president of the Wason Manufacturing Company. Fisk sold his property in 1913 to John Lester, who had sold properties in the area to William Lay, an English-born real estate developer and builder. Lay first <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the area in February 1913, and received building permits in December for the first building, one of the six-unit wood-frame buildings on Franklin Street. The brick eight-unit buildings on Belle Street were built in 1915.

5000|$|The plains {{thereafter}} remained nondescript fields, {{with only}} a monument to Wolfe {{as a reminder of}} the events that took place. As Quebec City grew, development of the area took place unabated, and hundreds of acres were built over. Only in 1901 did government intervention come, when the <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> of 88 acre of the region was halted by the purchase of the land by the Dominion Crown. At the same time, however, another area of the plains was taken and, despite public protest, covered by a Ross rifle factory, which included a water tank built upon an existing Martello tower. A movement to preserve the site continued, nonetheless, and by 1904, the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec was permitted by the federal government to put up plaques at various significant spots around the vicinity. The following year, a proposal for the establishment of an Historic Landmarks Association was placed before the Royal Society of Canada and Governor General the Earl Grey initiated his plan to preserve the battlefields, having visited the site and stating that he [...] "would never rest until such sacred ground became the heirloom of all Canada and the Empire." ...|$|E
5000|$|PALCO {{announced}} in 2006 {{a desire to}} sell the homes (to the employees and retirees who currently live there) and commercial property. The company suggested that Scotia become part of Rio Dell, a small neighboring town located directly across the Eel River. Additionally, the need for employees had fallen from over 1,000 to around 300, {{in part due to}} a lack of logs and also from automation. On January 18, 2007, PALCO filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. On July 8, 2008, the court issued its judgment and order confirming the Plan of Reorganization submitted by secured creditor Marathon Structured Finance Fund (Marathon), joined by Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC). Pursuant to that plan, most of the Town of Scotia’s real and personal assets transferred to a reorganized entity wholly owned by Marathon, Town of Scotia Company, LLC (TOS). Under the plan, the active Scotia sawmill facilities and other ancillary office buildings will transfer to a second reorganized entity, Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC) in which Marathon and MRC both have interests (United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Corpus Christi Division as [...] "Case No. 07-20027-C-11" [...] under the consolidated title, In Re Scotia Development LLC, et al., Debtors.) The Town of Scotia LLC has pursued a General Plan Amendment/ Zone Reclassification and Final Map Subdivision application. Subdivision requires fulfillment of conditions of approval which include formation of a community services district or other public entity to manage utilities. Service district formation requires approval by the Humboldt County Local Agency Formation Commission, which has a pending application. The purpose of the subdivision is to create individual parcels for existing residential and commercial properties, and public facilities. The <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivision</b> would allow for the sale of residential and commercial lots (all of which are currently owned and operated by the Town of Scotia LLC) to individual property owners.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the range}} of mass-classifiers, authors have <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivisions</b> based on {{the manner in which}} a mass-classifier organizes the noun into {{countable}} units. One of these is measurement units (also called [...] "standard measures"), which all languages must have in order to measure items; this category includes units such as kilometers, liters, or pounds (see list). Like other classifiers, these can also stand without a noun; thus, for example, (bàng, pound) may appear as both (sān [...] ròu, [...] "three [...] of meat") or just (sān , [...] "three [...] ", never *sān [...] ). Units of currency behave similarly: for example, 十 (shí , [...] "ten [...] "), which is short for (for example) 十人民币 (shí [...] rénmínbì, [...] "ten [...] of renminbi"). Other proposed types of mass-classifiers include [...] "collective" [...] mass-classifiers, such as (yì [...] rén, [...] "a [...] of people"), which group things less precisely; and [...] "container" [...] mass-classifiers which group things by containers they come in, as in (yì [...] zhōu, [...] "a [...] of porridge") or (yì [...] táng, [...] "a [...] of sugar").|$|R

40|$|Passage of Arizona Revised Statute 45 - 513 in May 1973 {{required}} the Arizona Water Commission {{to evaluate and}} determine {{the adequacy of the}} water supply of <b>proposed</b> <b>subdivisions.</b> The majority of new subdivisions in Arizona utilize ground water as a source of supply. The adequacy of a development's water supply is determined according to four types of criteria. The water supply must be adequate in quantity, quality, and dependability; in addition, a valid legal right to use the water must exist. An analysis of the administration of the statute reveals that the Arizona Water Commission's requirements for compliance with the law are an effective regulatory process for large developments with less than adequate water supplies. Since the law is only advisory, the effects of the Commission's decisions on the consumer are more limited. In addition, information generated by the Commission is often not considered by the counties during local subdivision approval. A prerequisite to the successful application of Commission decisions is the adoption of rules and regulations by Arizona counties to allow for the consideration of the adequacy of the water supply during the subdivision approval process...|$|R
