40|$|Discovery and {{characterization}} of functional RNA structures remains challenging due to deficiencies in de novo secondary structure modeling. Here we describe a dynamic programming approach for model-free sequence comparison that incorporates high-throughput chemical <b>probing</b> <b>data.</b> Based on SHAPE <b>probing</b> <b>data</b> alone, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) from three diverse organisms – the eubacteria E. coli and C. difficile and the archeon H. volcanii – could be aligned with accuracies comparable to alignments based on actual sequence identity. When both base sequence identity and chemical probing reactivities were considered together, accuracies improved further. Derived sequence alignments and chemical <b>probing</b> <b>data</b> from protein-free RNAs were then used as pseudo-free energy constraints to model consensus secondary structures for the 16 S and 23 S rRNAs. There are critical {{differences between these}} experimentally-informed models and currently accepted models, including in the functionally important neck and decoding regions of the 16 S rRNA. We infer that the 16 S rRNA has evolved to undergo large-scale changes in base pairing as part of ribosome function. As high-quality RNA <b>probing</b> <b>data</b> become widely available, structurally-informed sequence alignment will become broadly useful for de novo motif and function discovery...|$|R

A recent trend is to exploit the prevalence of Global Positioning System (GPS) embedded in public vehicles. The collected data forms a two dimensional traffic condition matrix (TCM), i. e., time slot and road segment.

We find that in practice it is challenging to reliably estimate a TCM. First, The distribution of <b>probed</b> <b>data</b> is uneven among road segments.

50|$|The {{flight plan}} called for the Pioneer 3 probe to pass close to the Moon after 33.75 hours and then go into solar orbit. The Juno II lifted from LC-5 at 12:44 AM on December 6. Launch went entirely {{according}} to plan until first stage cutoff, when the engine cut off 3.7 seconds early due to {{a failure of the}} propellant depletion sensors, leaving a velocity shortfall of several hundred feet per second. The injection angle was also about 71° instead of the planned 68°, and the de-spin mechanism also failed to operate. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 102,360 km (109,740 km {{from the center of the}} Earth) before falling back to Earth. It re-entered Earth's atmosphere and burned up over Africa on December 7 at approximately 19:51 UT (2:51 p.m. EST) at an estimated location of 16.4 N, 18.6 E. The probe returned telemetry for about 25 hours of its 38-hour-6-minute journey. The other 13 hours were blackout periods due to the location of the two tracking stations. The returned information showed that the internal temperature remained at about 43 °C over most of the period.While Pioneer 3 did not meet its primary mission objective of a lunar flyby, the data obtained was of particular value to James Van Allen. The Pioneer 3 <b>probe</b> <b>data</b> in addition to the data from the previous Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 satellites led to the discovery of a distinct second radiation belt around the Earth.

These Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the Earth are named for Dr. James Van Allen, in honor of his discovery.|$|E
