25|$|Although the numbat finds termite mounds {{primarily}} using scent, it has {{the highest}} visual acuity of any marsupial, and, unusually for marsupials, has {{a high proportion of}} cone cells in the retina.

The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he did not say that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the <b>primary</b> <b>sense</b> is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E

25|$|Vision is the <b>primary</b> <b>sense</b> for humans, but speech {{perception}} is multimodal, {{which means that}} it involves information {{from more than one}} sensory modality, in particular, audition and vision. The McGurk effect arises during phonetic processing because the integration of audio and visual information happens early in speech perception. The McGurk effect is very robust; that is, knowledge about it seems to have little effect on one's perception of it. This is different from certain optical illusions, which break down once one 'sees through' them. Some people, including those that have been researching the phenomenon for more than twenty years, experience the effect even when they are aware that it is taking place. With the exception of people who can identify most of what is being said from speech-reading alone, most people are quite limited in their ability to identify speech from visual-only signals. A more extensive phenomenon is the ability of visual speech to increase the intelligibility of heard speech in a noisy environment. Visible speech can also alter the perception of perfectly audible speech sounds when the visual speech stimuli are mismatched with the auditory speech. Normally, speech {{perception is}} thought to be an auditory process; however, our use of information is immediate, automatic, and, to a large degree, unconscious and therefore, despite what is widely accepted as true, speech is not only something we hear. Speech is perceived by all of the senses working together (seeing, touching, and listening to a face move). The brain is often unaware of the separate sensory contributions of what it perceives. Therefore, when it comes to recognizing speech the brain cannot differentiate whether it is seeing or hearing the incoming information.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from its}} use in the Qur'an, fitna came to have a <b>primary</b> <b>sense</b> of [...] "'revolt', 'disturbances', 'civil war', but a civil war that breeds schism and in which the believers' purity of faith is in grave danger." [...] This was {{especially}} so as it came, in the term First Fitna, {{to refer to the}} first major civil war of the Islamic Caliphate, which lasted from 656 to 661. [...] "On account of the struggles that marked Mu‘āwiya's advent, the term fitna was later applied to any period of disturbances inspired by schools or sects that broke away from the majority of believers." [...] The term thus appears the descriptions of other major conflicts such as the Second Fitna (680–92), the Third Fitna (744–47), the Fourth Fitna (809-827), and the Fitna of al-Andalus (1009–1031).|$|E
2500|$|The {{aesthetics}} scholar David Marshall draws {{out this}} theme even further {{by noting that}} the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities. In describing the occupations of the acting troupe, he writes [...] "Two construct or put together, two mend and repair, one weaves and one sews. All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent, broken, or sundered." [...] In Marshall's opinion, this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities, it creates new identities found in community, which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare's opinions on love and marriage. Further, the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Marshall remarks that [...] "To be an actor is to double and divide oneself, to discover oneself in two parts: both oneself and not oneself, both the part and not the part." [...] He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character, particularly among the lovers, has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing. It seems that a desire to lose one's individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events of A Midsummer Night's Dream. As the <b>primary</b> <b>sense</b> of motivation, this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story's overall mood.|$|E

40|$|Experimental modal {{analysis}} is {{highly dependent on}} the quality of the frequency response functions (FRFs) used to extract the mode shapes and other modal parameters. Therefore, the key to success in experimental {{modal analysis}} is to obtain FRFs which contain accurate and reliable information;In spite of manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 efforts to minimize the cross-axis sensitivity of their transducers, most transducers used to measure the response of the structure have a <b>primary</b> <b>sensing</b> axis and a perpendicular plane which contains a direction of maximum cross-axis sensitivity. Due to the cross-axis sensitivity, the measured signals are contaminated and this contamination can lead to serious errors in the measured FRFs as well as the resulting modal analysis. It was found that the contamination is not random in nature but is systematically accumulated in the measured FRF, and that the amount of cross-axis measurement error depends on the components of the motion to be measured relative to the <b>primary</b> <b>sensing</b> direction as well as the cross-axis plane;This cross-axis sensitivity error can be compensated for in either the time domain or the frequency domain. The method employed is dependent on the data acquisition and data processing system being used. Accurate calibration for the cross-axis sensitivities should be done using the same compensation process. Both compensated and uncompensated frequency response functions are used to show the effect of cross-axis sensitivity on the modal analysis results obtained for a simple structure...|$|R
