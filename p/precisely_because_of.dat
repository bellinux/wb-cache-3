Ironically, these attempts did not truly subvert the Music, but only elaborated Eru's original intentions: the Music of Eru took on depth and beauty <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the strife and sadness Melkor's disharmonies (and measures to rectify them) introduced.

25|$|With {{both his}} courage and {{experience}} to draw from, Cézanne created a hybrid art-form. He combined {{on the one hand}} the imitative and the immobile, a system left over from the Renaissance, and the mobile on the other; together to forming a hybrid. His own generation would see in his contradictory codes nothing more than impotence, unaware of his intentions. However, the next generation would see in Cézanne greatness, <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this duality. Cézanne was seen simultaneously as a classicist by those who chose to see in his work the imitation of nature and perspective, and as a revolutionary by those who saw in him a revolt against imitation and classical perspective. Timid, yet clearly manifest, was the will to deconstruct. Artists {{at the forefront of the}} Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice these tendencies inherent in the work of Cézanne, and decided to venture still further.|$|E
25|$|Justice White {{authored}} the dissent, {{joined by}} Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens. In noting his {{disagreement with the}} other Justices, Justice White argues that the third part of the O'Brien test (requiring that the law be unrelated to the suppression of free expression) is not satisfied. In pursuing legitimate government interests, the statute in place restricts conduct - nudity - that is integral to the expressive nature of the act. Citing Schad v. Borough of Mt. Ephraim (1981), the dissent remarks that the condition of human nakedness {{in and of itself}} does not transform otherwise protected speech into unprotected speech. Justice White argues that it is <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the heightened expressive impact that the state chooses to forbid public nudity, because the state desires to control the negative secondary effects such as prostitution and degradation of women. Because nudity {{is an essential part of}} the potency of the expression in question, the law unconstitutionally restricts that expression.|$|E

25|$|The {{stock market}} crash in the 1929 not only {{affected}} {{the business community and}} the public’s economic confidence, but also it led to the banking system soon after the turmoil. The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist Kindleberger of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and {{after the collapse of the}} stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked. Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} have expressed {{the view that}} excessive value has been placed by the courts on protecting {{the independence of the}} judiciary, and that insufficient weight has been given to the right to freedom of speech. One assumption said to be incorrect is that undermining public confidence in the administration of justice is in all circumstances harmful to the public interest. Arguably, if the scandalizing allegation is true or is an opinion honestly and reasonably held, then it is in the public interest that such speech be heard <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the importance of the judiciary to society. However, common law rules of contempt do not recognize the defence of either justification or fair comment which are available to the tort of defamation. Secondly, the claim that scandalizing the court may undermine public confidence in the judiciary represents an unduly pessimistic view of the maturity and ability of the Singapore public to assess for itself whether or not the scandalizing speech is true, and is perhaps a sweeping statement as to general public awareness. Lastly, it is also assumed that public confidence in the judiciary can be preserved by the suppression of scandalizing speech. However, it is unlikely that such speech can ever be completely suppressed. It would be impossible to monitor speech that goes on in homes, coffee shops and hawker centres. Through these informal channels, suspicions of the judiciary may fester and grow.|$|E

He indicated that he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name, and contrasted this with other writing methods which first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow. He again defended his decision to have Mami die, claiming that this could actually have the converse effect of making her character even more memorable, saying, [...] "I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died, like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star. <b>Precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the way they died, they were able to live forever." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{last major}} theme {{examined}} in this report is the vexed question of earnings dispersion, analysis of which has gained more currency <b>of</b> late <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the association between inequality and growth.

The first is the standard one: unions are associated with reduced inequality, the corollary being that their decline has exacerbated it. The second {{is associated with the}} recherché notion that unions have in fact become less interested in redistribution. Even if one accepts that union decline is an important determinant of rising inequality, however, there is no general presumption in favor of strengthening the institution. The growth card is complicated <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> losses <b>of</b> competitiveness may have caused union decline.|$|R

500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word seems to get bogged down or get taken apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re {{not going to find}} anyone arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for [...] "rockism".

Moreno sought to modify the military balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up until that point, the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead. However, in the short run this measure worked against him, as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> such rules.
