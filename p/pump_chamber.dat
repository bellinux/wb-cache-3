50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a flexible diaphragm, similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a diaphragm spring, during which the fuel in the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the diaphragm spring.|$|E
50|$|Some {{compressor}} types such as {{the scroll}} compressor use a continuously shrinking compression volume. Once liquid completely fills this volume the pump may either stall and overload, or the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> may be warped or otherwise damaged by the fluid that can not fit into a smaller space.|$|E

In 1943 {{building}} began on a complex of underground tunnels and rooms, included shell stores, magazines, <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> and power house, plotting room and command post, and battery observation posts. However, the threat of attack receded as the battery was completed. Resources were allocated elsewhere, and the battery and its guns were placed in reserve. The battery was decommissioned in 1963 and the guns scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The {{carburetor}} typically {{contains a}} float bowl {{into which the}} expelled fuel is pumped. When the fuel level in the float bowl exceeds a certain level, the inlet valve to the carburetor will close, preventing the fuel pump from pumping more fuel into the carburetor. At this point, any remaining fuel inside the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> is trapped, unable to exit through the inlet port or outlet port. The diaphragm will continue to allow pressure to the diaphragm, and during the subsequent rotation, the eccentric will pull the diaphragm back to bottom dead center, where it will remain until the inlet valve to the carburetor reopens.|$|E

40|$|The {{conductance}} catheter {{method has}} been applied to evaluate dynamics of a heart cycle. Its validation for the functional analysis of Biomechanical Hearts (BMH), autologous muscular blood pumps with a stabilizing <b>pumping</b> <b>chamber,</b> has not yet been reported. In a test apparatus, a fluid filled <b>pumping</b> <b>chamber</b> of a BMH was hydraulically compressed by a moving piston. Volume shift was measured simultaneously by a conductance catheter and by a movement analyzer as control with variation of catheter’s electrical field, the <b>pumping</b> <b>chamber’s</b> surrounding conductivity and the piston velocity. For all these conditions, no significant influence on the measurement accuracy was observed (p> 0. 4,p> 0. 33,p> 0. 18). Volumes measured by both methods showed a maximum relative error of 6. 1 ± 0. 4 % (R= 0. 99). Peak flows however demonstrated a remarkably high relative error up to 48 % (R= 0. 955). Aberrations in peak flows as well as in volumes may be compensated by computed calibration formulae.

30|$|The {{combined}} valveless piezoelectric pump with cone-shaped tubes was fabricated on a brass substrate with {{thickness of}} 1 mm. The diameter of single piezoelectric vibrator was 13 mm. The cross-sections of both diffuser and nozzle were square, where the narrowest size was 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm. When the two <b>pump</b> <b>chambers</b> {{were working in}} reversed phase, the maximum flow rate was 16 ml/min at the driving frequency of 540 Hz and the maximum pump pressure was 1.7 m.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a pump plunger. Oil is used since it is self lubricating and stable. When the plunger pulls back, it draws oil out of the reservoir through a suction check valve into the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber.</b> When the plunger moves forward, it pushes the oil through a discharge check valve into the cylinder. The suction valve ball is within the chamber and opens with each draw of the plunger. The discharge valve ball is outside the chamber and opens when the oil is pushed into the cylinder. At this point the suction ball within the chamber is forced shut and oil pressure builds in the cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{technology}} {{has recently been}} developed which combines gas lift with a rod pump, dedicating two separate tubing strings in the wellbore for each lift method. This technique is designed specifically to artificially lift the unique geometry of horizontal/deviated wells and also vertical wells that have deep or very long perforated intervals, or have too high of a gas liquid ratio (GLR) for conventional artificial lift methods. In this design, the rod pump {{is placed in the}} vertical portion of the well above the deviated or perforated interval, while relatively low pressure-low volume gas is used to lift reservoir liquids from the deviated or extended perforated interval to above the rod pump. Once the liquids are raised above the pump, they become trapped above a packer and then enter the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> where they are transported to the surface.|$|E
50|$|Valveless pumping {{assists in}} fluid {{transport}} in various biomedical and engineering systems. In a valveless pumping system, no valves (or physical occlusions) are present {{to regulate the}} flow direction. The fluid pumping efficiency of a valveless system, however, is not necessarily lower than that having valves. In fact, many fluid-dynamical systems in nature and engineering more or less rely upon valveless pumping to transport the working fluids therein. For instance, blood circulation in the cardiovascular system is maintained to some extent even when the heart’s valves fail. Meanwhile, the embryonic vertebrate heart begins pumping blood long before the development of discernible chambers and valves. In microfluidics, valveless impedance pumps have been fabricated, {{and are expected to}} be particularly suitable for handling sensitive biofluids. Ink jet printers operating on the Piezoelectric transducer principle also use valveless pumping. The <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> is emptied through the printing jet due to reduced flow impedance in that direction and refilled by capillary action..|$|E

5000|$|Spring-piston guns, {{especially}} high-powered ones, do still recoil as {{a result}} of the forward motion of the piston. Although the recoil is less than that of some cartridge firearms, it can make the gun difficult to shoot accurately as the recoil forces are in effect whilst the pellet is still within the barrel. Spring gun recoil has a sharp forward movement too, caused by the piston hitting the front end of the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> when the spring has fully decompressed. These two reactions are known to damage scopes not rated for spring gun use. In addition, the spring vibrations can also cause accuracy to suffer. These vibrations can be controlled by adding features like close-fitting spring guides or by aftermarket tuning done by [...] "air-gunsmiths" [...] who specialize in air gun modifications. A common modification is the addition of viscous silicone grease to the spring, which both lubricates it and dampens vibration. Some shooters also often hold the gun in a very loose grip (the [...] "artillery hold" [...] as coined by famous airgunner Tom Gaylord) that allows the gun to vibrate in a natural and consistent manner.|$|E
50|$|Rocket engines {{requires}} {{a tremendous amount}} of fuelat high pressure. Often the pump costs more than the thrust chamber. One way to supply fuel is to use the expensiveturbopump mentioned above, another way is to pressurize fueltank. Pressurizing a large fuel tank {{requires a}} heavy, expensive tank. However suppose instead of pressurizing the entire tank, the main tank is drained into a small <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> which is thenpressurized. To achieve steady flow, the pump system consists oftwo pump chambers such that each one supplies fuel for half of each cycle. The pump is powered by pressurized gas which acts directly on the fluid. For each half of the pump system, a chamber is filled from the main tank under low pressure and at a high flow rate, then the chamber is pressurized, and then the fluid is delivered to the engine at a moderate flow rate under high pressure. The chamber is then vented and cycle repeats. The system is designed so that the inlet flow rate is higher than the outlet flow rate. This allows time for one chamber to be vented, refilled and pressurized while the other is being emptied. A breadboard pump has been tested and it works great. A high version has been designed and built and is pumping at 20 gpm and 550 psi.|$|E
