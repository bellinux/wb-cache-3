5|$|The Reich Forestry Office under Göring {{enforced}} {{regulations that}} required foresters {{to plant a}} wide variety of trees to ensure suitable habitat for wildlife and a new Reich Animal Protection Act became law in 1933. The regime enacted the Reich Nature Protection Act in 1935 to protect the natural landscape from excessive economic development and it allowed for the expropriation of privately owned land to create nature preserves and aided in long-range planning. <b>Perfunctory</b> efforts were made to curb air pollution, but little enforcement of existing legislation was undertaken once the war began.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{efforts were}} {{launched}} from St John's {{in the hope}} of finding more survivors. An English schooner, John Clements, spent a week searching, before returning with Arctics flagstaff but no personnel. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, owners of the steamer Victoria, offered their vessel to the US consul for a fee of $500 a day, an action which led to considerable local press criticism. By contrast, the Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Revd Edward Feild, provided his private yacht Hawk free of charge. Eventually Victoria agreed to assist without payment, although an unnamed correspondent of the Public Ledger doubted whether the ship made more than a <b>perfunctory</b> search. None of the ships other than John Clements found any definite traces of Arctic. Some reported that they had sighted debris, but were not able to identify or recover it.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{participated in}} the Battle of Midway in June 1942, {{although}} they did not see any combat. Mutsu saw more active service than her sister because {{she was not a}} flagship and {{participated in the}} Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August before returning to Japan in early 1943. One of Mutsus aft magazines detonated in June, killing 1,121 crew and visitors and destroying the ship. The IJN conducted a <b>perfunctory</b> investigation into the cause of her loss and concluded that it was the work of a disgruntled crewmember. They dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking to keep up morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was salvaged after the war and many artifacts and relics are on display in Japan.|$|E

25|$|William F. S. Miles of Northeastern University, {{argues that}} this <b>perfunctory</b> {{division}} of the entire continent created expansive ungoverned borderlands. These borderlands persist today and are havens for crimes like human trafficking and arms smuggling.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} criticisms have been leveled at the Robertson panel. In {{particular}} that the panel’s {{study of the}} phenomena was relatively <b>perfunctory</b> and its conclusions largely predetermined by the earlier CIA review of the UFO situation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the drawing}} {{up of the}} Penang Structure Plan, public {{consultation}} was minimal, <b>perfunctory</b> {{and the results were}} entirely ignored. Since a mega development is going to take place on the Turf Club land that is subjected to the Structure Plan, we would therefore call for a greater genuine public consultation due to the large size of this project.|$|E
25|$|On 13 April, {{partly in}} revenge for the Deir Yassin massacre, a convoy that was driving towards Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus was {{attacked}} by hundreds of Arabs. In the seven-hour battle 79 Jews were killed including doctors and patients. Thirteen British soldiers were present, but they stood by, only putting in a <b>perfunctory</b> attempt at intervention in the last moments of the massacre.|$|E
25|$|Many {{immigrants}} who passed the <b>perfunctory</b> quarantine checks at Grosse Isle fell sick soon afterwards. Some {{died in the}} camp for the 'healthy', tents {{on the eastern side}} of Grosse Isle. When a priest, Father O'Reilly, visited this area in August, he gave the last rites to fifty people. In the week leading up to August 18 alone, 88 deaths occurred among the 'healthy'.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} {{bank of the}} Danube, Napoleon's forces relentlessly pressed back the outnumbered Austrian left wing of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller, which {{consisted}} of the V, VI, and II Reserve Armeekorps. After brutal fighting at the Battle of Ebelsberg on 3 May, the Franco-Allied army appeared before Vienna. After a <b>perfunctory</b> resistance, Archduke Maximilian of Austria–Este abandoned the Austrian capital which was {{handed over to the}} French early on 13 May.|$|E
25|$|There was extreme {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{marriage}} “registry offices” of the time. Couples, who could not or would not use clerical celebrants, were humiliated by <b>perfunctory</b> and undignified ceremonies. The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, the major denominations of the time, discouraged or forbad remarriage of divorced people; and the offensively dismissive marriages offered by the state in registry offices often seemed designed {{to add to the}} distress of couples who were defying their own church's rules.|$|E
25|$|In early May, Satoko {{visits the}} Toinnomiya villa {{by the sea}} and meets Prince Harunori. Formal {{proposals}} quickly follow by mail. Kiyoaki is filled with satisfaction to see Satoko, Tadeshina and Iinuma drift out of his life; and he takes pride in his lack of emotion when Iinuma tearfully takes his leave, later comparing his own ultra-correct conduct with the elegant progress of a beetle on his window-sill. The absence of Iinuma makes that year's omiyasama festival, commemorating Kiyoaki's grandfather, more <b>perfunctory</b> than ever.|$|E
25|$|In February 1301 the Mongols, {{accompanied}} by the Armenian king Hethum II, finally made their promised advance into Syria. General Kutlushka went to Little Armenia to fetch troops and from there moved south past Antioch. The Armenians were also {{accompanied by}} Guy of Ibelin, Count of Jaffa, and John of Giblet. While Kutlushka had a force of 60,000, he could do little else than engage in some <b>perfunctory</b> raiding {{as far as the}} environs of Aleppo. When Ghazan announced that he had canceled his operations for the year, the Crusaders, after some deliberations, decided to return to Cyprus, leaving only a garrison on Ruad.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, {{the theater}} was running one-reel films after each night's performances; Anita {{would take a}} <b>perfunctory</b> bow and run {{to the back of}} the theater to watch them. She sent her first attempt at a screenplay, He Was A College Boy, to the Biograph Company, for which she {{received}} $25. The New York Hat, starring Mary Pickford and Lionel Barrymore and directed by D. W. Griffith, was her third screenplay and the first to be produced. Loos dredged real life and real situations for her scenarios: she dished up her father's cronies, her brother's friends and the rich vacationers from the San Diego resorts; eventually every experience became grist for her script mill.|$|E
25|$|During 1969, Buckley {{began to}} write and record {{material}} for three different albums: Lorca, Blue Afternoon, and Starsailor. Inspired by the singing of avant-garde musician Cathy Berberian, he decided to integrate the ideas of composers such as Luciano Berio and Iannis Xenakis in an avant-garde rock genre. He started to fully use his vocal range. According to Underwood, Buckley knew that Lorca had little to no chance in the commercial market. Selecting eight songs that {{had yet to be}} recorded, these tracks evolved into the sessions for Blue Afternoon, an album that was quite similar to Happy Sad in style. In a 1977 article for Down Beat magazine, Underwood wrote that Buckley's heart was not into the Blue Afternoon performances and that the album was a <b>perfunctory</b> response to please his business partners.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-18th century, the bassoon's {{function}} in the orchestra was still mostly limited {{to that of a}} continuo instrument—since scores often made no specific mention of the bassoon, its use was implied, particularly if there were parts for oboes or other winds. Beginning in the early Rococo era, composers such as Joseph Haydn, Michael Haydn, Johann Christian Bach, Giovanni Battista Sammartini and Johann Stamitz included parts that exploited the bassoon for its unique color, rather than for its <b>perfunctory</b> ability to double the bass line. Orchestral works with fully independent parts for the bassoon would not become commonplace until the Classical era. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Jupiter symphony is a prime example, with its famous bassoon solos in the first movement. The bassoons were generally paired, as in current practice, though the famed Mannheim orchestra boasted four.|$|E
25|$|French opera was now {{established}} as a distinct genre. Though influenced by Italian models, tragédie en musique increasingly diverged from the form then dominating Italy, opera seria. French audiences disliked the castrato singers who were extremely popular {{in the rest of}} Europe, preferring their male heroes to be sung by the haute-contre, a particularly high tenor voice. Dramatic recitative {{was at the heart of}} Lullian opera, whereas in Italy recitative had dwindled to a <b>perfunctory</b> form known as secco, where the voice was accompanied only by the continuo. Likewise, the choruses and dances that were such a feature of French works played little or no part in opera seria. Arguments over the respective merits of French and Italian music dominated criticism throughout the following century, until Gluck arrived in Paris and effectively fused the two traditions in a new synthesis.|$|E
25|$|On November 2, 1919, the Phillips County {{authorities}} began {{trying the}} defendants {{on charges of}} murder. Frank Hicks was charged with first degree murder of Clinton Lee, with Frank Moore, Ed Hicks, J. E. Knox, Paul Hall, and Ed Coleman charged as accessories. Hicks {{and a total of}} eleven defendants were sentenced to death after <b>perfunctory</b> trials: counsel for the accused, who did not meet their clients until the trial began, called no witnesses, produced no evidence, and did not call on the defendants to testify. The first trial took three-quarters of an hour, after which the all-white jury returned a guilty verdict on the first-degree murder charge in eight minutes. Later trials were just as short; the juries took less than ten minutes to reach a verdict in each case. A twelfth defendant was sentenced to death several weeks later, after the jury deliberated for four minutes.|$|E
25|$|He was {{insulated}} by his wife, who selected {{matters for}} his attention and delegated others to his cabinet. Wilson temporarily resumed a <b>perfunctory</b> attendance at cabinet meetings. By February 1920, the President's true condition was publicly known. At issue was Wilson's fitness {{for the presidency}} {{at a time when}} the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to him, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing to admit he was unable to perform the duties of the presidency. Because of this complex case, and the subsequent realization of the difficulties that might have been experienced in the nuclear age if, instead of being assassinated in 1963, John F. Kennedy had been left in a permanent vegetative state on account of his brain injuries, the 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 to allow the voluntary or forcible replacement of an unable or unwilling incumbent.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from his}} {{business}} interests, Landale was appointed an unofficial {{member of the}} Executive Council, from 1946 to 1951, and the senior unofficial member of the Legislative Council, from 1946 to 1950, by the Hong Kong government, {{being one of the}} first unofficial members appointed when civilian government resumed after the war in May 1946. As an active critic of the government, he openly criticised the government in the Legislative Council meetings for a number of times, such as to blame the government for the <b>perfunctory</b> way it compiled the annual Budget and for its failure to maintain effective communication between Hong Kong and Whitehall in London, of which he thought was a key factor to achieve good governance. In 1947, the government started to require an increase in the extent of developments on some of the Rural Buildings Lots in offering re-grants to landowners, as a measure to cope with the influx of refugees from mainland China and the housing shortage. The measure was complained by Landale as oppressive to the landowners due to the higher construction costs that they had to bear.|$|E
25|$|His {{scholarship}} and {{his interest in}} questions of the day led him into affiliations {{with many of the}} learned societies. Nor were these affiliations <b>perfunctory</b> only. He regularly attended the society meetings, wrote papers for them, and rose to the highest places in their councils. He was president of the American Social Science Association (1897), International Law Association (1899), American Historical Association (1905), Political Science Association (1910), American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes (1911), Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, Connecticut Society of the Archeological Institute of America (1914). He was vice-president of the Archeological Institute of America (1898) and of the social and economic science section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1903). He was an associate of the Institute of International Law. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1912. He was a member also of the National Institute of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Society, elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893, and a corresponding member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Colonial Society of Massachusetts, and L'Institut de Droit Comparé.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{began on}} February 3, 1863 with the breaching of a levee on the Mississippi River, allowing water to {{flow from the}} river into a former channel that connected with the Yazoo River {{through a series of}} other waterways. The attacking fleet passed through the cut into Moon Lake, through the Yazoo Pass to the Coldwater River, and then into the Tallahatchie, which combines with the Yalobusha to form the Yazoo River, which met the Mississippi a short distance above Vicksburg. From the start, the expedition was delayed by natural obstacles that were more serious than the <b>perfunctory</b> Confederate resistance, so forward motion was as little as ten miles (16km) a day. Because progress was so slow, the Confederate Army under Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton was able to set up a fort and block passage of the Federal fleet near the town of Greenwood, Mississippi. The Federal fleet did not approach the fort until March 11; then, the ironclad gunboats of the fleet were repulsed in a series of gunfire exchanges on three separate days. The Army troops present could not contribute significantly to the battle {{because of the nature of}} the ground, much of which was under water.|$|E
25|$|After the Arab Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Middle Persian, the {{language}} of Sassanids, continued in wide use well into the second Islamic century (eighth century) as a medium of administration in the eastern lands of the Caliphate. Despite Arabization of public affairs, the peoples retained much of their pre-Islamic outlook and way of life, adjusted to fit {{the demands of the}} Islamic religion. Towards {{the end of the first}} Islamic century, population began resenting the cost of sustaining the Arab Caliphs, the Umayyads - who become oppressive and corrupt, and in the second Islamic century (eighth century AD), a generally Persian-led uprising - led by the Iranian national hero Abu Muslim Khorasani - brought another Arab clan, the Abbasids, to the Caliphal throne. Under the Abbasids, the Persianate customs of their Barmakid viziers became the style of the ruling elite. Politically, the Abbasids soon started losing their control, causing two major and lasting consequences. First, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutasim (833-842) greatly increased the presence of Turkic mercenaries and Mamluk slaves in the Caliphate, and they eventually displaced Arabs and Persians from the military, and therefore from the political hegemony, starting an era of Turco-Persian symbiosis. Second, the governors in Khurasan, Tahirids, were factually independent; then the Saffarids from Sistan freed the eastern lands, but were replaced by independent Samanids, although they showed <b>perfunctory</b> deference to the Caliph. Separation of the eastern lands from Caliphate was expressed in a distinctive Persianate culture that became a dominant culture in West, Central and South Asia, and the source of innovations elsewhere in the Islamic world. This culture would persist, at least in the modified form of the Ottoman Empire, into the twentieth century. The Persianate culture was marked by the use of the new Persian language as a medium of administration and literature, by the rise of Persianized Turks to military control, by new political importance of non-Arab ulama, and by development of ethnically composite Islamic society.|$|E
500|$|That {{night the}} {{delegation}} stayed {{at a local}} hotel where, despite confirmed reservations, most of the rooms had been canceled and reassigned, leaving the delegation sleeping in the lobby. [...] For three days, Ryan continued negotiation with Jones's legal counsel and held <b>perfunctory</b> meetings with embassy personnel and Guyanese officials.|$|E
500|$|The first movement's {{exposition}} commences in the tonic of F-sharp minor, before modulating to {{the relative}} major of A. After a long development section, the recapitulation both arrives and concludes in F-sharp major. Sutcliffe argues that the <b>perfunctory</b> major-key conclusion is not a [...] "happy ending" [...] but an [...] "uneasy truce" [...] that paves {{the way for the}} remainder of the quartet, the finale of which concludes in a minor key.|$|E
500|$|By contrast, The A.V. Club Evan Rytlewski {{wrote that}} the song opens Looking 4 Myself on a [...] "discouragingly <b>perfunctory</b> note", though complimented Usher for not using {{auto-tune}} to alter his vocals. Idolator's Robbie Daw was ambivalent towards the track, writing that [...] "Scream" [...] contains [...] "a dance-pop formula you can hear when flipping to any pop station on the radio". Neon Limelight disproved the track as a whole for being generic, saying that the song is a disappointment compared to its previous single [...] "Climax". Melinda Newman of HitFix showed a similar opinion, also noting the track as generic.|$|E
500|$|The minuet is the {{shortest}} among those of the Opus 50, but the trio features an exceptionally long second section, which uses drifting melodies, a fermata {{and a pair of}} two-measure pauses {{to create a sense of}} timelessness. Neither the minuet nor the trio reaches a proper conclusion, and in this they continue a feature of the first two movements. [...] The minuet ends with a <b>perfunctory</b> reprise of its main theme and the trio draws out its final cadence with a chromatic passage marked [...] "diminuendo". [...] Again, Haydn reinforces the interconnectedness between the movements with an explicit direction to the performers for an immediate segue from the reprised minuet to the finale.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in 2012, calling Q an [...] "iconic figure". [...] Handlen said Q allowed the writers {{to compare the}} different reaction of the characters to his presence in DS9 and TNG. However, Handlen felt that Q {{was not a good}} fit for DS9, as the character seemed like an afterthought. Also, the pairing of Vash and Q took up too much screen time compared to the main cast, Handlen noted, while the overall plot involving the [...] "stealth alien" [...] embryo [...] "plays like an abandoned script from early in TNGs run, and an example of a fascinating concept reduced to a <b>perfunctory</b> MacGuffin," [...] Handlen wrote.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Puerto Rican salsa singer Tony Vega covered [...] "Si Tú Supieras" [...] on his album Hoy Quiero Cantarte. It was {{released}} {{as a single}} for the album and peaked at number five on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Mexican recording artist Manuel Mijares recorded {{his version of the}} song on his album Vivir Así (2009). Argentine-Mexican singer Noel Schajris covered the track on his album Grandes Canciones (2011). AllMusic editor Jon O'Brien criticized Schajris for choosing to [...] "play it safe with <b>perfunctory</b> covers of drippy romantic ballads" [...] with [...] "Si Tú Supieras" [...] being cited as one of the examples. Mexican guitarist Chamin Correa performed an instrumental version on his album Cuerdas Amor Y Guitarra, Vol. 2 (1997).|$|E
500|$|After his <b>perfunctory</b> reconnaissance, Frederick {{returned}} to his camp to develop his battle plan. [...] He planned to direct a diversionary force, commanded by Finck, to the Hühner Fliess, to demonstrate in front of what he {{believed to be the}} main Russian line. He would march with his main army to the southeast of the Allied position, circling around Kunersdorf, screened by the Reppen Forest. This way, he thought, he would surprise his enemy, forcing the Allied army to reverse fronts, which is a complicated maneuver for even the best trained troops. Frederick could then employ his much feared oblique battle order, feinting with his left flank as he did so. Ideally, this would allow him to roll up the Allied line from the Mühlberge.|$|E
500|$|Brad Wete of Complex disagreed, {{calling the}} song, along with [...] "Lemme See", a [...] "gem". Andrew Unterberger of Popdust called the song [...] "not exactly single-worthy material", being [...] "a hobbled-together bunch of musical cliches, where David Guetta stadium house beats meets Skrillex wub-wubs, like {{the brainchild of}} the most uncreative EDM think tank possible." [...] According to Unterberger, the lyrics are [...] "even more hackneyed", with its [...] "Kardashian-worthy opening lines" [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club both [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Scream" [...] as two [...] "overinflated dance numbers" [...] that open the album on a [...] "discouragingly <b>perfunctory</b> note". He {{concluded}} by stating that: [...] "If there’s a bright spot to either, it’s that they forgo the garish auto-tune of Usher's previous dance forays, so at least his whole register comes across cleanly." ...|$|E
500|$|Other than {{participating}} in the Battle of Midway and the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in 1942, where {{she did not see}} any significant combat, Mutsu spent most of {{the first year of the}} Pacific War in training. She returned to Japan in early 1943. That June, one of her aft magazines detonated while she was at anchor, sinking the ship with the loss of 1,121 crew and visitors. The IJN conducted a <b>perfunctory</b> investigation into the cause of her loss and concluded that it was the work of a disgruntled crew member. The navy dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking in the interest of morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was scrapped after the war, but some artefacts and relics are on display in Japan, and a small portion of the ship remains where it was sunk.|$|E
500|$|After leaving {{reinforcements}} {{with the}} Fort Stanwix garrison, Arnold returned to Stillwater, where General Gates {{had taken over}} the command from Schuyler. [...] Arnold had learned of Gates' assumption of command while he was at Fort Dayton. [...] He wrote a somewhat <b>perfunctory</b> congratulatory to Gates when he heard of the American victory in the Battle of Bennington, but a somewhat warmer letter he wrote to Schuyler at the same time somehow fell into Gates' hands. [...] Gates provided a snub of sorts when he reported to Congress on the relief of Stanwix and the action at Bennington, and failed to mention Arnold's role; he did specifically mention Stark and Seth Warner, the principal commanders at Bennington, in his dispatch. [...] Washington was more forthcoming with praise, recognizing that [...] "the approach of General Arnold with his detachment" [...] played [...] {{a key role in the}} relief of Stanwix.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to head off {{unauthorised}} American productions of their next opera, The Pirates of Penzance, Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere. They hoped to forestall further [...] "piracy" [...] by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto. They did succeed in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the venture, but they tried without success {{for many years to}} control the American performance copyrights over their operas. Pirates was an immediate hit in New York, and later London, becoming {{one of the most popular}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas. To secure the British copyright, there was a <b>perfunctory</b> performance the afternoon before the New York premiere, at the Royal Bijou Theatre, Paignton, Devon, organised by Helen Lenoir.|$|E
500|$|Portal {{received}} critical acclaim, often {{earning more}} praise than either Half-Life 2: Episode Two or Team Fortress 2, two titles {{also included in}} The Orange Box. It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that [...] "the way the game progresses from being a simple set of <b>perfunctory</b> tasks to a full-on part of the Half-Life story is absolute genius", while GameSpy noted that [...] "What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration." [...] The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the stand-alone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.|$|E
