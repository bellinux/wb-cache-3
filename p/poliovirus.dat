5|$|The second inactivated polio {{virus vaccine}} was {{developed}} in 1952 by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh, and announced to the world on 12 April 1955. The Salk vaccine, or inactivated <b>poliovirus</b> vaccine, is based on <b>poliovirus</b> grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (vero cell line), which is chemically inactivated with formalin. After two doses of inactivated <b>poliovirus</b> vaccine (given by injection), 90 {{percent or more of}} individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of <b>poliovirus,</b> and at least 99 percent are immune to <b>poliovirus</b> following three doses.|$|E
5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} <b>poliovirus</b> receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to <b>poliovirus</b> injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain.

5|$|Although <b>poliovirus</b> {{transmission}} {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild <b>poliovirus</b> does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild <b>poliovirus</b> into previously polio-free regions. If importations of <b>poliovirus</b> occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePoliomyelitis {{outbreaks}} {{caused by}} pathogenic vaccine-derived <b>polioviruses</b> (VDPVs) are primarily {{a result of}} low polio vaccine coverage. Low coverage enables interhuman circulation of <b>polioviruses</b> (PVs) from the oral polio vaccine (OPV), and it enables genetic drift of the viruses and their subsequent reversion to neurovirulent phenotypes. Polio outbreaks associated with type 2 or 3 VDPVs (VDPV 2 s or VDPV 3 s) were reported in 2001 - 2002 and 2005 in Toliara Province in southern Madagascar. These VDPVs were found in patients with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and in healthy children who were contacts of the patients with AFP. The genomes of these VDPVs belong to several independent, complex mosaic recombinant lineages composed of sequences derived from vaccine <b>polioviruses</b> and other co-circulating species C human enteroviruses (human EV-C). The 2001 - 2002 and 2005 outbreaks in Toliara Province were stopped after rapid and efficient OPV vaccination campaigns...|$|R

5|$|<b>Poliovirus</b> infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like {{receptor}}, CD155, (also {{known as the}} <b>poliovirus</b> receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of <b>poliovirus</b> and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that <b>poliovirus</b> binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poliovirus</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1909 by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper. In 1981, the <b>poliovirus</b> genome {{was published by}} two different teams of researchers: by Vincent Racaniello and David Baltimore at MIT and by Naomi Kitamura and Eckard Wimmer at Stony Brook University. <b>Poliovirus</b> {{is one of the}} most well-characterized viruses, and has become a useful model system for understanding the biology of RNA viruses.|$|E
40|$|Hybridization of {{single-stranded}} RNA from virions {{of human}} enteroviruses with denatured double-stranded RNA from infected cells {{indicates that a}} minimum of about 5 % of the genome is shared by these viruses.

In general, about 30 to 50 % of the nucleotide sequences are shared by different serotypes of virus within each of these major groups, whereas among different groups less than 20 % homology is observed.

The procedures by which oral polio vaccine (OPV) rapidly eliminated all or almost all paralytic disease caused by <b>polioviruses</b> from the economically developed temperate climate countries have been inadequate in tropical and subtropical countries, except in some small countries with good health services, largely because there is much more year-round circulation of "wild" <b>polioviruses</b> which continue to produce the disease in the unvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated children. Not even a cheap, hypothetically 100 percent effective, one-dose vaccine could eliminate poliomyelitis in the tropics if, for a variety of reasons, it would reach only a portion of the infant population. Paralytic disease caused by <b>polioviruses</b> has been quickly eliminated from both small and large tropical countries by OPV in well-organized programs of annual mass vaccinations of almost all children under a certain age...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} {{has been used}} {{successfully}} as a powerful tool to control the spread of wild <b>polioviruses</b> throughout the world; however, during replication in under immunized children, some vaccine viruses revert and acquire the neurovirulent phenotypic properties. In this study, we describe the evolution and circulation of Vaccine-Derived <b>Polioviruses</b> (VDPVs) in Helmand province of Afghanistan. We investigated 2646 AFP cases of Afghan children from June 2009 -February 2011 and isolated 103 (04 %) vaccine viruses, 45 (1. 7 %) wild type <b>polioviruses</b> and six (0. 22 %) type 2 circulating vaccine-derived <b>polioviruses</b> (cVDPVs). These cVDPVs showed 97. 7 %- 98. 2 % nucleotide and 98 %- 98. 7 % amino acid homology in VP 1 region on comparison with Sabin type 2 reference strain. All these cVDPVs had two signature mutations of neurovirulent phenotypes and 12 additional mutations in P 1 capsid region that might also have contributed to increase neurovirulence and replication. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all these viruses were closely related and originated from previously reported Sabin like 2 virus from Pakistan which did not conform to the standard definition of VDPVs at that time. It was also observed that initial OPV dose was administered approximately 9 {{months prior to the}} collection of first stool specimen of index case. Our findings support that suboptimal surveillance and low routine immunization coverage have contributed to the emergence and spread of these viruses in Afghanistan. We therefore recommend high quality immunization campaigns not only in affected district Nad Ali but also in the bordering areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan {{to prevent the spread of}} cVDPVs...|$|R
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated <b>poliovirus</b> in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild <b>poliovirus</b> infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three <b>poliovirus</b> serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three <b>poliovirus</b> types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13.

Since Coxsackie viruses belong to the same family as <b>polioviruses</b> they are similar in their biological and physical properties. Coxsackie viruses can cause serious diseases both in newborns and in adults, and the infections are usually determined by the isolation of the agent through the inoculation of suckling mice, by sign of the disease appearing in the newborn mice, and in the histological sections. The study of Coxsackie viruses, in vitro, has not received enough attention and therefore very little information is available. This study was designed to isolate the plaque variants of Coxsackie group B viruses, especially type B- 3, by means of selection under different environments and sources; to study (or characterize) their biological properties both in vivo and in vitro; also to investigate their correlations by applying similar techniques which have been used to study the <b>polioviruses.</b> Excerpt from pages 15 - 16...|$|R

5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells.

Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support <b>poliovirus</b> replication.
