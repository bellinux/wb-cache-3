5|$|Figard {{spent the}} summer of 1995 working {{at a hotel in}} Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the {{opportunity}} to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to <b>pick</b> <b>her</b> up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes lorry. Bouvier had reservations about the driver, but let her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.|$|E

25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not. Women will look for this by observing if the man comes to the door to <b>pick</b> <b>her</b> up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man is feeling the same thing.|$|E
25|$|Female {{choice is}} the final step in the males attempt to reproduce; if the female does not find the male’s traits desirable, {{reproduction}} will not be successful. As it is in most species, body size is an important and most common desired trait amongst females. Body size is indicative of fitness and/or genetic quality; {{and because it is}} easily observable, it can be an indicator for how a female will <b>pick</b> <b>her</b> mate. A larger body size positively correlates to higher paternity; thus larger males are more successful in siring more offspring than smaller males. Male salamanders also prefer larger females because they produce more ova than smaller females.|$|E

25|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Jean is being helped by the nurse Marjorie on trying to recall her name. Marjorie starts {{speaking}} name after name and would not stop even though Jean asked her to. Jean became confused and not realizing what she was doing, lost control of her telekinetic powers. This caught Emma Frost's attention when it registered on Cerebro and went to <b>pick</b> <b>her</b> up with Cyclops. Meanwhile, Jean is being chased by the MRD in the hospital and, once cornered, ratted out by Marjorie, she unintentionally manifested her enormously powerful Phoenix abilities {{in the heat of}} her fear and hopelessness, which caused an intense psionic wave that affected almost the entire city. Archangel, under Mr. Sinister's command, went to capture Jean but Cyclops and Emma intervened. They soon discovered that the reason why Jean was not in mental contact with Scott was because she had no memory of Scott. Archangel pursued them as they tried to get Jean home, Cyclops desperately fought him, but in the end both he and Jean were captured so that Sinister could take samples of their DNA for his experiments. The X-Men came to rescue them and fought the Marauders, but just as Archangel is about to kill Cyclops, Jean manifests her immensely powerful Phoenix Force abilities and defeats him. Scott was able to calm her down and take her to the Institute for rest and promised her that she would regain her memories in conjunction with Emma's help. Everyone at the institute then became unconscious, except Emma, an undercover agent of the Hellfire Club who now had Jean, and therefore the Phoenix Force itself, in their hands.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, {{producers}} {{decided to}} have Shortland Street undergo a cot death storyline and {{the decision was made}} for the character of Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm) to undergo it. Needing a suitable father character, writers paired Ellen with the relatively new character of David. Ellen and David had been dating for several months but the arrival of his ex-wife Isobel Kearney (Jennifer Ward-Lealand) lead to Ellen thinking the two had reconciled, causing her to flee to Fiji. In a specially shot episode in the country, David tracked her down and the two reconciled, only for Ellen to announce she was pregnant. The couple decided to get married to support the child and lured their friends to the ceremony under the pretense that it was Grace Kwan's (Lyentte Forday) birthday. Producers encountered a problem when developing the storyline, when they realized they had accidentally over run Ellen's pregnancy. A quick fill in story was devised where Ellen was nervous that the baby was so late. In the casting of Ellen and David's child, the daughter of the show's medical adviser was chosen. Having set the storyline up to unfold in 1998, crew members began to get cold feet due to the uneasiness of shooting the scene using one of their co workers own children and the fact that two of the storyliners had fallen pregnant. On screen, Ellen had an unscheduled birth, giving birth to Rose Crozier-Kearney (Georgia Bishop) in her bathroom, but help arrived in the form of Caroline Buxton (Tandi Wright) just in time. Due to the tenderness of the storyline, it was continuously pushed back until the stage where it was nearing the point of improbability. The plot was ultimately scheduled to air in the last possible week with the potential of cot death to occur. In February 1998, Ellen and David were shocked to discover her baby daughter Rose, had died in her sleep. The scene was shot with the baby's actress but Malcolm was directed to quickly <b>pick</b> <b>her</b> up and then the shot was changed to a close up, to avoid any movements from the child. The couple's devastation at Rose's death saw them break up and date other characters. However, over a year later they finally put Rose to rest and reconciled. The storyline landed Malcolm with her first ever television acting nomination. The subject of a child's death was dealt with once more in the soap, 5 years later in the death of Te Ngakau Hudson.|$|E
