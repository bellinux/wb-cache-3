5|$|By the 1960s, {{only the}} Saint Thomas Creek, the City Mills River and the Channelsea River {{were still being}} used for {{commercial}} traffic. A section of the Channelsea River between Stratford High Street and Lett Road was culverted between 1957 and 1958. As traffic ceased, the lock structures deteriorated, and by 2006, City Mills Lock and Carpenters Road Lock were officially disused. The 1968 British Waterways Act had classified most waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those for which {{the government of the}} time could see no economic future, and which would only therefore be subject to maintenance to prevent them becoming unsafe. The Bow Back Rivers fell into this category, and remained neglected until their full restoration was enshrined in a British Waterways <b>policy</b> <b>document</b> in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), a <b>policy</b> <b>document</b> {{that had}} been agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an {{addition}} to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E

40|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>documents</b> in {{the public}} library field, such as the library legislation, local {{political}} goals and intra-library plan documents, often include ambitious but ambiguous formulations. This two years master’s thesis examines the relationship between four <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> and library practice in a local context. The theoretical framework is inspired by a sociocultural theory developed by the Swedish professor of pedagogical psychology Roger Säljö. The theory {{emphasizes the importance of}} context to learning and development. The thesis’ method is a case study. The study compares how § 8 of the Swedish library legislation is interpreted in three local <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> and how the clause is implemented in local library practice. The local library practice studied is the work of one working group which has the special assignment to implement the statutory commission for public libraries to provide special attention to immigrants and other minorities. The main empirical material is hence derived from analysis of four <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> and from qualitative interviews with the five members of the working group. The method of analysis can be described as a questioning in three stages. What is stated by the documents and the informants? What do the statements mean in relation to other statements? And finally: how can the statements be understood in relation to the theoretical framework and to results from previous research? The main result of the analysis is that the <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> do not function as a determinant context of library practice. Instead the <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> play roles as tools used by the library staff to fulfill situational needs in the local library practice. In the conclusion I argue for further research on the content of <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> and the function of <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> in library practice. One possible aim of such research could be to enhance librarians’ abilities to use <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> to serve their professional purposes...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} municipal {{utilization of}} <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> in child health-promoting activities {{with reference to}} document types, substance in the documents and timing in the policy process. Methods: Fifty semi-structured interviews were performed using the snowball method, and content analyses of written documentation were made. Data were categorized {{by means of a}} policy process matrix, and nine case studies were written. Triangulation was used as a validating method, and the coding reliability was assessed. Statements related to various <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> were categorized according to document types, substance in the documents, and timing in the policy process. Results: Various <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> were spontaneously mentioned by 33 of 50 interviewees, in eight of nine case studies, and in all stages of the policy process. Well-defined statements concerning which content in the <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> that actually impacted on the policy process development were uncommon. Conclusions: This study shows that <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> are present in policy processes related to child health-promoting activities in Swedish municipalities. As Swedish municipalities are autonomous and not forced to pursue governmental recommendations, this probably demonstrates that <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> are significant in the development of such processes.

25|$|With the {{nationalisation}} of {{the railways}} in 1948, {{responsibility for the}} canal passed to the British Transport Commission. In 1955, a Board of Survey carried out {{an assessment of the}} canals, and many in the fledgling waterways movement, including the Inland Waterways Association, expected that the British Transport Commission annual bill for that year would include powers to close many of the canals rated as Class 3 by the Board of Survey. However, with growing public unease at the perceived fate of the canals, no such powers were included in the bill. The canal was visited by Sir Reginald Kerr, the head of British Transport Waterways, and other dignitaries on 27 February 1958, and again by boat on 21 May 1958, when he expressed his intent to ensure that the canals were used by private boaters. There was a risk that the northern end of the canal would be cut off by the closure of the Lower Peak Forest and the Ashton Canal, but vigorous campaigning and a growing restoration movement resulted in the passing of the Transport Act 1968, which effectively assured their future. As part of the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council's Recreational Framework for Britain's Canals initiative, published as a <b>policy</b> <b>document</b> in 1975, Macclesfield Borough Council designated the whole canal as a Conservation Area in June of that year.|$|E

Secondly, the document states that collective defence remains the core purpose of NATO, but at the same time emphasizes potential NATO contributions to conflict prevention and crisis management, and the potential planning and management of missions like that in Afghanistan.

500|$|The party {{intended}} {{to participate in}} the 2006 federal election. They prepared a pamphlet and sent it to Canada Post to deliver via their Unaddressed Admail Program. The Canada Post employees rejected the pamphlet because their <b>policy</b> <b>document,</b> the Unaddressed Admail Customer Guide, allowed them to refuse to deliver sexually explicit material. The four-page pamphlet had several images depicting people in the nude and objects shaped like human body parts, and because the pamphlet also contained the party's election platform, they complained that Canada Post was violating its directive to be politically impartial. The Sex Party objected to the refusal by filing a lawsuit against Canada Post saying the organization violated their right to freedom of expression. The Federal Court of Canada ruled that the [...] "sexually explicit material" [...] phrase used in the Canada Post <b>policy</b> <b>document</b> was undefined and too vague to be arbitrarily applied to any particular pamphlet. The Court found that their freedom of expression was reasonably restricted, and not prohibited, as Canada Post did offer alternative means of distribution.
