40|$|Recent {{works in}} the econometric {{literature}} consider the problem of efficiently summarising a large set of variables and using this summary {{for a variety of}} purposes, including forecasts (Stock and Watson, 2002; Forni et al., 2005; Giannone et al., 2008; for a wide review, see Eklund and Kapetanios, 2008). Factor analysis combined with linear modelling has usually been the main tool used for this task.

40|$|Abstract: There {{are some}} {{fundamental}} economic uncertainties. We cannot forecast economic events {{with a very}} high scientific precision. It is very clear that there does not exist a unique "general " model, which can yield all answers {{to a wide range}} of macroeconomic issues. Therefore, we use several different kinds of models on segments of the macroeconomic problem. Different models can distinguish/solve economy desegregation, time series analysis and other subfactors involved in macroeconomic problem solving. A major issue becomes finding a meaningful method to link these econometric models. Macroeconomic models were linked through development of an Expert System for National Economy Model Simulations (ESNEMS).

40|$|What are the stylized {{facts that}} {{characterize}} the dynamics of credit booms and the associated fluctuations in <b>macro-economic</b> <b>aggregates?</b> This paper answers this question by applying a method proposed in our earlier work for measuring and identifying credit booms to data for 61 emerging and industrial countries over the 1960 - 2010 period. We identify 70 credit boom events, half of them in each group of countries. Event analysis shows a systematic relationship between credit booms and a boom-bust cycle in production and absorption, asset prices, real exchange rates, capital inflows, and external deficits. Credit booms are synchronized internationally and show three striking similarities in industrial and emerging economies: (1) credit booms normalized by the cyclical variability of credit are similar in magnitude; (2) banking crises, currency crises or Sudden Stops often follow credit booms, and the frequencies with which they do are similar across industrial and emerging economies; and (3) credit booms often follow surges in capital inflows, TFP gains, and financial reforms, and are far more common with managed than flexible exchange rates...|$|R

40|$|In 2005, Germany’s {{system of}} {{national}} accounts was altered from so called fixed prices (prices of a fixed year, {{in the end}} 1995) to prices of the preceding year as basis for calculating macroeconomic time series in real terms. Compared to the previous SNA, the new system offers {{a wider range of}} possibilities to interpret theoretically relevant variables empirically. There are, for instance, at least three possibilities to express the main aggregates of an economy in real terms. At least two of them are no longer additive in respect to the sub-aggregates they comprise. But this is not the only problem: Quarterly data of macro-economic variables are calculated by using the annual overlap method which cannot always easily handled by such a standard program for time-series analysis like E-Views. Both problems raised serious concerns about the applicability of econometric models to the new data basis. The focus of the paper is laid on the basic features of the new possibilities to express <b>macro-economic</b> <b>aggregates</b> in real terms.

40|$|Brunei is one {{of those}} tiny economies of Southeast Asia with {{abundant}} reserves of oil. It is this oil and natural gas that have contributed to the wealth of this Islamic kingdom. However, with the reserves of oil and natural gas projected to run out in two or three decades, there have been efforts to diversify and develop the economy of Brunei. It is in this backdrop that we try to analyse the prospect of economic transition of this tiny economy. While there are many ways of bringing transition, we must note that Bruneian economy has a lacuna, namely, inadequate skilled labour force of its own. In addition, there are serious political and economic issues, such as the suppression of democratic rights of people, decline in the growth rates of Gross National Product (GNP) per capita as well as population, huge military spending, and decline in the share of agriculture and manufacturing in GDP.

We find that second round effects from a reduction in financial inflows such as remittances, foreign direct investments and overseas development assistance, as well as reduction in international demand from cash crops such as cotton, tea and coffee, could lead to a reduction in economic growth by 0. 6 percentage points on average annually over the period 2008 - 2010 compared to a baseline reflecting pre-crisis conditions. A surge in regional exports and early counter-cyclical policies in particular are found to dampen the most adverse impacts of the crisis. The paper also shows that {{the impact of}} the government’s expansionary 2009 / 2010 budget could return growth to pre-crisis levels and illustrates how a re-prioritization of government expenditure away from expenditure on administration to more productive sectors of the economy, combined with reforms to improve the efficiency of public spending, could lift long-term growth and reduce poverty, especially in rural areas, even more.

40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the GREENSTAMP Project (GREEned National STAtistical and Modelling Procedures) which, during 1994 – 1996, developed results and recommendations concerning empirically and theoretically robust methods for greening national accounts. The recommended approach centres on methods for quantifying economic opportunity costs associated with meeting specified environmental performance standards. In this perspective, a "greened GDP" is a hypothetical measure of a performance potential, viz., an estimate of the level of output (or of consumption, or of national income, etc.) that a national economy would be able to achieve while simultaneously respecting specified environmental quality and resource husbandry requirements. The GREENSTAMP approach is modular, establishing linkages with different categories of data and analyses. First, information is organised in so-called satellite environmental accounts, which describe the state of the environment according to chosen categories and measures (largely non-monetary), and which establish links between economic activity sectors and environmental change in terms of the pressures acting on each environmental category. Second, cost information is obtained through various levels of analysis (firms and households, sectors and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>aggregates)</b> about the economic resource requirements – such as investments needed or consumption foregone – that would be necessary in order to reduce a specified environmental pressure. Environmental defensive expenditures, pollution avoidance cost curves, and macroeconomic comparative static and dynamic scenario modelling are among the applicable cost concepts and tools. In this cost-effectiveness perspective, the value of environmental assets and services is not estimated in monetary terms directly. Rather, estimates of the costs – at various scales of analysis and timeframes – of specified improvements in environmental performance are considered in relation to scientific, political and economic judgements {{about the importance of the}} environmental functions, services and assets in question. avoidance cost curves; cost-effectiveness; dynamic models; environmental standards; GREENSTAMP; national accounts; statistical methods; sustainable national income; green accounting. ...|$|R

ESNEMS was developed to model the optimum macro-economic policy of a developing country (SFRY-formerly Yugoslavia). Most econometric models are very complex. Optimizing of the economic policy is typically defined as a nonlinear goal programming problem. To solve/optimize these models, a new methodology, MINGP, was developed as a part of ESNEMS. MINGP is methodologically based on linear goal programming and feasible directions method. Using Euler's Homogeneous Function Theorem, MINGP linearizes nonlinear homogeneous functions. The highest priorities in minimizing the objective function are the growth of gross domestic product and the decrease of inflation. In the core of the optimization model, MINGP, there is a small-scale econometric model. This model was designed through analysis of the causal relations in the SFRY's social reproduction process of the past 20 years. The objective of the econometric model is to simulate potential short term (one-year) national economic policies. Ex-ante simulation and optimization of economic policy for 1986 showed that, in SFRY, non-consistent macro-economic policy was resolute and led to both slower economic development and more rapid growth of inflation...|$|R

This paper uses quarterly data (1961. 1 - 1998. 2) on failure rates and potential macroeconomic determinants to build a time-series econometric model which explicitly tests for the impact of changes to the insolvency legislation as encompassed in the Insolvency Act 1986. The enactment of the 1986 Insolvency Act is incorporated into the time-series model determining failure rates along side macroeconomic variables such as the clearing bank base rate, lending to corporate sector, gross corporate profits, the retail price index, and the company birth rate. The econometric results show that the key relationships between failure rates and other potential determinants were changed by the Insolvency Act after 1986. 4. The results indicate that there is a structural break over the sample period under examination and provides evidence of a negative association between failure rates and the Insolvency Act of 1986 even after adjusting for other effects. Thus, the preventive effect of the Insolvency Act on business failures shows a short-term impact and longer-term effects in a seemingly well-specified model. The independent effects of other macroeconomic variables were found to be as predicted by theory. JEL Classification: C 22, C 51, G 33...|$|R

It is hoped that this study, and others being conducted in other countries, will put the nations' negotiators in a strong and informed position in the current round GATT negotiations. In this regard, the study assesses the contribution of services to the national economy directly through income and employment generation and indirectly through linkages with other sectors of the economy. The study reviews the regulatory environment within which the sector operates and examines how liberalisation can affect the sector's role in facilitating competitive development of the productive sectors. The study also addresses issues of regional co-operation within the various service sub-sectors. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase entailed examining the national economic environment and identifying the contribution of services to various <b>aggregate</b> <b>macro-economic</b> variables. It then went on to examine the legal/regulatory framework and regional cooperation agreements and arrangements. To achieve the above, the study team examined secondary data published by the Central Statistical Office, policy documents and legal instruments governing the operations of various service sub-sectors. In addition interviews were conducted with government officials and officials from the various service sub-sectors. Phase 2 entailed detailed studies on selected sub-sectors. These are financial services, transportation and telecommunications. For these detailed studies, structured questionnaire interviews were conducted to get further information on how the sub-sectors operate and interact with other sectors, the constraints faced and competition within the sub-sectors and competitiveness of the sub-sectors.

40|$|Since the mid- 1970 s Pakistan has {{witnessed}} very high magnitudes of labour out-and in-migration. Most {{of the earlier}} studies on the subject either concentrated on the <b>aggregate</b> <b>macro-economic</b> impact of this migration on the national economy or {{have been in the}} nature of case studies of specific'groups of migrants*. In these studies, the analysis of geographical distribution of the labour force has been missing. Given the fact that both out- and return-migrants may have location-specific effects which might lead to uneven economic and social development in the country and as such policies would have to respond in concrete locational terms, such an omission is critical. This paper attempts to identify the international labour flows of Pakistanis focussing on their geographical distribution. Based on a survey conducted by the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation and the Population Census of 1981 the study suggests that less developed districts are characterised by low out-migration and high return-migration. In addition, structural characteristics (e. g., land tenure) may be important in explaining low mobility from some underdeveloped districts, e. g., those of Sindh and lower Punjab. On the basis of the information presented, the paper suggests a number of avenues for future research: (i) to relate the indices of out- and return-migration to disaggregated characteristics of the regional socio-economic structure; (ii) to compare the pattern of international out-migration with the pattern of internal out-migrant; (iii) to verify whether the process of internal relocation is of significant magnitude a trace analysis of return migrants to the less developed districts could be attempted; and (iv) to determine the socio-economic and political implications of the patterns of out- and return-migration, as the differential patterns are likely to have significant implications for future development. ...|$|R
40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Department of Industrial Economics, Rand Afrikaans University, 12 August 1982 Security {{analysis}} and portfolio management have changed significantly in recent years. Investment management {{has become more}} complicated and sophisticated, both from an academic and practical point of view. It has developed into a separate discipline over a relatively short period. The factors which contributed to the change and development were: (1) {{the development of the}} modern portfolio theory (particularly since the contribution made by Tobin, the full covariance model of Markowitz, and the capital-asset pricing model of Sharpe), (2) the development of capital market theory and the efficient market hypothesis, (3) the developments in the field of financial management and policy in general, and (4) the developments in stock market theory and practice. From a practical point of view, the capital markets developed into highly sophisticated markets, mainly {{as a result of the}} continuous growth of the institutional investors. It is the investor's objective to maximize the expected rate of return on a given investment, given the expected risk, or to minimize the expected risk, given the expected rate of return, for any given holding-period. This also applies to a diversified portfolio of investments. The expected rate of return refers to the real internal rate of return, after tax, as determined by the discounting of expected future cash flows, after adjusting the latter for inflation and taxation. The expected risk is defined as the dispersion in a subjective probability distribution, or more specifically, the variance and the standard deviation of that distribution, for example, the standard deviation of the expected return, where the latter is a random variable. The standard deviation is an absolute measure of risk. For it to be meaningful one should consider relative risk measures, for example, the coefficient of variation and the beta-coefficient. The value of beta measures the sensitivity of the security's excess return to that of the market portfolio. The expected total risk can be divided into systematic and unsystematic risk. The systematic risk is the market component of the total risk, and the unsystematic risk the non-market component of the total risk. The systematic risk depends on factors which affect all securities, eg changes in macro-economic variables, such as changes in the growth rate, changes in interest rates, the purchasing power risk, political events, etc. The unsystematic risk reflects factors which are unique to individual firms. The unsystematic risk can be reduced by the efficient diversification of investments. The objective of the investor, as stated, implies a continuous trade-off between risk and return. In this respect modern portfolio theories are mostly quantitative. Furthermore, modern theories treat different aspects of portfolio construction, diversification, upgrading, the influence of the market, interrelationships of securities, the risk-return trade-off etc. Lastly, modern portfolio theories include all facets pertaining to the efficient market hypothesis. In the valuation of ordinary shares, three different approaches can be indentified. They are: (1) the fundamental analysis, (2) technical analysis, and (3) the random walk hypothesis. The fundamental analysis is a three step process, beginning with a <b>macro-economic</b> and <b>aggregate</b> market analysis, followed by an industry analysis, and lastly, an analysis of the individual firm. The factors and events influencing the aggregate economy have an important effect on the future performance of industries, with the result that the economic factors must be considered before the different industries can be analysed. The underlying variables which determine intrinsic or investment value must be analysed and projected into the future. An investment based on historical data is not consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. In an efficient market a security's price will be a good estimate of its investment value. An investment based on future estimates of the relevant variables is consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. In this sense the fundamental approach is justifiable and acceptable. Even in a perfectly efficient market there is still work to be done. Fundamental analysis is essential if capital markets are to be efficient. The basic philosophy of the technicians is that it is not necessary to study the fundamentals in order to know where the price of a given security is going, because knowledge of past price movements will be indicative of future price movements. Thus the methodology of technical analysis rests upon the assumption that history tends to repeat itself. Furthermore, the technicians assume that share prices tend to move in trends which persist for long periods, and that prices adjust only partially and slowly to a new equilibrium level. To be able to derive above average results the technician must have a system to detect the beginning of price movements from one equilibrium value to the next. There are numerous technical rules, eg contrary opinion rules, the confidence index, the breadth of the market, and charting. There is little evidence showing the efficacy of technical methods. Technical analysis is inconsistent with the efficient market hypothesis and therefore unacceptable. According to the random walk hypothesis, share price changes over time are serially independent. In an efficient market price changes would adjust very rapidly to the infusion of any new information, which comes to the market in a random, independent fashion. The independence assumption gives a good description of reality. There is consistent empirical evidence of the random walk hypothesis. The random walk theory is consistent with the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, and is therefore acceptable. The technical {{analysis and}} random walk hypothesis are irreconcilable. In the teaching of and research on investment management, the various approaches will be dealt with. More emphasis will, however, be placed on the fundamental approach and the modern portfolio theories. Furthermore, the basic training in investment management must be of an interdisciplinary nature...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{volume of}} solid waste (SW), not only arising from household (Municipal SW, MSW) but also from industrial process (Industrial SW, ISW), has become a serious issue in Chinese metropolises with the economic growth, urbanization, industrialization, and increasing affluence. Growth of industry leads {{to the expansion of}} population, while the augment of demand by increasing population stimulates the industrial growth in turn, thereby increasing not only ISW generation, but also MSW generation. Therefore, in order to solve the waste problem for the construction of sustainable waste management system in a city, it is necessary to consider these two types of waste together, in which, the emphasis should be focused on waste reduction from the source. The starting point in adopting this should be a good understanding of the upstream flow of waste and accurate knowledge of the volume and composition of waste that will be generated in the future. However, due to deficient historical records and complex production process, the effective attempts at forecasting SW generation are far from enough, especially for ISW by waste category. A common approach which is based on the limited waste statistics and can be easily popularized into Chinese countries is thus urgent. This paper, therefore, attempts the construction of a systematic approach to make projections of SW generation by waste category from the following issues: (1) to develop household consumer behaviour model taking into account lifestyle of residents and project the demand of private consumption in the future; (2) to quantitatively investigate and project MSW generation fully considering the change in consumer behaviour and waste management policies; (3) to effectively evaluate the present and future industrial structure and their contributions to ISW generation among industries; (4) to carry out a scenario analysis of calculating CO 2 emissions in different waste treatment options based on the projected waste quantity and composition in 2015. The approach is applied on a city level as the basic administrative unit of SW management in China. The entire framework comprises four modules-regional macro-economic module, MSW generation module, ISW generation module, and waste treatment module. Further, the study of consumption pattern conducted from the consumer behaviour model in MSW module is a prerequisite for industrial restructuring caused by change in consumption demand in ISW module. Moreover, the regional macro-economic module is to provide a means for economic structural analysis and economic forecasting, considering the influence of national GDP and socioeconomic indicators including world trade. It is found out that the regional model fits the historical records reasonably well and provides an acceptable reproduction. In the MSW generation module for estimating and projecting MSW generation, firstly the per capita total household consumption expenditure is estimated by using total consumption expenditure model; then, household consumption pattern is estimated using an extension of the linear expenditure system (LES); thereafter, MSW generation by composition is quantitatively expressed in terms of the expenditure for consumption category and waste management policies by using ordinary least squares (OLS). Then, five Chinese cities with distinct economic levels are presented by applying the module to determine the waste generation features in different regions. The research findings clearly indicate that 1) the number of variables affecting consumer behaviour in Chinese cities is not one but the integrations of a series of indicators. Aside from Shanghai, saving rate towards consumption (SAV) and natural growth rate (NAGR) are currently the two common factors. However, in Shanghai, consumer behaviour is strongly influenced by SAV and the average number of persons per household (ANPH). 2) The MSW generation model quantitatively demonstrates the linear conversion process from consumption to corresponding waste generation in all cities. For example, education and consumption of food-as the form of consumption expenditure in this research-is the source of generation of food, plastic and paper waste. Further, glass and metal waste is estimated by food expenditure in all cities. 3) Total MSW generation per unit consumption is 0. 198 ~ 0. 225 kg/RMB with an average value of 0. 213 kg/RMB. 4) All the waste management policies analyzed in the research will provide feasible experiences or valuable lessons to other Chinese cities. 5) Volume of per capita MSW generated in 2020 will be 1. 24 - 2. 18 folds compared to that in 2008 in each city if there were no effective policies implemented advancing to diminishing waste generation. Then, for the forecasting of ISW generation of each waste category by industry, the ISW module is developed, linking three <b>principal</b> models-regional <b>macro-economic</b> model, regional input-output (IO) analysis, and ISW generation model. The approach investigates the influence of industrial restructuring on ISW generation, based on the study of consumption patterns, export composition figures and change in ISW generation coefficient. The principal priorities in the case study on Shanghai are as follows: 1) the approach provides an idea for a way to quantitatively analyze industrial restructuring by adjusting the converter that, in turn, helps assess the impact of these changes on sectoral output. 2) A sensitivity analysis describes that per yuan of increase in consumption on FOOD, CLSH, FUNI, EDUC, TRAN, HLTH and RESI induces to an average increase of 76. 41, 76. 16, 82. 28, 106. 54, 93. 89, 148. 30 and 292. 58 g total ISW, respectively. 3) It is verified that ISW generation not only arises from economic growth but also from the onset of industrial restructuring. The unit ISW generation per gross output reduces from 0. 16 to 0. 14 tons/ 10 000 RMB as we move from 2002 to 2020. 4) It is investigated that the total volume of ISW generated in 2010, 2015 and 2020 will be 2. 07, 2. 83 and 4. 12 times that of the 2002 levels. The total SW generation of Shanghai in 2020 will be 4. 06 times of that in 2002. 5) However, if considering scenario analysis of adjusting ISW generation coefficient, the total SW generation is 1. 93 times compared to 2002 and ISW is 2. 18 times of MSW generation. 6) Based on our results, the industrial sectors making the biggest contribution to the production of each type of ISW can each be separately identified. Therefore, constraining specific industries or penetrating them with selective technological changes will be useful attempts on the way to meeting the objectives of overall waste reduction. Finally, in the waste treatment module, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions emitting from the treatment and disposal of waste, including landfill site, waste-to-energy incineration and composting are calculated, respectively. Further, based on the projection of waste quantity and composition of Shanghai in 2015, a scenario analysis is carried out as well concerning the GHG emissions from alternative treatment options. The results confirm that composting and recycling of waste before the treatment are effective attempts at reducing GHG emissions in Shanghai. Further, scenario designed as the integrated waste treatment system makes the biggest reduction of GHG emissions, as 34 % as compared to current treatment options with energy recovery. In a word, this research develops the entire systematic approach investigating the upstream flow of waste generation from the viewpoint of economic growth, change in socioeconomic indicators and constitution of waste management policies, and makes a reasonable attempt at projecting SW generation of each type of waste category. Based on the results, it is suggested that for the waste reduction to promote sustainable society, government interventions including promoting green consumption, reducing extra consumption, et al. and waste policies such as increasing recycling and penetrating technological innovation in specific industries will be effective. Further, based on the forecasts of SW generation, the recycling and appropriate treatment of waste generating from municipal and industrial process can be examined from the long view. From the relationship between ISW and MSW generation, the development of industry will promote the growth of service industry and induce greater generation of recyclable items. While the recycling of these items before the waste treatment is essential for effectively reducing GHG emissions which contribute to global warming. In addition, the systematic model can be easily popularized into other Chinese cities even other Asian developing cities, thereby possibly promoting the sustainable waste management of China and Asian countries.
