40|$|Thickness {{shear mode}} (TSM) sensors, {{also known as}} quartz crystal micro-balances (QCM) are a class of {{acoustic}} wave sensors {{that have been used}} for gas phase sensing. In this thesis this device is used to measure vapor-liquid equilibrium data for copolymers of <b>poly(styrene-butadiene)</b> at 294 K. Copolymers of <b>poly(styrene-butadiene)</b> with varying percentages of styrene (85 %, 45 % and 21 %) were studied with benzene, n-hexane, dichloroethane and chloroform as solvents. Literature data for pure polystyrene/benzene and polystyrene/chloroform and polybutadiene/benzene were obtained to complement the measured data. Obtained experimental data were fit with a modified Flory-Huggins model and compared with the predictions of three models (UNIFAC-FV, Entropic-FV, and GK-FV). Flory-Huggins model gave a good quantitative fit for the solvent activities in the copolymer solutions...|$|E
40|$|A {{system was}} refined for the {{determination}} of the bulk ultrasonic wave propagation velocity in small cortical bone specimens. Longitudinal and shear wave propagations were measured using ceramic, piezoelectric 20 and 5 MHz transducers, respectively. Results of the pulse transmission technique were refined via the measurement of the system delay time. The precision and accuracy of the system were quantified using small specimens of polyoxymethylene, <b>polystyrene-butadiene,</b> and high-density polyethylene. These polymeric materials had known acoustic properties, similarity of propagation velocities to cortical bone, and minimal sample inhomogeneity. Dependence of longitudinal and transverse specimen dimensions upon propagation times was quantified. To confirm the consistency of longitudinal wave propagation in small cortical bone specimens (0. 997) were maintained between propagation time and distance throughout the size ranges down to less than 0. 4 mm. Results for polyoxymethylene, <b>polystyrene-butadiene,</b> and high-density polyethylene were accurate to within 5 percent of reported literature values. Measurement repeatability (precision) improved with an increase in the wave transmission distance (propagating dimension). No statistically significant effect due to the transverse dimension was detected...|$|E
40|$|Layer {{thickness}} {{measurements are}} used to investigate polymer adsorption and possible conformations of adsorbed polymer. In a first step, photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) is used to monitor the layer thickness at different ratios of polyethylene oxide (PEO) per polystyrene (PS) latex spheres. Comparison of the polymer concentration at which the equilibrium layer thickness was attained with the concentration where the adsorption isotherm reached its plateau leads to a proposed three step adsorption process. Kinetic studies of the layer thickness build-up also support this mechanism. Polymer polydispersity {{and the effect of}} anchored end groups on layer thickness are found to be in agreement with theoretical predictions. In a second step, a rheological investigation of PEO coated <b>polystyrene-butadiene</b> (PSB) latex spheres was performed. The influence of coating on the second virial coefficient was determined. Comparison of the layer thickness as measured by viscosity and PCS shows the relative importance of the latex polydispersity for the two methods...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis and {{characterisation}} of PEM using aryl backbone commercial <b>polystyrene-butadiene</b> rubber (locally sourced) {{were carried}} out by sulphonation with chlorosulphonic acid, and assessed for its potential to serve as possible PEMFC application. The effect of weight of the <b>polystyrene-butadiene</b> rubber (PSBR), sulphonation time, stirring speed, concentration of sulphonation agent and sulphonation temperature {{on the degree of}} sulphonation (DS), ion exchange capacity (IEC) and viscosity of the resulting sulphonated material were investigated. Synthesized membranes were thus characterized by Fourier Transform Infra-red (FT-IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 HNMR) to confirm sulphonation. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimentry (DSC) were used to verify the thermal stability of the membrane, while impedance spectroscopy was used to measure the proton conductivity of the membrane. The results obtained revealed that the weight of the rubber, sulphonation time, stirring speed, concentration of sulphonating agent and the sulphonation temperature affect the DS, IEC, viscosity, thermal stability and proton conductivity of the membrane, such that, sulphonation time of 24 hrs and acid concentration of 1. 6 M/ml gave the best DS, with IEC ranging from 0. 23 to 2. 36 mmol/g. Conductivities were in the range of 10 - 3 – 10 - 2 S/cm. However, over 2 folds increase in ion exchange capacity and degree of sulphonation was achieved on the effect of temperature. The sulphonation kinetic of PSBR was studied in 0. 0016 mol L- 1 of chlorosulphonic acid where first-order kinetic model; without the effect of HCl and the effect of HCl were investigated. The reaction rate was found to obey the first-order model with the HCl produced having a desulphonation effect on the reaction. A predictive model Page iv developed is able to predict degree of sulphonation at different initial concentration of acid. The thermodynamic study showed that the reaction is non-spontaneous, and as temperature increases the reaction system experienced phase change from liquid to solid at temperature above 328 K. The DSC and TGA analysis showed that <b>polystyrene-butadiene</b> rubber is a thermo stable polymer for PEM fuel cell application with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 198 oC. Porosity of the membrane and uptake of solvent per sulphonic groups at different thickness of membrane were also calculated. The porosity of the membrane to methanol increased with a decrease in membrane thickness and increased with an increase in methanol concentration. Based on the results obtained from the porosity of the membrane to methanol and methanol up take, it can be inferred that the membrane is less permeable to methanol than water. In comparism, the porosity of the synthesised membrane to methanol was less than that of Nafion® which was in the range of 0. 40 - 0. 51. The results also showed that water uptake increases as the thickness of the membrane decreases. However, the membrane was found to exhibit a moderately water absorption and desorption capacity. But considering the effect of temperature, the membrane will require proper humidification especially if the fuel cell where the membrane will be used will be operated above room temperature. The electrochemical activity test was performed on a single fuel cell fed with H 2 /O 2 at room temperature. An open circuit voltage (OCV) of 718. 75 mV was achieved with electrode 40 wt...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} self-consistent field theory (SCFT) study of spherical micelle {{formation}} in {{a blend of}} <b>poly(styrene-butadiene)</b> diblocks and homopolystyrene. The micelle core radii, corona thicknesses and critical micelle concentrations are calculated as functions of the polymer molecular weights and {{the composition of the}} diblocks. Our results are compared with an earlier scaling theory and with X-ray scattering data. The agreement between self-consistent field theory and experiment for the micelle structure is sometimes quantitative and is generally more successful than scaling theory. For copolymers with relatively light core blocks, SCFT predictions for the critical micelle concentration improve over those of scaling theories by an order of magnitude. In the case of heavier core blocks, SCFT predicts the critical micelle concentration less well due to inaccuracies in the modelling of the bulk chemical potential. Overall, we find that SCFT gives a very good description of spherical micelle formation and hence demonstrate that a mean-field, equilibrium approach is valid for these systems.

40|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} (ZnO-NPs) {{and modified}} calcium carbonate (nano-CaCO 3) nanoparticles were successfully prepared {{and added to}} <b>polystyrene-butadiene</b> rubber copolymer (PSBR) matrix to prepare PSBR nanocomposites. The prepared nanomaterials (ZnO-NPs & nano-CaCO 3) were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Furthermore, the prepared polymer nanocomposites and oil base mud were used for drilling in {{high pressure high temperature}} (HPHT) wells. The consequence of using polymer nanocomposites based on different loading of ZnO-NPs and nano-CaCO 3 on the rheological properties of oil base mud was evaluated and enhanced the yield point at high pressure high temperature wells (HPHT). The using of the polymer with different percentage from (0. 5) in all percent the obtained results is very promising; this means that the increase of polymer is reasonable for the increase of apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity and yield point at high temperature. Correspondingly, polymer nanocomposites displayed rise of apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, and yield point, decreased in fluid loss and increased in electrical stability at high pressure high temperature wells...|$|E
40|$|Osmometry, viscometry, light {{scattering}} and Gel permeation chromatograph are normally {{used to measure}} the physical properties of polymer solutions and determine their average molecular weights. Nine monodisperse polystyrene standards with different molecular weights were used to obtain a conventional calibration curve for GPC. Another five polystyrene standards were used to obtain a universal calibration curve. By use of both calibration curves and the chromatogram of polymer sample from GPC, the number-average molecular weight, M¯n, and the weight-average molecular weight, M¯w, were consequently computed. Three polystyrene standards were characterized by osmometry, viscometry, {{light scattering}}, and GPC. Determinations of molecular weights were generally in agreement with their given molecular weight except for polystyrene of very high molecular weight. Commercial polybutadiene, polyisoprene, and two types of <b>polystyrene-butadiene</b> were also characterized by means of osmometry, viscometry, light scattering and GPC. M¯n for the synthetic rubbers as determined by osmometry was found to be in the range from 45, 000 to 100, 000. Because of some slight turbidity of polystyrene-butadiene-THF solution, the molecular weight determined by light scattering was found to be extremely high and finally deleted. From GPC analyses, it was found that synthetic rubber polymers had a relatively broad molecular weight distribution...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} self-consistent field theory (SCFT) study of spherical micelle {{formation}} in {{a blend of}} <b>poly(styrene-butadiene)</b> diblocks and homopolystyrene. The micelle core radii, corona thicknesses, and critical micelle concentrations are calculated as functions of the polymer molecular weights and {{the composition of the}} diblocks. We then make a parameter-free comparison of our results with an earlier scaling theory and X-ray scattering data. For the micelle core radii R, we find that SCFT reproduces the shape of the variation of R with different molecular parameters much more accurately compared to scaling theory, though, like scaling theory, it overestimates R by about 20 - 30 %. For the corona thickness L, the accuracy of our SCFT results is at least as good as that of scaling theory. For copolymers with lighter core blocks, SCFT predictions for the critical micelle concentration improve over those of scaling theories by an order of magnitude. In the case of heavier core blocks, however, SCFT predicts the critical micelle concentration less well due to inaccuracies in the modeling of the bulk chemical potential. Overall, we find that SCFT gives a good description of spherical micelle formation and is generally more successful than scaling theory. ? 2009 American Chemical Society. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Developed {{technologies}} in vitrification, cement, and polymeric materials manufactured using flammable organic solvents {{have been used}} to encapsulate solid wastes, including low-level radioactive materials, but are impractical for high salt-content waste streams (Maio, 1998). In this work, we investigate an emulsification process for producing an aqueous-based polymeric waste form as a preliminary step towards fabricating hybrid organic/inorganic polyceram matrices. The material developed incorporates epoxy resin and <b>polystyrene-butadiene</b> (PSB) latex to produce a waste form that is non-flammable, light weight, of relatively low cost, and that can be loaded to a relatively high weight content of waste materials. Sodium nitrate was used {{as a model for the}} salt waste. Small-scale samples were manufactured and analyzed using leach tests designed to measure the diffusion coefficient and leachability index for the fastest diffusing species in the waste form, the salt ions. The microstructure and composition of the samples were probed using SEM/EDS techniques. The results show that some portion of the salt migrates towards the exterior surfaces of the waste forms during the curing process. A portion of the salt in the interior of the sample is contained in polymer corpuscles or sacs. These sacs are embedded in a polymer matrix phase that contains fine, well-dispersed salt crystals. The diffusion behavior observed in sections of the waste forms indicates that samples prepared using this emulsion process meet or exceed the leachability criteria suggested for low level radioactivity waste forms...|$|E
40|$|Using block {{copolymers}} for large-area periodic structure fabrication is {{of great}} interest {{because of the potential}} for low fabrication costs and simplicity of the processing. The concept is that by selective inclusion of the nanoparticles into one of the blocks of a self-assembling copolymer, the nanoparticles are forced into a defined spatial arrangement determined by the phase morphology of the copolymer. Although copolymers can form well defined structures, they inherently have a 'polycrystalline' structure in the bulk, meaning that there is no long-range order of the domains. This thesis addresses both the effect of inclusion of the nanoparticles and the long range ordering of block copolymer domains. The first part of the thesis focuses on the study of the effect of nanoparticle inclusions on the phase morphology of the <b>poly(styrene-butadiene)</b> diblock and poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) triblock copolymers. For gold inclusions, it was found that even at relatively low concentrations of inclusions (less than 1 wt. /vol. %) the block copolymer phase morphology is altered from that of the native copolymer. By contrast to the block copolymer-gold system, no significant changes in bulk morphology is observed for similar fullerene concentrations. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, the evolution of the order in cylinder forming poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) triblock copolymer thin films as a function of the type of solvent vapor, exposure time to the saturated vapors and substrate surface energy is discussed. Solvent vapors of dimethoxyethane, ethyl acetate and cyclohexanone were found to be the most effective for our polymer films. Solvent vapors differing in their selectivity towards the block copolymer domains have different kinetics of ordering which is explained in terms of the difference in the interaction of the solvent between the two different copolymer blocks.

30|$|The used {{membrane}} {{materials for}} removing sulfur are mostly including hydrophobic membranes such as polyurethane, polyurea/polyurethane, polyamide, natural rubber, <b>polystyrene–butadiene</b> and polydimethylsiloxane. Hydrophilic {{properties of the}} membranes clearly increase the selectivity to the sulfur compounds which usually are more polar than hydrocarbons. The most common methods for making membranes with high selectivity and flux include cross-linking, blending, filling and copolymerization. Lin et al. studied the solubility of gasoline blending in polyethylene glycol [1]. They concluded that sulfur recovery rate by {{increasing the amount of}} cross-linking agent and the cross-linking time increases. Lin et al. used polyethylene glycol and polyurethane polymers for fluidized bed catalytic cracking unit gasoline desulfurization [2]. Wu et al. improved the stability of the interface between the active layer of polydimethylsiloxane and base layer of polyethersulfone by the aminosilane and amino propyl trimethoxysilane [3]. Their results showed that with increase of cross-linking agent penetration flux is uniformly reduced. The effect of tetraethyl ortho silicate on the increasing selectivity in the Polydimethylsiloxane membrane has been studied by Xu et al. [4]. In another study, manufacturing of polydimethylsiloxane and polyamide composite membrane in separation of heptane from thiophene was studied [5]. The transport properties of gases in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/zeolite a mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were determined based on pure gas permeation experiments in study of Rezakazemi et al. 2012. The permeation rates of C 3 H 8, CH 4, CO 2, and H 2 were evaluated through a dense homogeneous pure PDMS membrane and PDMS/ 4 A MMMs to assess the viability of these membranes for natural gas sweetening and hydrogen purification. SEM investigations showed good adhesion of the polymer to the zeolite in MMMs. Permeation performance of the membranes was also investigated using a laboratory-scale gas separation apparatus and effects of feed pressure, zeolite loading and pore size of zeolite on the gas separation performance of the MMMs were evaluated [6]. Rezakazemi et al. cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes supported on cellulose acetate (CA) and polyamide (PA) microfiltration membranes were prepared by pre-wetting technique for pervaporation (PV) dehydration of ethanol. The experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of support layer and permselective thickness on the separation performance of membranes at different operating conditions particularly initial ethanol concentrations and temperatures. The results revealed that increasing feed concentration and temperature increases total permeation flux. PDMS/PA membrane showed better overall performance than PDMS/CA membrane [7]. Chen et al. investigated cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–polyetherimide (PEI) composite membranes preparation, in which asymmetric microporous PEI membrane prepared with phase inversion method acted as the microporous supporting layer in the flat-plate composite membrane. Membrane characterization was conducted by Fourier-transform infrared and scanning electronic microscopy analysis. The composite membranes were employed in pervaporation separation of n-heptane–thiophene mixtures. Effect of amount of PDMS, cross-linking temperature, amount of cross-linking agent, and cross-linking time on the separation efficiency of n-heptane–thiophene mixtures was investigated experimentally [8].|$|E
