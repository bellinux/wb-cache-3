5|$|Dr. <b>Phlox,</b> {{played by}} John Billingsley, is {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise. A Denobulan member of the Inter-Species Medical Exchange, <b>Phlox</b> is brought aboard the Enterprise {{to care for the}} Klingon {{passenger}} during the ship's first mission. Afterwards, he volunteers to stay on, delighting in the experience of humanity taking its first steps onto the galactic stage. An exceedingly cheerful alien, Dr. <b>Phlox</b> uses many animals and naturalistic cures in practicing medicine, in addition to the usual technological methods.|$|E
5|$|He and Doctor <b>Phlox</b> then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to <b>Phlox</b> how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with <b>Phlox</b> and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and <b>Phlox</b> keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{physician}} Antaak and a badly beaten Doctor <b>Phlox</b> update General K'Vagh {{on their}} progress. K'Vagh contacts Admiral Krell, who {{tells him that}} if a cure is not completed soon, the facility will be eradicated in order to contain the disease. Back on Enterprise, Archer questions Reed about his recent actions, and is contacted by Harris from Section 31, a secretive agency within Starfleet. Harris reveals that <b>Phlox</b> is on an important mission and little else, but Reed reveals his location as Qu'Vat; Harris contacts Krell, to inform him that Enterprise is on the way, and Krell reveals that he used Harris. Enterprise arrives at the colony, and Archer beams down to the base with Marab to confront the Klingons and <b>Phlox.</b>|$|E
50|$|Navarretia is a genus {{of about}} 30 species of {{flowering}} plants {{related to the}} <b>phloxes</b> and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushionplants. The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it {{the appearance of a}} pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.|$|R
5000|$|While at warp speed, a huge alien vessel overtakes and {{swallows}} Enterprise, disabling the ship's {{engines and}} weapons. When the scanners register neither the alien ship nor its numerous energy-wisp-like non-corporeal beings, Captain Archer takes Lieutenant Reed and Commander Tucker on an away {{mission to the}} interior. While EV Tucker is visibly [...] "entered" [...] {{by one of the}} beings before being returned to his normal state. Doctor <b>Phlox's</b> examination, however, reveals no lingering effects.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Soong and the Augments capture Barzai, a Denobulan medical ship, {{and use it}} {{to enter}} the medical {{facility}} called Cold Station 12 (C-12). They soon overpower security and capture the scientists there, including its chief medical officer, Doctor Jeremy Lucas (Doctor <b>Phlox's</b> Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart). Due to security protocols, tensions begin to surface between Soong and Malik, as to how to coerce Lucas into divulging the entry codes. Malik convinces Soong to torture Lucas, and failing that, to expose a scientist to a deadly pathogen using a containment chamber.|$|R
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, the crew investigate the kidnapping of Doctor <b>Phlox</b> (John Billingsley), and the ship is attacked by {{a new type of}} Klingon. Meanwhile, <b>Phlox</b> is taken to a Klingon colony to work on a cure for a plague whose effects include the disappearance of the Klingon's cranial ridges.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, <b>Phlox,</b> Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. <b>Phlox</b> makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{returns to}} Earth {{in time for}} the launch of the second NX class starship, Columbia, and Commander Tucker prepares for his transfer. Meanwhile, Ensign Sato and Doctor <b>Phlox</b> are {{attacked}} in San Francisco, and <b>Phlox</b> is kidnapped. Captain Archer and Lieutenant Reed investigate the scene, and Reed is given a secret assignment by a secretive agent that he seems to know. Commander T'Pol, seeking information from Sato, conducts her first mind-meld, and the two realize that the attackers spoke Rigelian. They discover that a Rigelian freighter recently left orbit and head off in pursuit.|$|E
5000|$|As {{molecular}} sieve {{relates to the}} long-term preservation and treatment of cut flowers for long duration, (i.e. continually maintaining their decorative properties [...] ), Vermont Flowers has been using this method of preserving flowers instead of the traditional silica gel more than 20 years ago. The advantage was a much more professional regeneration of the {{molecular sieve}}s. Flowers which are particularly suitable for such a treatment are roses, peonies, camellias, marigolds, globe flowers, orchids, dahlias, carnations, <b>phloxes,</b> summer chrysanthemums, hollyhocks, and the like, and other species with many petals or a fairly rigid structure.|$|R
50|$|Undaunted, Enterprise then sets {{course to}} {{rendezvous}} with Tal'Kir, a Vulcan ship. Doctor <b>Phlox's</b> scans reveal the dead pilot has multi-generational DNA fragments from several alien species including Vulcan, Terrelian, and Rigelian. Seeking answers, Archer and Sub-Commander T'Pol enter Agent Daniels' cabin, and {{they learn that}} the pod is a time travel vessel from the 31st century. Meanwhile, Tucker and Reed, on returning to the pod, get stuck in a recurring time-loop. This heightens T'Pol's concerns and she discusses the situation with Archer, who feels they must have {{more information on the}} Temporal Cold War.|$|R
50|$|His {{garden was}} not tidy and orderly, but rather like an {{idealized}} forest, with a winding path and a gazebo {{at the far}} end from the house. Tchaikovsky adored flowers, particularly the wild flowers of the fields and forest that he saw on his daily walks. He was especially fond of the lily of the valley, to which he even wrote a poem. After his death, his brother Modest planted islands of lilies of the valley around the garden, along with the violets, forget-me-nots, and bluebells that Tchaikovsky admired. The garden has many other varieties of flowers it had in Tchaikovsky's time: roses, begonias, gillyflowers, <b>phloxes,</b> and sweet tobacco.|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant Reed (Dominic Keating) and Ensign Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) {{play chess}} {{while serving as}} hosts to non-corporeal aliens. Returning from an away mission on the planet below, Commander Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and Ensign Sato (Linda Park) soon exhibit {{symptoms}} of a strange disease. Upon examination by Doctor <b>Phlox</b> (John Billingsley), it {{is found to be}} a highly contagious silicon-based virus, and Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) explains that Commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) and <b>Phlox</b> are seeking a cure. To pass the time, while isolated in Decontamination, the two try to learn more about each other.|$|E
5|$|With {{time running}} out, <b>Phlox</b> and T'Pol {{find a way}} to disrupt the virus using deadly levels of radiation. Archer and <b>Phlox,</b> while wearing {{environmental}} suits, escort Tucker and Sato to Sickbay for treatment. Sato soon goes into cardiac-arrest, and Archer removes his gloves and helmet to assist her, but she cannot be resuscitated. They then administer a dose of radiation to Tucker, but that too is ineffective. <b>Phlox</b> then leaves to resume work from the Bridge. Suddenly, Tucker and Sato are reanimated by the aliens, whowhile possessing the crewmenexplain the situation to a surprised Archer, who then makes an impassioned speech on behalf of his crew. The aliens decide to modify their procedures, choosing to resurrect and cure the infected crew members, when they previously would have left them to die. The aliens erase the encounter from the crew's memory. Archer orders a warning beacon to be placed above the planet, and the aliens leave to begin planning first contact with more advanced humans at a later time.|$|E
5|$|Doctor <b>Phlox</b> {{receives}} {{a letter from}} his Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart, Doctor Jeremy Lucas, who is serving a term on Denobula. He begins to compose a letter back, describing his experiences with the crew, {{and the ways in}} which humans are different. Meanwhile, on the Bridge, the crew are discussing a pre-warp vessel they have encountered. The alien they speak with, a Valakian, begs them to assist with a medical emergency their species is facing. Sub-Commander T'Pol reveals that the Vulcans are unaware of the species, but she agrees with Captain Archer to help them. <b>Phlox</b> continues his letter, describing the challenges of treating the disease â€“ with over fifty million lives at stake.|$|E
6000|$|The gardens {{between the}} great shady houses that flanked the street {{were full of}} tall white and crimson <b>phloxes</b> in all the majesty of their summer bloom, {{and the air was}} filled with fragrance; and Lillie, after a two hours' toilet, came forth from her chamber fresh and lovely as the bride in the Canticles. [...] "Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee." [...] She was killingly dressed in the rural-simplicity style. All her robes and sashes were of purest white; and a knot of field-daisies and grasses, with French dew-drops on them, twinkled in an infinitesimal bonnet on her little head, and her hair was all crÃ©ped into a filmy golden aureole round her face. In short, dear reader, she was a {{perfectly}} got-up angel, and wanted only some tulle clouds and an opening heaven to have gone up at once, as similar angels do from the Parisian stage.|$|R
6000|$|She was swifter {{of change}} than he. She could turn {{from the air}} of the [...] "ghost-room" [...] to the glory of the peacock as swiftly as a mirror {{reflects}} its beam of light, and she caught a delightful respite from the flowers. She was accustomed to the lavish greenhouses of her wealthy patrons, but here was something that delighted her more than all their hotbeds. Here were all the old-fashioned out-of-door plants and flowers, the perennials of her grandfather, to whom hot-houses were unknown. This Colonial garden was another of Bartol's peculiarities. He had no love for orchids, or any exotic or forced blooms. His fancy led to the glorification of <b>phloxes,</b> to the ripening of lilacs, and to the preservation of old-time varieties of roses--plants with human association breathing of romance and sorrow--hence his plots were filled with hardy New England roots flourishing in the richer soils of the Western prairies.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} {{variations}} due to reversion, {{there is a}} similar difference between plants propagated from buds and seeds. Many varieties can be propagated securely by buds, but generally or invariably revert to their parent-forms by seed. So, also, hybridised plants can be multiplied to any extent by buds, but are continually liable to reversion by seed,--that is, {{to the loss of}} their hybrid or intermediate character. I can offer no satisfactory explanation of these facts. Plants with variegated leaves, <b>phloxes</b> with striped flowers, barberries with seedless fruit, can all be securely propagated by buds taken from the stem or branches; but buds from the roots of these plants almost invariably lose their character and revert to their former condition. This latter fact is also inexplicable, unless buds developed from the roots are as distinct from those on the stem, as is one bud on the stem from another, and we know that these latter behave like independent organisms.|$|R
5|$|Krell's Klingon battlecruiser and two Birds of Prey {{arrive in}} orbit and Krell orders the ships {{to destroy the}} colony. Enterprise {{attempts}} to intervene but is engaged by the Birds of Prey. Columbia arrives and joins combat with the two Birds of Prey, while Enterprise impedes the battlecruiser. Meanwhile, <b>Phlox</b> infects a restrained Archer, as he needs human antibodies for the cure. Antaak then transports a canister of the virus onto the battlecruiser which infects the crew, including Krell. Needing the cure from <b>Phlox,</b> Krell stands down the attack and the Klingon High Council soon agrees to distribute the cure throughout the Empire. Tucker then agrees to remain onboard temporarily to assist with repairs.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, Columbia arrives so that Commander Tucker can be transferred to conduct repairs on Enterprises warp engine before it overloads. The two ships then pursue a lead to a Klingon research outpost where <b>Phlox</b> is under pressure to cure the virus that the Klingons created from augmented human DNA.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, after visiting the planet Kreetassa, Captain Archer's (Scott Bakula) dog Porthos falls ill with an unknown pathogen. Archer stays overnight in sickbay to look after his dog with Doctor <b>Phlox</b> (John Billingsley) knowing that afterwards he must take part in an elaborate apology display to the Kreetassans.|$|E
60|$|Plants, in fact, {{compete with}} one another all round for {{everything}} they stand in need of. They compete for their food--carbonic acid. They compete for their energy--their fair share of sunlight. They compete for water, and their foothold in the soil. They compete for the favours of the insects that fertilize their flowers. They compete for the good services of the birds or mammals that disseminate their seeds in proper spots for germination. And how real this competition is we can see in a moment, if {{we think of the}} difficulties of human cultivation. There, weeds are always battling manfully with our crops or our flowers for mastery over the field or garden. We are obliged to root up with ceaseless toil these intrusive competitors, if we wish to enjoy the kindly fruits of the earth in due season. When we leave a garden to itself for a few short years, we realize at once what effect the competition of hardy natives has upon our carefully tended and unstable exotics. In a very brief time the dahlias and <b>phloxes</b> and lilies have all disappeared, and in their place the coarse-growing docks and nettles and thistles have raised their heads aloft to monopolize air and space and sunshine.|$|R
5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become increasingly aggressive, while women increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor <b>Phlox</b> determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is then {{ordered to}} Mars {{to destroy the}} array, but is turned away when a warning shot from the weapon damages the ship. Gannet Brooks, now in the brig, reveals to Ensign Mayweather she is a Starfleet Intelligence operative, and that Terra Prime {{probably}} has an operative aboard. Under the urging of Minister Samuels, the crew of Enterprise conceive a way to approach the deadly station undetected, using a shuttlepod hidden inside {{the tail of a}} comet. Captain Archer elects to lead the away mission, along with Lieutenant Reed, Doctor <b>Phlox,</b> and Mayweather.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, following an accident, Captain Jonathan Archer's (Scott Bakula) long term memory is affected and he is relieved of duty. The crew of the Enterprise subsequently fail to stop the Xindi attack on Earth resulting in {{the remnants of the}} human race resettling another planet. Dr <b>Phlox</b> (John Billingsley) finds a way of curing Archer in the past, in the hope that it would undo everything since the Captain was originally injured.|$|E
5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor <b>Phlox</b> determines that 12â€“15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish {{so that it can be}} used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E
5|$|Twelve years {{pass and}} Archer, still plagued by memory loss, lives with T'Pol {{in a house}} on the colony. They are visited by Doctor <b>Phlox,</b> who {{eventually}} engineers a cure. He also discovers that when the subspace radiation treatments kill one of the parasite clusters in Archer's brain, it also vanishes from every other previous medical scanas if the parasite had never existed. Therefore, since Archer will never have been infected, he would have remained Captain and possibly prevented the chain of events that led to Earth's destruction.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, the ship, now captained by Captain Tucker, is {{observed}} and attacked by Xindi vessels before the treatments can be completed. Outnumbered and heavily damaged, <b>Phlox,</b> T'Pol, and Archer race {{against the clock}} to create a subspace implosion. The ship is destroyed, but their plan works and the subspace parasites (which exist outside the normal space/time realm) are also destroyed by the implosion. The episode ends with the time-line reset; Archer is in sickbay recovering from a physical injury but will never develop the amnesia he originally suffered.|$|E
5|$|Doctor <b>Phlox</b> treats her {{injury and}} discovers {{that she is}} one-quarter Skagaran. Meanwhile, back on the planet, Bennings hands in his deputy badge because MacReady orders him not to take any further action against the Skagarans. Archer returns in a shuttlepod along with T'Pol and a {{security}} crew, led by Lieutenant Reed â€” all wearing their modern uniforms. Landing {{in the center of}} town, he informs the Sheriff that he is from Earth and will return to help them once their mission is over. Bennings then shoots MacReady, starting a firefight. In the chaos, Archer is also shot by Bennings, but finally overpowers him in a fistfight. Enterprise then departs, but not before returning Bethany to the surface, and providing her with a PADD to educate the local children about Earth's recent history.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{approaches}} within transporter range, and beams an away team (including <b>Phlox)</b> to the facility. They are soon detected, however, {{and imprisoned}} with the facility's staff. Meanwhile, Commander T'Pol, having {{lost contact with}} the team, attempts to destroy the station, but the Klingon ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is now able to access the remaining 1,800, a carry-over from the Eugenics Wars. Soong and the Augments then escape, but not before Malik kills Smike, helps himself {{to a number of}} pathogen samples, and sets the viral containment fields to fail.|$|E
5|$|He {{chooses to}} go {{mountain}} climbing; to his initial annoyance, Hernandez invites herself along. That night, Archer dreams {{that he is}} attacked by Reptilians, and Hernandez tries to help him {{come to terms with}} his memories and new-found adulation. In return, Archer tries to caution her that space exploration is not as idealistic as she thinks it is. In spite of this, the two manage to rekindle their romance. Returning to Starfleet Command, Archer is able to keep his emotions in check, and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval. Elsewhere, Doctor <b>Phlox</b> learns that some humans still hold a grudge over the Xindi attack, xenophobically blaming all aliens, and Phlox's presence in a bar results in a brawl.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The mural took fourteen weeks to complete. The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star <b>Phlox</b> (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition. A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E

25|$|In February 1913, Gleizes {{and other}} artists {{introduced}} the new style of European modern art to an American {{audience at the}} Armory Show (International Exhibition of Modern Art) in New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to Man on a balcony (l'Homme au Balcon) no. 196, Gleizes exhibited at the Armory Show his 1910 Femme aux <b>Phlox</b> (Woman with <b>Phlox),</b> Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.|$|E
25|$|La Femme aux <b>Phlox,</b> {{also known}} as Woman with <b>Phlox</b> or Woman with Flowers, is an oil {{painting}} created in 1910 by the French artist and theorist Albert Gleizes (1881â€“1953). The painting was exhibited in Room 41 at the Salon des IndÃ©pendants in the Spring of 1911 (no. 2612); the exhibition that introduced Cubism as a group manifestation {{to the general public}} for the first time. The complex collection of geometric masses in restrained colors exhibited in Room 41 created a scandal from which Cubism spread throughout Paris, France, Europe {{and the rest of the}} world. It was from the preview of the works by Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay and LÃ©ger at the 1911 IndÃ©pendants that the term 'Cubism' can be dated. La Femme aux <b>Phlox</b> was again exhibited the following year at the Salon de la Section d'Or, Galerie La BoÃ©tie, 1912 (no. 35). La Femme aux <b>Phlox</b> was reproduced in The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations (Les Peintres Cubistes) by Guillaume Apollinaire, published in 1913. The same year, the painting was again revealed to the general public, this time in the United States, at the International Exhibition of Modern Art (The Armory Show), New York, Chicago, and Boston (no. 195). The work is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Gift of the Esther Florence Whinery Goodrich Foundation.|$|E
25|$|With {{its highly}} limited color palette Gleizes {{achieved}} in La Femme aux <b>Phlox</b> a masterful demonstration of monochromism, a relative and paradoxical monochromy, considering {{the subject matter}} of a woman with flowers.|$|E
