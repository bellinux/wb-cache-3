The first international organization to cover this area was the <b>Pan-American</b> <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Bureau</b> in 1902, followed by the Office International d'Hygiène Publique in Paris in 1909. The League of Nations Health Organization was established following the First World War inside the League of Nations framework, although it did not subsume other health organizations. These efforts were hampered by the Second World War, during which UNRRA also played a role in international health initiatives.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to analyze the Worldwide Anti-Yellow Fever Campaign {{launched}} in 1914 by Wickliffe Rose, the first Director of the International Health Board (IHB) of the Rockefeller Foundation (RF). This campaign was developed between the 1910 s and 1930 s and continued after World War II, under the auspices of the Pan American <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Bureau</b> (PASB) with a new name, "Continental Campaign for Eradication of Aedes aegypti. " At this time the PASB was directed by Fred L. Soper (1947 - 1959), a U. S. sanitarian, physician, and former regional director for the IHB in Brazil (1927 - 1942). Soper led the anti-yellow fever and malaria campaigns launched by both the Brazilian government and the RF beginning in the 1920 s through the 1930 s.

They later tried infecting people with [...] "direct inoculations made from syphilis bacteria poured into the men's penises and on forearms and faces that were slightly abraded [...] [...] [...] or in a few cases through spinal punctures". Approximately 700 people were infected as part of the study (including orphan children). The study was sponsored by the Public Health Service, the National Institutes of Health and the Pan American Health <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Bureau</b> (now the World Health Organization's Pan American Health Organization) and the Guatemalan government. The team was led by John Charles Cutler, who later participated in the Tuskegee syphilis experiments. Cutler chose to do the study in Guatemala because he would not have been permitted {{to do it in the}} United States. In 2010 when the research was revealed, the US officially apologized to Guatemala for the studies. A lawsuit has been launched against Johns Hopkins University, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Rockefeller Foundation for alleged involvement in the study.|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} urban {{yellow fever virus}} (YFV) in Bolivian cities has been {{attributed}} to the lack of competent urban mosquito vectors. Experiments with Aedes aegypti from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, demonstrated infection (100 %), dissemination (20 %), and transmission of a Bolivian YFV strain (CENETROP- 322). Yellow fever virus (YFV) may cause severe hemor-rhagic fever in humans. The virus is transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by infected mosqui-toes in the genera Aedes, Haemagogus, or Sabethes (1). In the Americas, YFV occurs in two transmission cycles. In the jungle/sylvatic cycle, the virus is transmitted between susceptible monkeys, and possibly other vertebrates, by tree-hole–breeding mosquitoes (1). Jungle yellow fever (YF) cases occur when these infected vectors feed on sus-ceptible humans. In the urban cycle, YFV is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (1). In 2003, a total of 226 cases of jungle YF were reported from South America to the Pan American Health Organization, and as of June 23, ongoing outbreaks in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru during 2004 have thus far resulted in 86 confirmed cases and 41 deaths (2). An Ae. aegypti eradication campaign initiated by the Pan American <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Bureau</b> in 1947 eliminated this species from most of Central and South America, and urban YF disappeared from the Americas in the 1940 s. However, during the past 20 years, many countries aban-doned Ae. aegypti control measures, and this urban vector now reoccupies almost the entire area of its distribution preeradication (1). Ae. aegypti was eradicated from Bolivia during the 1960 s and 1970 s but reappeared in the city of Santa Cruz in 1980, and epidemics of dengue fever occurred during the 1980 s and 1990 s (3). In 1997 to 1998, six cases of YF were reported among Santa Cruz residents, and some were regarded as urban YF cases (3); despite a population> 1 million, low vaccine immunization cover-age, and the presence of Ae. aegypti (3), no urban YF out-break occurred. Based on these observations, researchers have suggested that sylvan strains of YFV circulating in Bolivia may not be infective for Bolivian Ae. aegypti. This study examined that hypothesis and the infectivity of a Bolivian strain of YFV for Bolivian Ae. aegypti...|$|R
40|$|En el último siglo, la salud pública ha sido el ente dinamizador en la aplicación de estrategas para mantener la salud y para tratar de disminuir y manejar las enfermedades prevalecientes en grandes grupos comunitario. Estas estrategias han sido denominadas educación para la salud, promoción de la salud y prevención de la enfermedad.   Para lograr cumplir con estas acciones a nivel comunitario, ha sido necesaria la ingerencia de grandes organizaciones como la Organización Panamericana de la Salud (OPS), la Oficina Panamericana Sanitaria y la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), quienes no sólo han actuado para fundamentar planes estratégicos, sino para elaborar políticas públicas referidas  promover y proteger la salud y la vida de las personas más vulnerables y desprotegidas del planeta. Esta protección busca proporcionar los medios necesario para ejercer mayor control sobre la  propia salud,  y así poder mejorarla con la implementación de la ética y la bioética. En estos términos, la acción de estas dos disciplinas ha orientado la fundamentación y la reflexión sobre el actuar interdisciplinar, de acuerdo con el bioeticista Daniel Callahan, quien define uqe la bioética {{cultural}} se relaciona con el contexto histórico, ideológico, cultural y social en el cual vive y se expresa la persona. A su vez, la bioética clínica considera la toma diaria de decisiones morales sobre lo que se debe hacer para cuidar la salud y la vida; y la bioética normativa,  se identifica con las reglas y las normas que orientan la toma de decisiones en casos y situaciones que requieren soluciones ético-legales y aplicación de las políticas públicas.  ABSTRACTThe {{public health}} {{has been in}} the last century the dynamo being in the application of strategies to maintain the health and to try to diminish and to handle the prevalentes diseases of great communitarian groups. These strategies have been denominated education for the health, promotion of the health and prevention of the disease; in order to manage to fulfill these actions at communitarian level, the interference of great organizations has been necessary: the Pan-American Organization of health (OPS), the <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Pan-American</b> Office and the world-wide  Organization of the Health (the WHO), who have not only acted to base strategic plans, but in the elaboration of public policies referred to promote and to protect the health and the life of the most vulnerable and unprotected people of the planet, in terms  to provide means necessary to exert  greater control on the own health  and thus to be able to improve it with the implementation of the ethic and the bioethic. In these terms the action of these two disciplines have oriented the fundamentation and the reflection on acting between disciplines, as it conceives Daniel Callahan, when it defines that the cultural bioethic, is related to the historical, ideological context, cultural and social in which  it lives and it express the person; the clinical bioethic, considers the taking daily of moral decisions on which it is due to make {{to take care of the}} health and the life; and the normative bioethic, identifies with the rules and the norms that orient the decision making in cases and situations that require ethical-legal solutions and application of the public policies.
