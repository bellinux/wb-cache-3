500|$|A crucial {{maneuver}} in Crash Team Racing is {{the power}} slide; the player executes the slide by holding {{down one of the}} shoulder buttons to perform a hop, and steering before the kart lands. While sliding, the [...] "Turbo Boost Meter" [...] on the lower-right corner of the screen fills up and goes from green to red. At the same time, the exhaust gas from the player's kart turns black. To get a speed boost, the player quickly presses the opposite shoulder button while the Turbo Boost Meter is red. The player can execute three speed boosts in a row during a <b>power</b> <b>slide,</b> with the third speed boost being more powerful than the previous two. If the player waits too long into the <b>power</b> <b>slide</b> for a boost, the kart back-fires and the chance for a speed boost is lost; <b>power</b> <b>sliding</b> for too long causes a spin-out. Aside from <b>power</b> <b>slides,</b> speed boosts can be obtained by gathering [...] when leaping over gaps in the track. The longer the player is in the air, the bigger the speed boost will be when the kart lands.|$|R

500|$|The game {{features}} advanced maneuvers such as <b>power</b> <b>sliding</b> and hopping. <b>Power</b> <b>sliding</b> {{allows a}} kart {{to maintain its}} speed while turning, although executing the maneuver for too long causes the kart to spin. Hopping helps a kart execute tighter turns: the kart makes a short hop and turns in the air, speeding off in the new direction when it lands. Reviewers praised Super Mario Karts gameplay, describing the battle mode as [...] "addictive" [...] and the single player gameplay as [...] "incredible". IGN stated that the gameplay mechanics defined the genre.|$|R

From this available information {{it was determined that}} Odontocyclops lack denary teeth, but do contain a lateral dentary shelf. The presence of the lateral dentary shelf combined with the quadrates being similar in morphology to other dicynodonts suggest that Odontocyclops used a propalinal <b>sliding</b> <b>feeding</b> mechanism.|$|R

50|$|WCVs {{themselves}} {{incorporate a}} compacting mechanism {{which is used}} to increase the payload of the vehicle and reduce the number of times it has to empty.

5000|$|Urban Terror allows {{players to}} perform superhuman feats. Damage {{is a key}} example; while damage taken depends {{on the part of}} the body which is hit, one can keep going after {{receiving}} numerous hits. Further breaking from reality, Urban Terror also retains the movement speeds from Quake III Arena (circle jumping) which allowed players to move through the environment incredibly quickly and includes moves such as wall jumping and <b>power</b> <b>sliding.</b> Wall jumping allows players to literally jump off of walls and helps the player to gain more height, distance and speed. <b>Power</b> <b>sliding</b> lets the player slide, rapidly, in a crouched position, maintaining speed. These abilities have spawned a sub-community of players who focus on specially designed [...] "jump maps" [...] of which the goal is to reach the end of a series of difficult courses.|$|R

25|$|ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System), {{a method}} of {{controlling}} air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was {{also a part of}} the 7M-GE's technological arsenal.

50|$|The PGR series have {{a system}} called Kudos points. These are given for {{performing}} stunts with the vehicle (such as <b>power</b> <b>sliding,</b> overtaking another driver, two wheels, etc.). The longer the stunt is maintained, the more points the player receives. Colliding with the guard rails and other surroundings will cause the Kudos points from that stunt to be lost.|$|R
50|$|In July 2012, Honda Malaysia added {{a cheaper}} {{version of the}} Honda Freed called the Grade S. It was priced RM99,800 on-the-road with insurance.

Some found it noisier than competitors. It won consecutive Edmunds.com Editors' Most Wanted awards from 1999-2003 in the minivan category.|$|R
