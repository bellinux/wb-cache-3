40|$|Welding {{is used in}} ships, bridges, {{pressure}} vessels, industrial machinery, automobile, {{rolling stock}} and many other fields. Problems associated with welding are common issues in these fields. Weldability of steel refers to the maximum hardness of the heat affected zone (HAZ) and the cold cracking susceptibility of welds. When steel is welded non uniform heating and cooling in weld metal and in base metal generates harder Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), cold crack susceptibility and residual stress in weldment. The best way to minimize above difficulties is to slow the heating and cooling rate of the base metal and weld heat affected zone. However there are many methods for reducing the effects of above problems {{and one of them}} is preheating and/or <b>post</b> <b>heating.</b> Pre heating and/or <b>Post</b> <b>heating</b> have been widely employed in welding operation for preventing cold cracking.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} obtain the highest process {{efficiency}} for oil production, considerations {{should be given to}} the determination of the optimum processing parameters. Coconut oil has many domestic, industrial, food, medicinal and cosmetics usages. Coconut trees which produce coconut fruits are widely available in tropical climates {{all over the world and}} as such its uses are still been exploited. From literature reviews, studies into optimum processing parameters for many oil seeds have been reported, however none exists for coconut oil processing parameters. Therefore, this study focused on the determination of optimum processing parameters for coconut oil production. Experimental studies carried out in this study considered the following processing parameters: <b>post</b> <b>heating</b> moisture content, applied pressure, pressure duration, heating time and temperature to which the dried coconut meat samples were subjected using hydraulic uniaxial compression method. Optimum values for these parameters were determined and reported. The highest coconut oil yield obtained was 51. 9 % at optimum condition. This yield corresponds to an expression efficiency of 81. 2 % of the total coconut oil content, which represented 63. 9 % by weight of the copra (dried coconut flesh). The highest oil yield was obtained at an expression pressure of 25 MPa when samples were conditioned to an initial moisture content of 11. 3 % (w. b.) and heated at 120 ºC for 15 min to obtain a <b>post</b> <b>heating</b> moisture of 7. 13 % (w. b.). Increases in oil yield were recorded for increases in applied pressure but this tended to level off between pressures of 20 MPa and 25 MPa.

It consisted of glass beads coated with Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase (BLA) and stabilizing additives in a dehydrated form. <b>Post</b> <b>heating</b> residual enzymatic activity {{was used as}} a response property of the TTI. Under isothermal conditions, different batches of the system were characterized by Z(TTI) -values around 13. 5 degreesC in the temperature range 100 - 130 degreesC as well as by their ability to provide a response within 5 min after thermal processing. When used under non-isothermal conditions in a model food (silicone spheres), the system allowed to measure process-values F-zTTI(121. 1 degreesC) UP to 60 min with an average error of 10. 9 %.

40|$|Fe-Si alloys {{are widely}} applied {{materials}} in industrial fields {{due to their}} magnetic properties. However, these alloys are difficult to manufacture due to the high oxidation affinity of Fe-Si alloys at high temperature; further, the permanence of the formed oxides (i. e., Fe 2 SiO 4) degrade their workability. In order to solve this problem, disposable workability-improving thick coating layers were deposited on Fe-Si alloy substrates in this study using plain carbon steel wire and pure Fe powder via thermal and kinetic spraying processes. The resulting deposits were compared in terms of microstructure and mechanical properties. In thermal sprayed deposit, the oxides degraded mechanical properties, but were helpful for the deposition of a thick layer by restraining bending by thermally induced tensile residual stress. On the other hand, kinetic sprayed deposit showed better adhesive bond strength owing to the compressive residual stress.

Rats received 1. 7 mg/kg cisplatin i. p., twice a week for 6 weeks, up to a cumulative dose of 20. 4 mg/kg. After termination of cisplatin treatment, a 5 mm segment of the nerve was locally heated at a temperature of 45 degrees C (5 - 30 min). Loss of motor function was assessed by means of the toe-spreading test, 24 h <b>post</b> <b>heating.</b> The calculated ED 50 for control nerves was significantly (p < 0. 01) larger than the ED 50 for cisplatin treated rats; 16. 3 +/- 1. 1 min vs. 10. 9 +/- 1. 1 min. This indicates that nerves from cisplatin treated rats were more sensitive to heat than nerves from control rats (dose modifying factor = 1. 5 +/- 0. 2). Histopathological investigation of nerves after heat alone or after heat preceded by cisplatin confirmed these differences and showed that edema, vascular damage and axonal degenerative changes of axons and myelin sheaths occurred at lower heat doses when compared to control nerves.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{reduction}} of residual stress induced during the selective laser melting {{with a mixture of}} ferrous based metal powder. To evaluate the residual stresses induced during layered manufacturing processes, a strain gauge is attached on the bottom face of the base plate. The residual stress within the consolidated structure is calculated from the amount of strain change measured by the strain gauge when the consolidated structure is cut with an end mill. The influences of base plate thickness and consolidated structure height on the residual stresses are investigated. In addition, the effect of pre-heating and <b>post</b> <b>heating</b> by a laser beam irradiation are evaluated. The results showed that the deformation of the base plate increased with the increase of the consolidated layer and the decrease of base plate thickness, and the deformation was flattened when the consolidated structure was completely removed with the end mill. The deformation was related to the induced residual stresses. The residual stress distribution within the consolidated structure in the z direction was extremely large at the top layer of the structure and the boundary between the base plate and consolidated structure. The residual stress at the first layer of the structure decreased when the base plate was heated before consolidating the deposited powder. The residual stresses decreased when each of the consolidated layers was repeatedly heated by the laser beam irradiation. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{microwave}} materials interactions were studied through dielectric property measurements, process modeling, and lab scale microwave hybrid calcination tests. Characterization and analysis {{were performed to}} evaluate material reactions and energy usage. Processing parameters for laboratory scale and larger scale calcining experiments were developed for MAT limestone calcination. Early stage equipment design concepts were developed, {{with a focus on}} microwave <b>post</b> <b>heating</b> treatment. The retrofitting of existing rotary calcine equipment in the lime industry was assessed and found to be feasible. Ceralink sought to address some of the major barriers to the uptake of MAT identified as the need for (1) team approach with end users, technology partners, and equipment manufacturers, (2) modeling that incorporates kiln materials and variations to the design of industrial microwave equipment. This project has furthered the commercialization effort of MAT by working closely with an industrial lime manufacturer to educate them regarding MAT, identifying equipment manufacturer to supply microwave equipment, and developing a sophisticated MAT modeling with WPI, the university partner. MAT was shown to enhance calcining through lower energy consumption and faster reaction rates compared to conventional processing. Laboratory testing concluded that a 23 % reduction in energy was possible for calcining small batches (5 kg). Scale-up testing indicated that the energy savings increased as a function of load size and 36 % energy savings was demonstrated (22 kg). A sophisticated model was developed which combines simultaneous microwave and conventional heating. Continued development of this modeling software could be used for larger scale calcining simulations, which would be a beneficial low-cost tool for exploring equipment design prior to actual building. Based on these findings, estimates for production scale MAT calcining benefits were calculated, assuming uptake of MAT in the US lime industry. This estimate showed that 7. 3 TBTU/year could be saved, with reduction of 270 MMlbs of CO 2 emissions, and $ 29 MM/year in economic savings. Taking into account estimates for MAT implementation in the US cement industry, an additional 39 TBTU/year, 3 Blbs of CO 2 and $ 155 MM/year could be saved. One of the main remaining barriers to commercialization of MAT for the lime and cement industries is the sheer size of production. Through this project, it was realized that a production size MAT rotary calciner was not feasible, and a different approach was adapted. The concept of a microwave post heat section located in the upper portion of the cooler was devised and appears to be a more realistic approach for MAT implementation. Commercialization of this technology will require (1) continued pilot scale calcining demonstrations, (2) involvement of lime kiln companies, and (3) involvement of an industrial microwave equipment provider. An initial design concept for a MAT post-heat treatment section was conceived as a retrofit into the cooler sections of existing lime rotary calciners with a 1. 4 year payback. Retrofitting will help spur implementation of this technology, as the capital investment will be minimal for enhancing the efficiency of current rotary lime kilns. Retrofits would likely be attractive to lime manufacturers, as the purchase of a new lime kiln is on the order of a $ 30 million dollar investment, where as a MAT retrofit is estimated on the order of $ 1 million. The path for commercialization lies in partnering with existing lime kiln companies, who will be able to implement {{the microwave}} post heat sections in existing and new build kilns.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a standardised and practice relevant method for ‘direct process control’, which is suitable for large communal as well as smaller agricultural co-fermentation plants, we first analysed the suitability of germ carriers and the tenacity of various test organisms. These analyses were conducted in anaerobic mesophilic and thermophilic lab-scale fermenters and in a pasteurising container (70 - 90 °C). The aim was to identify an indicator organism that can be detected quickly and inexpensively by conventional techniques, and which is also highly thermoresistant and has epidemiological relevance. In thermophilic lab-scale fermenters (55 °C), the tenacity of Salmonella Senftenberg W 775, Ascaris suum, Campylobacter jejuni, ‘wild type’ coliphage, as well as coliphage T 1, and Enterococcus faecalis was investigated. Whereas Salmonella Senftenberg W 775, Ascaris suum, and Campylobacter jejuni could be inactivated within 3 hours, Enterococcus faecalis survived for more than 3 hours, and a wild type coliphage could be detected even after more than 24 hours. Tenacity experiments in mesophilic lab-scale fermenters (35 °C) showed no inactivation {{of any of the}} test organisms within 24 hours. Heating to temperatures between 70 - 90 °C showed that both Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis and Ascaris suum were eliminated within 30 minutes at 70 °C. Enterococcus faecalis, wilde type coliphage, and Salmonellae could not be detected after 1 hour of incubation at 70 °C. The coliphage T 1 could be eliminated only after 90 minutes at 70 °C. For the most part, these results were confirmed by investigations in operating fermentation plants, with the exception that, under practice conditions, wild type coliphage as well as coliphage T 1 need to be pasteurised for 1 hour at 70 °C to be inactivated. The thermophilic fermentation alone (52 – 55 °C) is not enough to inactivate coliphage T 1 within 24 hours. Coliphage T 1 presents a test organism that, with regard to its thermoresistance, should be placed above Salmonella Senftenberg W 775 and Enterococcus faecalis. Its handling is unproblematic and results can be obtained within a day. Its use as a ‘test organism’ should be discussed, especially in relation to the regulation (EC) no. 1774 / 2002 (ANONYM, 2002), for usage of category III material, whereby further research is needed in this context. In order to obtain a product, which is safe with regard to health risks, it is suggested to choose the following temperature/ time combinations for direct process control in anaerobic fermenters: -Thermophilic fermenters: 55 °C/ 22 - 24 hours -Pasteurising: 70 C/ 1 hour. However, if the coliphage T 1 will become relevant as a test organism in the future, the present results show that heating to 70 °C/ 2 hours or 80 °C/ 1 hour are required. The thermophilic processes at 55 °C and an assured retention time of 22 - 24 hours are not sufficient to eliminate coliphage T 1. With regard to thermophilic wet fermentation processes without pre- or <b>post</b> <b>heating</b> steps, which do not warrant plug flow, it is absolutely necessary to obtain data for the exact retention times (minimum retention time) of substrate particles or the liquid phase. Establishing the exact retention time of particles in a thermophilic fermentation plant offers the possibility to limit the contact times of indicator organisms to predetermined retention times of a particular fermenter during the conduct of direct process monitoring. The strict demand of the required incubation times during process monitoring of 22 - 24 hours could thus be shortened. A Bacillus globigii spore suspension was used as a biological tracer because it could previously be shown in lab-scale fermenters that this thermoresistant bacterium, which is not present in the natural flora of substrates used in anaerobic fermenters, can be optimally mixed with infeed materials, and the influences of processes in anaerobic fermenters are unable to eliminate Bacillus globigii. The use of a Bacillus globigii spore suspension was investigated in 3 selected treatment plants. Its value as a biological tracer to determine absolute retention times was, amongst other things, also seen in a large communal anaerobic fermentation plant (> 3. 000 m 3), as well as in a mixing drum for drying sewage sludge. In addition to the ‘direct process control’, the substrate from the different biogas plants, was examined for its Salmonella, enterococci and total and faecal coliforms content before and after the thermal treatment. The purpose of these assays was to ensure the efficiency of the process used in the biogas plants. According to the results of this study, thermophilic anaerobic digestion ensures better inactivation of microorganisms than anarerobic digestion at mesophilic temperatures. However, the complete inactivation of microorganisms was not possible without additional pasteurisation. It is advisable to still call for the so-called ‘direct process control’ even under an amended bio-waste regulation (BioAbfV). For it provides a definite indication that the processes in a particular plant, with its given technical set-up by using defined substrates, are principally able to yield a hygienically risk-free end product. This study was carried out in 2002. According to Regulation (EC) No. 2008 / 2006 (Anonymus, 2006 a) from February 2006, the validation of biotechnological processes in composting and biogas plants must to be carried out using two test organisms: Salmonella Senftenberg H 2 S negative and Enterococcus faecalis...|$|E

Friction welding tests {{were carried out}} at a constant rotation speed and pressure. Optimum friction condition {{was found to be}} the friction pressure of 25 kg/cm 2, friction time of 40 sec, upset pressure of 80 kg/cm 2, and dwell time of 5 sec. After friction welding tests, <b>post</b> weld <b>heat</b> treatments were performed in the temperature range of 500 - 900 °C for 8 hrs in order to investigate the microstructure and mechanical properties of weld joint. Specimens with the <b>post</b> weld <b>heat</b> treatment at 720 °C for 8 hrs show optimal mechanical properties. Residual stress of <b>post</b> weld <b>heat</b> treated specimens was measured to weld joint in the same temperature range. After friction welding tests on samples with a diameter of 80 mm, tensile properties of post-weld-heat-treated and non-heat-treated samples were compared...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the high costs of {{conventional}} materials, and to reduce the power necessary for the deposition of titanium dioxide, titanium tetrabutoxide has been developed {{in the form of a}} suspension of TiO 2 using water instead of expensive ethanol. To avoid sedimentation of hydroxide particles in the suspension, mechanical milling of the suspension was conducted in order to create diffusion in colloidal suspension before using it as feedstock. Consequently, through the creation of a colloidal suspension, coating deposition was able to be conducted without sedimentation of the hydroxide particles in the suspension during the deposition process. Though an amorphous as-deposited coating was able to be deposited, through <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treatment at 630 °C for 60 min, the chemical structure became anatase rich. In addition, it was confirmed that the <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treated anatase rich coating had enough photo-catalytic activity to decolor methylene-blue droplets. From these results, this technique was found to have high potential in the low cost photo-catalytic titanium coating production process...|$|R

40|$|Slurry erosive wear as {{a failure}} {{mechanism}} has significance in terms of dictating the performance of marine components. Experimental determination of this wear phenomenon for various materials in current naval applications is tedious, expensive and, {{in the majority of}} cases, not reliable. The standard experimental procedures in assessing the slurry erosive wear do not simulate the actual operating conditions. Researchers have been focusing on predictions of wear behaviour based on several hypotheses and mathematical models as a response to overcome the above mentioned obstacles. The fuzzy logic approach is a highly reliable analytical technique and therefore widely accepted and used. This paper discusses a fuzzy logic model to predict the slurry erosive wear behavior of cast aluminum 6061 (Al 6061) alloy pre and <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treatment. The adopted fuzzy model employs hybrid-learning techniques involving a combination of both back-propagation and least-square method. Sand concentration, test duration, slurry rotation speed and impinging particle sizes served as inputs while slurry erosive wear losses were the outputs. The predicted values have been compared with published experimental data under various operating conditions. The predicted values of slurry erosive wear loss of cast aluminum 6061 alloy pre and <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treatment are in close agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|In this work, NiAl bronze (NAB) alloys were {{subjected}} to friction stir processing (FSP) at a constant traverse speed of 100 mm/min and rotation rates of 600 rpm, 800 rpm, 1000 rpm and 1200 rpm, respectively. Thereafter, heat treatment was performed at 675 °C for 2 h. The effects of rotation rates on strengthening mechanisms of friction stir processed and <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treated NAB alloy were studied. The results showed that friction stir processed NAB alloy microhardness was increased as the rotation rate increased. During friction stir processing, martensite nanotwins could be formed due to high strain rates and peculiar martensitic structures of NAB alloys. A rotation rate increase, increased peak temperatures and strain rates in friction stir processed NAB alloys, leading to {{a significant amount of}} martensite nanotwins formation. As rotation rates increased from 600 rpm to 1200 rpm, in addition to grain refinement effects, the strengthening mechanism of friction stir processed NAB alloys gradually changed from secondary phase strengthening to solid solution, dislocations and nanotwin strengthening. During <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treatment, discontinuous static recrystallization occurred and β′ phase decomposed into α and κ phases. Highest microhardness values were obtained at the rotation rate of 800 rpm and the uniformly distributed second phases formed during friction stir processing contributed mainly to higher microhardness...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{show the}} {{deposition}} of 2. 7 μm thick phosphate based glass films produced by magnetron sputtering, followed by <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treatments at 500 °C. Variations in degradation properties pre and <b>post</b> <b>heat</b> treatment {{were attributed to}} the formation of Hematite crystals within a glass matrix, iron oxidation and the depletion of hydrophilic P-O-P bonds within the surface layer. As deposited and heat treated coatings showed interfacial tensile adhesion in excess of 73. 6 MPa; which surpassed ISO and FDA requirements for HA coatings. Scratch testing of coatings on polished substrates revealed brittle failure mechanisms, amplified due to heat treatment and interfacial failure occurring from 2. 3 to 5. 0 N. Coatings that were deposited onto sandblasted substrates to mimic commercial implant surfaces, did not suffer from tensile cracking or trackside delamination showing substantial interfacial improvements to between 8. 6 and 11. 3 N. An exponential dissolution rate was observed from 0 to 2 h for as deposited coatings, which was eliminated via heat treatment. From 2 to 24 h ion release rates ordered P > Na > Mg > Ca > Fe whilst all coatings exhibited linear degradation rates, which reduced by factors of 2. 4 – 3. 0 following heat treatments...|$|R
40|$|Dissimilar {{diffusion}} boning {{between an}} oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Ni-base alloy, MA 758, and conventional casting Ni-base superalloy, CM- 247 LC, was studied by combining and controlling some bonding parameters : bonding temperature, bonding pressure, and the <b>post</b> weld <b>heat</b> treatment. The optimum bonding condition was filtered and refined {{on the basis}} of the microstructure and thickness of the diffusion layer, the hardness distribution across the welded interface, and the high temperature tensile properties of the joints. The experimental evidences indicated, the bonding temperature and the <b>post</b> weld <b>heat</b> treatment played an essential role. For example, the longer the <b>post</b> weld <b>heat</b> treatment time, the better the high temperature tensile properties were.
