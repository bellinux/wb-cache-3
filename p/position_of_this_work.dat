This generalization {{focuses on the}} properties of the evaluation functions, on the characteristics of the state graphs, on the notion of path length, on the procedures that control the choices of the node expansions, on the rules that govern the updating operations. Consequently, we present new theorems about the subadmissibility.

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the processes of}} community natural resources management, agrosilvopastoral and fishery, since the agrarian communalism {{is presented as a}} central issue in the contemporary agrarian world with implications for the biocultural heritage management, more in line with socio-economic approaches of the 21 st century. Thus, from a qualitative methodology, the advances of the first research offer a vision of communal management of goods: land, pastures, livestock, water, fisheries and ecotourism. The experiments studied in Sierra de Santa Marta of Veracruz in Mexico, through the caseanalysis Project Sierra de Santa Marta, PSSM, show how, starting from an “ecology of knowledge (Santos, 2009), the resources of the jungle have allowed different peasant and/or indigenous communities to survive, avoiding, largely, to resort to emigration.

40|$|One {{of the key}} results we {{associate}} with the Pareto/NBDmodel (Schmittlein et al. 1987) is an expression for P (alive | x, tx, T), {{the probability that a}} customer with purchase history (x, tx, T) is “alive ” at time T. In Fader, Hardie and Lee (2005) we present the BG/NBD model {{as an alternative to the}} Pareto/NBD. The <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> is that the model yields very similar results to the Pareto/NBD while being vastly easier to implement. Although we present analogous expressions for most of the quantities reported in Schmittlein et al. (1987), we do not report an expression for P (alive). This has led some to claim that this quantity cannot be computed using the BG/NBD model; as we shall see, this is not the case. (Our primary reason for not presenting this result is simply that we see the quantity as a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. However, continued interest in it leads us to write this note.) Deriving the expression for P (alive) under the BG/NBD model is a triv-ial exercise. Given the assumptions of the BG/NBD model, the probability that a customer with purchase history (x, tx, T) is alive at time T is simply the probability that he did not “die ” at tx. Recall the BG/NBD likelihood function: L(r, α, a, b |x, tx, T) = B(a, b+ x...|$|R

40|$|Tradition {{states that}} the most popular Olympian deities are Apollo, Athena, Zeus and Dionysius. These divinities played key roles in the communal, {{political}} and ritual development of the Greco-Roman world. This work suggests that this deeply entrenched scholarly tradition is fissured with misunderstandings of Greek and Ephesian popular culture, and provides evidence that clearly suggests Artemis is the most prevalent and influential goddess of the Mediterranean, with roots embedded {{in the community and}} culture of this area that can be traced further back in time than even the arrival of the Greeks. In fact, Artemis reign is so fundamental to the cultural identity of her worshippers that even when facing the onslaught of early Christianity, she could not be deposed. Instead, she survived the conquering of this new religion under the guise of Mary, Mother of Jesus. Using methods of narrative analysis, as well as review of archeological findings, this work demonstrates that the customs devoted to the worship of Artemis were fundamental to the civic identity of her followers, particularly in the city of Ephesus in which Artemis reigned not only as Queen of Heaven, but also as Mother, Healer and Saviour. Reverence for her was as so deeply entrenched in the community of this city, that after her temple was destroyed, and Christian churches were built on top of her sacred places, her citizens brought forward the only female character in the new ruling religion of Christianity, the Virgin Mary, and re-named her Theotokos, Mother of God, within its city walls. The fundamental <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> is that a fusion took place between the ancient worship of Artemis in Ephesus, and the elevation of Mary to Theotokos, and that this fusion is not a result of the church-initiated action to convert the Ephesians, but rather the Ephesians forcing the early church to accommodate their traditions of Artemis by reshaping and reinterpreting the authority and responsibilities of the Virgin Mary...|$|E

We also show that in the blastoderm, the regulatory sign of a transcriptional regulator is unlikely to change in a concentration dependent manner.

In {{the field of}} robot manipulation {{there has been a}} great deal of work on how to grasp objects stably, and in the field of robot motion planning there has {{been a great deal of}} work on how to find collision-free paths to those grasp <b>positions.</b> However, most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> assumes exact knowledge of the shapes and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> both the object and the robot; little work has been done on how to grasp objects robustly in the presence <b>of</b> <b>position</b> uncertainty.

We derive a closed-loop strategy that maintains a belief state (a probability distribution over world states), and select actions with a receding horizon using forward search through the belief space. Our actions are world-relative trajectories (WRT) : fixed trajectories expressed relative to the most-likely state of the world.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} 3 D head pose estimation and tracking. Existing approaches generally need huge database, training procedure, manual initialization or use face feature extraction manually extracted. We propose a framework for estimating the 3 D head pose in its fine level and tracking it continuously across multiple Degrees of Freedom (DOF) based on ICP and particle filtering. We propose to approach the problem, using 3 D computational techniques, by aligning a face model to the 3 D dense estimation computed by a stereo vision method, and propose a particle filter algorithm to refine and track the posteriori estimate <b>of</b> the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the face. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> comes with two contributions: the first concerns the alignment part where we propose an extended ICP algorithm using an anisotropic scale transformation.

As the preference ranking indicated, the tasted tequilas were practically ranked as “regular”, since the theoretical ranking values were around of 100 points. Despite this, there were no statistical differences (sign tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) found between the tequila <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> and any <b>of</b> the commercial tequilas. Results from the effective test, <b>positioned</b> the tequila <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> more pleasant to consumers (only two consumers found it unpleasant) when compared to the two commercial tequilas, while most of them also found our tequila strong, same result when the commercial tequilas were qualified. Most of the consumers assigned descriptors linked to basic degustation savours (acid, sweet, sour), besides common distillated alcoholic beverages descriptors such as astringency, aroma strength, fruitiness, spiciness, hotness and smoked-likeness.|$|R
