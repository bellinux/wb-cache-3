This paper investigates how the state-dependence between two periods affects the optimal audit decision.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the usefulness of sural nerve biopsy in neurological practice.  METHODS—The first prospective study of sural nerve biopsy in 50 consecutive patients was undertaken. The investigating neurologist declared the prebiopsy diagnosis and management plan and after 3 months an independent neurologist evaluated {{the contribution of the}} biopsy to diagnosis and management. An independent <b>audit</b> <b>officer</b> sought information from the patient about the adverse effects and value of the biopsy after 6 weeks and 6 months.  RESULTS—In seven cases the nerve biopsy changed the diagnosis, in 35 cases the biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis, and in eight cases the biopsy was non-contributory. The biopsy either changed or was helpful in guiding patient management in 60 %, especially those with demyelinating neuropathy and multiple mononeuropathy. Seven patients reported having had infection and 10 reported increased pain at the biopsy site 6 months later.  CONCLUSION—In a consecutive series of 50 cases, sural nerve biopsy altered the diagnosis in 14 %, affected management in 60 %, and caused persistent increased pain at the biopsy site in 33 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{guidelines}} have specified {{a number}} of waiting time targets to prevent delay {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer. This study was carried out to assess the quality of lung cancer services and compare with national recommendations. Methods All newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer presenting to our institution via general practitioner referral were entered into a prospective tracking study by a dedicated <b>audit</b> <b>officer.</b> From September 2003 to March 2005 a total of 247 patients were entered into the study. Of these 133 (54 %) were referred by general practitioners and the remainder 114 (46 %) were internal referrals. The Cancer Plan waiting time targets are mainly applicable to GP referrals, which formed the study group. Results All the patients were seen in chest out-patients clinic within the recommended two weeks period. However there was a delay in starting all forms of treatment. The median waiting time to any form of treatment was 60 days (recommendation 62 days for all patients). Conclusion This data demonstrates that although patients receive out patient consultation in the recommended time period, the National Cancer Plan 62 days GP referral to treatment target is not being achieved. A concerted effort by all clinicians is required to meet the prescribed target times. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the effect of {{surgical}} training on outcomes in thoracic surgery. The impact of surgeon training on outcomes following lung resection was examined, focusing on lobectomy as a marker operation. Methods: 328 consecutive patients who underwent lobectomy at our institution between 1 October 2001 and 30 June 2003 were studied. Data were collected prospectively during the patient’s admission as part of routine clinical practice and validated by a designated <b>audit</b> <b>officer.</b> Patient characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared between trainee led and consultant led operations. Results: In 115 cases (35. 1 %) the operation was performed by a trainee thoracic surgeon as the first operator. There {{were no significant differences in}} patient characteristics between the two groups. In-hospital mortality was similar for operations led by trainees and consultants (3. 5 % and 2. 8 %, respectively; p. 0. 99).
