Sources differ on the film's final cost, offering figures between $93,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and $300,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted). A film production group, <b>Pie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sky,</b> provided $23,532 (about $ inflation-adjusted) {{in exchange for}} 19% of Vortex. This left Henkel, Hooper {{and the rest of}} the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake. Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Pictures. David Foster, producer of the 1982 horror film The Thing, arranged for a private screening for some of Bryanston Pictures' West Coast executives, and received 1.5% of Vortex's profits and a deferred fee of $500 (about $ inflation-adjusted).|$|E

He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter Easy Date won the All American Futurity in 1974. Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired <b>Pie</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sky,</b> the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner. More than 1,500 of his offspring earned their AQHA Race Register of Merit, and nine became World Champion Quarter Running Horses. Besides the horses already mentioned, the champions include My Easy Credit, Extra Easy, Easily Smashed, Easy Angel, Easy Move, and Megahertz. His foal Sunset Gallant Jet was the 1979 and 1980 AQHA High Point Cutting & Chariot Racing Co-Champion. At various points in time, Easy Jet has led the AQHA's lists of All-time leading sires of sires, All-time leading sires of Register of Merit qualifiers, All-time leading sires of stakes winners, and All-time leading broodmare sires. In March 2008, he still led the list of All-time leading sires of Quarter Horse racehorses by winners, and on the corresponding list ordered by earnings, he ranks fourth.

As of 2008, his offspring had earned over $26,000,000 on the racetrack. In total, he sired 2,507foals in 25years of breeding.|$|E

500|$|Environmental groups {{dispute the}} {{economic}} benefits that are claimed for air transport, and the OEF reports have been specifically challenged. The Aviation Environment Federation (AEF), publishing the Rebuttal of Oxford Economic Forecasting Report, has labelled the 2006 OEF report [...] "biased and misleading". AirportWatch, an umbrella movement for national environmental organisations and airport community groups opposed to aviation expansion, has produced {{a critique of the}} 2006 OEF report and the DfT’s reliance on economic research that has been [...] "… sponsored by the aviation industry." [...] In response to government policy supporting further growth in aviation, Friends of the Earth (FoE) published <b>Pie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> in September 2006. This study concludes that {{the economic benefits}} of aviation have been exaggerated, and that the costs arising from environmental damage, as well as to other sectors of the economy, are ignored. Also published in 2006, the Environmental Change Institute study Predict and decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy re-examined the economic arguments made in favour of aviation, concluding that restricting future growth would not necessarily be detrimental to the economy, and could potentially result in some economic benefits.|$|E

2500|$|One Wobbly {{characteristic}} {{since their}} inception {{has been a}} penchant for song. To counteract management sending in the Salvation Army band {{to cover up the}} Wobbly speakers, Joe Hill wrote parodies of Christian hymns so that union members could sing along with the Salvation Army band, but with their own purposes. For example, [...] "In the Sweet By and By" [...] became [...] "There'll Be <b>Pie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> When You Die (That's a Lie)". From that start in exigency, Wobbly song writing became common because they [...] "articulated the frustrations, hostilities, and humor of the homeless and the dispossessed." [...] The IWW collected its official songs in the Little Red Songbook and continues to update this book to the present time. In the 1960s, the American folk music revival in the United States brought a renewed interest in the songs of Joe Hill and other Wobblies, and seminal folk revival figures such as Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie had a pro-Wobbly tone, while some were members of the IWW. Among the protest songs in the book are [...] "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum" [...] (this song was never popular among members), [...] "Union Maid", and [...] "I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night". Perhaps the best known IWW song is [...] "Solidarity Forever". The songs have been performed by dozens of artists, and Utah Phillips performed the songs in concert and on recordings for decades. Other prominent IWW songwriters include Ralph Chaplin who authored [...] "Solidarity Forever", and Leslie Fish.|$|E
