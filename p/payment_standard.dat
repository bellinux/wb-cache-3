40|$|The Nation’s number-one {{housing problem}} {{is the lack of}} {{affordable}} housing for extremely low-income households, particularly families with children. Housing vouchers directly mitigate this affordability problem. The flexibility inherent in the voucher program helps avoid the concentration of poor families by providing voucher holders with a broad choice of housing units. Moreover, vouchers continue {{to meet the needs of}} low-income families even as those needs change. As family size changes or economic opportunities arise in different locations, the voucher can be used for a new housing unit. This flexibility appears to have positive effects on adult employment and welfare receipt as well as on children’s health and educational outcomes.

To narrow {{urban and}} rural {{development}} gaps in recent years, realization of urban-rural endowment insurance integration is an important content of the reform of social security system in China. In recent years, China has continuously completed endowment insurance system, and expanded coverage groups of social insurance. Almost all urban employees were covered {{in the range of}} endowment insurance. Due to restraint from city-countryside dualization structure in China, {{urban and rural}} economic development is imbalanced. Rural endowment insurance system is different from urban endowment insurance system in terms of payment and delivery, which influences free circulation of labor to some extent. In this paper, the author centered on the theme of urban-rural endowment insurance integration, and proposed countermeasures for existing issues from the angles of <b>payment</b> <b>standard,</b> completion of pension insurance fund management and supervision enhancement based on current implementation conditions of endowment insurance system.

40|$|This article uses {{administrative}} data on families {{that participated in}} the U. S.

The most important results are that large decreases in the program’s <b>payment</b> <b>standard</b> and increases in the tenant contribution to rent will have small effects on program attrition. These results suggest that the overwhelming majority of voucher recipients receive substantial benefits from program participation. The empirical analysis also indicates that whether the head of the household is elderly and whether the head is disabled are by far the most important influences on the likelihood that the family will exit the tenant-based voucher program. Families with disabled heads of the household are about 37 percent less likely to exit the program and families with elderly heads of the household are about 23 percent less likely to exit the program each year than otherwise similar families. Differences in attrition rates based on other family characteristics are much smaller...|$|E

40|$|Background: In recent years, the {{prevalence}} of type 2 diabetes among Chinese population has been increasing by years, directly leading to an average annual growth rate of 19. 90 % of medical expenditure. Therefore, it is urgent to work on strategies to control the growth of medical expenditure on type 2 diabetes {{on the basis of}} the reality of China. Therefore, in this study, we explored the feasibility of implementing bundled payment in China through analyzing bundled <b>payment</b> <b>standards</b> of type 2 diabetes outpatient services. Methods: This study analyzed the outpatient expenditure on type 2 diabetes with Beijing Urban Employee's Basic Medical Insurance from 2010 to 2012. Based on the analysis of outpatient expenditure and its influential factors, we adopted decision tree approach to conduct a case-mix analysis. In the end, we built a case-mix model to calculate the standard expenditure and the upper limit of each combination. Results: We found that age, job status, and whether with complication were significant factors that influence outpatient expenditure for type 2 diabetes. Through the analysis of the decision tree, we used six variables (complication, age, diabetic foot, diabetic nephropathy, cardiac-cerebrovascular disease, and neuropathy) to group the cases, and obtained 11 case-mix groups. Conclusions: We argued that it is feasible to implement bundled payment on type 2 diabetes outpatient services. Bundled payment is effective to control the increase of outpatient expenditure. Further improvements are needed for the implementation of bundled <b>payment</b> reimbursement <b>standards,</b> together with relevant policies and measures...|$|R

40|$|When it was {{originally}} proposed, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) was hailed for its potential to contribute significantly to making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010. All national <b>payments</b> <b>standards</b> were supposed to disappear and be replaced by new SEPA standards, which would allow additional economies of scale and scope. After six years of intensive work on developing SEPA, however, and roughly 18 months before SEPA was due to have been completed (end of 2010), this ECRI Research Report finds that the SEPA process is in a crisis. The banks and their customers are reluctant to migrate to the new SEPA standards and some banks and banking associations are not persuaded that the benefits attributed by the European Commission to SEPA will materialise. The author, Professor Dr Jürgen Bott of the University of Applied Sciences of Kaiserslautern, argues that incentives are necessary to motivate service providers and users to change their current behaviour and to migrate to new service standards...|$|R

It analyses the need to develop <b>payment</b> <b>standards</b> and the content of payment instructions in order to fully automate the payment process. Since interbank settlements comprise an essential part of payments, they should be made an integral part of the payment process within the Internet environment. With cross-border payments increasing in importance, any new developments should take an international perspective. Payment system development requires cooperation between the banks and other participants involved. In order to build the necessary consensus, banking industry organizations as well as central banks and other regulators will need to work together to re-engineer the present payment systems, making full use of the possibilities created by modern technology. payment systems; settlement systems; RTGS; payment system integration...|$|R

We present a framework for understanding the evolution and transitions of payment platforms. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework in a in-­‐depth single case study of a prepaid cash card. The learning of past experience with digital payment platforms is demonstrated to be the right starting point for investigations into how new solutions might succeed or fail in the future. Thus we finally discuss how possible venues and routes of transitions appear in current evolution of digital payment platform...|$|R
