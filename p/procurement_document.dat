40|$|The {{results of}} a survey show that {{both public and private}} {{building}} clients in Sweden, to varying extents, include environmental requirements in their <b>procurement</b> <b>documents.</b> The requirements identified have been classified into six categories primarily related to building and demolition waste, building material, contractors' environmental work, ecological aspects, construction work and other. One conclusion is that requirements regarding the separation of waste and a contractor's environmental policy are considered important, since they are stipulated in the majority of projects. Another finding is that requirements related to operation and especially to energy use are not considered sufficiently. Structured interviews were conducted with three of the clients who at that time of the survey had developed the most complete <b>procurement</b> <b>documents</b> with regard to environmental requirements. The aim of the interviews was to investigate how the stipulation of requirements, the evaluation of environmental aspects and the verification of environmental requirements were carried out. The conclusion drawn is that Swedish clients find the stipulation of requirements relatively uncomplicated, but find the evaluation of environmental impact, mainly related to selection of materials, problematic due to inadequate evaluation models.

30|$|What other effects did the consultant’s report have? A {{civil servant}} at the {{regional}} cooperation body argued that the consultant’s report was crucial to {{the outcome of the}} <b>procurement</b> <b>document.</b> He stated that “The PTA bought everything in the report” [47]. In addition, the PTA president thought the consultant’s report was relevant, not in a way that changed the <b>procurement</b> <b>document,</b> but rather as it ensured that the process was on the right track. A local politician thought that the consultant’s report was an addition to the procurement report. He believed that the consultant’s report was more research based, which was also important to consider when conducting a procurement. Regarding the timing of the completion of the consultant’s report, the informant believed it was right: “We had time to reflect on the report when it wasn’t too old – we can’t use old data in these kinds of processes” [42]. One consequence of the consultant’s report, besides allowing the regional cooperation body to influence the procurement process, was that other actors (including the PTA) also used the report as a resource to gather political support for their decisions. Not only did the actor mobilizing power resources in the initial stage benefit from this resource mobilization, but other actors could also use the resources to their own benefit.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is to make {{recommendations}} concerning the improvement of public procurement law in Indonesia. The author identifies five fundamental problems commonly arising in the pre-contractual phase in Indonesia: the <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> may be prepared {{in a way that}} favours certain bidders, but it is questionable whether legal procedure to review the <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> is available; corruption may occur within procuring entities which may, in turn, lead to distrust towards the entities regarding its impartiality in relation to the handling of the administrative appeal; the reasons for awarding the contract may not be transparent; the procedures for seeking redress are erratic; finally, the availability of remedies is uncertain. The author adopts two methods for the pursuit of his research. First, three principles of good governance are discussed (equality, transparency and accountability), and five principles of good public procurement are identified. These five principles are outlined as: equal opportunity, equal treatment, transparency including its limitations to protect commercially sensitive information, clarity about the forum for redress, and the availability of effective remedies. Second, a comparative methodology is undertaken, examining the law relating to public procurement procedures in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. From these approaches, the author draws out recommendations for the legislature, the administration and the judiciary in Indonesia. Although this book concentrates on the case of Indonesia, ideas brought forth in the discussion may be applicable and useful to other countries sharing similar issues...|$|E

This report was then to be printed {{on behalf of the}} regional cooperation body and sent to all municipalities and the county council. The consulting firm made four alternative suggestions regarding the new traffic routing system, but was also required to analyse the alternative that the PTA had proposed in the <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> (this was a fifth alternative [43]). Thus, the regional cooperation body had hired a consulting firm to evaluate the alternative that the PTA had designed.|$|E

30|$|What effect did the consultant’s report have? Did the {{regional}} cooperation body manage {{to change the}} procurement content? One thing is for sure, the consultant’s report created confusion among several actors in the municipalities and among the politicians on the PTA board [45]. For example, one municipality {{did not know how}} to value the consultant’s report in relation to the opinions it was to give on the procurement documents [46]. A civil servant in one municipality stated that neither he nor “his” politicians had received any information about the consultant’s report until it was already complete. He was very surprised to hear about the report, and confused as to why and by whom it was prepared. This civil servant decided to call his colleagues in two other municipalities to discuss the consultant’s report. These three civil servants then turned to the PTA president and said that they needed more time to respond to the <b>procurement</b> <b>document,</b> if they were also to consider the conclusions of the consultant’s report [32]. The regional cooperation body stated that it would await their response [45].|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. Construction {{projects}} have developed over several decades through {{the advancement of}} technology, increased scarcity of resources and the ever increasing pressure of time and cost constraints. Because of new technology and modern construction methods, construction {{projects have}} become increasingly complex. These complexities inherently bring new risks that {{must be dealt with}} accordingly. A contract is the primary method through which risks are allocated between the Employer and the Contractor. The conditions allocating the risks legally bind both parties to accept responsibility of those risks, therefore {{it is important to understand}} the aspects of law that has bearing on contracts. In this thesis the scope is restricted to construction contracts. Because of the role that a contract plays, especially in the construction industry context, it is important to know the requirements of a modern contract to ensure the successful completion of projects and the continued sustainability of Employer-Contractor relationships. In South Africa, the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) is a body that monitors developments in the construction industry. The CIDB has the authority to enforce legislation to ensure that contracts conform to a standard that protects the interests of both the Employer and the Contractor. One of the procurement documents endorsed by the CIDB is the General Conditions of Contract for Construction Works published by the South African Institution of Civil Engineering (SAICE). The first edition of the GCC was published in 2004 (GCC 2004) and a revised second edition was published in 2010 (GCC 2010). In this study the GCC 2010 and the GCC 2004 are compared first through a content analysis, to establish the effect the revisions on the bias of the document (or favouring a particular party) and then by means of a survey. The objectives are: a. To test whether revisions to the GCC from the 2004 edition to the 2010 edition resulted in a change in bias (assuming it exists) and compliance with the requirements of the modern contract; b. To determine the extent and effect of alterations to standard clauses of the GCC 2010 on the way in which the contract favours a particular party; c. Providing recommendations for future revisions that would potentially improve project success, relationship building and reduce the need for significant alterations to the standard clauses. Although a construction contract is undertaken between the Employer and the Contractor, the Consultant (who is not party to the contract) commonly drafts the contract on behalf of the Employer. The findings of the study show that the revision had a significant impact on improving the clarity of the roles of the Employer and the Contractor. A marginal improvement was found in the area of payment operating mechanisms. The perceived fairness of the document neither increased nor decreased. Clauses on claims and disputes and risk and related matters were the two areas that respondents identified as having the most bias that may be detrimental to the success of a construction project. Despite survey respondents finding the GCC 2010 <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> to be fair, clauses are still altered by Employers (probably through Consultants) resulting in a biased contract favouring the Employer. Employers and Consultants should thus be educated more on bias and fairness in contracts and on the implications of shifting more risk to Contractors by altering clauses. Ultimately, the success of any construction project is dependent on the attitudes of the participants. Even the most fair <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> is not a substitute for a relationship built on honesty and trust...|$|E
30|$|The consultant’s report {{can be seen}} as a {{regional}} cooperation body attempt to influence the outcome of the <b>procurement</b> <b>document.</b> Notably, the report preparation was not kept secret from the PTA and the municipalities. The consultant’s report can also be seen as a tool for mobilizing political resources. To that end, a steering committee was connected to the report; it included two civil servants from the regional cooperation body, two civil servants from the PTA (the president and a civil servant, not the employee working on the procurement), two civil servants from two municipalities, and the head of the county council board (also a civil servant) [43]. So, besides mobilizing informational resources by hiring a consultant, the regional cooperation body invited strategically picked people to form a steering committee. The representatives were not geographically distributed over the county; for example, none of the municipalities in the south was represented on the steering committee, nor was the largest municipality represented (this municipality has the second-largest ownership share in the PTA after the county council). All the members of the steering committee were civil servants, and this group {{can be seen as}} exemplifying horizontal relationships among principals. When I asked the civil servants why they were elected to the steering committee, their answers differed. For example, the municipal representatives said that they were “forward thinking” and had regular contact with the regional cooperation body’s civil servants [38]. The other participants believed that they had been selected for their titles or roles, to insure that the report was supported by all the organizations involved in the procurement. The county council representative stated that he did not play an active role, and was often connected to various groups, without any requirement to “do” something [44].|$|E

40|$|The {{design-build}} (DB) {{project delivery}} system (PDS) {{has been widely}} applied and studied in the construction industry. Its advantages include shortened project duration, lowered risk to the owner, improved project performance, and possibly reduced cost. Researchers have also studied the factors related to the improved performance in DB projects, especially in the building and transportation industries. Compared to the building and highway industries, the application of DB in water/wastewater (WW) projects has been rarely studied before. One of the potential factors that may influence project performance is procurement duration (PD). By focusing on DB applied to WW projects, this study explored the relationship between PD (from Request for Proposal issue date to proposal due date) and project success. The project success criteria was defined as cost and schedule growth, which were objective measurements and thus provided more convincing data analysis. Project data was collected through an on-line questionnaire given to owners and design-builders who had experience in DB WW projects. The data was used to analyze how PD impacts project performance in terms of cost and schedule growth. The relationships between PD and performance in DB WW projects were compared to DB transportation projects. Both similarities and differences were found. To explore the reasons of these similarities and differences, content analysis was conducted to compare the DB WW and transportation <b>procurement</b> <b>documents.</b> Variables were defined and analyzed based on their frequency of use within <b>procurement</b> <b>documents.</b> Hypotheses were given based on {{the similarities and differences}} found between DB WW and transportation projects’ procurement items as to which might influence the project success.
