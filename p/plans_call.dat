A disjoint segment of MD32 was constructed on a new alignment from MD175 in Odenton to MD178 in Crownsville in the early 1970s. The Patuxent Freeway was built from Fort Meade to Columbia in the mid-1980s and from Fort Meade to Millersville in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

5|$|In {{a master}} plan from 2006, Avinor has {{identified}} several key development issues to increase {{the capacity of the}} airport. For Terminal A, the <b>plans</b> <b>call</b> to keep the existing structure, and gradually expand it westwards, eventually passing over the railway on a culvert. Along the area between the railway and the highway, a south pier is planned to be constructed, with the inside facing immediately towards the railway and the outside having aircraft stands. In the short term, this is planned with six stands for regional aircraft, with a single-story building. The remaining stands currently used for regional aircraft will then be converted to international gates. While Avinor states that there is need for an expansion of Terminal B, no concrete solution has been found, {{in part because of the}} lack of space in the area, although this can partially be fixed by removing the general aviation from the area.|$|E
5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced that it}} was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The <b>plans</b> <b>call</b> for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{commission}} {{announced plans}} to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this system, tolls will be paid with E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either method will be billed by mail (using license plate recognition), and a surcharge will be imposed. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission {{announced that it was}} implementing an all-electronic tolling plan. The turnpike commission will save $65million annually on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. <b>Plans</b> <b>call</b> for a 76-percent surcharge on motorists without E-ZPass who are billed by mail; this surcharge could raise the toll for a motorist without E-ZPass to well over $50 to travel the entire turnpike. On January 3, 2016, all-electronic tolling was introduced in the westbound direction at the Delaware River Bridge mainline toll plaza, while the eastern terminus of the ticket system was moved from the Delaware River Bridge to Neshaminy Falls.|$|E
