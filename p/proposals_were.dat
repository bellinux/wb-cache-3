5|$|Mouton's <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> {{taken seriously}} by, amongst others, the seventeenth-century {{scientists}} Jean Picard and Christiaan Huygens, but {{a hundred years}} were to elapse before the French again took interest in the underlying theory {{of the development of}} systems of measure.|$|E
5|$|These <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> {{rejected}} by the electorate of all departments involved {{with the exception of}} Arequipa. Thus, no merger was carried out.|$|E

5|$|Buckner {{proposed}} {{a number of}} progressive ideas, {{most of which were}} rejected by the legislature.

His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, {{the local}} {{authority}} began to systematically buy {{up all the}} stalls on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: stalls were arranged into parallel rows and a new City Hall was built along the entire {{western side of the}} marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant changes {{for the rest of the}} 20thcentury. By the 1990s, the market was becoming decrepit and, in 2003, <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of stalls, but replaced the old stalls with steel units of four stalls each. The rebuilt market was completed in early 2006 and is one of the largest markets in Britain.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} the Birch Spur Incline. This would have {{involved}} the line continuing from Summit to Birch Spur from where a rope-worked incline would convey traffic to the valley floor where the railway would continue through a narrow valley to the Wairarapa plains. The Public Works Department engineers investigating this <b>proposal</b> <b>were</b> unable to locate a suitable incline, so this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> also abandoned.|$|R
50|$|While this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{approved}} by Pershing, it met some resistance when {{it reached the}} Secretary of War. With an initial price tag of almost $800,000 just to open the field, the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> rejected by the Secretary of War on 19 May 1917. That same day the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> resubmitted with the additional argument that a facility such as the 3d AIC was critical {{to the development of}} the air forces that would accompany the A.E.F. to Europe. This time the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> accepted and by July 1917 the first Aero Construction Squadrons began to arrive in France.|$|R

5|$|Four main <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> {{suggested}} {{for the new}} fixed link. One involved a four-lane subsea tunnel, one involved building a second, two-lane bridge immediately adjacent to the current one, which would {{give the impression of}} a single bridge, another involved a new four-lane bridge slightly to the south, and the last involved a new bridge considerably further to the south, which would connect to County Road 557.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> made to re-open {{the line}} to Tryvandshøiden Station, so that the Tryvann Ski Resort would be more {{accessible}} to Oslo residents. Oslo Sporveier, the operator, turned down the proposals, arguing that it would cost about 3billion NOK to lay the tracks and put up overhead line equipment, {{and that it would}} not attract enough passengers.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation {{of local}} {{government}} in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two county boroughs (Belfast and Derry) by 26 single-tier districts, which, apart from Fermanagh cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as Lieutenancy. In November 2005, <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> announced which would see the number of local authorities reduced to seven.|$|E
50|$|A {{business}} <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> {{a written}} offer from a seller to a prospective buyer.Business <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> often a key {{step in the}} complex sales process—i.e., whenever a buyer considers more than price in a purchase.|$|R

25|$|The Workers' Party {{called for}} a No vote against the Treaty of Lisbon in both the June 2008 referendum, in which the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> defeated, and the October 2009 referendum, in which the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> approved.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> made {{to connect the}} tunnel with a free-flow, grade-separated {{motorway}} system {{as part of the}} London Ringways project. Aside from the construction of the A102(M) Blackwall Tunnel approach roads, opened in 1973, these plans were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Later in his career, Ford {{split with}} Huddleston's successor, Mitch McConnell, over a {{proposed}} settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies. Ford favored the package as presented to Congress, {{which would have}} protected the price support program, while McConnell favored a smaller aid package to tobacco farmers {{and an end to}} the price support program. Both <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> ultimately defeated, and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed.|$|E
5|$|Operation Sandwedge was a {{proposed}} clandestine intelligence-gathering operation against the political {{enemies of the}} Richard Nixon presidential administration. The <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> put together by H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Jack Caulfield in 1971. Caulfield, a former police officer, created a plan to target the Democratic Party and the anti-Vietnam War movement, inspired by what he {{believed to be the}} Democratic Party's employment of a private investigation firm.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, the owners, North Hill Estates Ltd, {{applied for}} {{planning}} permission to redevelop the site. The <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> for {{a mix of}} live/work units and residential accommodation. Further consultation on their <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> ongoing (2007).|$|R

5|$|Other <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> made in 1715, {{this time}} by the knight René Jacob de Tigné {{and a team of}} French engineers. There were several {{different}} plans, including building a coastal battery and a redoubt. Other plans included building a four-bastioned fort, or combining all three (fort, battery and redoubt) for the defence of the island.|$|E
5|$|<b>Proposals</b> <b>were</b> {{put forward}} in 2008 {{to expand the}} town with the {{building}} of 178 houses on Braidbar Quarries next to Huntly Park, involving the Park closing {{for a period of}} two years. However, following 2,000 objections from local people and the opposition of the Scottish Government's reporter, East Renfrewshire Council abandoned the plans in October 2011.|$|E
5|$|Several design <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> submitted, all {{calling for}} heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, {{financial}} limitations dictated that smaller, less expensive weaponry {{would be used}} instead. The final design therefore used the same 28cm(11in) double turret introduced {{for the last two}} s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E
5000|$|Consistency: what {{is bad for}} one <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> bad for all; find {{an adverse}} comment, then look at of the {{proposals}} of the other bidders {{and see if the}} same problem exists in there and was not written up in the evaluation for those <b>proposals.</b> What <b>is</b> good for one <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> good for all proposals (See above) ...|$|R
