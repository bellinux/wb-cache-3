5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be <b>permitted</b> <b>in</b> alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E
50|$|When Britain {{leaves the}} EU, {{citizens}} of the EU might need a work <b>permit</b> <b>in</b> the UK.

Without an EEA agreement, {{citizens of the}} EU will probably need work <b>permits,</b> <b>in</b> the same way as Swiss citizens who do need a permit, which other citizens like Serbians (Serbia is negotiating for EU membership) also need. Same principles will apply for Britons in EU countries as the other way around, that is depending on an EEA agreement.|$|R

Other variations included breaking a lift into two syllables, the first short but stressed, the second weak, with for instance 'vĕssel' in place of 'boat'.|$|E
5|$|Music was {{the least}} {{restricted}} of cultural activities, probably because Hans Frank regarded himself as a fan of serious music. In time, he ordered {{the creation of the}} Orchestra and Symphony of the General Government in its capital, Kraków. Numerous musical performances were <b>permitted</b> <b>in</b> cafes and churches, and the Polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist operas. Visual artists, including painters and sculptors, were compelled to register with the German government; but their work was generally tolerated by the underground, unless it conveyed propagandist themes. Shuttered museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes.|$|E

The match was played at the Launceston Racecourse ground, but the state of the ground was such that the umpires were unsure of the best place to pitch the wickets.
