40|$|For {{the last}} few years, the city of Macaé has been {{suffering}} an impact on urban traffic due to increasing in number of vehicles. Between December 2010 and June 2011, for example, {{there was an increase}} of 1, 974 cars (DETRAN-RJ, 2011).

30|$|Automatically {{controlled}} trains indeed consume {{less energy}} {{due to the}} optimized acceleration, traction, and braking processes, and it is reported that the energy consumption can be cut {{by as much as}} 30 % depending on the degree of automation [33]. In the operation experience of the Vancouver Sky-Train system [34], the energy consumption per <b>passenger-kilometer</b> is just less than half the average of the other systems since the braking process of train could be coordinated with other accelerating trains to enhance the usage of regenerative energy in DTO systems. Since the usage of the regenerative energy is strongly affected by the power supply system and the traffic density, the Singapore MRT operator introduced inverters at substations to recover the regenerative energy for station auxiliary loads. These inverters can recover up to 5 % of the total energy used by the urban rail transit systems [35].|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} full cost of three modes of {{intercity}} transportation: air, highway, and high speed rail for the California Corridor, connecting the Los Angeles Basin and the San Francisco Bay Area in order to compare the economic implications of investment in, or expansion of, any of these three modes.

High speed rail and highway transportation have approximately the same full cost; rail costs $ 0. 2350 /pkt and highway costs $ 0. 2302 /pkt.

40|$|Abstract: This article studies {{environmental}} and distributional effects from a differentiated tax system {{on a set}} of disaggregated transportation goods. Empirical examination on Norwegian data indicates that higher tax rates on high-pollution luxury modes of transportation such as air flights and taxis reduce inequality and increase the environmental quality. Lower tax rates on low-pollution necessary modes such as buses, bicycles, and mopeds reduce inequality and increase environmental quality. However, higher taxes on high-pollution necessities such as gasoline have favorable environmental effects, but increase inequality somewhat. Railway passenger transportation appears to be distributionally neutral. In order to interpret the estimates with respect to distributional and environmental concerns, we use a theory of distribution effects based on Engel, child, and adult elasticities and a wide range of empirical estimates of environmental hazards from transportation consumption. For different modes of transportation, we study emissions per <b>passenger-kilometer</b> and per monetary unit.

An unambiguous ranking of the specific climate impact can be established for freight transportation, with shipping and rail having lowest and light trucks and air transport having highest specific impact for all cases calculated.

40|$|The {{transportation}} {{sector is}} a leading source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide, {{and one of the}} most difficult to control. In developing countries, where vehicle ownership rates are considerably below the OECD average, transport sector emissions are poised to soar as income levels rise. This is especially true for China, whose imminent accession to the World Trade Organization will contribute to economic growth and could make consumer credit widely available for the first time. These factors are likely to accelerate automobile purchases, and GHG emissions. Shanghai is one of China's most dynamic cities. Extremely densely populated, with very low personal vehicle ownership rates for its income level, Shanghai is also home to a nascent Chinese automotive industry. Transportation plans and policies there are designed to achieve broader urban objectives of population decentralization, with an eye to controlling increases in traffic congestion and improving environmental quality. Because Shanghai's transportation system and planning process are so sophisticated, Shanghai may be a "best case" for controlling transportation sector GHG emissions in the absence of climate change mitigation goals. This report creates two scenarios of GHG emissions from Shanghai's transportation sector in 2020. It finds: •Greenhouse gas emissions quadruple in the low-GHG scenario; they increase sevenfold in the high scenario. On a <b>passenger-kilometer</b> basis, the estimated increase ranges from 10 to 100 percent. •Providing an array of high-quality options to travelers can help meet the demand for transportation services while keeping traffic congestion in check and meeting other urban objectives. •Special lanes and other infrastructure to accommodate vehicles such as buses, minicars, and bicycles can save money and improve traffic circulation. •Using clean technology and fuels in motorized vehicles lowers the environmental impact of various transportation modes. •Perfecting the use of "intelligent" traffic control systems through improved coordination will yield higher returns on capital investments...|$|E
40|$|Automobile {{systems and}} public {{transportation}} are often organized separately within government structure inhibiting a comparative analysis {{between the two}} modes. Further complicating the comparison is that in public transportation systems, not only is infrastructure but vehicles and operators are usually provided by government or contracted private sector partners, while in the automobile system, infrastructure is normally government owned but costs of vehicle ownership and operation and parking are private. However, these private actions have enormous costs. In total in FY 2004 - 05 in London, private automobile spending was over 14 times greater than public automobile spending, as public spending on the automobile was about £ 1. 4 billion while private spending on the automobile was about £ 20. 9 billion. For public transportation, public spending was about £ 2. 0 billion while private spending was about £ 2. 3 billion. On a normalized basis, when not including time costs, the automobile was 3. 7 times more expensive than public transportation on a per trip basis, and 2. 0 times more expensive on a per <b>passenger-kilometer</b> basis. When including time costs and segmenting trips by travel zone, we found that public transportation enjoys an advantage for all travel zone combinations, with the advantage being the greatest for trips between outer London and inner London and for trips within inner London. At the household level, we estimated that households well-served by public transportation spend 15 to 18 percent less out-of-pocket on transportation than the average London household, although these savings are outweighed by additional time costs. From our findings in this research, we see significant opportunity for the London region to achieve a more cost-efficient transportation system. First, measures should be pursued to increase the share of variable automobile costs {{as a percentage of}} total costs. Policy such as pay-as-you-drive insurance and road pricing or policy inducing greater awareness of parking costs would help shift the burden. Second, public authorities should consider the private expenditures on automobiles and parking, as they are relatively large compared to the public spending on automobiles, when allocating resources between transportation modes. by Tejus Jitendra Kothari.
