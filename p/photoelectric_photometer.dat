5000|$|In 1891 Goodsell Observatory was {{equipped}} with a 16.2 in telescope produced by the famous John Brashear of Pennsylvania. It was then the twelfth-largest refractor {{in the world and}} sixth-largest in the United States. The old observatory was made into a library and then torn down to make room for Laird Hall in 1905. The observatory acquired a sidereal clock in 1910. [...] In 1922 Carleton professor Edward Fath constructed one of the nation's first <b>photoelectric</b> <b>photometers</b> in Goodsell.

50|$|The Wisconsin Experiment Package had eleven {{different}} telescopes for ultraviolet observations. For example, {{there was}} a <b>photoelectric</b> <b>photometer</b> fed by a 16-inch telescope with a six-position filter wheel. WEP observed over 1200 targets in ultraviolet light before the mission ended in early 1973.|$|E
50|$|The telescopes at the {{observatory}} had started with relatively modest focal plane instruments {{and later on}} graduated to more sophisticated ones.

40|$|The November 13, 1984 {{occultation}} of BD + 08 deg 0471 {{was discovered}} during a photographic search {{carried out with}} the 0. 5 meter Carnegie Double Astrograph at Lick Observatory and the Lowell Observatory PDS microdensitometer. Such a search was stimulated by the curious fact that few favorably located occultations of AGK 3 or SAO catalog starts by Ceres will occur during the 1980 s. The occultation on November 13, however, is a particularly good event. The star is 1000 cubic M in V, yielding a predicted drop at occultation of about 10 percent. Such a drop can be detected by small telescopes equipped with <b>photoelectric</b> <b>photometers,</b> but {{is too small to}} be seen visually. The track was predicted to cross the Caribbean, Florida, southern Texas, and Mexico. Based on this prediction, preparations were made to observe the event in Mexico using four portable occultation data systems...|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{selenium}} cell photometer was proving successful, {{it was difficult}} to use and not very sensitive. Illinois physics professor Jakob Kunz suggested that Stebbins try a photoelectric cell. Kunz had been doing experimentation on an improved photoelectric cell which was alkali based.

5000|$|The {{observatory}} {{operates a}} one-metre-diameter Boller and Chivens telescope, {{which is a}} wide-field Ritchey-Chrétien reflector mounted on a rigid, off-axis equatorial mount. This telescope was originally a twin of the Las Campanas 1 m Swope telescope http://www.ociw.edu/lco/swope/swope.html, which was described by Bowen and Vaughan (1973), though the two instruments diverged somewhat during the years. It also has two CCD cameras, a two-star [...] "Nather-type" [...] photometer, a [...] "Faint-object spectrograph-camera" [...] (FOSC), and an older Boller and Chivens spectrograph.

40|$|During the 1980 Saturn apparition, UBV pinhole {{scans of}} the disk were {{obtained}} with a <b>photoelectric</b> area-scanning <b>photometer.</b> An analysis of these data reveals that the atmosphere of Saturn can be represented by a finite clear H 2 layer overlying a semiinfinite absorbent aerosol haze. The extent of the clear H 2 region appears to be latitude-dependent; the H 2 column density varies systematically from about 15 km-am over the equatorial and polar regions to about 31 km-am at temperate latitudes. A previous conclusion that the aerosol haze is strongly absorbent in the UV is confirmed; its effective U-band single-scattering albedo is about 0. 4.

50|$|Kunz made {{significant}} contributions to construction of photoelectric cells improving on the methods introduced by Elster and Geitel. During the fall of 1911, he began a collaboration and friendship with the University of Illinois Observatory director Joel Stebbins that would revolutionize astronomical photometry. Kunz’s photoelectric cells were many times more sensitive that what was available commercially and therefore able to detect faint star light. Kunz’s cells would be used at half a dozen observatories all across the nation including Yerkes Observatory, Lick Observatory, and Washburn Observatory. Kunz also accompanied Stebbins and four solar eclipse expeditions beginning with the Solar_eclipse_of_June_8,_1918 to measure the total light of the solar corona with the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>photometer.</b> The collaboration between Stebbins and Kunz continued until Kunz’s death in 1938.|$|E
50|$|The first direct {{measurement}} of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of {{the stars in the}} heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W. Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements. The first {{solution to the problem of}} deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.The twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool.

40|$|Context. The {{study of}} apsidal motion in {{detached}} eclipsing binary systems {{is known to}} be an important source of information about stellar internal structure as well as the possibility of verifying of General Relativity outside the Solar System. Aims. As part of the long-term Ondřejov and Ostrava observational projects, we aim to measure precise times of minima for eccentric eclipsing binaries, needed for the accurate determination of apsidal motion, providing a suitable test of the effects of General Relativity. Methods. About seventy new times of minimum light recorded with <b>photoelectric</b> or CCD <b>photometers</b> were obtained for ten eccentric-orbit eclipsing binaries with significant relativistic apsidal motion. Their O–C diagrams were analysed using all reliable timings found in the literature, and new or improved elements of apsidal motion were obtained. Results. We confirm very long periods of apsidal motion for all systems. For BF Dra and V 1094 Tau, we present the first apsidal-motion solution. The relativistic effects are dominant, representing up to 100 % of the total observable apsidal-motion rate in several systems. The theoretical and observed values of the internal structure constant k 2 were compared for systems with lower relativistic contribution. Using the light-time effect solution, we predict a faint third component for V 1094 Tau orbiting with a short period of about 8 years...|$|R
