5|$|The hoard was {{acquired}} by the British Museum in April 1994. As the Museum's entire <b>purchase</b> <b>fund</b> amounted to only £1.4 million at the time, the hoard had to be purchased {{with the assistance of}} donors that included the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the National Art Collections Fund (now the Art Fund), and the J. Paul Getty Trust. The grants from these and other benefactors enabled the museum to raise the £1.75 million needed for the acquisition.|$|E
25|$|The National Treatment <b>Purchase</b> <b>Fund</b> (NTPF) {{was set up}} in 2002 {{for those}} waiting over three months for an {{operation}} or procedure, and as a result over 135,000 patients on waiting lists have been treated so far. The NTPF involves the government paying for public patients to be treated for free in a private hospital in Ireland, or sometimes abroad if necessary. The NTPF has reduced waiting times for procedures to an average of between two and five months (with the average in 2009 being 2.4 months), compared to between two and five years in 2002. There are cases where essential care is needed urgently but not made available by the HSE under their NTPF, and contrary to relevant judgements by the European Court of Justice.|$|E

40|$|Resource <b>purchasing</b> <b>funds</b> {{have become}} a major tool for {{environmental}} protection and resource conservation. These funds use various strategies to target resources for conserva-tion, the choice of which may lead to striking differences in environmental performance. This paper develops an analytical framework to analyze the impact of alternative targeting strategies on different interest groups, including consumers, producers, labor, and environ-mentalists. We show that ignoring the output price effect of <b>purchasing</b> <b>funds</b> reduces environmental gain {{and in some cases}} may make a <b>purchasing</b> <b>fund</b> counterproductive, and we argue that the optimal design of targeting criteria must consider the price feedback effect. 2001 Academic Press Key Words: conservation funds; distributional effects; environmental benefits; targeting strategies. ‘‘You want to save the environment?

2500|$|MyFC was {{engineered}} by former football journalist Will Brooks. [...] Brooks initially estimated MyFC's <b>purchase</b> <b>fund</b> at £1,375,000 if 50,000 people were {{to sign up}} as members. All members have voting rights on certain decisions in the club purchased by MyFC and they will collectively manage that club, by making many of the decisions usually made by the manager and others, through a voting system on the MyFootballClub website. However, they do not actually hold any shares. The watershed figure of 50,000 registrations expressing interest in participation was passed on 31 July 2007, {{with a total of}} 53,051 registrations completed at that time. At that point, MyFC began collecting payments from those who had registered as well as any new people who signed up subsequently, opening what MyFootballClub described as [...] "phase 2". [...] Paid-up members would participate in a non-binding vote on takeover preference, with Leeds United initially leading the member voting, followed by Cambridge United and Nottingham Forest.|$|E
