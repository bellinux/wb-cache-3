5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the <b>plumed</b> prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E
40|$|The {{entrainment}} {{processes of}} a rising mantle <b>plume</b> are investigated using high-resolution numerical modelling and analogue laboratory experiments. It is {{found that the}} ascending <b>plume</b> is enveloped in a <b>plume</b> sheath that effectively blocks entrainment into the <b>plume</b> core region, indicating that the chemical heterogeneity of <b>plumes</b> is predominantly inherited at the <b>plume</b> source region. Distinct spatial regions within the deep <b>plume</b> source region are preserved as distinct vertical stripes within the <b>plume</b> core. Interaction between the rising <b>plume</b> and sharp viscosity interfaces in the mantle can result in massive distortion and deformation of the <b>plume</b> head {{as well as the}} stripping off of the protective <b>plume</b> sheath, leading to a remarkably complex compositional structure of the <b>plume</b> and to increased sampling of specific regions in the mantle through entrainment. keine dt. -spr.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{compositional}} discontinuities of density and viscosity in the Earth's mantle on the ascent of mantle <b>plume</b> heads is studied using a boundary integral numerical technique. Three specific problems are considered: (1) a <b>plume</b> head rising {{away from a}} deformable interface, (2) a <b>plume</b> head passing through an. interface, and (3) a <b>plume</b> head approaching {{the surface of the}} Earth. For the case of a <b>plume</b> attached to a free-surface, the calculated time-dependent <b>plume</b> shapes are compared with experimental results. Two principal modes of <b>plume</b> head deformation are observed: <b>plume</b> head elongation or the formation of a cavity inside the <b>plume</b> head. The inferred structure of mantle <b>plumes,</b> namely, a large <b>plume</b> head with a long tail, is characteristic of <b>plumes</b> attached to their source region, and also of buoyant material moving away from an interface and of buoyant material moving through an interface from a high- to low-viscosity region. As a rising <b>plume</b> head approaches the upper mantle, most of the lower mantle will quickly drain from the gap between the <b>plume</b> head and the upper mantle if the <b>plume</b> head enters the upper mantle. If the <b>plume</b> head moves from a high- to low-viscosity region, the <b>plume</b> head becomes significantly elongated and, for the viscosity contrasts thought to exist in the Earth, could extend from the 670 km discontinuity to the surface. <b>Plume</b> heads that are extende...|$|R
40|$|We perform two {{and three}} {{dimensional}} numerical simulations of <b>plume</b> formation in density and viscosity stratified fluid systems.

By studying the geometry of the line <b>plumes</b> and the flow in the circulation cells, we discuss the mechanisms of their formation and the dynamics of merging.

5|$|The siege at the Peñol de Cerquín {{dragged on}} for months, with {{constant}} fighting. The Spanish there numbered about a hundred, plus auxiliaries, but were unable to maintain supply lines through the surrounding hostile territory, and were often short of food. The seasonal rains that arrived in spring 1538 only added to their hardship. The supplies from El Salvador finally arrived, and Cáceres slowly gained territory around the Peñol. After six months, Cáceres invited Lempira to a parley. Lempira arrived, dressed in full regalia, cotton armour, and <b>plumed</b> headdress, accompanied by a retinue of nobles. Cáceres sent a mounted soldier to request his surrender, and when Lempira refused, a carefully hidden arquebusier shot him through the head. This was a signal for an all-out surprise attack by the Spanish. The Indians responded with complete panic at {{the death of their}} leader, and the Spanish onslaught swiftly took the fortress without any Spanish loss of life, although some were wounded. A portion of the indigenous garrison retreated to nearby mountains, but most of the Indians surrendered without further resistance, including a great many women, children and elderly. Cáceres followed Montejo's instructions in dealing with the defeated natives with moderation. He followed native custom and sent gifts of textiles and fowls to the native leaders, as a symbol of peace, accompanied by a spear as a promise of war should they refuse to submit. After a council, the Indian leaders accepted peace, and the region passed immediately under Spanish control. Cáceres released all his prisoners to return to their villages, a move that surprised the natives, who had expected harsh punitive measures. The fall of Lempira's stronghold was followed by the speedy capitulation of a wide area of Honduras, and came at a critical juncture for the Spanish, when they had been at the point of losing the province.|$|E

30|$|Hot {{ascending}} <b>plumes</b> become, however, less prominent as Mp increases: At Mp=[*] 2, the {{convective flow}} induced by hot <b>plumes</b> {{is still an}} important element of the convection in the mantle. The excess temperature of the heads of hot <b>plumes</b> with respect to the surrounding mantle is, however, smaller than that calculated at Mp=[*] 1 shown in Fig.  1 a. At Mp=[*] 4 and 6, the excess temperature of hot <b>plume</b> heads becomes even smaller. Hot <b>plumes</b> become faint except around the core–mantle boundary, and the heads are often detached from the stems of hot <b>plumes</b> before they ascend {{to the base of the}} top TBL. The excess temperature of hot <b>plumes</b> rapidly decreases as they ascend, while cold descending <b>plumes</b> are prominent at all depths. At Mp=[*] 9.4, hot <b>plumes</b> become almost invisible, while cold descending <b>plumes</b> are still conspicuous. The effects of adiabatic compression on temperature contrast between <b>plumes</b> and the surrounding mantle are more conspicuous for hot <b>plumes</b> than for cold <b>plumes,</b> because the effect is proportional to the temperature (Eq.  4).|$|R

Furthermore, the LES data {{were used to assess}} the behavior of the entrainment coefficient, the momentum amplification factor, and the bubble-to-momentum spread ratio. It is found that bubble <b>plumes</b> with constant bubble size and smaller diameter behave in accordance with integral <b>plume</b> models. <b>Plumes</b> comprising larger and non-uniform bubble sizes appear to deviate from past observations and model predictions. In multi-diameter bubble <b>plumes,</b> a bubble self-organisation takes place, i. e., small bubbles cluster {{in the center of the}} <b>plume</b> whilst large bubbles are found at the periphery of the <b>plume.</b> Multi-diameter bubble <b>plumes</b> also feature a greater entrainment rate than single-size bubble <b>plumes,</b> as well as a higher spread ratio and lower turbulent momentum rate. Once the <b>plume</b> is fully established, the size of the diffuser does not appear to affect integral properties of bubble <b>plumes.</b> However, <b>plume</b> development is affected by the diffuser width, as larger release areas lead to a delayed asymptotic behavior of the <b>plume</b> and consequently to a lower entrainment and higher spread ratio.
