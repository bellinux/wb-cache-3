40|$|Palynologic {{samples for}} this study were {{collected}} in April of 1975 at the Hawthorne and Minnehaha Mines near Linton and Dugger, Indiana, respectively. All samples were taken from the Coal No. 7 and the overlying shale. A total of eighty-three species assigned to thirty-one genera were recovered. Sixty-six species assigned to twenty-nine genera were recovered from the Hawthorne Mine and forty-seven species assigned to twenty-three genera were recovered from the Minnehaha Mine. Comparison of the palynomorph floras of the two localities reveals twenty-one genera and thirty-three species in common to both mines. <b>Palynologic</b> <b>data</b> from the sample area reveals two slightly different depositional basins. The ecology of the area was probably a coastal-swamp type of environment with an abundance of arborescent lepidodendrids. Ball State UniversityMuncie, IN 47306 Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|Several {{examples}} yield that in {{the vicinity}} of Jan 6 w Podlaski (Eastern Poland), the older Quaternary is represented by preglacial (pre-Pleistocene) deposits, superimposing Oligocene and Upper Cretaceous sediments. Gla-ciogenic series ofthe Sanian 1 and Sanian 2 Glaciations, separated by fluvial deposits of the Ferdynandovian Interglacial occur above them. The younger of the mentioned series is overlain by lacustrine deposits with <b>palynologic</b> <b>data</b> representing the Mazovian Interglacial and the early glacial of the Liviecian Glaciation, as well as probably the lowermost part of the Zb 6 jnian Interglacial. These sediments are covered by the youngest in the area gla-ciogenic series (or their residua) corresponding to the Odranian and/or Wartanian Glaciations. The younger Quaternary is represented by fluvial deposits of suprainudation terraces accumulated during the Eemian Intergla-cial and the Vistulian Glaciation, {{as well as by the}} Holocene tidal flats and sediments occurring at floors of tributary river Valleys...|$|E
40|$|Unusual fossil macrofloras from South America (Peru, Bolivia, Brazil), Africa (Niger), India, and Australia are {{distinctly}} different {{from both the}} Early and Late Carboniferous floras of Gondwana. These floras can be correlated with each other based on macrofloral and palynologic composition, and dated as Late Visean to earliest Serpukhovian through <b>palynologic</b> <b>data</b> from several floras and isotopic data from Australia. The floras are dominated by pteridosperm foliage and characterized by the occurrence of tree-lycopsids, and represent a warm-temperate, frost-free floral belt in Gondwana that reached from 30 8 to as far as 60 8 South that existed directly {{before the onset of}} the major episode of the Carboniferous glaciation. The plants lived during an interval of very warm climate as indicated by the width and extent of the floral belt, conditions that facilitated the migration of plants into this area {{from other parts of the}} globe. The term Paraca floral realm is redefined and extended to include all of these Late Visean-earliest Serpukhovian floras throughout Gondwana...|$|E
40|$|The Wrangell Mountains basin {{consists}} of ∼ 7, 000 m of Upper Triassic-Upper Cretaceous sedimentary strata that depositionally overlie the allochthonous Wrangellia composite terrane in southern Alaska. The well-exposed sedimentary strata provide a valuable long-term record of tectonic processes and basin development associated with {{translation of the}} Wrangellia composite terrane from an intraoceanic setting at low paleolatitudes (∼ 12 °N) to its present position along the continental margin of southern Alaska (∼ 61 °N). New sedimentologic, geochronologic, compositional, and structural data document five stages of basin development: (1) Lithofacies associations indicate that Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic sedimentation occurred on a northward-dipping carbonate platform that probably formed in response to thermal subsidence of an underlying volcanic platform. (2) Lithofacies associations, sandstone framework modes, and northward-directed paleocurrent indicators suggest that Middle to Late Jurassic sedimentation was largely a product of volcanic processes in a backarc basin located northward of a coeval intraoceanic arc. (3) Cross-cutting relationships, provenance data, and a new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar date (152. 8 ± 1. 1 Ma) from an granitic clast of an Upper Jurassic conglomerate demonstrate that Late Jurassic sedimentation occurred synchronous with thrust-fault deformation in a retroforeland basin. (4) Lithofacies distributions, southward-directed paleocurrent indicators, and southward-thickening of sedimentary strata across intrabasinal normal faults indicate that Early to Late Cretaceous deposition occurred by trenchward- (southward-) prograding marine deposystems in an extensional forearc basin. (5) The final stage of basin development was characterized by coarse-grained sedimentation (MacColl Ridge Formation) along the trenchward (southern) margin of a compressional forearc basin. New palynological data and Ar-Ar radiometric dates (79. 4 ± 0. 7 Ma and 77. 9 ± 2. 1 Ma) indicate that the MacColl Ridge Formation was deposited during the late middle to late Campanian. Sediment gravity flows deposited sediment on arcward- (northward-) prograding submarine fans. New <b>palynologic</b> and paleomagnetic <b>data</b> indicate that the Wrangellia composite terrane was positioned at northerly paleolatitudes (∼ 40 °– 65 °N) during the Campanian (∼ 80 Ma). Regional integration of new geologic data from the Wrangell Mountains baste located along the outboard margin of the Wrangellia composite terrane, and the Nutzotin basin, located on the inboard margin of the Wrangellia composite terrace delineates distinct changes in the locations and tectonic setting of depocenters, the nature of intrabasinal structures, and the composition of detritus throw time. These variations are interpreted as recording discrete tectonic events that shy the northwestern Cordillera. ...|$|R
30|$|The Lengdong area {{is located}} {{to the north}} of the Lenghu {{structural}} belt (Fig.  2 a). Uplift in the late Cretaceous resulted in the erosion or non-deposition of the Late Cretaceous and entire Jurassic strata in the Lengdong area. The Cenozoic sequences of the basin have been precisely constrained and defined by lithostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic, seismic stratigraphic and <b>palynologic</b> <b>data</b> (Zhao et al. 2018). The Paleogene and Neogene stratigraphy in the Lengdong area can be divided into five formations, namely, from the base to the top, Lower Jurassic rock (J 1), the Paleocene and Eocene Lulehe Formation (E 1 [*]+[*] 2), the Oligocene Lower Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 31) and Upper Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 32), the Miocene Shangganchaigou Formation (N 1) and the Pliocene Xiayoushashan Formation (N 21) (Fig.  2 b). The target formation of this study is the Xiaganchaigou (E 3) Formation, which is the major oil-bearing formation in this area. The Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 3) is extensively developed in the Lengdong area, with an average thickness of 300 meters. The Lower Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 31) consists of brownish-red sandstones intercalated with siltstones. The Upper Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 32) comprises gray–green and gray sandstone interbedded with gray and dark gray mudstones (Tian et al. 2018).|$|E
40|$|The Garonne River {{developed}} through the Quaternary a huge network of asymmetric strath terraces. The last terrace is contemporary {{to the last}} glaciation. The mapping of the paleochannels preserved below the last Terrace of the Garonne River (southwest of France), by mean of remote sensing based on aerial photographs and field data, allows us to investigate the factors controlling factors of the transition braiding meandering related {{to the end of}} the last glaciation in the Pyrenees. Three channels patterns preserved in the infill of the lowest terrace of the Garonne River, could be evidenced. In chronological order, these patterns are: 1 - braided channels before 30 ka, 2 - low sinuosity gravel meandering channels until 15 ka and 3 - high sinuosity gravel meandering channels before the end of the Younger Dryas. The available datings and <b>palynologic</b> <b>data</b> allow us to link this changes in fluvial morphology {{to the end of the}} last glaciation in the Pyrenees. The braided/meandering transition occurred 30 ka ago and the sinuosity sharply increased after 14 ka. This transition, in the context of the glaciar retreat in the upstream Garonne valley is the result of interplay between vegetation and hydrologic regime of the river, which evolved from a glacial regime with high water stage in spring/summer to a pluvio-nival regime with high water stage in winter/spring leaving uncovered gravel bars by the time of vegetation germination...|$|E
40|$|Great Salt Lake level {{fluctuations}} from 13, 000 yr B. P. to {{the present}} were interpreted by examination of shoreline geomorphic features, shoreline deposits, archeologic sites, isotopic data, and <b>palynologic</b> <b>data.</b> After {{the conclusion of the}} Bonneville paleolake cycle, between 13, 000 and 12, 000 yr B. P. the lake regressed to levels low enough to deposit a littoral oxidized red bed stratum and a pelagic Glauber 2 ̆ 7 s salt layer. A late Pleistocene lake cycle occurred between 12, 000 and 10, 000 yr B. P. depositing several beaches, the highest reaching an altitude of about 4250 ft (1295. 3 m). The lake regressed after 10, 000 yr B. P., only to rise to 4230 ft (1289. 2 m) between 9700 and 9400 yr B. P. and then gradually lower at least 15 ft (4. 5 m) or more. Lake levels fluctuated between 4212 and 4180 ft (1284 and 1274 m) for the next 4000 years. A late Holocene lake cycle, constrained by radiocarbon ages between 3440 and 1400 yr B. P., is reported at a highest static level of 4221 ft (1286. 5 m). After a lake level drop to altitudes ranging between 4210 and 4205 ft (1283. 2 and 1281. 6 m), a 4217 ft (1285. 7 m) level was reached after 400 yr B. P. This level lowered to 4214 ft (1284. 4 m) in the mid to late 1700 s A. D. The lake levels have since stabilized around a 4200 ft (1280 m) mean...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 40 years colluvial and {{alluvial}} deposits {{have been used}} in Brazil as good indicators of regional landscape sensitivity to Quaternary environmental changes. In spite of the low resolution of most of the continental sedimentary record, geomorphology and sedimentology may favor palaeoenvironmental interpretation when supported by independent proxy data. This paper presents results obtained from pedostratigraphic sequences, in near-valley head sites of southern Brazilian highlands, based on geomorphologic. sedimentologic, micromorphologic, isotopic and <b>palynologic</b> <b>data.</b> Results point to environmental changes, with ages that coincide with Marine Isotopic Stages (MIS) 5 b; 3; 2 and 1. During the late Pleistocene, although under temperatures and precipitation lower than today, the local record points to relatively wet local environments, where shallow soil-water saturated zones contributed to erosion and sedimentation during periods of climatic change, as during the transition between MIS 2 and MIS 1. Late Pleistocene events with ages that coincide with the Northern Hemisphere Younger Dryas are also depicted. During the mid Holocene, slope-wash deposits suggest a climate drier than today, probably under the influence of seasonally contrasted precipitation regimes. The predominance of overland flow-related sedimentary deposits suggests an excess of precipitation over evaporation that influenced local palaeohydrology. This environmental condition seems to be recurrent and explains how slope morphology had influenced pedogenesis and sedimentation in the study area. Due to relative sensitiveness, resilience and short source-to-sink sedimentary pathways, near-valley head sites deserve further attention in Quaternary studies in the humid tropics.
