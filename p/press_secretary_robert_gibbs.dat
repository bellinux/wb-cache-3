The president's nominee, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, was still awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate until passing on April 28.

The next day they retracted the statements, saying that the system had in fact [...] "failed miserably." [...] According to Napolitano, her initial statement had referred to the rapid response to the attack that included alerts sent to the 128 other aircraft in U.S. airspace at the time, and new security requirements for the final hour of flight, rather than the security failures that allowed the attack to happen. Napolitano had originally stated on This Week that [...] "once this incident occurred, everything went according to clockwork" [...] and that [...] "once the incident occurred, the system worked".|$|E

In subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by The Washington Post, he said, [...] "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things if I got out."

500|$|It {{took some}} time for the {{cautious}} Obama and the blunt, rambling Biden to work out {{ways of dealing with}} each other. In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction from the White House. [...] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes, and led to a spate of late-night television jokes themed on him being a loose-talking buffoon. [...] In the face of persistently rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had [...] "misread how bad the economy was" [...] but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. [...] The same month, Secretary of State Clinton quickly disavowed Biden's remarks disparaging Russia as a power, but despite any missteps, Biden still retained Obama's confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration. On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was [...] "a big fucking deal" [...] during live national news telecasts. White House <b>press</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs</b> replied via Twitter [...] "And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right..." [...] Senior Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett said that Biden's loose talk [...] " [...] part of what makes the vice president so endearing ... We wouldn't change him one bit." [...] Former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham said, [...] "If there were no gaffes, there'd be no Joe. He's someone you can't help but like." [...] Biden gained a long-running alter ego persona, [...] "The President of Vice", on the satirical news site The Onion, which parodied his job title. [...] Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor's {{nomination}} won {{praise from}} Democrats and liberals, and Democrats {{appeared to have}} sufficient votes to confirm her. The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms {{in a number of}} her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture: [...] "I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life." [...] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time. The remark now became widely known. The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a [...] "racist" [...] (although the latter later backtracked from that claim), while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling. Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark, and White House <b>Press</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs</b> stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been [...] "poor". Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, [...] "ultimately and completely" [...] a judge follows the law regardless of personal background. Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in Ricci v. DeStefano received the most attention during the early nomination discussion, motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case. In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29. A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo and was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation of Second Amendment rights. [...] Some of the fervor with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.|$|E
