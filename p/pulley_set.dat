5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the railway tracks was to {{facilitate}} the transport of provisions for the keepers and fuel for the light (paraffin, at that date; the light consumed twenty barrels a year) up the steep gradients from the landing places {{by means of a}} cable-hauled railway. This was powered by a small steam engine in a shed adjoining the lighthouse. A track descended from the lighthouse in a westerly direction and then curved round to the south. In the approximate centre of the island it forked by means of a set of hand-operated points humorously dubbed [...] "Clapham Junction"; one branch continued in its curvature to head eastwards to the east landing place, on the south-east corner of the island, thus forming a half-circle, while the other, slightly shorter, branch curved back to the west to serve the west landing, situated in a small inlet on the island's south coast. The final approaches to the landing stages were extremely steep. The cable was guided round the curves by <b>pulleys</b> <b>set</b> between the rails, and a line of posts set outside the inner rail prevented it from going too far astray should it jump off the pulleys. The cargo was carried in a small four-wheeled bogie.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{how to make}} a finite element model of a scooter CVT. This finite element model will be made in ABAQUS. To check the results from the ABAQUS model an experimental CVT test setup is used. While making a model, different in fluences will be studied and simplified to make a simple but effective model for studying rubber belt CVTs. First some material test are done to achieve the material properties of the belt. The properties of the pulleys and boss are achieved from the manufacturer. From the measurements can be concluded, that the belts material is anisotropic and viscoelastic in the longitudinal direction. Because the belt will be simulated as isotropic and the material behavior in the longitudinal direction is most important, an isotropic viscoelastic model should be used. The reason for choosing isotropic instead of anisotropic is due to its complexity and lack of time. The other parts will be simulated as analytical rigid due to its 200 times larger Young's modulus. The simulation is split into 5 steps, it starts with a model where forces or stresses are not present, converted into a model where the pulleys are rotating and the belt is clamped. The elements used for the model are 20 -node quadratic bricks with reduced integration. To see the difference between the effects, different models are made. The details that are researched in this paper are: - The geometry of the modeled belt - Material behavior (viscoelastic/elastic) - Misalignment of the <b>pulley</b> <b>sets</b> - Symmetric/Asymetric model To see the difference and compare the results of the experiments, 6 models are made. After studying the results of the experiments and the models, {{it became clear that the}} in fluence of the torque on the effciency has the same behavior in the simulation as in the experiments. Only the in uence of the speed on the effciency is not visible in the results. To see the effects of the different details which are investigated, the mean effciency is compared between the models. The highest in uence on the effciency is the belt shape. The in uence of the cogs on the effciency was 3. 7 % on average. The in fluence of viscoelastic and misalignment were respectively 0. 89 % and 0. 33 %, which are remarkably low. In the model with cogs, only simple square cogs are used to compare against a model without cogs. Probably when a exact copy of the belt shape was used even a larger effciency increase was noticed. The difference between a symmetric or asymmetric model in mean effciency is small, only 2 %. When a model without misalignment, clearance and exact pulley positions is suffcient a symmetric model is preferred because of its lower computational costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{parallel}} hybrid-vehicle system {{discussed here}} features two mechanisms: an internal-combustion-engine energy-distribution mechanism and dual energy-integration mechanism. The former comprises a first <b>pulley</b> <b>set</b> {{and a second}} <b>pulley</b> <b>set,</b> whereby {{it is possible to}} adjust its radius ratio and change the road surface oriented output load, output speed and required load, to maintain an optimal operating state for the internal-combustion engine at a given generator rotational speed. In this way, the engine can be maintained in an optimal state. For the dual energy-integration mechanism, any power source can be individually actuated by an electric motor and the power transmitted from the internal-combustion engine energy-distribution mechanism. Moreover, a one-way clutch can prevent the actuated power source from reversion, so any output power source will not be affected by another inactive power source. Also, the two input power-sources can be integrated into a bigger power source via a dual energy-integration mechanism, thus resulting in twice the output energy and obtaining the necessary tractive power to reach the road surface. A dynamic equation is therefore derived for this system to obtain the flow direction of the power source. Furthermore, dynamic equations of various system components can be established by modularized software Matlab/simulink and fuzzy logic are used to control and develop this system's dual energy-integration mechanism as a control strategy. After the engine's energy is distributed by the controller of the dual energy-integration mechanism, decelerated by the reduction ratio of the first <b>pulley</b> <b>set</b> of internal combustion engine distribution mechanism and added to the generator torque energy transmitted from second <b>pulley</b> <b>set,</b> the engine can maintain an optimum state under various operating conditions.

Up-todate friction knowledge is useful to accurately determine the maximum transmittable torque and to monitor the variator condition.

An adaptive estimator is presented based on the Kalman filter, which estimates friction-related parameters to find the maximum friction. The filter requires no a priori knowledge of the maximum friction and needs no detailed friction model. Experiments show that this method can be used for both an undamaged and damaged pushbelt...|$|E

50|$|Hardey was {{influential}} {{in the development of}} the Belmont area, as he took on the roles of Justice of the Peace, magistrate and member of the Legislative Council. Harvey lobbied for river crossings to be constructed in 1837; The Causeway was built in 1843, and a crossing over the Helena River soon followed. Horse racing began on Grove Farm in 1848, and roads were constructed using convict labour to improve access from the road to Guildford (modern-day Great Eastern Highway). In 1850 the races moved to the current site of Ascot Racecourse. With the advent of horse training facilities in 1856, a horse <b>pulley</b> system was <b>set</b> up to provide a river crossing - close to the modern-day Garratt Bridge site, but east of the racecourse. Bridges were constructed in the 1880s to improve access to the races - a mechanical drawbridge for pedestrians opened in 1881, and a railway bridge was built in 1885. The bridge, later known as the Belmont railway bridge, carried a spur of the Perth-Guildford line that terminated south of the racecourse, but only operated on racing days.|$|R

5000|$|Gt. Fransham towermill was a four-storey mill {{that stood}} at Mill Farm {{described}} as a very wide-towered Mill, not very high, but thick & heavily built. The mill used four patent sails to power two pairs of French burr stones. A <b>pulley</b> wheel was <b>set</b> onto {{the outside of the}} mill to allow auxiliary power via a belt from a steam engine. In 1886, two windmills were advertised to be let, along with a bake office on the same site.The Mill had a history of tragedy. The Norfolk News of 10 February 1866 reported On Thursday in last week a distressing accident accompanied by a fatal termination occurred in Mr. Perkins’ mill, the unfortunate victim being a respectable & steady married man in his service, named Crispin Howard. About ten minutes before eleven in the forenoon Mr. Perkins left the deceased following his usual avocation. On his return shortly after eleven, Mr. Perkins thought the mill was not working so smoothly as before he left & on looking upwards he discovered the lifeless body of his workman resting on the beam to which he had been elevated after having been drawn in & passed between the two cog wheels. From the nature of the wounds inflicted, it was obvious death must have been instantaneous. The dead man who was fifty five years of age leaves a widow & three children to mourn his loss & for whom much sympathy is felt. At the inquest held on Saturday, the only verdict that could be found in the circumstances was returned - that of [...] "Accidental death".Just a few years later The King's Lynn Advertiser reported in April 1874 that Jonathan Perkins, miller of Gt Fransham was fatally injured on being thrown out of a pony cart when it hit a gatepost.By {{the early part of the}} 20th century, the end had come for Great Fransham Mill.The Dereham & Fakenham Times - 28 August 1909 reported the sale of the mill by auction at the George Hotel, East Dereham, on 23 August 1909.Mr. Heyhoe next offered the substantial built brick tower windmill situate at the Mill Farm, Great Fransham. This contained patent sails, two pairs of stones, shafting gear and fittings in good order and were sold subject to being removed from the occupation by 11 October next, from instructions from the trustees of Court 1246 A. O. F. (Swaffham). Mr. Crane was the purchaser for £7. This was the Crane family who owned the wagon works at Gt Fransham.|$|R
