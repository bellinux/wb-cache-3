40|$|Ribozymes are polynucleotide {{molecules}} with intrinsic catalytic activity, {{capable of}} cleaving nucleic acid substrates. Large RNA molecules were synthesized containing a hammerhead ribozyme moiety of 52 nucleotides {{linked to an}} inactive leader sequence, for total lengths of either 262 or 1226 nucleotides. Frozen RNAs were irradiated with high energy electrons. Surviving ribozyme activity was determined using {{the ability of the}} irradiated ribozymes to cleave a labeled substrate. The amount of intact RNA remaining was determined from the same irradiated samples by scanning the RNA band following denaturing gel electrophoresis. Radiation target analyses of these data revealed a structural target size of 80 kDa and a ribozyme activity target size of 15 kDa for the smaller ribozyme, and 319 kDa and 16 kDa, respectively, for the larger ribozyme. The disparity in target size for activity versus structure indicates that, in contrast to proteins, there is no spread of radiation damage far from the <b>primary</b> site of <b>ionization</b> in RNA molecules. The smaller target size for activity indicates that only <b>primary</b> <b>ionizations</b> occurring in the specific active region are effective. This is similar to the case for oligosaccharides. We concluded that the presence of the ribose sugar in the polymer chain restricts radiation damage to a small region and prevents major energy transfer throughout the molecule.

50|$|Generally {{speaking}} single-particle measurement instruments desorb particles {{one at a}} time using a pulsed laser. The {{process is}} called laser desorption/ionization (LDI) and is the <b>primary</b> <b>ionization</b> method used for single-particle measurements. The main advantage of using LDI over thermal desorption, is the ability to analyze both non-refractory and refractory (e.g., mineral dust, soot) components of atmospheric aerosols. The most common of these instruments is the aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (AToFMS).|$|E
50|$|A time {{projection}} chamber {{consists of}} a gas-filled detection volume in an electric field with a position-sensitive electron collection system. The original design (and the one most commonly used) is a cylindrical chamber with multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) as endplates. Along its length, the chamber is divided into halves {{by means of a}} central high-voltage electrode disc, which establishes an electric field between the center and the end plates. Furthermore, a magnetic field is often applied {{along the length of the}} cylinder, parallel to the electric field, in order to minimize the diffusion of the electrons coming from the ionization of the gas. On passing through the detector gas, a particle will produce <b>primary</b> <b>ionization</b> along its track. The z coordinate (along the cylinder axis) is determined by measuring the drift time from the ionization event to the MWPC at the end. This is done using the usual technique of a drift chamber. The MWPC at the end is arranged with the anode wires in the azimuthal direction, &theta;, which provides information on the radial coordinate, r. To obtain the azimuthal direction, each cathode plane is divided into strips along the radial direction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} in technological improvement {{that came out}} of the 1970s was in 1976 by Stoffel with the development of a magnetic sector RTSPMS technique that had a direct-inlet mass spectrometry (DIMS) also known as particle-inlet mass spectrometry (PIMS). [...] The PIMS instrument was the first to have a deferentially-pumped direct inlet that consists of a stainless steel capillary, followed by a skimmer and conical collimator that focuses the sample into a particle beam that goes on to the ionization region. This type of inlet system is what modern on-line aerosol mass spectrometer instruments use today. In 1982 Sinha and Fredlander developed the particle analysis by mass spectrometry (PAMS), this method was the first to incorporate the optical detection of particles followed by laser desorption/ionization (LDI) in a RTSPMS technique. Prior to this point all RTSPMS methods used surface desorption/ionization (SDI) which consist of a heated metal that ionized the samples. [...] The LDI method involves the sample being hit with a continuous wave, where the particle absorbs photons, and undergoes both desorption and ionization by the same pulse. LDI has several advantages over SDI for on-line single particle mass spectrometry, as such since its development it has been the <b>primary</b> <b>ionization</b> method for RTSPMS.The last major step in RTSPMS development was in 1994 by Prather. Prather developed the aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS), this method was the first that allow for simultaneous measurement of size and composition of single airborne particle. This techniques was different then previous methods in that instead of using the unreliable method of using light scattering signal intensity to measure particle size, this method uses a two laser system that allows for aerodynamic sizing.|$|E
30|$|As {{the atomic}} oxygen is the <b>primary</b> source of <b>ionization</b> at F-region heights, and the {{molecular}} nitrogen {{is the primary}} source of recombination, the change of the n (O)/n (N 2) ratio controls the electron density.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of dopant-assisted atmospheric pressure photoionization (DA-APPI) for LC/MS is generally reduced at higher solvent flow rates. Theory suggests that quenching of excited-state precursors to the dopant ions, via collisions with vaporized solvent molecules, {{may be one}} mechanism responsible for this trend. To ascertain if the <b>primary</b> rate of <b>ionization</b> is affected by quenching, experiments were performed utilizing an ionization detector to determine the primary ion current generated by irradiating vaporized mixtures of toluene dopant and methanol solvent. The results indicate that no loss of primary ion current occurs as the solvent flow is increased, provided the dopant-to-solvent ratio is held constant. Additional primary ion current can always be generated by increasing the dopant flow rate and/or the lamp power. Thus, quenching of excited-state precursors to the dopant ions, leading {{to a reduction in}} the <b>primary</b> rate of <b>ionization,</b> is not the mechanism responsible for the observed loss of sensitivity at higher liquid solvent flow rates...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we study by visible {{emission}} spectroscopy, energy resolved ion mass spectrometry and electric probes, H 2 plasmas generated in low pressure hollow cathode glow discharges. The study allows {{the determination of}} the energy distributions of the different plasma constituents (ions, electrons and neutrals), which span five orders of magnitude. The rotational H 2 temperature, assumed to be close to the translational one, scarcely exceeds the room temperature (0. 03 eV); free electrons, responsible of <b>primary</b> <b>ionizations</b> and dissociations, display mean kinetic energies of 3 - 6 eV; whereas ions (H+, H 2 +, H 3 +) and a part of H atoms reach the highest energies (300 eV). Our present study focuses on the line-shape analysis of the H Balmer series emitted by the plasma, whose spectral profiles evince its remarkable deviation from thermal equilibrium, and on the dependence of these profiles with H 2 pressure. The aim is to get {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes responsible of this behaviour. Three different Doppler broadenings are found in the atomic lines: the narrow peak, the plateau, and the far wings, with FWHM of ~ 0. 3, 6 and up to 80 eV, respectively [1]. Besides, a directional and asymmetric behaviour in the line shifts up to some 300 eV is observed when ions are directed preferentially towards the observation window through a grounded grid. The narrow line peak can be explained by direct electron impact excitation of the free H atoms and by Frank-Condon transitions to Rydberg levels. The plateau is also explained by electronic excitations, in this case to pre-dissociative levels and levels giving rise to dissociative ionization. Their effectiveness depends primarily on electron temperature. In contrast, the far wings are assumed to be mainly due to charge transfer processes and dissociative reactions of H 2 with the H+, H 2 + and H 3 + ions accelerated in the plasma sheath. The latter processes depend strongly on collision frequency and increase appreciably with pressure. The ion energy distributions obtained by mass spectrometry [2, 3] and the electron temperatures measured with the electric probe support the validity of the proposed mechanisms. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
