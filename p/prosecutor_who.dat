Either party can, on specified terms, appeal the outcome of the case to the court of appeal and ultimately the Supreme Court of Norway.|$|E

5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the <b>Prosecutor</b> <b>who</b> was involved in the extradition.|$|E

50|$|Interestingly, {{one of the}} <b>prosecutors</b> <b>who</b> befriended the Ciello {{character}} and is shown in {{a very positive light}} was based on then rookie federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani. The character, Mario Vincente, played by Steve Inwood, is portrayed as threatening to resign if the U.S. Attorney's office indicts Ciello (Leuci) for past transgressions. In general, the <b>prosecutors</b> <b>who</b> argued against the prosecution of Leuci are treated sympathetically, while those who sought his indictment are shown as officious and vindictive.|$|R
25|$|As Hennepin County Attorney, Olson quickly {{earned a}} name for himself as a stern <b>prosecutor</b> <b>who</b> relished going after crooked businessmen.

25|$|Anderson was {{represented}} by Anchorage attorney Paul Stockler, a former state <b>prosecutor</b> <b>who</b> usually handles civil litigation. Stockler successfully defended an Anchorage aviation company against federal weapons charges in a prominent case in 2006.

They served over 3,000 days in pre-trial arrest. I believe the <b>prosecutors</b> <b>who</b> asked for the pre-trial arrest of these people should be arrested immediately for abuse of power or malfeasance in office, because they falsified evidence.

25|$|Other {{theories}} suggest Donati's death resulted {{more directly}} from specific crimes {{he was engaged}} in.

Donati's FBI files also note that he had some large gambling debts at the time.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 2008, Hervé Eon, from Laval {{came to an}} anti-Sarkozy {{demonstration}} with a sign {{bearing the}} words Casse-toi pov' con, the exact words Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the <b>prosecutor,</b> <b>who</b> in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of €1000. The court eventually imposed a symbolic €30 suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side. This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, {{as president of the}} Republic, is immune from prosecution, notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{unfortunately}} {{large number of}} instances in which appellate courts reverse convictions for serious prosecutorial misconduct but do not identify {{the names of the}} <b>prosecutors</b> <b>who</b> committed that misconduct. Because judges are reluctant to publicly shame prosecutors whose cases are reversed, this Article advocates that a neutral set of third parties undertake the responsibility of publicly identifying <b>prosecutors</b> <b>who</b> have committed serious misconduct. The naming of prosecutors will shame bad actors, provide a valuable pedagogical lesson for junior prosecutors, and signal to trial judges that certain prosecutors must be monitored more closely to avoid future misconduct...|$|R
25|$|Earlier in the year, Cabrini had {{declined}} to renew Philip's contract, citing repeated tardiness and alcohol-related issues, effectively firing her. Shortly after she had been informed of that decision, {{she went out to}} a bar with other Cabrini employees. The outing led to her spending the night in jail. She complained to police that a fellow intern touched her inappropriately during that time. The <b>prosecutor</b> <b>who</b> investigated the case dropped the sexual abuse charge and instead charged Philip with third-degree falsely reporting an incident, a misdemeanor under New York law. He offered to drop the charge if she recanted the original complaint, but she refused and was held overnight pending release.|$|E
25|$|At {{the trial}} for Zach, it was {{alleged that the}} state used {{unethical}} investigatory techniques to coerce a confession from Dylan.

The <b>prosecutor,</b> <b>who</b> was also handing the Bobo case, arranged a no-jail plea deal {{on the condition that}} he go live with a retired police officer, Dennis Benjamin, who Dylan did not know. Five weeks later, Benjamin called 911 to report that he had someone in his home that wanted to confess to the murder of Holly Bobo. Despite the fact that this confession led to the arrests, much of what he confessed to did not match the evidence.|$|E

On the day of the trial, the original <b>prosecutor,</b> <b>who</b> already had pleaded for the death penalty, was prevented participating and Filbinger, who hadn't been involved in the case, was appointed prosecutor. According to the Admiral's orders, Filbinger demanded the death penalty and the court sentenced the seaman to death. Admiral Dönitz rejected a plea for pardon. On 16 March 1945 Gröger was executed and, according to military custom, Filbinger supervised the execution.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversation}} now revealed {{took place}} in 2006 {{with the aim of}} explaining the large outgoing amounts of money from the company's headquarters in London at the time of approval of the project. According to some sources contacted in London by TVI, José Sócrates remains the main suspect of British police. The British police are now set to send to the Portuguese authorities the 25 volumes of all research done in this process in England. The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major financial fraud in Britain, has seen its activity limited due to the lack cooperation of the Portuguese authorities in investigating the case. The first official meeting took place only on 17 November 2008 in The Hague, the headquarters of Eurojust, a body which is designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in the EU. The judge Cândida Almeida, director of DCIAP (Central Department for investigation and prosecution), which coordinates the department's <b>prosecutor</b> <b>who</b> investigates the case, refused a joint research proposal by the English.

25|$|First {{names are}} {{chosen by the}} child's parents. There are no legal a priori {{constraints}} on the choice of names nowadays, but this {{has not always been}} the case. The choice of given names, originally limited only by the tradition of naming children after a small number of popular saints, was restricted by law {{at the end of the}} 18th century, could be accepted. Much later, actually in 1966, a new law permitted a limited number of mythological, regional or foreign names, substantives (Olive, Violette), diminutives, and alternative spellings. Only in 1993 were French parents given the freedom to name their child without any constraint whatsoever. However, if the birth registrar thinks that the chosen names (alone or in association with the last name) may be detrimental to the child's interests, or to the right of other families to protect their own family name, the registrar may refer the matter to the local <b>prosecutor,</b> <b>who</b> may choose to refer the matter to the local court. The court may then refuse the chosen names. Such refusals are rare and mostly concern given names that may expose the child to mockery.|$|E
