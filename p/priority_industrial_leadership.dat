40|$|Important {{contributions}} {{within the}} realms of industrial dynamics and evolutionary economic theory have shown the need to explore the sources of <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> in high-tech industries. Several of these {{studies suggest that the}} co-evolution between national industries and certain supporting institutions could play a fundamental role as a source of competitive advantage, although an analysis of these processes still poses significant formal and theoretical challenges. In this article, we draw on previous contributions to formal evolutionary theorizing in order to build up a co-evolution model suitable for the dynamic analysis of <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership.</b> This model involves national firms competing on a worldwide level in a science-based industry, and co-evolving with their respective national university systems. Certain national firms may influence university funding by institutional shaping, while national university systems crucially affect the competitive advantage of said firms in the global market. The model highlights important mechanisms through which institutional, technological, and market interrelated factors determine the dynamics of <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> and, eventually, the emergence of <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> shifts. Some of the implications regarding policy and future research on economic development follow. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we seek {{to analyse}} the role of {{national}} university systems in combination with technological and market factors as sources of <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> and industry growth in science-based industries. We propose a model in which national university systems and their respective national firms and industries are considered as co-evolving. National firms compete on a worldwide level and they rely {{on the progress of}} science and the availability of scientists to innovate. As the global industry develops, firms try to mold their national university systems, but they achieve different degrees of success. Apart from highlighting the role of institutional responsiveness as a source of competitive advantage, our model points to the access to essential inputs for production, the technological and strategic characteristics of firms, the international diffusion of knowledge, and the initial distribution of market demand as key sources of leadership and industry growth.

40|$|Industrial {{complexes}} {{are considered}} as {{a major source of}} hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) which include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals, etc. Therefore, the comprehensive monitoring and management of HAPs in the industrial complexes are required. In this study, the basic information of the industrial complexes (e. g., location, area, emission of air pollutants, meteorological conditions, and population) was used as input data for a geographic information system (GIS) software. On the basis of these GIS data, we proposed a systematic method for determining <b>priority</b> <b>industrial</b> complexes for the monitoring of HAPs. We identified 28 <b>priority</b> <b>industrial</b> complexes and classified them into four groups from level 1, whose HAPs should be continuously monitored, to level 4, whose HAPs {{do not have to be}} monitored. Furthermore, the case study of Ulsan was presented to demonstrate the selection procedure for sampling sites. The results of this study can be practically used to establish a long-term plan of the monitoring and management of HAPs. clos...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how government policy has influenced {{the pattern of}} innovation and <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> in the cellular mobile communication systems. It focuses on the US government's role in promoting the early development of the cellular concept in the 1970 s, Europe's attempt {{to take the lead}} with the promotion of the GSM standard in the late 1980 s, and the rise of two rival world-wide standards in the 1990 s (Europe's GSM versus America's CDMA systems). The cellular mobile communications system is treated {{as an example of a}} complex product system (CoPS). CoPS are large-scale, engineering intensive products that are supplied in unit or batch production and tailored to meet the requirements of particular large users.

40|$|This thesis set out {{to explore}} the forces that {{determine}} {{the rise and fall}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership.</b> It attempted to do this by applying an industry life cycle model to the shipping industry. The industrial life cycle was posited on the basis of existing literature, particularly the growth of knowledge, evolutionary and institutional literature, which lend themselves to patterns of industrial growth and entrapment. On this basis, this thesis {{set out to}} examine whether <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> can be explained by a four-staged process of imitation, catch up, advance and entrapment. However, this thesis has exposed something more complicated. Processes of imitation, catch up advance and entrapment were shown to be at work in the shipping industry, but they were tempered by the effects of military and political forces that may not be exogenous, and the trend from regionalism to globalisation. The original model did not encompass early indigenous developments that are not based on imitation that do not immediately lead to a position of advanced leadership. In this light, a better description of the first stage would be capability building...|$|R
