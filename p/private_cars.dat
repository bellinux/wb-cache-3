40|$|Active and {{functional}} public transportation {{is a necessity}} in urban areas. It provides a means of mobility for non-car users such as teenagers, elderly and people who cannot or {{do not want to}} use a <b>private</b> <b>car,</b> walk or cycle. Public transportation is also more economical and ecological mode of transportation if compared with a <b>private</b> <b>car.</b> However, the problem is {{that a large number of}} urban travellers do not consider today’s public transport services as a real alternative for a <b>private</b> <b>car.</b> This causes for instance traffic congestion and air quality degradation in urban areas. This thesis compares the travelling experience between private vs. public and personal vs. shared. The work questions what is it that <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users have to ‘give up’ if they make a change in their travel behaviour and start using public transportation instead of a <b>private</b> <b>car?</b> Therefore, the thesis examines the motives for <b>private</b> <b>car</b> use. Why <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users prefer using their own cars and what is it that makes a <b>private</b> <b>car</b> such an appealing and attaching object to own and use? And how come are our current public transport services incapable of satisfying the travel related needs and desires of <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users? The thesis views symbolic, affective and instrumental motives behind <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users’ transport mode choices with an emphasis to the symbolic and affective motives to use a <b>private</b> <b>car.</b> At first, the thesis examines transport related theories explaining what affects to the individuals’ travel behaviour and travel related needs. After this, the thesis looks into European transportation research papers related to <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users’ motives to use a <b>private</b> <b>car.</b> The product attachment theories are studied to find explanations to the questions: Why do <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users tend to be so attached with their cars and what is it that makes giving up car use such a difficult task to do? To allow comparisons between the experience of using a <b>private</b> <b>car</b> and using public transportation, a four-month participant observation period considering service experiences in today’s public transport was conducted in Helsinki. In addition, the thesis includes documentation analysis considering the public transport service quality factors that are used to measure the quality of today’s public transportation services. The findings are used to create an alternative design approach for developing public transportation services in the future. At the end of the thesis, a new demand responsive transport concept is used to illustrate future scenarios for a new public transport service, which could hold potential to start attracting <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users. This thesis is a part of five-year long Metropol research project, initiated by the Aalto University School of Science and Technology. The project has examined whether a new type of demand responsive transportation concept is economically and technically feasible to design and implement in urban areas such as Helsinki. The ultimate aim of the project has been to design and produce a new type of public transportation service concept, which could finally challenge the predominance of a <b>private</b> <b>car</b> as the most popular mode of transportation in urban areas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{effectively}} attract commuters from <b>private</b> <b>car</b> to public transit, this paper aimed {{to find out}} the target population and the attributes of public transit which needs improvement. The research was based on a survey of <b>private</b> <b>car</b> commuters in Shanghai. The survey covered perceptions of public transit and <b>private</b> <b>car</b> service performance, the importance degree of trip attributes, and <b>private</b> <b>car</b> commuters’ intention to switch to public transit. The findings indicate that the target population is female and short distance commuters, because female and short distance <b>private</b> <b>car</b> commuters have lower trip demand {{and are more likely to}} switch to public transit. The analysis of Difference-Importance shows that public transit attributes of comfort and timeliness require improvement, and the measures strengthening public transit's comfort level should be taken first...|$|R

The railway was also used for transporting workers, with trains running from the towns to the plants {{in the morning and}} returning after the working day was over. Prior to <b>private</b> <b>cars</b> becoming common, the railway operated a passenger carriage on the trains between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn—allowing free travel. The railway has never had any scheduled or public transport of passengers, but the company's concession specifies that the authorities could at a later date require the company to operate public passenger services under specified conditions.|$|E

This study aims to estimate and develop a model of congestion costs for <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users in the area of Jalan Malioboro, Yogyakarta, with a length of 1. 414 km. The study was limited to the congestion charge for <b>private</b> <b>car</b> users only.

40|$|A diamond effect exists when an individual's utility {{depends on}} the {{exchange}} value {{in addition to the}} intrinsic consumption effects of the good. This concept was first studied by Ng (1987). The existence of the diamond effect justifies a higher tax than a good with no diamond effect, and the stronger the effect is, the higher the tax should be. This paper attempts to test the diamond effect of <b>private</b> <b>car</b> ownership in China. While taxi services are very convenient in most of the large and mediumsize Chinese cities, and the cost of owning a <b>private</b> <b>car</b> is much higher than using a taxi for all travel purposes, many people still choose to buy a <b>private</b> <b>car.</b> This suggests the existence of diamond effects. A survey of 118 <b>private</b> <b>car</b> owners in three Chinese cities was conducted to test this conjecture. The survey results show that the relative income and the purchase decisions of colleagues, friends and relatives may have a strong impact on the purchase decisions of potential car owners, and that the closer the relationship, the stronger the impact. It also suggests that <b>private</b> <b>car</b> ownership may act as a sign of social status in China. In conclusion, the survey is supportive of the existence of a diamond effect in <b>private</b> <b>car</b> ownership in China...|$|R
