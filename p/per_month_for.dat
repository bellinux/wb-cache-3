5|$|Maintaining an {{affordable}} food {{supply to the}} city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (annona) to citizens who registered for it. About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33kg. <b>per</b> <b>month,</b> <b>for</b> a per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E

Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E

5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the couple's {{popularity}} resulted in their being invited {{to set up a}} children's theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the theater in the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and Hans Christian Andersen. They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged marionette productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows <b>per</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The theater in the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from the traveling theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help people forget the famines and violence of the times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy.|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 (a) and (b) {{also suggest}} that there is not one {{threshold}} value for which IBC and SIGACT reporting agrees both in terms of number of events and casualties <b>per</b> <b>month.</b> While they show the best visual agreement with respect to casualty counts for a threshold of 2 (Figure  4 (b), upper right panel), the corresponding events <b>per</b> <b>month</b> statistics differ markedly (Figure  4 (a), upper right panel). Recall, however, that we argued before that coverage in IBC should be much more limited for small events than in SIGACT. This implies that we should actually not expect an agreement in the number of events <b>per</b> <b>months</b> <b>for</b> thresholds of 1 and 2. In fact, the number of events <b>per</b> <b>month</b> are most consistent for thresholds between 5 and 10 where media-based coverage should be more complete. Since the casualty counts in IBC are significantly larger for these thresholds, this appears to suggest that overall IBC systematically reports more casualties than SIGACT.|$|R

One of the reasons why the poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams.
