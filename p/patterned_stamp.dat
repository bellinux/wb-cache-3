We {{investigated the}} non-uniformity {{of the residual}} layer thickness caused by wafer deformation in an experiment that examined different wafer thicknesses using UV-NIL with an element-wise <b>patterned</b> <b>stamp</b> (EPS). Experiments using the EPS were performed on an EVG ® 620 -NIL. Severe deformation of the wafer served {{as an obstacle to}} the spread of resin drops, which caused non-uniformity of the residual layer thickness.

The sequential localoxidation process is performed with an atomic force microscope and requires {{the application of a}} sequence of voltage pulses of 36 V for 1 ms. The parallel localoxidation process is performed by using a conductive and <b>patterned</b> <b>stamp.</b> Then, a voltage pulse is applied between the stamp and the pentacenesurface. Patterns formed by arrays of parallel lines covering 1 mm 2 regions and with a periodicity of less than 1 μm have been generated in a few seconds. We also show that the patterns can be used as templates for the deposition of antibodies.

40|$|Abstract — In this study, soft {{microcontact}} printing with force control using microrobotic assembly based templates is investigated. Polystyrene microparticles are assembled automatically in a 2 -D desired pattern on a glass substrate using an Atomic Force Microscope nanoprobe installed on a nanopositioning stage. A force-controlled printing {{process of the}} <b>patterned</b> <b>stamp</b> is conducted after making a template and stamp from the assembled mircoparticles. Aluminum sputtering of the pattern on the glass and ultrasonically removing the microparticles is {{used to make a}} template. Soft lithography method is used to mold elastomeric polymers on the template to make a stamp. The stamp is inked and printed with a force-controlled system on a Petri dish substrate. Depending on the particle size and contact force, a smaller micro or nanometer size pattern can be formed. Since the spherical patterns on the stamp collapse due to the interfacial contact force, force-controlled {{microcontact printing}} is crucial. Using a fluorescent protein for inking the stamps enables the fluorescent imaging of the imprints. Preliminary experiments using 5 µm and 10 µm diameter polystyrene particles showed the feasibility of our technique. Thus, it is possible to get nanopatterns using assembled microparticle based stamps in high volumes. I...|$|E

Low temperature nanoimprint lithography (LTNIL) can avoid these problems. LTNIL is also ideal for manufacturing biological compatibility samples since the samples do not sustain high temperature.

40|$|An industrially {{feasible}} {{process for}} the fast mass-production of molded polymeric micro-patterned substrates is here presented. Microstructured polystyrene (PS) surfaces were obtained through micro injection molding (μIM) technique on directly <b>patterned</b> <b>stamps</b> realized with a new zirconia-based hybrid spin-on system able to withstand 300 cycles at 90 °C. The use of directly <b>patterned</b> <b>stamps</b> entails a great advantage on the overall manufacturing process as it allows a fast, flexible, and simple one-step process {{with respect to the}} use of milling, laser machining, electroforming techniques, or conventional lithographic processes for stamp fabrication. Among the different obtainable geometries, we focused our attention on PS replicas reporting 2, 3, and 4 μm diameter pillars with 8, 9, 10 μm center-to-center distance, respectively. This enabled us to study the effect of the substrate topography on human mesenchymal stem cells behavior without any osteogenic growth factors. Our data show that microtopography affected cell behavior. In particular, calcium deposition and osteocalcin expression enhanced as diameter and interpillar distance size increases, and the 4 - 10 surface was the most effective to induce osteogenic differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Different {{methods to}} create {{chemically}} <b>patterned,</b> flat PDMS <b>stamps</b> with two different chemical functionalities were compared. The best method for making such stamps, functionalized with 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (PFDTS) and 3 -(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTS), {{appeared to be}} full functionalization of a freshly oxidized flat PDMS stamp with either adsorbate, followed by renewed oxidation through a mask and attachment of the other adsorbate. These stamps were used to transfer polar inks (a thioether-functionalized dendrimer and a fluorescent dye) by microcontact printing. The PFDTS monolayer {{was used as a}} barrier against ink transfer, while the APTS SAM areas functioned as an ink reservoir for polar inks. The printing results confirmed the excellent transfer of hydrophilic inks with these stamps to gold and glass substrates, even from aqueous solutions.

40|$|The questimed {{document}} examination {{plays an}} important role in forensic science. In Chinese documents, such as business contracts, there are stamps and signatures (or fingerprints) over them. Sometimes, those <b>patterns</b> (<b>stamps,</b> signatures or fingerprints) may superimpose on each other. When the documents being served as evidences to court, the overlapped patterns become contentious usually. Even in the document examination, overlapped patterns may interfere with the examination work. It will be helpful if we can reduce the overlapping influence before processing the document examination. The objective of image segmentation is to find regions that represent objects or meaningful parts of objects. The method for image segmentation is to find the measure of homogeneous regions of objects or to detect the boundaries between objects. In this paper, we review some color image models and explain how we apply the image segmentation method to analyze overlapped patterns in the document examination. Synthetic images and one real case image are used to show the capability of the image segmentation method...|$|R

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{strategy is}} presented to combine the preparation of functional building blocks based on polymer beads decorated with luminescent nanocrystals (NCs) and their precise positioning onto suitable patterns by capillary assembly technique. In particular, a layer-by-layer (LbL) polyelectrolyte (PE) deposition procedure has been implemented to provide uniform NC coverage on PS beads, thus conveying the optical properties of luminescent nanocrystals to highly processable PS beads. The latter have then been integrated into <b>patterned</b> <b>stamps</b> by means of template-driven capillary assembly. Their selective positioning has been directed by means of pattern geometry. The use of luminescent (CdSe) ZnS NCs offers a direct optical probe to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} positioning procedure on the substrate, enabling the extension of the method {{to a wide range of}} materials, i. e., NCs with different compositions and specific geometry-dependent properties.

40|$|A general {{methodology}} for nanopatterning organosilane thin films directly from vapor phase precursors is presented. Aminosilane line patterns with a width of 200 nm {{in an area}} of 1 cm 2 were fabricated on silicon substrates by diffusion of aminosilane vapor through the open channels of PDMS stamps bonded to a substrate. The patterned thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Patterns were initially formed at the three-phase boundary lines between substrate, PDMS mold, and vapor by exploiting the fact that vapors condense preferentially in geometrically restricted areas with a concave shape compared to flat surfaces. The lateral resolution of the formed patterns is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than the feature sizes of the PDMS stamp. Prolonged exposure to the precursor vapor resulted in micrometer-sized patterns with similar features and dimensions as the stamp. This methodology provides an easy and low cost parallel fabrication route of functional organosilane nanoscale patterns of arbitrary shape and composition from micrometer-size <b>patterned</b> <b>stamps...</b>|$|R
50|$|Redwork {{is a form}} of American embroidery, {{also called}} art needlework, that {{developed}} in the 19th century and was particularly popular between 1855 and 1925. It traditionally uses red thread, chosen because red dyes were the first commercially available colorfast dyes, in the form of Turkey red embroidery floss. Redwork designs are composed of simple stitches and were mainly used to decorate household objects in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially quilts. Patterns for individual quilt blocks were sold for a penny in the United States, making them popular and affordable. In the 21st century, redwork has seen a resurgence among crafters. The main stitch used in redwork is backstitch or outline stitching, formerly known as Kensington stitch. Redwork was a common introductory form of embroidery taught to children in the 19th and 20th century. Children would make quilts decorated with redwork motifs, with motifs of various sizes prior to approximately 1910 and uniform sizes after that year. It was also a way for women with skills in <b>pattern</b> <b>stamping</b> or embroidery to generate their own source of income from the home.|$|R
