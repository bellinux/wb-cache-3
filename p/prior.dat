Furthermore, the intrinsic Bayes factors are asymptotically equal to the ordinary Bayes factors computed by some reasonable proper <b>priors</b> called intrinsic <b>priors.</b> Several intrinsic <b>priors</b> are derived for testing the equality of two independent exponential means.

40|$|Query-independent {{features}} (also called document <b>priors),</b> such as {{the number}} of incoming links to a document, its Page-Rank, or the type of its associated URL, have been successfully integrated into Web Information Retrieval systems in order to enhance the retrieval effectiveness. The combination of several document <b>priors</b> could further enhance the retrieval performance. However, most current combination of <b>priors</b> approaches are based on heuristics, and often ignore the possible dependence between the document <b>priors.</b> In this paper, we present a novel and robust method for conditionally combining document <b>priors</b> in a principled way. The approach adjusts the distribution of document <b>priors</b> for one source of evidence according to the distribution of document <b>priors</b> for other sources of evidence. We investigate the retrieval performance attainable by our combination of <b>priors</b> method, in comparison to the use of single <b>priors</b> and to a heuristic combination of document <b>priors</b> method, which assumes that document <b>priors</b> are independent. Furthermore, we investigate how sensitive the proposed method is to the training data. Using two standard Web test collections, including the large-scale. GOV 2 test collection, we find that some of the document <b>priors</b> used in our experiments, have a considerably high correlation, suggesting that the dependency between documents <b>priors</b> should indeed be taken into account. Through extensive experiments on these two large-scale collections, we observe that our proposed conditional combination method is overall effective and robust. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We are {{interested}} in studying Gaussian Markov random fields as correlation <b>priors</b> for Bayesian inversion. We construct the correlation <b>priors</b> to be discretisation-invariant, which means, loosely speaking, that the discrete <b>priors</b> converge to continuous <b>priors</b> at the discretisation limit. We construct the <b>priors</b> with stochastic partial differential equations, which guarantees computational efficiency via sparse matrix approximations. The stationary correlation <b>priors</b> have a clear statistical interpretation through the autocorrelation function. We also consider how to make structural model of an unknown object with anisotropic and inhomogeneous Gaussian Markov random fields. Finally we consider these fields on unstructured meshes, which are needed on complex domains. The publications in this thesis contain fundamental mathematical and computational results of correlation <b>priors.</b> We have considered one application in this thesis, the electrical impedance tomography. These fundamental results and application provide a platform for engineers and researchers to use correlation <b>priors</b> in other inverse problem applications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an approach}} to estimation in possibly sparse data sets using shrinkage <b>priors</b> based upon the class of hypergeometric-beta distributions. These widely applicable <b>priors</b> {{turn out to be}} a four-parameter generalization of the beta family, and are pseudo-conjugate: they cannot themselves be expressed in closed form, but they do yield tractable moments and marginal likelihoods when used as <b>priors</b> for the mean of a normal distribution. These <b>priors</b> are useful in situations where standard <b>priors</b> are inappropriate or ill-behaved. Non-Bayesians will find these <b>priors</b> useful for generating easily computable shrinkage estimators that have excellent risk properties. Bayesians will find them useful for generating computationally tractable <b>priors</b> for a variance parameter. We illustrate the use of these <b>priors</b> on a variety of global and local shrinkage problems, and we prove a theorem that characterizes their risk proprieties when used for estimation of a normal mean under a quadratic loss function...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} way to allow Bayesian <b>priors</b> to reflect the {{objectives}} of an economic problem. That is, we impose <b>priors</b> on {{the solution to the}} problem rather than on the primitive parameters whose implied <b>priors</b> can be backed out from the Euler equation. Using monthly returns on the Fama-French 25 size and book-to-market portfolios and their 3 factors from January 1965 to December 2004, we find that investment performances under the objective-based <b>priors</b> can be significantly different from those under alternative <b>priors,</b> with differences in terms of annual certainty-equivalent returns greater than 10 % in many cases. In terms of an out-of-sample loss function measure, portfolio strategies based on the objective-based <b>priors</b> can substantially outperform both strategies under alternative <b>priors</b> and some of the best strategies developed in the classical framework...|$|R
