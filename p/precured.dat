40|$|ABSTRACT：Rubber {{composites}} {{were prepared}} by kneading the <b>precured</b> CIIR with BR {{in order to}} analyze {{the effects of the}} dispersed phase on the BR/PCIIR composites. The particle size of domain in BR/CIIR composites was decreased and homogeneously dispersed by kneading process the <b>precured</b> CIIR used as dispersed phase in kneader once again. In case of BR/PCIIR 40, the kneading time of <b>precured</b> CIIR with BR did not have any effect on the rebound resilience and the hardness of the composite. The tensile strength of the composite prepared by kneading <b>precured</b> CIIR particles and then mixing them with BR increased significantly more than 10 % when compared to that of the composite which was not kneaded.

40|$|The scarf-joint {{technique}} {{is one of}} the latest techniques used for repairing composite aircraft structures. But this {{technique is}} mostly used at depot level repairing activities since it requires autoclave and other equipments. This article focuses on scarf joint comprised of vacuum and autoclave <b>precured</b> and co-cured composite patches bonded to autoclave and vacuum <b>precured</b> parent laminates. Autoclave and vacuum cured parent laminates and scarf joints were prepared and exposed to the same temperature and moisture environment for comparison. All specimens were loaded in tension at three temperatures. Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests were also carried out for the parent materials. As noted, the tensile strength and ILSS decrease when the material has been exposed to moisture and tested at elevated temperature. But, no significant difference was reported for either tensile strength or ILSS between autoclave and vacuum cured materials. The room temperature repair efficiencies are reported for single scarf repairs comprised of vacuum co-cured and <b>precured</b> patches. These vacuum cured repair efficiencies were found to be similar to the efficiency of the autoclave <b>precured</b> patch repair. This result supports the feasibility of scarf joint repairs with <b>precured</b> or co-cured patches under vacuum curing conditions in field level facilities. Therefore, repairs with vacuum <b>precured</b> or vacuum co-cured patches requiring less equipment seems to be a serious potential alternative to the composite patch repair requiring autoclave conditions which might be only available at depot level maintenance centers. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The study aims to {{evaluate}} and compare marginal microleakage in deep class II cavities restored with various techniques using different composites. Materials and Methods: Sixty freshly extracted teeth were divided into six groups of 10 teeth each. Standardized class II cavities were made and were restored using composites of different consistencies with different placement techniques. Group 1 with Microhybrid composite, Group 2 with Packable composite, Group 3 Microhybrid composite with a flowable composite liner, Group 4 Packable composite with a flowable composite liner, Group 5 Microhybrid composite with <b>precured</b> composite insert in second increment and Group 6 Packable composite with <b>precured</b> insert in second increment. Specimens then were stored in distilled water, thermocycled and immersed in 50 &#x 0025; silver nitrate solution. These specimens were sectioned and evaluated for microleakage at the occlusal and cervical walls separately using stereomicroscope. Results: The results demonstrated that in the occlusal wall, packable composite, showed significantly more marginal microleakage than the other groups. In the cervical wall, teeth restored with a flowable composite liner showed less marginal microleakage when compared to all other groups. Conclusion: Based {{on the results of}} this study, the use of flowable composite as the first increment is recommended in deep class II cavities...|$|E

40|$|As {{the use of}} {{composite}} materials and adhesive-bonding technology for the manufacturing of aircraft components have become well established in the aviation industry, adhesively bonded repairs of aluminum aircraft structures with {{composite materials}} should be given more considerations and further developed. Repairs of aircraft primary structure such as spherically or complex contoured fuselage skins, frames, stingers and longerons, with composite materials are of particular interest. The present study investigated the repair of a center-cracked panel with a <b>precured</b> carbon fiber/epoxy patch. To be aligned with the common repair method for bonded aircraft components, single sided patching of the cracked panel was studied. A typical test specimen consisted of a center-cracked panel, reinforced with a bonded composite patch. The panel and the patch were made from aircraft material [...] 2024 T 3 aluminum sheets and plies of symmetrically laid carbon fiber/epoxy composites, Fibredux 913, respectively. The <b>precured</b> patch was configured in two forms: (1) unidirectional fibers perpendicular to the crack and (2) fibers at +/- 45 °C to the crack. Both tensile and fatigue tests were implemented. During the tensile test, each repaired specimen, heated or unheated in an environmental chamber, was uniaxially loaded to complete failure. The corresponding ultimate load {{was used as an}} index for determination of the effectiveness of the repair. During the fatigue test, each test specimen was subjected to a tension-tension cyclic load and the behavior of the crack {{at the center of the}} repaired panel was observed. The crack initiation, propagation rate and the total number of load cycles accumulated prior to complete failure of the test specimen were used as means to measure the effectiveness of the repair under fatigue loading. For comparison purposes, cracked specimens which were reinforced with conventional type riveted-on doublers were also tested. Finally, the test results can be used as a major reference for checking on the validity of a finite element model that is designed to evaluate performance of bonded repairs with composite patches...|$|E

40|$|Carbon fiber {{composite}} materials are increasingly used in automobile, marine, and aerospace industries {{due to their}} unique properties, including high strength, high stiffness and low weight. However, due to their brittle characteristic, these structures are prone to physical damage, such as a bird strike or impact damage. Once the structure is damaged, {{it is important to}} have fast and reliable temporary repair until the permanent repair or replacement can take place. In this dissertation, UV-based adhesives were used to provide a bonding strength for temporary repair. Adhesively bonded patch repair is an efficient and effective method for temporary repair. In this study, <b>precured</b> patches (hard patches) and dry fabric patches with laminating resins (soft patches) were performed. UV-based epoxy adhesives were applied to both patch repair systems. ^ For <b>precured</b> patch repair, the bonding strengths were investigated under different surface treatments for bonding area and different adhesives thicknesses. The shear stresses of different UV exposure times and curing times were tested. Besides, the large patch repair was investigated as well. For soft patch repair, the hand wet lay-up was applied due to high viscosity of UV resins. A modified single lap shear testing (ASTM D 5868) was applied to determine the shear stress. The large patches used fiber glass instead of carbon fiber to prove the possibility of repair with UV epoxy resin by hand wet lay-up process. The hand lay-up procedure was applied and assisted by vacuum pressure to eliminate the air bubbles and consolidate the patches. To enhance the bonding strength and effective soft patch repair, vacuum assisted resin transferring molding (VaRTM) is the better option. However, only low viscosity resins can be operated by VaRTM. Hence, new UV-based adhesives were formulated. The new UV-based adhesives included photoinitiator (PI), epoxy and different solvents. Solvents were used to compound the photoinitiator into epoxy monomer. Acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chloroform were used as well as their anhydrous solvents. The UV exposure times and curing times of new UV-based resins were tested. FT-IR, DSC and DMA were used to investigate structure, glass transition temperatures(Tg) and properties of polymer. ^ In summary, the UV-based adhesive was applied to adhesively bonded hard patch and soft patch repair. In addition, new UV-based resins were formulated for the VaRTM process. The in-field repair can be effective and efficient by using UV adhesives. ...|$|E
