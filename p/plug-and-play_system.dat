40|$|The SARG 04 {{protocol}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently used protocol in commercial plug-and-play quantum key distribution (QKD) system, where an eavesdropper can completely control or change the photon number statistics of the QKD source. To ensure the security of SARG 04 protocol in plug-and-play QKD system with an unknown and untrusted source, the bounds of a few statistical parameters of the source need to be monitored. An active or a passive source monitor schemes are proposed to verify these parameters. Furthermore, the practical issues due to statistical fluctuation and detection noise in the source monitoring process are quantitatively analyzed. Our simulation results show that the passive scheme can be efficiently applied to <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>system</b> with SARG 04 protocol. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve the}} highest {{bandwidth}} {{performance in a}} <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>system,</b> optical interfaces offer scalability into eventually terabits/s in backplanes. The “on-ramps ” to such backplanes come through interface modules. In simpler plug-and-play networks, these ASIMs have played this role in USB, SpaceWire, and inter-integrated circuit (I 2 C) copper-based bus physical layers. In this paper, we describe one possible implementation of an optical ASIM (O-ASIM), which integrates optical fibers into the earlier SpaceWire-based plug-and-play interface to provide dramatic enhancement to information transport. The present O-ASIM targets a 40 Gbps performance, which is ~ 80 X higher than the copper-only SpaceWire-based system.

40|$|Lanthi{{peptides}} are peptides {{that contain}} several post-translationally modified amino acid residues and commonly show considerable antimicrobial activity. After translation, the amino acid residues of these peptides are modified by a distinct set of modification enzymes. This process results in peptides containing {{one or more}} lanthionine rings and dehydrated Ser and Thr residues. Previously, an in vivo lanthipeptide production system based on the modification machinery of the model lantibiotic nisin was reported. Here, we present {{the addition of the}} modification enzymes LtnJ and GdmD to this production system. With these enzymes we can now produce lanthipeptides that contain D-alanines or a C-terminal aminovinyl-cysteine. We show experimentally that the decarboxylase GdmD is responsible for the C-terminal decarboxylation. Our results demonstrate that different lanthipeptide modification enzymes can work together in an in vivo production system. This yields a <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>system</b> {{that can be used to}} select different sets of modification enzymes to work on diverse, specifically designed substrates. ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{have found their}} way to countless applications in many different fields. Due to the restricted power availability these systems are faced with, custom wireless protocols have been designed. Many different protocols have already been conceived, yet each application will impose different requirements. In inertial motion tracking, sensor nodes are applied on the body allowing full body posture reconstruction. These nodes must not hinder or restrict the movements of the user in any way, meaning that a wireless approach is desirable. A suiting protocol that insures robust simultaneous functionality of at least 15 nodes at a rate of 100 Hz is required. A TDMA based protocol with master/slave hierarchy is presented for the application at hand. Nodes dynamically decide on their role within the network at startup and reassess the network state regularly. Conflicting situations are handled whenever they arise and nodes react accordingly creating a fully <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>system.</b> Careful implementation of the protocol in embedded software allows data transmission of 19 nodes while each of them consumes an average current of only 3 mA...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} four {{different}} computer programming languages, C++, Python, Processing, and Pixar's RenderMan?, {{were used to}} realize four different rendering programs. The goal was to identify the main challenges in implementation with each language and qualitatively evaluate each program once completed. A history of ray casting and rendering theory is introduced. Then, a set of ?ray tracing milestones? were established so that each language can address the challenges unique to that language. These milestones {{are related to the}} image synthesis process and include preliminary preparations, direct illumination, distributed ray tracing, and indirect illumination. After writing and reviewing with the four different computer programming languages, it was found that Processing offers the best opportunity for thoroughly implementing a rendering program because it will allow more time to be focused on rendering and ray casting theory, rather than language implementation process. It is inevitable that some learning must occur for all scripting languages with specific syntax-related challenges, but Processing's pre-packaging <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>system</b> makes the most versatile, accessible and requires a smaller learning curve than the other languages provided...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} fifty years, the finite element method {{has emerged as a}} {{successful}} methodology for solving a wide range of partial differential equations. At the heart of any finite element simulation is the assembly of matrices and vectors from finite element variational forms. In this paper, we present a general and unified framework for finite element assembly. Based on this framework, we propose a specific software interface (UFC) between problem-specific and general-purpose components of finite element programs. The interface is general {{in the sense that it}} applies to a wide range of finite element problems (including mixed finite elements and discontinuous Galerkin methods) and may be used with libraries that differ widely in their design. The interface consists of a minimal set of abstract C++ classes and data transfer is via plain C arrays. We discuss how one may use the UFC interface to build a <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>system</b> for finite element simulation where basic components such as computational meshes, linear algebra and, in particular, variational form evaluation may come from different libraries and be used interchangeably.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that the gated detectors of two commercially available quantum key distribution (QKD) systems are blindable and controllable by an eavesdropper using continuous-wave illumination and short bright trigger pulses, manipulating voltages in the circuit [L. Lydersen et al., Nat. Photonics DOI: 10. 1038 /nphoton. 2010. 214]. This allows for an attack eavesdropping the full raw and secret key without increasing the quantum bit error rate (QBER). Here we show how thermal effects in detectors under bright illumination {{can lead to the}} same outcome. We demonstrate that the detectors in a commercial QKD system Clavis 2 can be blinded by heating the avalanche photo diodes (APDs) using bright illumination, so-called thermal blinding. Further, the detectors can be triggered using short bright pulses once they are blind. For systems with pauses between packet transmission such as the <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>systems,</b> thermal inertia enables Eve to apply the bright blinding illumination before eavesdropping, making her more difficult to catch.

40|$|Extending {{the ideas}} of {{reconfigurable}} components and self-organizing, <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>systems</b> offer some very intriguing prospects for rapid satellites of the future. In this talk, we describe the “cellular satellite” as a paradigm for the ultimately modular and rapidly formed system. In this vision, all systems are formed as a vast ensemble of black-box cells, {{each of which is}} individually customizable to collectively form an integral system. Locally (within a given cell), all significant functions and properties (e. g., electrical, thermal, and mechanical) are softwaredefinable, similar in principle to the approaches used in ordinary field programmable gate arrays but extended far beyond digital building blocks. Systems are “merely” ensembles of cells whose arrangements are also soft-defined, leading to a DNA-like analogy in which a very long Boolean string, in effect, forms a unique specification of a constructible spacecraft. Initial attempts at cellular satellites would proceed with cells that are physically large (in some sense, the panels of our plug-and-play satellite could be viewed as very large cells), but would evolve through a Moore’s Law-like principle to become eventually tiny smart particles. We believe these ideas provide the ultimate solution for responsive space, in which containers of such “programmable matter” could be rapidly configured with powerful computer-automated design tools to form complex shapes, structures, and systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The most {{prominent}} solutions for efficient management of complexity and rapid {{changes in the}} modern enterprise world are standardisation efforts {{in the field of}} open distributed systems such as ISO Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) as well as a new <b>plug-and-play</b> component-based <b>system</b> development (CBD) paradigm. This paper shows the way for a seamless and meaningful integration of these two powerful concepts that can be beneficial for both sides. RM-ODP can adopt high-level component-based concepts in order to reach more consistent system specification, which can be effectively mapped to component-based system implementation using already available component technology. CBD can effectively use RM-ODP as an underlying specification framework in order to provide a systematic, consistent and integrated CBD approach, by integrating component concepts consistently into all phases and aspects of the enterprise system development, from business to implementation. ...|$|R
