5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, {{at any given time}} the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the <b>population</b> <b>is</b> simply its frequency in the population at that time.

5|$|The {{demographic}} characteristics of the population of Croatia are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29 million. The population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate; the natural growth rate of the <b>population</b> <b>is</b> negative. Croatia is in the fourth or fifth stage of the demographic transition. In terms of age structure, the <b>population</b> <b>is</b> dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment. The median age of the <b>population</b> <b>is</b> 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total <b>population</b> <b>is</b> 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E

5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a <b>population</b> <b>is</b> not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective <b>population</b> <b>is</b> usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the <b>population</b> <b>is</b> the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
