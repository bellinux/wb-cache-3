40|$|Perforations ("punctae") {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{characteristic}} morphological shell features in calcite brachiopods. The significance of <b>punctae</b> is that they represent discontinuities in shell biomineralisation and thus add a level of complexity that must be accounted for in any model of brachiopod shell formation. A significant hindrance to understanding <b>punctae</b> growth and formation is the absence of sufficient information on volume, size and density. Here, we use synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to obtain three-dimensional information about <b>punctae</b> of five species of calcite brachiopods. X-ray tomography shows that <b>punctae</b> morphology is species-specific and reveals previously unknown levels of complexity for each species. This information is combined with previous data on morphology to discuss the function and growth of <b>punctae.</b> Overall the present study demonstrates the need to increase our understanding of discontinuities and the role of cell biology in the context of biomineralisation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|ABSTRACT Kinesin- 5 is an {{essential}} mitotic motor. However, how its spatial–temporal distri-bution is regulated in mitosis remains poorly understood. We expressed localization and af-finity purification–tagged Eg 5 from a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (this construct was called mEg 5) and found its distribution to be tightly regulated throughout mitosis. Fluo-rescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed rapid Eg 5 turnover throughout mi-tosis, which cannot {{be accounted for by}} microtubule turnover. Total internal reflection fluo-rescence microscopy and high-resolution, single-particle tracking revealed that mEg 5 <b>punctae</b> on both astral and midzone microtubules rapidly bind and unbind. mEg 5 <b>punctae</b> on midzone microtubules moved transiently both toward and away from spindle poles. In contrast, mEg 5 <b>punctae</b> on astral microtubules moved transiently toward microtubule minus ends during early mitosis but switched to plus end–directed motion during anaphase. These observations explain the poleward accumulation of Eg 5 in early mitosis and its redistribution in anaphase. Inhibition of dynein blocked mEg 5 movement on astral microtubules, whereas depletion of the Eg 5 -binding protein TPX 2 resulted in plus end–directed mEg 5 movement. However, mo-tion of Eg 5 on midzone microtubules was not altered. Our results reveal differential and precise spatial and temporal regulation of Eg 5 in the spindle mediated by dynein and TPX 2...|$|R

40|$|Tumor cells use actin-rich {{protrusions}} called invadopodia {{to degrade}} extracellular matrix (ECM) and invade tissues; related structures, termed podosomes, are sites of dynamic ECM interaction. We show here that supervillin (SV), a peripheral membrane protein that binds F-actin and myosin II, reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and potentiates invadopodial function. Overexpressed SV induces redistribution of lamellipodial cortactin and lamellipodin/RAPH 1 / PREL 1 {{away from the}} cell periphery to internal sites and concomitantly increases the numbers of F-actin <b>punctae.</b> Most <b>punctae</b> are highly dynamic and colocalize with the podosome/invadopodial proteins, cortactin, Tks 5, and cdc 42. Cortactin binds SV sequences in vitro and contributes {{to the formation of}} enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) -SV induced <b>punctae.</b> SV localizes to the cores of Src-generated podosomes in COS- 7 cells and with invadopodia in MDA-MB- 231 cells. EGFP-SV overexpression increases average numbers of ECM holes per cell; RNA interference-mediated knockdown of SV decreases these numbers. Although SV knockdown alone has no effect, simultaneous down-regulation of SV and the closely related protein gelsolin reduces invasion through ECM. Together, our results show that SV is a component of podosomes and invadopodia and that SV plays a role in invadopodial function, perhaps as a mediator of cortactin localization, activation state, and/or dynamics of metalloproteinases at the ventral cell surface...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{pathogens}} {{of plant}} and animals share a homologous group of virulence factors, {{referred to as the}} YopJ effector family, which are translocated by the type III secretion (T 3 S) system into host cells during infection. Recent work indicates that some of these effectors encode acetyltransferases that suppress host immunity. The YopJ-like protein AvrBsT is known to activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in Arabidopsis thaliana Pi- 0 plants; however, the nature of its enzymatic activity and host target(s) has remained elusive. Here we report that AvrBsT possesses acetyltransferase activity and acetylates ACIP 1 (for ACETYLATED INTERACTING PROTEIN 1), an unknown protein from Arabidopsis. Genetic studies revealed that Arabidopsis ACIP family members are required for both pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) -triggered immunity and AvrBsT-triggered ETI during Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC 3000 (Pst DC 3000) infection. Microscopy studies revealed that ACIP 1 is associated with <b>punctae</b> on the cell cortex and some of these <b>punctae</b> co-localize with microtubules. These structures were dramatically altered during infection. Pst DC 3000 or Pst DC 3000 AvrRpt 2 infection triggered the formation of numerous, small ACIP 1 <b>punctae</b> and rods. By contrast, Pst DC 3000 AvrBsT infection primarily triggered the formation of large GFP-ACIP 1 aggregates, in an acetyltransferase-dependent manner. Our data reveal that members of the ACIP family are new components of the defense machinery required for anti-bacterial immunity. They also suggest tha...|$|R
40|$|Ultrastructure of {{the shell}} of Lingula unguis Linne, an inarticulate brachiopod, was studied mainly by {{electron}} microscopy to investigate mineralization {{of the shell}}. Lingula has a chitino-phosphatic shell, which consists of the periostracum, alternations of organic and mineralized layers, and the <b>punctae.</b> The {{main part of the}} periostracum shows a striped pattern almost perpendicular to the shell surface and covered by a triple-layered membrane. Showing an elaborate reticulated pattern the organic layer is made up of fine chitinous fibrils. The mineralized layer thins out antero-posteriorly and laterally. Not uniformely mineralized, it shows different grading zones of crystallites at different parts of the shell, as distinguished in the following: amorphous particles or minute granular crystallites; acicular crystallites which are arranged subparallel or intersected at a low angle; coalescent acicular crystallites which intersect irregularly. The organic matrix of the mineralized layer consists of fine proteineous fibrils without periodicity. Cytoplasmic projections of the epithelial cells intrude the <b>punctae,</b> and the distal ends of them adjoin the inner wall of the <b>punctae</b> by a net of fine threads. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that Lingula shell consisted of carbonate fluorapatite which was similar to francolite. Detected from an electron probe analysis were Ca, P, Mg, F, S, and Na.
