5000|$|ParMRC {{is known}} as one of the best systems for {{bacterial}} segregation. This system uses actin-like filaments to push plasmids, small DNA molecules within a cell that are physically separated from a chromosomal DNA and can replicate independently, to opposite poles of the cell. There the plasmids are segregated and can replicate without interference from the chromosomal DNA. During cell division many plasmids are plagued with low copy numbers and thus evolved active segregation to avoid plasmid loss during cell division [...] The process of this segregation is carried out by a small number of components, three to be exact, in the DNA, with incredible efficiency.

40|$|DNA {{partition}} or segregation is {{the process}} that ensures the stable inheritance of genomic material. The majority of the bacterial plasmid and some chromosomal <b>partition</b> <b>systems</b> utilize ParA Walker-box-based <b>partition</b> <b>systems.</b> These systems require three components: a DNA centromere site, the ParA ATPase, and the ParB centromere binding protein. ParB binds to the centromere to form the partition complex, which then recruits the motor protein ParA. ParA mediates the partition of replicated DNA by a still poorly understood mechanism. Notably, recent data indicates that ParA Walker-box-based <b>partition</b> <b>systems</b> are employed not only by bacterial plasmids and chromosomes but also DNA elements in archaea. The work in this thesis focused on a homolog of the ParA protein from the first identified archaeal plasmid <b>partition</b> <b>system,</b> located on the plasmid pNOB 8. pNOB 8 plasmid is harbored in the thermophilic archaeaon, Sulfolobus solfataricus. The goals of this work were to structurally and biochemically characterize the ParA homolog to gain insights into its function. Towards these goals, {{the structure of the}} ParA homolog was solved by X-ray crystallography in its apo and ADP bound states to resolutions of 2. 45 Å and 2. 73 Å, respectively. The overall structure was similar to bacterial ParA proteins. We next demonstrated that, similar to bacterial ParA proteins, this ParA homolog harbored ATP-dependent nonspecific DNA capabilities by using fluorescence polarization based DNA binding assays. By mutating the residues in the deviant Walker A motif, we were able to demonstrate the importance of ATP binding in its DNA binding function. Moreover, characterization of ATP and ADP binding were performed using ITC. Finally, we observed that ParA was able to form polymers in the presence of ATP, using negative stain electron microscopy. Our findings provide evidence that ParA Walker-box-based <b>partition</b> <b>systems,</b> which are the most common systems in bacteria, appear to also be found in archaea. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{condition}} monitoring system tracks real-world variables and alerts users when a predefined condition becomes true, e. g., when enemy planes take off, or when suspicious terrorist activities and communication are detected. However, a monitoring server can easily get overwhelmed by rapid incoming data. To prevent this, we partition the condition being monitored and distribute the workload onto several independent servers. In this paper, we study {{the problem of}} how to make a <b>partitioned</b> <b>system</b> behave “equivalently ” to a one-server system. We identify and formally define three desirable properties of a <b>partitioned</b> <b>system,</b> namely, orderedness, consistency, and completeness. We propose assignmentbased partitioning as a solution that can handle opaque conditions and simplifies load balancing. We also look at a few typical <b>partitioned</b> <b>systems,</b> and discuss their merits using several metrics that we define. Finally, an algorithm is presented to reduce complex system configurations to simpler ones. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} the umbral {{chromatic}} polynomial of a simplicial complex provides a combinatorial framework {{for the study of}} formal group laws over a commutative, torsion free ring, and our aim in this work is to extend its definition to a class of set systems P, which we label <b>partition</b> <b>systems.</b> When suitably evaluated, our polynomial χ φ (P; §) enumerates factorized colorings, as well as coloring forests of the <b>partition</b> <b>system</b> by type. These colorings are related to the Mullin-Rota concept of reluctant functions, and whenever P is a simplicial complex, they reduce to more familiar notions of coloring. Our three main results demonstrate how several properties of the classical chromatic polynomial χ(H; x), where H is a simple graph, may be generalized. Firstly, we prove that our polynomial χ φ (P; §) retains the property of being expressible as the characteristic polynomial of an appropriate poset, which holds for χ(H; x) by virtue of Whitney’s original definition. Secondly, we provide two generalizations for the formula describing the chromatic polynomial of a disjoint union of graphs; one of these formulas depends explicitly on the context of <b>partition</b> <b>systems</b> and is not available when we restrict attention to graphs or simplicial complexes. Thirdly, we introduce <b>partition</b> <b>systems</b> with group action, thereby providing a combinatorial interpretation of normalized versions of our polynomials. In the case of the symmetric group acting on the trivial <b>partition</b> <b>system,</b> these are the normalized conjugate Bell polynomials, whose interpretation is a vital prerequisite for extending our framework to formal group laws over arbitrary rings of scalars; here, however, we concentrate solely on combinatorial aspects. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Although layered coding {{solutions}} elegantly handle bandwidth heterogeneity among {{users in}} video conferencing, they also incur significant rate and complexity overheads. An alternative is partitioning the receiver sets and using non-layered coding for each group. In this paper, we investigate how {{to maximize the}} received video quality for both systems under uplink and downlink capacity constraints. We first show that any multicast tree is equivalent to a collection of depth- 1 and depth- 2 trees, under inbound and outbound flow constraints. For the layered system, we propose an algorithm that simultaneously solves {{for the number of}} video layers, the rate and distribution tree of each layer. For the receiver <b>partitioning</b> <b>system,</b> we develop an algorithm for determining the receiver partitions and tree construction for each group. Through numerical comparison study, we show that the receiver <b>partitioning</b> <b>system</b> achieves significantly higher video quality than the layered system, because of its higher coding efficiency.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of fluid-structure interaction {{can be a}} very time-consuming task due to the large amount of time steps that need to be taken in order to obtain an accurate solution. To reduce computing times a higher order time integration algorithm is applied. Based on a mixed combination of implicit and explicit multistage Runge-Kutta schemes, the proposed algorithm integrates <b>partitioned</b> <b>systems</b> with higher order accuracy in time even without the need for sub-iterations. The method outperforms current first and second order schemes. For physically strongly coupled interactions, sub-iterations are mandatory. The computing time of sub-iterations can be greatly reduced using a two-level approach in which the sub-iterations are performed on a coarse grid. This algorithm {{can be used to make}} a coarse grid prediction before solving the <b>partitioned</b> <b>system</b> on the fine grid or to make a coarse grid correction after solving the <b>partitioned</b> <b>system</b> on the fine grid.
