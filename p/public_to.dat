Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses– the first in the country. The pair worked with other experts from the Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards.|$|E
5|$|A CBC investigation, {{intended}} to test {{access to information}} following Bill 29, discovered that some departments and agencies were refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries. When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the-then Deputy Minister of Justice, Donald Burrage, said that {{the provisions of the}} act which enabled the <b>public</b> <b>to</b> see bonuses offered to public service employees had not been changed. Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary, or a salary range, plus a range of possible bonuses, are now available. However, he said {{that this was not a}} change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh <b>public</b> <b>to</b> a national hero.|$|E

5|$|Active {{resistance}} in Belgium {{took the form}} of sabotaging railways and lines of communication as well as hiding Jews and Allied airmen. The resistance produced large numbers of illegal newspapers in both French and Dutch, distributed to the <b>public</b> <b>to</b> provide news about the war not available in officially approved, censored newspapers. Some such publications achieved considerable success, such as La Libre Belgique, which reached a circulation of 70,000. Attacks on German soldiers were comparatively rare as the German administration made a practice of executing at least five Belgian hostages for each German soldier killed. At great personal risk, Belgian civilians also hid large numbers of Jews and political dissenters hunted by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access for the <b>public</b> <b>to</b> markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the <b>public</b> <b>to</b> assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
