5|$|David Jones, {{poet and}} author of In <b>Parenthesis</b> based on his war-time experiences.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram {{points out that}} rule 184, when run on {{patterns}} with density 50%, {{can be interpreted as}} parsing the context free language describing strings formed from nested parentheses. This interpretation is closely related to the ballistic annihilation view of rule 184: in Wolfram's interpretation, an open <b>parenthesis</b> corresponds to a left-moving particle while a close <b>parenthesis</b> corresponds to a right-moving particle.|$|E
5|$|Results in the Dutch-speaking {{electoral college}} {{is given in}} the <b>parenthesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Results in <b>parentheses</b> {{are those}} not {{counted in the}} final points score. Points totals without <b>parentheses</b> are {{championship}} points; those in <b>parentheses</b> are total points scored.|$|R
50|$|The {{proof that}} the {{language}} of balanced (i.e., properly nested) <b>parentheses</b> is not regular follows the same idea. Given p, there is a string of balanced <b>parentheses</b> that begins with more than p left <b>parentheses,</b> so that y will consist entirely of left <b>parentheses.</b> By repeating y, we can produce a string that does not contain {{the same number of}} left and right <b>parentheses,</b> and so they cannot be balanced.|$|R
5000|$|All {{procedure}} calls must be {{made with}} <b>parentheses</b> in VB.NET, whereas in Visual Basic 6 there were different conventions for functions (<b>parentheses</b> required) and subs (no <b>parentheses</b> allowed, unless called using the keyword [...] ).|$|R
5|$|The {{numbers in}} <b>parenthesis</b> {{represents}} {{the number of}} participants qualified.|$|E
5|$|The {{score of}} the playoff game is in <b>parenthesis</b> with the Packers score first no matter of the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{score of}} the playoff game is in <b>parenthesis</b> with the winning score first no matter the outcome for the Bears.|$|E
50|$|In {{combinatorial}} mathematics, the Lobb number Lm,n {{counts the}} number of ways that n + m open <b>parentheses</b> and n − m close <b>parentheses</b> can be arranged to form {{the start of a}} valid sequence of balanced <b>parentheses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Numbers without <b>parentheses</b> are {{retained}} championship {{points and}} numbers within <b>parentheses</b> are total points scored.|$|R
50|$|The nth number {{counts the}} number of {{different}} ways of inserting <b>parentheses</b> into a sequence of n symbols, with each pair of <b>parentheses</b> surrounding two or more symbols or parenthesized groups, and without any <b>parentheses</b> surrounding the entire sequence.|$|R
5|$|The table below {{shows some}} {{examples}} of how the cursive form is written. Dropped vowels are marked in <b>parenthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{legitimate}} syllable in Hokkien {{takes the}} form (initial) + (medial vowel) + nucleus + (stop) + tone, where items in <b>parenthesis</b> indicate optional components.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chart depicts Tech's lineup {{during the}} 1928 season with games {{started at the}} position shown in <b>parenthesis.</b> The chart mimics the offense after the jump shift has taken place.|$|E
5000|$|For example, the unnamed {{minor planet}} [...] has its number always written in <b>parentheses,</b> while for named minor planets such as (274301) Wikipedia, the <b>parentheses</b> may be dropped as in 274301 Wikipedia. <b>Parentheses</b> are now often omitted in {{prominent}} databases {{such as the}} SDBD. (Note: on English Wikipedia, named minor planets never use <b>parentheses</b> in their designations. However, redirects form parenthetical versions exist for most lower-numbered and well-known objects.) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Parentheses</b> in {{mathematics}} signify a different precedence of operators. For example: [...] equals 14, since the multiplication is done before the addition. However, [...] equals 20, because the <b>parentheses</b> override normal precedence, causing the addition {{to be done}} first. Some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that, when <b>parentheses</b> have one level of nesting, the inner pair are <b>parentheses</b> and the outer pair are square brackets. Example: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{one form}} of branch which does not require <b>parentheses</b> are ring-closing bonds. Choosing ring-closing bonds {{appropriately}} can {{reduce the number of}} <b>parentheses</b> required. For example, toluene is normally written as Cc1ccccc1 or c1ccccc1C, avoiding the <b>parentheses</b> required if written as c1ccc(C)ccc1 or c1ccc(ccc1)C.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} chart {{provides a}} visual depiction of Centre's lineup during the 1921 season with games {{started at the}} position reflected in <b>parenthesis.</b> The chart mimics a single wing on offense.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chart {{provides a}} visual depiction of Michigan's lineup during the 1901 season with games {{started at the}} position reflected in <b>parenthesis.</b> The chart mimics Yost's short punt formation while on offense, with the quarterback under center.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chart {{provides a}} visual depiction of Tech's lineup during the 1917 season with games {{started at the}} position reflected in <b>parenthesis.</b> The chart mimics the offense after the jump shift has taken place.|$|E
50|$|Operators in <b>parentheses</b> succeeded {{the railway}} {{operation}} of the lines. Lines not followed by <b>parentheses</b> were substituted by buses.|$|R
5000|$|... (In <b>parentheses</b> Low Saxon names. If no <b>parentheses</b> {{are given}} the {{official}} German name is a loan from Low Saxon.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Factor the {{expression}} [...] from {{the expression}} inside the <b>parentheses.</b> In addition, add and subtract the expression [...] inside the <b>parentheses.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} chart {{provides a}} visual depiction of Vanderbilt's lineup during the 1906 season with games {{started at the}} position reflected in <b>parenthesis.</b> The chart mimics a short punt formation while on offense, with the quarterback under center.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Parenthesis</b> (1937) by David Jones, {{in which}} he {{reflects}} on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War. Jones put a quotation from the Gododdin {{at the beginning of}} each of the seven sections of In <b>Parenthesis.</b> Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used Y Gododdin as the basis of his difficult but much-admired poem For the Fallen (1997), written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line 'Men went to Catraeth', using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of Y Gododdin are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheers’s Pink Mist (2012), an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan; the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, our {{conclusion}} is that the order of <b>parenthesis</b> matters, and that our task {{is to find the}} optimal order of <b>parenthesis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Treat any sub-expression in <b>parentheses</b> as {{a single}} recursively-evaluated operand (there may be {{different}} kinds of <b>parentheses</b> though, with different semantics).|$|R
5000|$|Only {{the best}} 4 results counted towards the Championship. Numbers without <b>parentheses</b> are Championship points; numbers in <b>parentheses</b> are total points scored.|$|R
50|$|Supplementary English {{titles in}} <b>parentheses</b> are nonce {{translations}} for this article; those outside <b>parentheses</b> and in quotation marks were {{used at the}} time.|$|R
25|$|The teams' pre-tournament Elo rankings {{are shown}} in <b>parenthesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The year in <b>parenthesis</b> is {{the last}} year of examination.|$|E
25|$|All tracks {{composed}} by Bo Hansson, original song titles in <b>parenthesis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Parentheses</b> the {{previous}} model, the fx-29, {{did not have}} <b>parentheses</b> despite also being a scientific calculator. The fx-39 has 6 levels of brackets.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, {{the outer}} pair of <b>parentheses</b> {{maintain}} correct order of operation. For example, [...] expands to without <b>parentheses,</b> [...] gives precedence to the division.|$|R
5000|$|... {{where the}} colon {{represents}} the outer (...) , {{the next two}} dots represent the <b>parentheses</b> around ~p and ~q, the third dot represents the <b>parentheses</b> around p ∧ q, and the fourth dot (rather confusingly) represents the logical symbol ∧ rather than a pair of <b>parentheses.</b> This uses the definition (followed by the explanatory comment): ...|$|R
