50|$|A tower {{testing station}} {{is a special}} plant for testing various design for towers for {{transmission}} lines and similar uses. A tower testing station consists of two steel stands and one or more foundations, on which {{a sample of the}} tower can be built. The number of test conditions is normally limited to between six and eight individual cases, with loading condition such as reduced wind and ice. The towers to be tested are erected on rigid foundation and the wire ropes attached to the loading point required. Loading may either be applied by 'dead' weights using scale pans, winches or hydraulic rams. In the latter cases a load cell or dyamometer is placed in the rigging adjacent to the point of loading at the structure. The loading methods induce strain by pulling cables away from the tower to the specified loads. The <b>pulling</b> <b>load</b> is indicated through a strain gauge placed on the pulling point. Loading points on a tower naturally encompasses longitudinal, transverse and vertical components, either as individual or a combined resultant load.|$|E

Breeds such as the Connemara pony, are recognized {{for their ability to}} carry a full-sized adult rider. Pound for pound ponies can pull and carry more weight than a horse. Draft-type ponies are able to <b>pull</b> <b>loads</b> significantly greater than their own weight, with larger ponies capable of <b>pulling</b> <b>loads</b> comparable to those pulled by full-sized draft horses, and even very small ponies able to pull as much as 450 percent of their own weight.|$|R

For instance, sled dogs <b>pull</b> <b>loads</b> but do not normally carry them, while working elephants {{have been used for}} centuries to haul logs out of forests.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates and {{discusses}} the composite behavior of geosynthetic reinforced soil mass. It {{presents the results}} of a series of large-scale laboratory tests supported by analytical methods to examine the performance of geogrid reinforcement subjected to static and cyclic pullout loading. The testing equipment and procedures used for this investigation are outlined. The results show that geosynthetic reinforcement can mobilize great resistance to static <b>pulling</b> <b>load</b> under high confining pressures. The reinforcement exhibits gradual deformation under cyclic loading showing no sign of imminent pullout failure for all levels of applied loads. In general, the results demonstrate that geosynthetic can be used in situations where loads are non-static, although care will be required in ensuring that appropriate factors of safety are applied to control the resulting deformation. A simplified analytical model for calculating the pulling capacity of geosynthetic reinforcement is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Mo fiber-reinforced resin mineral {{composite}} (RMC) {{belongs to}} a multiphase material, whose mechanical strength depends on the property of components and microstructure characteristics of Mo fibers including surface state, fiber content, fiber shape, and so on. The reinforcing mechanism of Mo fiber is analyzed and the reinforcing effects of new and scrap fibers on RMC are studied, respectively, in the paper. Typical samples with different fiber parameters are prepared to validate the aforementioned assumptions. Experimental results and finite element simulation prove that scrap Mo fibers can improve the mechanical properties of RMC better than ordinary new Mo fibers because of the discharge pits randomly distributed {{on the surface of}} scrap fibers. The reinforcing effect is best while the fiber content is 1. 2 % of the total mass. If the length, diameter, and mass fraction of fibers are identical, special-shaped fibers such as U, V, N, W perform better obviously, and their maximum <b>pulling</b> <b>load</b> is much bigger than ordinary linear fibers...|$|E

Fiber pulling out micromechanics is governing the macro-crack opening process.

In the present paper are presented numerical simulations and experimental investigations results of a single and few non-metallic fibers were embedded into concrete matrix and were subjected to external applied <b>pulling</b> <b>load.</b> Numerical modeling was performed using 3 D FEM approach. Experimental data analysis shown that the pull-out process for single fiber can be divided into three stages- a) fiber pull-out with perfect bond between fiber and concrete matrix; b) fiber pull-out with partial debond (cylindrical crack) between concrete matrix and fiber, started from concrete matrix surface; c) fully debonded fiber pull-out of concrete matrix. All above mentioned stages were investigated theoretically and experimentally. Few fibers bundle has “telescopical” pull-out mechanism if it is not penetrated by concrete properly...|$|E

It was an experiment. The amount of energy output was measured by indirect calorimetry, based on inhaled oxygen (O 2) and exhaled carbon dioxide (CO 2). The MetaMax 3 B instrument was used to analyze inhaled and exhaled gases. Testing took place on a plane where everybody pulled 6 -minute 15 kg sleigh and then carried a 6 -minute 15 kg backpack at a speed of 4. 5 km / h. Results: In 8 of the 9 tested, there was less energy expenditure when <b>pulling</b> the <b>load</b> on sleds than carrying it in the backpack. In 5 of the 9 tested, the difference between pulling and carrying was greater than the average difference of 4. 57 kJ / min.

40|$|A {{number of}} human-centred methodologies-subjective, objective, and combined-are used for {{slipperiness}} measurement. They comprise {{a variety of}} approaches from biomechanically-oriented experiments to psychophysical tests and subjective evaluations. The objective {{of this paper is}} to review some of the research done in the field, including such topics as awareness and perception of slipperiness, postural and balance control, rating scales for balance, adaptation to slippery conditions, measurement of unexpected movements, kinematics of slipping, and protective movements during falling. The role of human factors in slips and falls will be discussed. Strengths and weaknesses of human-centred approaches in relation to mechanical slip test methodologies are considered. Current friction-based criteria and thresholds for walking without slipping are reviewed for a number of work tasks. These include activities such as walking on a level or an inclined surface, running, stopping and jumping, as well as stair ascent and descent, manual exertion (pushing and <b>pulling,</b> <b>load</b> carrying, lifting) and particular concerns of the elderly and mobility disabled persons. Some future directions for slipperiness measurement and research in the field of slips and falls are outlined. Human-centred approaches for slipperiness measurement do have many applications. First, they are utilized to develop research hypotheses and models to predict workplace risks caused by slipping. Second, they are important alternatives to apparatus-based friction measurements and are used to validate such methodologies. Third, they are used as practical tools for evaluating and monitoring slip resistance properties of footwear, anti-skid devices and floor surfaces...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the failure behaviour of composite sandwich T-joint structures under <b>pulling</b> <b>load.</b> A FE model of the T-joint structure was created and validated by test data for the purpose of design improvement. The critical regions were identified in and underneath the cleats, which are made to joint the base and web panels and transfer the load. Experimental and FE results showed that the T-joint failure is due to the excessive shear stress in the cleat and a combined shear and tensile stress in the adhesive layer between the composite base panel and the cleats. It was also shown that the presence of a circular cutout in the web panel near the joint reduces the failure load by 18 %. The current conventional T-joint design is proved to be very effective despite of its complex manufacture. Alternative designs for low cost manufacture were therefore proposed and evaluated. One of the options proved to be an improved design to compete with the conventional one in terms of structural strength and low cost manufacture.

Relationships were identified between the morphology, performance, and ecology. Species that did not feed on hard prey clustered in the gracile region of cranial morphospace and exhibited significantly higher levels of strain during biting (P = 0. 0106). Species that fed on large prey clustered in the elongate area of mandible morphospace. This relationship differs from those that have been identified in other taxonomic groups such as crocodiles and mammals.
