By the 1930s, their act consisted of wisecracking leader Groucho, the chronically silent Harpo, the overly ethnic Chico, and the strangely normal Zeppo. The plot of the seminal comedy Duck Soup (1933) is quite convoluted. Groucho's plebeian character is named king of the fictional Freedonia, and he is pursued by two bumbling spies played by Chico and Harpo. Zeppo plays a typically normal secretary. Groucho's con artist character leads Freedonia into war with neighboring Sylvania. The plot essentially exists to {{provide a framework for}} several comedic bits and long sketches. The film was unsuccessful at the box office and the anarchic zaniness and subversive nature of the comedy in the film would be unmatched in the brothers' <b>post-Code</b> work, which was more standardly burlesque.|$|E

2500|$|Female protagonists in aggressively sexual vice {{films were}} usually of two general kinds: the bad girl or the fallen woman. In {{so-called}} [...] "bad girl" [...] pictures, female characters profit from promiscuity and immoral behavior. Jean Harlow, an actress who was by all reports a lighthearted, kind person off the screen, frequently played bad girl characters and dubbed them [...] "sex vultures". Two {{of the most}} prominent examples of bad girl films were Red-Headed Woman (1932) and Baby Face (1933). In Red-Headed Woman, Jean Harlow plays a secretary determined to sleep her way into a more luxurious lifestyle. She seduces her boss and intentionally breaks up his marriage. During her seductions, he tries to resist and slaps her, at which point she looks at him deliriously and replies [...] "Do it again, I like it! Do it again!" [...] They eventually marry but Harlow seduces a wealthy aged industrialist who is in business with her husband so that she can move to New York. Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots the original boss, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France {{in the back seat of}} a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur. The film was a boon to Harlow's career and has been described as a [...] "trash masterpiece." [...] Similarly, in Baby Face Barbara Stanwyck is an abused runaway determined to use sex to advance herself financially and sleeps her way to the top of Gotham Trust. Her progress is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from <b>post-code</b> films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) provides a viable solution to communicate over frequency selective fading channels. However, {{in the presence}} of frequency nulls in the channel response, the uncoded OFDM faces serious symbol recovery problems. As an alternative to previously reported error correction techniques in the form of pre-coding for OFDM, we propose the use of <b>post-coding</b> of OFDM symbols in order to achieve frequency diversity. Our proposed novel <b>post-coded</b> OFDM (PC-OFDM) comprises of two steps: 1) upsampling of OFDM symbols and 2) subsequent multiplication of each symbol with unit magnitude complex exponentials. It is important to mention that PC-OFDM introduces redundancy in OFDM symbols while precoded OFDM introduces redundancy in data symbols before performing the IFFT operation. The main advantages of this scheme are reduction in system complexity by having a simple encoder/decoder, smaller size IFFT/FFT (inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform) modules, and lower clock rates in the receiver and transmitter leading to lower energy consumption. The proposed system is found to be equally good over Gaussian and fading channels where it achieves the maximum diversity gain of the channel. Simulation results show that PC-OFDM performs better than existing precoded OFDM and Pulse OFDM systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} the achievable spectral efficiency and on the energy efficiency for a wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) link operating at millimeter wave frequencies (mmWave) in a typical 5 G scenario. Two different single-carrier modem schemes are considered, i. e., a traditional modulation scheme with linear equalization at the receiver, and a single-carrier modulation with cyclic prefix, frequency-domain equalization and FFT-based processing at the receiver; these two schemes are compared with a conventional MIMO-OFDM transceiver structure. Our analysis jointly {{takes into account the}} peculiar characteristics of MIMO channels at mmWave frequencies, the use of hybrid (analog-digital) pre-coding and <b>post-coding</b> beamformers, the finite cardinality of the modulation structure, and the non-linear behavior of the transmitter power amplifiers. Our results show that the best performance is achieved by single-carrier modulation with time-domain equalization, which exhibits the smallest loss due to the non-linear distortion, and whose performance can be further improved by using advanced equalization schemes. Results also confirm that performance gets severely degraded when the link length exceeds 90 - 100 meters and the transmit power falls below 0 dBW.

40|$|Multimedia {{contents}} {{are inherently}} sensitive signals {{that must be}} protected whenever they are outsourced to an untrusted environment. This problem becomes a challenge when the untrusted environment must perform some processing on the sensitive signals; a paradigmatic example is Cloud-based signal processing services. Approaches based on Secure Signal Processing (SSP) address this challenge by proposing novel mechanisms for signal processing in the encrypted domain and interactive secure protocols to achieve the goal of protecting signals without disclosing the sensitive information they convey. This work presents a novel and comprehensive set of approaches and primitives to efficiently process signals in an encrypted form, by using Number Theoretic Transforms (NTTs) in innovative ways. This usage of NTTs paired with appropriate signal pre- and <b>post-coding</b> enables {{a whole range of}} easily composable signal processing operations comprising, among others, filtering, generalized convolutions, matrix-based processing or error correcting codes. The main focus is on unattended processing, in which no interaction from the client is needed; for implementation purposes, efficient lattice-based somewhat homomorphic cryptosystems are used. We exemplify these approaches and evaluate their performance and accuracy, proving that the proposed framework opens up a wide variety of new applications for secured outsourced-processing of multimedia contents.
