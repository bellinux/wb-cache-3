5|$|Neuner {{averaged}} a career shooting accuracy of 78%. Her career {{average in the}} <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> was 88%, while her career average in the standing position was 67%. Her shooting results in the <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> were similar to other top contenders. The standing shoot had long been her weak point and her hit percentage was well below average in the World Cup field, although it had improved considerably in her later seasons.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> onto their backs. The coaster then {{performs}} a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the <b>prone</b> <b>position.</b> After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|Jackson was {{eventually}} sent to Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan to help form the first Air Force Rifle Team and trained at Palm Beach Air Force Base in West Palm Beach, Florida {{during the winter}} months. His next international stop was the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships, where he took home gold in the 50 m rifle <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> with 60 (individual and team) and 40 shots (individual) and the bronze in the 300 m standard rifle (individual) and 50 m rifle <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> with 40 shots (team). He then traveled to the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal in the 50 m rifle prone event and finished 12th {{in a field of}} 44 competitors in the 50 m rifle three positions tournament. Upon his return to the United States, he discovered that he had been promoted to the rank of Captain.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion The <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> in French-speaking {{pediatric}} {{intensive care}} units {{is not very}} well protocolized. Nevertheless, the care not seems to be significantly impacted by the <b>prone</b> <b>positioning.</b> Future research {{should focus on the}} evaluation of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> nursing protocols.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: In {{patients}} who respond to <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> by the highest improvement in oxygenation, DPL significantly decrease after <b>prone</b> <b>positioning.</b> The changes in DPL {{and the changes}} in EL {{play a major role}} in the improvement in oxygenation induced by <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> whereas the changes in DPCW and ECW do not.|$|R
30|$|When used in {{combination}} with VV-ECMO, 24  h of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> improves both oxygenation and respiratory system compliance. Moreover, our study confirms the absence of serious adverse events. Currently, it remains unknown when and for which indication <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> should be systematically applied during VV-ECMO. Therefore, further {{studies are needed to}} better delineate <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> indications during VV-ECMO.|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> are positive indicators.|$|E
5|$|The 1954 ISSF World Shooting Championships were {{dominated}} by the Soviet Union, but Jackson still managed to take home a gold medal {{as a member of}} the United States' 50+100 m rifle <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> team. He fared better at the 1955 Pan American Games, taking home gold medals in both the individual and team versions of the rifle, three positions and prone at 50 meters, as well as the team high power rifle, three positions at 50 meters. He married Nancy Ord in 1956 and began training for that year's Summer Olympics, where he again finished 12th in a field of 44 competitors in the 50 m rifle three positions event and 31st in among 44 participants in the 50 m rifle prone tournament.|$|E
5|$|As for the Street Fighter series, {{starting}} from Street Fighter X Tekken, Poison {{has a unique}} moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques and her own streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done {{in a similar fashion}} to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original Final Fight games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once it hits, she flips into the air and lands with a hard hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a <b>prone</b> <b>position.</b> Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a final blow that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained her signature backflip from the original game.|$|E
30|$|Few {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{the effect of}} <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> focused on influenza pneumonia-related ARDS patients. Xu et al. [16] studied H 7 N 9 influenza patients with <b>prone</b> <b>positioning,</b> and decrease in carbon dioxide retention was noted, but no clinical outcome was mentioned. Moreover, what factors that can predict the efficacy of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> in severe ARDS are not entirely clear [17].|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of kinetic therapy beds for automated <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> and axial rotation in critically ill nontrauma patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There were 17 patients with ARDS who underwent automated <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> using a kinetic therapy bed. The mean age was 51 + 14 years; 12 were females and 12 were Caucasian. The most common admission diagnosis was sepsis (n 5). The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) 2 score was 30 + 9 with mean predicted mortality of 65 % + 25 %. At the time of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning,</b> all patients met the criteria for ARDS. The mean ratio of PaO 2 to FIO 2 (P/F ratio) before initiation of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> was 89 + 33 and rose to 224 + 92 after at least 30 minutes of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> (P <. 0001). There was no significant change in PaCO 2 or mean airway pressure. There were no instances of accidental endotracheal tube and central or peripheral venous or arterial catheter dislodgement. Eleven (65 %) patients developed new pressure ulcers, 10 (59 %) patients developed new skin tears, and all had conjunctival edema during the course of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning.</b> The median duration of automated <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> was 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 3. 5 - 8. 5) days. Eleven (65 %) patients died during hospitalization and 7 required percutaneous tracheostomy for long-term ventilator support. Automated <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> using a kinetic therapy bed is a safe and effective means of improving oxygenation in critically ill patients with ARDS. Larger randomized studies are needed to compare it to conventional ventilation strategies, conventional <b>prone</b> <b>positioning,</b> and to assess the impact on mortality...|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, on the Union right, Lew Wallace {{formed an}} attacking column with three brigades—one {{from his own}} division, one from McClernand's, and one from Smith's—to try {{to regain control of}} ground lost in the battle that morning. Wallace's old brigade (11th Indiana and 8th Missouri), now {{commanded}} by Col. Morgan. Wall L. Smith, and others from McClernand's and Wallace's divisions were chosen to lead the attack. The brigades of Cruft (Wallace's Division) and Leonard F. Ross (McClernand's Division) were placed in support on the flanks. Wallace ordered the attack forward. Smith, the 8th Missouri, and the 11th Indiana advanced a short distance up the hill using Zouave tactics, where the men repeatedly rushed and then fell to the ground in a <b>prone</b> <b>position.</b> By 5:30p.m. Wallace's troops had succeeded in retaking the ground lost that morning, and by nightfall, the Confederate troops had been driven back to their original positions. Grant began plans to resume his assault in the morning, although neglecting to close the escape route that Pillow had opened.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a <b>prone</b> <b>position,</b> as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to New York, Jackson joined the Long Island Antlers Club and resumed {{competitive}} sport shooting, {{as well as his}} career at Sperry's. He was admitted into St. John's University on a shooting scholarship, but declined, and instead entered the Clarence H. White School of Modern Photography. During his studies he earned a spot on the United States' delegation to shooting at the 1948 Summer Olympics, where he finished 16th in a field of 36 competitors in the 300 metre rifle three positions event. He then took up a job at the Pratt Institute in the photography department and began training for the 1949 ISSF World Shooting Championships, where he won gold in the 50+100 m rifle <b>prone</b> <b>position</b> individual event and silver in the team version. In 1950 he turned down a position as head of promotions at the Winchester Repeating Arms Company so that he could continue competing, with his next international stop being the 1951 Pan American Games. Here he captured the only two gold medals not won by the Argentinians in individual events, the three positions and prone rifle competitions at 50 meters, as well as silver in the high power rifle, three positions at 50 meters tournament. Upon his return, he was ordered to Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, Colorado to join the Radar Photo Interpreters' School. Following graduation, he reported to Strategic Air Command in Roswell, New Mexico.|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effect of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> in influenza pneumonia-related ARDS patients.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{therapeutic}} options for refractory hypoxemia {{in patients with}} severe ARDS [6, 7], {{but only a few}} options have been confirmed with clinical validity by previous studies, including higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [8, 9], lower tidal volume [10], neuromuscular blocking agents [11] and <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> [12]. <b>Prone</b> <b>positioning</b> was first suggested in 1974 [13]; however, the clinical benefit of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> in patients with ARDS was not confirmed until 2013 when the PROSEVA study showed decreased 28 -day and 90 -day mortality and increased ventilator-free days only when it was started early and there were sufficiently long sessions [12]. Further, meta-analysis by Cochrane database also revealed that <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> would reduce the mortality rate when used with lung-protective strategies and longer duration in patients with severe ARDS [14, 15].|$|R

30|$|Most of {{the studies}} {{evaluating}} the effect of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> were in ARDS patients with heterogeneous risk factors [14, 15]. For specific conditions such as burns, <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> has been demonstrated to safely implement and improve oxygenation (in burn patients with severe ARDS) in a burn intensive care unit [24]. The present study was more homogenous and specific to patients with ARDS caused by influenza pneumonia. Systematic review and meta-analysis studies in <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> have revealed decreased mortality in patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, but not in less severe hypoxemia. Survival benefits were noted using a range of PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio thresholds up to approximately 140  mm Hg [25] or less than 200  mm Hg [26]. In the present study, the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was 95.9 [*]±[*] 54.5  mm Hg before <b>prone</b> <b>positioning.</b> However, the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was not significantly different between 60 -day survivors and 60 -day non-survivors (102.3 [*]±[*] 59.8  mm Hg vs. 81.3 [*]±[*] 37.6  mm Hg, p[*]=[*] 0.153). In terms of the response of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> to ARDS, the different entities of the risk factor possibly produce different outcomes. In addition to severity of hypoxemia, further clinical trials would assist in clarifying the survival benefits of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> in the specific risk factors.|$|R

25|$|A {{bone marrow}} biopsy may {{be done in}} a health care provider's office or in a hospital. Informed consent for the {{procedure}} is typically required. The patient is asked to lie on their abdomen (<b>prone</b> <b>position)</b> or on their side (lateral decubitus position). The skin is cleansed, and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine or procaine is injected to numb the area. Patients may also be pretreated with analgesics and/or anti-anxiety medications, although this is not a routine practice.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} Japanese designs, {{it had a}} very low profile and was {{intended}} to be operated from a squat or <b>prone</b> <b>position.</b> The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner and open carriage-style legs which could be spread to improve the stability. The breech had a semi-automatic cartridge case ejection system to improve reloading time. When the shell was loaded, the rear of the cartridge case tripped a catch closing the breechblock. The recoil action of firing opened the breech and extracted the cartridge case.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) {{is often}} used in patients with severe respiratory failure to improve oxygenation and survival. ECMO gives the lungs an opportunity to rest and recover. The addition of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> therapy used concurrently with ECMO can further aid in optimizing alveolar recruitment and reducing ventilator-induced lung injury, ultimately resulting in fewer ICU admission days and improved overall survival. The objective of this review is to perform a systematic analysis of the complications reported with <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> and ECMO in the adult population and to briefly report on the patient outcomes in the studies. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched from January 1, 1960 to September 14, 2014. Studies were included if they examined both extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> simultaneously {{for the treatment of}} respiratory failure in the adult population. RESULTS: Seven studies fit the study inclusion criteria (1 prospective cohort study, 3 retrospective cohort studies, and 3 case series). All of the studies in this review reported no occurrence of ECMO cannula dislodgment, and 2 studies reported cannula site bleeding. Chest tube dislodgment and airway dislodgment did not occur in any of the studies included. Bleeding from the chest tube site was reported in 13. 5 % of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> maneuvers in 1 study, {{and the rest of the}} studies reported no evidence of chest tube site bleeding. Of the 2 studies that reported hemodynamic instability during the <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> maneuvers, very few adverse hemodynamic episodes were reported. The authors who reported adverse effects stated that the episodes were quickly and successfully reversible. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the limited complications documented during <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> and ECMO. More studies are needed to assess the clinical efficacy of the addition of <b>prone</b> <b>positioning</b> therapy to ECMO for patients in severe respiratory failure...|$|R
