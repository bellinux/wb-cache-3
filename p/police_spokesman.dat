5000|$|As a {{mechanism}} for fomenting terror and evading accountability for the assassination program, the government of Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia waged an intensive publicity campaign in which it issued regular statistics to the press on political assassinations and disappearances of persons whom it explicitly labeled [...] "criminals" [...] and [...] "subversives".

25|$|Alongside Barkley, {{his former}} Olympic teammate, {{he was also}} teamed with Hakeem Olajuwon, but there were {{chemistry}} problems, especially with Barkley. Pippen had his first triple-double in a 93–87 loss against the Atlanta Hawks as he had 15 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in addition to 1 steal in 46 minutes of play. On April 22, 1999, Pippen was detained under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. A Houston police officer who stopped Pippen about 1:30a.m. said the Rockets' star ran a red light. A member of the department's DWI task force was called after it was suspected Pippen was intoxicated, Houston <b>police</b> <b>spokesman</b> Fred King said. The charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. He had his second triple-double {{of the season in}} a 106–101 loss against the Los Angeles Clippers as he had 23 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds in addition to 6 steals in 45 minutes of play. Despite averaging a career high in minutes per game with 40.2 and finishing 4th in the NBA in minutes played, Pippen averaged 14.5 points per game, his lowest since his rookie year, and he made a career-low 43.2 percent of his shots. He also averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists and was named to the NBA All-Defensive first team for the 8th time. The Rockets finished the season with a 31–19 record, finishing third in the Midwest Division and fifth in the Western Conference. They faced the Los Angeles Lakers {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. In Game 3 of the series, Pippen scored 37 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 block in order to stave off elimination. The Lakers would go on to win the series the following game as they defeated the Rockets 98–88 and took the series 3–1.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{intimidation}} is from official sources. Activists {{have been}} arrested and had their residences searched, police have demonstrated elevated levels of violent suppression and brutality. The heavy-handed policing, {{including the use of}} tear gas on peaceful protesters, was widely credited with inspiring tens of thousands of citizens to join the protests in Admiralty. However, <b>police</b> <b>spokesmen</b> maintained that officers exercised [...] "maximum tolerance" [...] and blamed the violence on protesters, although this has been contradicted by the media.|$|R
2500|$|The police {{confirmed}} that they fired tear gas 87 times.

5000|$|Matches against England, {{which used}} to be played on an annual basis as part of the British Home Championship, were {{eventually}} stopped after 1989 due to violence and organised hooliganism.

500|$|On Sunday, January 16, 2011, {{eight days}} after the shooting, Vietnam War veteran James Eric Fuller, who {{had been shot in}} the knee during the attack, was arrested for disorderly conduct at a town hall meeting. After Tucson Tea Party figure Trent Humphries, who had faulted Giffords for not having enough security, stated that gun control {{measures}} should not be discussed until all those killed in the shooting were buried, Fuller allegedly took a picture of Humphries and shouted, [...] "You're dead." [...] In an interview during the week after the shooting, Fuller had criticized Palin and what he called the [...] "Tea Party crime-syndicate" [...] for promoting a divisive political climate before the attacks. The police then committed him to an undisclosed medical facility to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. A <b>police</b> <b>spokesman</b> stated that the hospital will determine when he will be released.

According to a <b>police</b> <b>spokesman,</b> at least 60% of streets in Port Arthur were inundated by water. In Orange County, two people were injured in automobile accidents. Along Highway 124, a bayou overflowed its bank. Because there were numerous inundated streets, police barricaded roads in Beaumont, Bridge City, Orange, Vidor, and Port Arthur. A sewer system in Roscoe was also damaged by flood waters, leaving 1,500residents without running water. In Port Arthur, twelve homes were reported flooded; one house in the Lakeview neighborhood had [...] of water inside.
