5000|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, one-off 16-inch [...] rpm lacquer discs {{were used}} by radio {{networks}} to archive recordings of their live broadcasts, and by local stations to delay the broadcast of network programming or to <b>prerecord</b> their own productions.|$|R
5|$|When Bowman finally {{disconnects}} Hal, a <b>prerecorded</b> {{video message}} from Floyd reveals {{the existence of}} the monolith on the moon, its purpose and origin unknown. With the exception of one short but extremely powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the object has been inert. Only Hal had been told of the mission's true objectives.|$|E
5|$|Eggman sneaks {{away with}} the last Emerald and arms the Eclipse Cannon. When he tries to fire it, the colony begins falling and a <b>prerecorded</b> message from Gerald broadcasts: he {{programmed}} the ARK to collide with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like <b>prerecorded</b> ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5000|$|Kennedy sparked {{controversy}} after a [...] "crow-call", which {{sounded like}} the word [...] "fuck", was broadcast in March 1975 (see below). Forced to <b>prerecord</b> from that point on, he abruptly departed following GTV-9's censorship of the 16 April 1975 edition.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{recording}} technology {{continued to}} evolve, {{making it easier}} to record and replay sound. As this happened, the more commonly used and harder-to-replicate sound effects were pre-recorded to make them more accessible. <b>Prerecording</b> also allowed the same sound effect to be used many times.|$|R
50|$|An {{animated}} sketch {{that first}} appeared on the show, The Ambiguously Gay Duo, featuring the voices of Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, became well known on SNL after Carvey's show was canceled. Additionally, a sketch used in the unaired eighth episode about Tom Brokaw <b>prerecording</b> the announcement of Gerald Ford's death was used verbatim when Carvey hosted Saturday Night Live on October 26, 1996.|$|R
5|$|Turunen {{enrolled}} in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe {{to gain a}} professional qualification as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the <b>prerecorded</b> instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.|$|E
5|$|The Dangerously in Love Tour was {{the debut}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Beyoncé. Although the tour {{was intended to}} showcase songs from her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love, (2003) the set list also contained a special segment dedicated to Beyoncé's girl group Destiny's Child and featured songs from her 2003 film The Fighting Temptations. The stage was simple and featured a large LED screen in the back that displayed video images of Beyoncé and her dancers, {{as well as some}} images from her music videos and some <b>prerecorded</b> images. The tour was reviewed negatively by Dave Simpson of The Guardian who graded it with two stars out of five. The Dangerously in Love Tour only reached Europe and Beyoncé's performance, at the Wembley Arena in London, was filmed and later released on the CD/DVD Live at Wembley (2004).|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Motoi Sakuraba, who had composed {{for nearly all}} the previous Tales games, and his regular partner Shinji Tamura, the latter working under the alias Hibiki Aoyama. While creating the soundtrack, Sakuraba {{was caught in the}} transition between sequenced to <b>prerecorded</b> streamed music, the latter of which gave room for rearrangements and improvisation mid-production. Sequenced music had been used up to Abyss, so {{it was the first time}} in the series that Sakuraba used this method, although he had done so for all his other projects at the time. For some tracks, a heavy piano element was used, with Sakuraba playing the instrument. Tamura worked with Sakuraba to create different feelings for the various tracks: character themes were melodic, dungeon themes were given a simple and minimalist mood, while town themes struck a balance between these two approaches. In addition to original tracks, three remixed tracks from other Namco Bandai games were included.|$|E
50|$|The {{perils of}} live {{transmission}} {{caught up with}} the production team on 28 November 1958, early in Newman's tenure. Whilst Underground was being broadcast, a key actor suddenly collapsed and died. Such nightmare situations could be handled more easily when Armchair Theatre was able to benefit from <b>prerecording</b> on videotape, after production of the series moved from Manchester to Teddington Studios near London in the summer of 1959.|$|R
40|$|A self-administered {{questionnaire}} {{designed for}} <b>prerecording</b> the routine clinical information required from outpatients {{has been found}} to be acceptable to them. Such a questionnaire should greatly ease the collection and recording of basic clinical information and offer the doctor more effective use of his time. With the questionnaire more information was recorded and therefore available in the case notes than at a conventional doctor-patient consultation. No administrative problems occurred in its distribution, use, and return...|$|R
5000|$|The Marlene Dietrich Collection Berlin's archival {{holdings}} include soundtrack <b>prerecording</b> discs and unissued {{radio and}} concert recordings. The following of Dietrich's studio recordings remain unreleased: [...] "Du, du liegst mir im Herzen", [...] "Aus der Jugendzeit", [...] "Das zerbrochene Ringlein", [...] "Treue Liebe" [...] (all recorded July 1954 with Jimmy Carroll and orchestra) and [...] "Wot cher! 'Em In the Old Kent Road" [...] (recorded in 1955 with Wally Stott and orchestra).|$|R
5|$|The {{projector}} {{could be}} controlled by a console where an individual presenter would provide specific talks or lectures. By the mid-1970s, automation features were added, {{which led to the}} creation of <b>prerecorded</b> shows. Most visitors to the facility would have seen an automated 40- to 45-minute audio/visual show on a particular space-related topic. Two types of shows were typically alternated on a daily basis: one aimed at families with young children and another aimed at older children and adults. Typical shows aimed at both audience types were built around themes such as space travel, the mythical stories behind the constellations, and around Christmas-time, a show that investigated theories on stellar explanations for the Star of Bethlehem. A listing from 1970 includes shows titled The Story of Eclipses, which looked at how solar eclipses occur and their scientific importance, Man and the Zodiac which explored the history of mythology and astrology with regard to the night sky, and The Planet Venus which surveyed the history of the planet in mythology, the planet's motion across the sky and featured imagined views from its surface.|$|E
5|$|Yoshiki's songwriting {{process is}} unusual in that he writes scores for everything, {{including}} guitar and drums, before beginning to play it with the band. Although changes are made if necessary. His composing style tends {{to make use of}} chords in sequences of eights or more with riff-based motifs or call-and-response style phrasing. He has maintained this style for the majority of his career as a composer. Having played classical piano since he was four years old, Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock. While also serving as the main songwriter Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan's later material. During live performances the band relies, for the most part, on its members (with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between their instruments) and <b>prerecorded</b> tracks for orchestrated strings, spoken word passages, and more recently, some of hide's guitar parts.|$|E
25|$|For <b>prerecorded</b> programs, commercials, {{and home}} videos, audio is {{transcribed}} and captions are prepared, positioned, and timed in advance.|$|E
50|$|As a Mexican-licensed station, {{nearly all}} the pieces it plays are {{introduced}} in Spanish, and for listeners in the U.S., {{at the conclusion of}} each piece the information is given in English. The announcers include Kingsley McLaren, Sue Harland, Gabriela Guinea-Johnston (chief Spanish announcer) and Gordon Brown. Most of the programming is automated, with the announcers <b>prerecording</b> their identifications of titles, artists and composers. At midnight each day, El Himno Nacional Mexicano (The Mexican National Anthem) is played.|$|R
5000|$|Strictly speaking, voice-tracking {{refers to}} the process of a disc jockey <b>prerecording</b> his or her on-air [...] "patter". It is then {{combined}} with songs, commercials, and other elements in order to produce a product that sounds like a live air shift. Voice-tracking has become common on many music radio stations, particularly during evening, overnight, weekend, and holiday time periods. It is seen by most radio station owners as an economical alternative to employing live disc jockeys around the clock.|$|R
50|$|For broadcasting, {{the channel}} used the {{software}} BMS (Broadcast Media Server) from the Swedish company BCC. BMS {{made it possible}} to <b>prerecord</b> announcements through a digital mixer, together with jingles and background atmosphere, on the computer hard disk and to manage playback together with music recordings from CD and digital audio tape (DAT). The CDs were stored in juke boxes that held 360 each. Each juke box had two players, and when fully developed, NRK Klassisk had ten such juke boxes.|$|R

50|$|A voice actor's role in anime {{consists}} {{of reading the}} lines before the production is finished. In Japan, the lines are usually performed before the anime has completed. The artist then draws in every expression to the key of the voice actors reading it off. This {{is the most common}} way of <b>prerecording</b> in Japan. Young voice actors are used in both the anime and OVAs. However, in fan-oriented productions and products they use voice actors because voice actors are often used as a selling point.|$|R
2500|$|You Bet Your Life {{debuted in}} October 1947 on ABC radio (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), {{sponsored}} by costume jewelry manufacturer Allen Gellman; {{and then on}} CBS (1949–50), and finally NBC, continuing until May 1961—on radio only, 1947–1950; on both radio and television, 1950–1960; and on television only, 1960–1961. The show proved a huge hit, {{being one of the}} most popular on television by the mid-1950s. With George Fenneman as his announcer and straight man, Groucho entertained his audiences with improvised conversation with his guests. Since You Bet Your Life was mostly ad-libbed and unscripted—although writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Groucho ready-made lines in advance—the producers insisted that the network <b>prerecord</b> it (instead of it being broadcast live). There were two reasons for this: <b>prerecording</b> provided Groucho with time to fish around for funny exchanges and any intervening dead spots to be edited out; and secondly to protect the network, since Groucho was a notorious loose cannon and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 successful seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Automobile marque DeSoto was a longtime major sponsor. For the DeSoto ads Marx would sometimes say: [...] "Tell 'em Groucho sent you", or [...] "Try a DeSoto before you decide".|$|R
50|$|Access Radio Taranaki invites a {{broad range}} of groups to make programmes, and refuses to {{exercise}} any editorial censorship or oversight. It is the only radio station in the southern hemisphere with a radio show hosted by a young person with Down Syndrome, and gears its musical playlist to the tastes of audiences at different times of the day. Local community boards south of Mount Taranaki have funded mobile broadcast technology to allow South Taranaki schools and cultural, medical and special interest groups to <b>prerecord</b> their own radio programmes.|$|R
25|$|Detroit-based {{talk show}} Kelly & Company {{broadcast}} an episode {{focusing on the}} Michigan Murders in October 1988. This episode featured <b>prerecorded</b> prison interviews with Collins himself in addition to live interviews with police and legal personnel connected to the case.|$|E
25|$|In March 1996, three {{different}} separately-sold 8M memory paks were produced already containing <b>prerecorded</b> data of this sort. These special 8M paks bore all new decals and contained EPROMs {{that could not}} be overwritten by new download data from the Satellaview.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 {{season of}} The Amazing Race Canada, BMO the {{sponsor of the}} Canadian version changed the format and had BMO {{employees}} hand racers a tablet where the clue was <b>prerecorded</b> by each racer's family members versus the traditional method.|$|E
50|$|The {{ease and}} {{accuracy}} of tape editing, {{as compared to the}} cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely <b>prerecord</b> their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and tape echo allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop broadcast cartridge led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.|$|R
50|$|The film, {{which was}} {{released}} in 1935, was a first for Warner Brothers studio, by producing a film based on a 400-year-old work of literary art. The studio assigned almost every star or character actor under contract {{to take part in}} the film, with the filming taking over six months. The studio also allowed Korngold to devote more attention to the score than it had to any of its previous films; he could <b>prerecord</b> certain parts of the film for the benefit of actors, whom he then had act to the rhythm and tempo of the music. As a result of the score's elaborate tailoring, the film and Korngold's music left a strong impression on the film industry.|$|R
5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of recording {{first is that}} the public may know the outcome of an event from another source, which may be a [...] "spoiler". In addition, <b>prerecording</b> prevents live radio announcers from deviating from an officially approved script, as occurred with propaganda broadcasts from Germany in the 1940s and with Radio Moscow in the 1980s. Many events are advertised as being live, although they are often [...] "recorded live" [...] (sometimes called [...] "live-to-tape"). This is particularly true of performances of musical artists on radio when they visit for an in-studio concert performance. Similar situations have occurred in television production ("The Cosby Show is recorded in front of a live television studio audience") and news broadcasting.|$|R
