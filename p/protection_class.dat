40|$|Abstract—This paper studies a {{relaying}} technique {{based on}} the signal-to-noise (SNR) threshold in cooperative networks using hi-erarchical modulation. Hierarchical modulation is useful in appli-cations that require different <b>protection</b> <b>classes</b> of the information. In particular, a cooperative network with one source, one relay, and one destination is considered. Two different <b>protection</b> <b>classes</b> are modulated by a hierarchical 2 / 4 -amplitude shift keying (ASK) constellation at the source. Based on the instantaneous received SNR at the relay, the relay decides to retransmit both classes by using a hierarchical 2 / 4 -ASK constellation, or the more-protection class by using a 2 -ASK constellation, or remains silent. Optimal thresholds are chosen to minimize the bit error rate (BER) of the less-protection class, whereas the BER of the more-protection class meets a given requirement. Numerical and simulation results are provided to verify the analysis. The {{results show that the}} optimal thresholds significantly improve the performance.
