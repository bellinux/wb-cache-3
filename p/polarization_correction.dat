40|$|The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is {{currently}} flying on NASA's Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua satellites, launched in 1999 and 2002, respectively. MODIS reflective solar bands in the visible wavelength range {{are known to}} be sensitive to polarized light based on prelaunch polarization sensitivity tests. After about five years of on-orbit operations, it was discovered that the polarization sensitivity at short wavelengths had shown a noticeable increase. In this paper, we examine the impact of polarization on measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance based on MODIS Collection- 6 L 1 B over pseudo invariant desert sites. The standard <b>polarization</b> <b>correction</b> equation is used in combination with simulated at-sensor radiances using the second simulation of a satellite signal in the Solar Spectrum, Vector Radiative Transfer Code (6 SV). We ignore the polarization contribution from the surface and a ratio approach is used for both 6 SV-derived in put parameters and observed TOA reflectance. Results indicate that significant gain corrections up to 25 % are required near the end of scan for the 412 and 443 nm bands. The <b>polarization</b> <b>correction</b> reduces the seasonal fluctuations in reflectance trends and mirror side ratios from 30 % and 12 % to 10 % and 5 %, respectively, for the two bands.

40|$|We {{illuminate}} {{the importance of}} a self-consistent many-body treatment in calculations of vacuum polarization corrections to the energies of atomic orbitals in many-electron atoms. Including vacuum polarization in the atomic Hamiltonian causes a substantial re-adjustment (relaxation) of the electrostatic self-consistent field. The induced change in the electrostatic energies is substantial for states with the orbital angular momentum $l &;gt; 0 $. For such orbitals, the relaxation mechanism determines the sign and even the order of magnitude of the total vacuum <b>polarization</b> <b>correction.</b> This relaxation mechanism is illustrated with numerical results for the Cs atom...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new <b>polarization</b> <b>correction</b> {{algorithm}} for polarization sensitive spaceborne spectrometers like Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) or Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY). These instruments measure polarization with less spectral resolution than the radiance. As a consequence, the current GOME <b>polarization</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm allows radiance errors of 10 % in the UV and 3 % in the visible (VIS) and near-IR. Using simulated spectra, {{we show that}} the continuum Stokes elements Q and U over a large wavelength range (300 to 800 nm) can be reliably retrieved from only a limited set of measurements (three to five). The interpolation to other wavelengths is made using numerically calculated polarization spectra. These polarization spectra can be calculated for Rayleigh scattering atmospheres, but we show that the retrieval is just as effective for cloudy and aerosol scenes as for clear scenes. For GOME the remaining radiance errors are less than 3 % (UV) and 1 % (VIS, near-IR), and often smaller than 0. 5 %. The lack of actual UV (300 - 330 nm) polarization measurements prevents further reduction of the radiance errors. We also show how the ozone Huggins absorption band may be accounted for through a parameterization and a single polarization broadband measurement and that strong but narrow absorption bands like the O 2 A band maybe ignored without detrimental effect on the algorithm...|$|E
