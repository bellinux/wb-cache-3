40|$|According to the {{frequent}} fractures of rock bolts in high ground pressure roadways of deep mines, this paper analyzes {{the mechanism of}} fractures and concludes that high ground pressure and material de-fects are main reasons for the fracture of rock bolts. The basic idea of fracture control of rock bolts in high ground pressure roadways of deep mines {{is to increase the}} yield load and the limit load of rock bolt materials and reduce the actual load of rock bolts. There are four ways of controlling rock bolt fracture: increasing the rock bolt diameter, strengthening bolt materials, weakening support rigidity and the implementation of double supporting. With the roadway support of the 2302 working face of a coal mine as the <b>project</b> <b>background,</b> this <b>paper</b> carries out a study on the effect of two schemes, increasing the rock bolt diameter and the double supporting technique through methods of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and so on. It determines the most reasonable diam-eter of rock bolts and the best delay distance of secondary support. Practices indicate that rock bolt fracture can be effectively controlled through the double supporting technique, which strengthens the roof and two sides through the first supporting technique and strengthens side angles through the secondary supporting technique...|$|R
40|$|This Workshop forms part of {{an overall}} {{endeavor}} to establish a global consortium of researchers focusing their efforts on improving the ability of crop plants to acquire phosphorus, particularly through sources from which it is only sparingly available. These sources include bound forms of soil phosphorus and such fertilizers or amendments as rock phosphate. This volume explains the overall procedures followed, presents the formal papers prepared for the Workshop, and highlights the outcome of the deliberations {{in the form of a}} preliminary draft proposal for a global <b>project.</b> A <b>background</b> <b>paper</b> covers the possibilities of favorably manipulating phosphorus acquisition, which include modifying root absorption area by improving rooting characteristics or mycorrhizal associations, manipulating ion absorption mechanisms, and modifying the rhizosphere through root exudations or effects of microorganisms. Position papers prepared by invited specialists examine in detail the prospects for favorable manipulation of specific components of phosphorus acquisition. During the Workshop, research areas with prospects for impact on agriculture in the medium term were identified and appropriate outputs and activities proposed. The promising research areas chosen were modification of root morphology, manipulation of root exudates, enhancement of mycorrhizal effects through crop management practices, and optimization of cropping systems approaches. The Workshop laid the foundation for subsequent activities of formulating detailed project proposals and soliciting support from potential donors for the proposed global consortium...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) of the subtype H 5 N 1 {{and the potential}} threat of a global human pandemic have been issues of great concern {{to the international community}} since its regional and global spread since 2003. At the same time, there has been less emphasis placed on the assessment of the effects of implemented mitigation strategies on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and their families in affected developing countries. While policymakers must take rapid and effective action to control the disease, some of their actions may lead to a number of direct and indirect effects that disproportionately negative impact the poor. The Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom has recently funded the Pro-Poor HPAI Risk Reduction Strategies Project that aims to help decision makers in developing countries generate evidence-based, pro-poor HPAI control measures at national and international levels. These control measures should not only be cost-effective and efficient in reducing disease risk, but also protect livelihoods, particularly of smallholder producers in developing countries. This project is being implemented in eight countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, including locations where HPAI has not yet been reported, where sporadic outbreaks have occurred, and where the disease is endemic. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) are responsible for project activities in Africa and Indonesia. HPAI, of the subtype H 5 N 1, first appeared in Java in August 2003 (and officially declared in January 2004) and spread rapidly {{to other parts of the}} country; since 2006, it has been considered to be endemic in many parts of Indonesia (MoA, 2007; OIE, 2006; Promed-mail, 2003; Sims et al., 2005). Its persistence represents a serious risk to animals and public health in the region. Frequent outbreaks are observed in rural areas where backyard poultry are kept. Humans are rarely but consistently infected. With 108 confirmed fatal human cases since 2005, Indonesia is the country with highest number of human deaths (WHO, 2008). A first step in initiating this project is to compile and assess, in the form of a <b>background</b> <b>paper,</b> the current state of knowledge of poultry systems and their place in the larger economy, the current HPAI situation and its evolution, and institutional experiences within its control. This information is of critical importance to underline existing information, identify research gaps, and better target further research activities in the <b>project.</b> This <b>background</b> <b>paper</b> was jointly developed by researchers from two different universities in Indonesia; an economic scientist from the University of Bogor and a veterinary epidemiologist from the Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta.
