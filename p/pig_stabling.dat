40|$|Melatonin is {{a hormone}} {{controlling}} the biorhythm of mammals {{and might be}} an indicator for harmony between individuals and their environment. The major ‘zeitgeber’ {{for the release of}} melatonin by the pineal gland, regulated by the hypothalamus, is environmental light. It synchronizes the melatonin secretion with the 24 - hour day/night cycle. Normally, melatonin levels are high in the night and low during the day. There is a lot of discussion about building “mega” pig stables in The Netherlands. In these discussions animal welfare plays a big role. Since pig breeding is more and more intensified, several adaptations to the way of <b>pig</b> <b>stabling</b> are introduced, including adapting the light regimen to feeding regimen. Until now no objective parameter is available to measure animal welfare in mammals. Because melatonin could be a possible parameter to estimate the (non) adaptation to another light regime. We formed two groups of six pigs. One group was kept under a single light phase regimen, for a minimum of eight hours of light per day. The other group was kept under a phased light regimen, three periods of three hours of light spread over 24 hours. Each pig was sampled during a 24 hour period, by a saliva sample taken every hour. In both groups no nocturnal rise in melatonin concentration was found. Both groups show a higher (no significant) mean melatonin concentration during light periods. There was no significant rise or fall in melatonin concentration caused by the change of environmental light from light to darkness and from darkness to light. There was no correlation between rise in melatonin concentration and food intake. We could conclude we did not find a difference in melatonin release pattern between pigs kept under a discontinuous multiple light regimen and pigs kept under a continuous light regimen. If melatonin could be a useful parameter for measuring animal welfare cannot be confirmed by this experiment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract] Biofiltration for {{removing}} ammonia and odour compounds from ventilation air of <b>pig</b> <b>stables</b> is a promising approach. In {{order to reduce}} the time for starting up a well-functioning biofilter a good inoculum suited for the environment is needed. In this study the microbial identity and quantity of dust and bioaerosols coming from a <b>pig</b> <b>stable</b> were analyzed for its suitability as inoculum. Inoculation of biofilters with dust had similar good ammonia removal capabilities as biofilters inoculated with activated sludge, although analysis of the microbial dust community revealed clear differences. The organic fraction of the dust particles seems to be important for mediating biofilm development on the filter material...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the prevalence of}} human and animal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at pig farms in The Netherlands, and related this to individual and farm-level characteristics. More {{than half of the}} farms investigated (28 / 50) had MRSA in <b>pigs</b> or <b>stable</b> dust and about one third (15 / 50) of person(s) were identified as MRSA carriers. Human carriage was found only on farms with M RSA-positive pigs or dust. MRSA strains in human samples were the same spa-type as found in pigs and all were not typable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (NT-MRSA). Multivariate analyses showed that risk factors for human MRSA carriage were: working in <b>pig</b> <b>stables</b> (OR 40, 95 % CI 8 - 209) and the presence of sows and finishing pigs (OR 9, 95 % CI 3 - 30).

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) {{was used to examine}} the genetic relatedness of the isolates. The study was carried out for 1 year as part of a project focusing on antimicrobial resistance of salmonellae recovered from asymptomatic pigs. A total of 400 finishing <b>pigs</b> <b>stabled</b> in 20 swine farms in central Greece were included in the study. Fecal samples taken directly from the rectum, one sample from each pig, were cultured for Salmonella spp. Five of the 400 tested finishing pigs, originating from the same herd, were asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella Mbandaka. All five isolates were resistant to tetracycline, four were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and three to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. In contrast, all five isolates were susceptible to cefuroxime and ceftriaxone, as well as to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. All five isolates had indistinguishable PFGE patterns.

40|$|We {{set up a}} matched {{case-control study}} of {{potential}} risk factors for clinical encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) in 58 pig farms in West Flanders (Belgium). In total, 29 farms experienced a clinical outbreak of EMCV confirmed by EMC virus isolation. Mortality was seen only among suckling piglets (18 case farms), in piglets and other age-groups (4 case farms), or only among fattening pigs (7 case farms). Five farms had reproductive problems among the sows. Control farms were matched geographically on farm size and farm type and were selected on the absence of clinical signs. A questionnaire on potential risk factors for EMCV was developed to collect data at both case and control farms. The exploration of the data used clusters of factors associated with clinical EMCV infection: (a) rodents, (b) general farm set up and (c) general hygiene. The multivariable relationships between clinical appearance of EMCV and potential risk factors were tested with conditional logistic regression. The final model on all farms contained presence of mice (OR = 8. 3) as {{a risk factor for}} clinical EMCV infection while the flow of manure up through the slatted floor (OR = 0. 11) and movement of manure between manure pits in the <b>pig</b> <b>stable</b> (OR = 0. 14) were protective.

40|$|For the {{majority}} of native species, human-created habitats provide a hostile environment that prevents their colonization. However, if the conditions encountered in this novel environment {{are part of the}} fundamental niche of a particular species, these low competitive environments may allow strong population expansion of even rare and stenotopic species. If these species are potentially harmful to humans, such anthropogenic habitat alterations may impose strong risks for human health. Here, we report on a recent and severe outbreak of the viciously biting and day-active mosquito Anopheles plumbeus Stephens, 1828, that is caused by a habitat shift toward human-created habitats. Although historic data indicate that the species was previously reported to be rare in Belgium and confined to natural forest habitats, more recent data indicate a strong population expansion all over Belgium and severe nuisance at a local scale. We show that these outbreaks can be explained by a recent larval habitat shift of this species from tree-holes in forests to large manure collecting pits of abandoned and uncleaned <b>pig</b> <b>stables.</b> Further surveys of the colonization and detection of other potential larval breeding places of this mosquito in this artificial environment are of particular importance for human health because the species is known as a experimental vector of West Nile virus and a potential vector of human malari...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this study was human health risk {{assessment}} of defined inhalation exposure scenario in selected cattle and pig farms in south Moravia (Czech Republic). This exceptional evaluation of potential risks for farms manipulators was the main contribution {{of this study}}. Possible both human health risks, non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic (according to US EPA Human health risk assessment methodology), for feeders and other workers exposed to polluted indoor air in the farm stables were quantified in the selected pig and cattle farms with significantly increased concentrations mainly of carcinogenic PAHs and PCBs in the indoor air. No non-carcinogenic risks were determined in any of the localities, but also increased carcinogenic risks were observed.

40|$|Light pipes offer {{a passive}} {{way to bring}} {{daylight}} inside deep buildings, such as agricultural buildings. However, the lack of reliable performance predictability methods for light pipes represents a major obstacle preventing their widespread use. This paper evaluates a simulation approach for performance prediction and identifies key light pipe design parameters affecting their daylight transmission performance. The study was carried out through continuous monitoring of daylight in two full-scale, identical <b>pig</b> <b>stables</b> fitted with two light pipe systems, Solatube® and Velux®. The experiment included three continuously measuring sensors in each stable and an outdoor sensor during 2013 and 2014. A forward raytracing tool, TracePro®, was used for illuminance prediction and parametric simulations. The simulation results for overcast skies indicated discrepancies between the simulated and average measurement results below 30 % in all cases. The discrepancies for clear skies were somewhat higher, i. e., below 30 % for 67 % of the cases. The higher discrepancies with clear skies were due to the overestimation of absolute sunlight levels and absence of an advanced and detailed optical characterization of the dome collector’s surface. The parametric results have shown that light pipes’ performance is better during summer time, in sunny climates, at low to mid-latitudes, which provides higher solar altitudes than during winter and cloudy climates at high latitudes. Methods to improve the luminous transmittance for low solar altitudes occurring in Scandinavia include: bending or tilting the pipe, increasing the aspect ratio, improving the pipe specular reflectance, tilting the collector to the south, and using optical redirecting system in the collector...|$|R
40|$|Today 70 % of all Danish pig herds are {{infected}} with MRSA CC 398. This paper examines the problem with MRSA, posted through 2014 by the media as a national threat. It examines {{the reasons for the}} bacteria’s resistance to antibiotics, how it spreads and our proposal to a sus-tainable solution that will fight the bacteria without causing new resistant bacteria’s. This is done by first collecting theory about staphylococci (MRSA & MSSA), pig production in Denmark, how antibiotics work and how resistance occurs in bacteria. Next different per-sons with a connection to MRSA were interviewed. These persons are: scientist Rita Ander-sen Leth and Henrik Torkil Westh, veterinarian Andreas Birch and pig farmer Peter Michael Kiær. We interviewed them whether they thought it was a problem or not, if the government did enough or not, and what they think could solve the problem. Through our investigation we realized that the general citizen in Denmark {{do not have to be}} afraid of MRSA CC 398. Our suggestions to fight the bacteria is in the long term to research how MRSA CC 398 be-comes resistant to treatment and why it colonizes best on pigs and not humans. Next there should be developed a way to almost instantly test for the bacteria so the most effective treatment can be given. Also the farmers should more often do a washing and disinfection of the <b>pig</b> <b>stables</b> and <b>pigs.</b> By doing so the bacteria can be kept in the stables, kept out of the stables or even not spread at all...|$|R

40|$|We present here a {{dynamical}} {{method for}} modelling temporal and geographical variations in ammonia emissions in regional scale Chemistry Transport Models (CTMs) and Chemistry Climate Models (CCMs). The method {{is based on}} the meteorology in the models and gridded inventories. We use the dynamical method to investigating the spatio-temporal variability of the ammonia emissions across part of Europe and study how these emissions are related to geographical and year-to-year variations in atmospheric temperature alone. For simplicity we focus on the emission from a storage related to a Danish standard <b>pig</b> <b>stable</b> with 1000 animals and display how the emission from this source category vary geographically throughout central and northern Europe and from year to year. In view of future climate changes we also evaluate the potential future changes in the emission by including temperature projections from an ensemble of climate models. The results points towards four overall issues: (1) Emissions can easily vary with 20 % by changing geographical location within a country due to overall variations in climate. Largest uncertainties are seen for large countries like UK, Germany and France. (2) Annual variations in overall climate can at specific locations cause uncertainties in the range of 20 %. (3) Climate change will in general increase the emissions with 0 – 40 %, in central to northern Europe. (4) Gradients in existing emission inventories that are seen along country borders (e. g. between UK and France), can be reduced by using a dynamical methodology for calculating emissions. Acting together these four issues can cause substantial uncertainties in emission. Emissions are generally considered among the largest uncertainties in the model calculations with CTM and CCM models. Efforts to reduce uncertainties are therefore highly relevant. It is therefore recommended that both CCMs and CTMs implement a dynamical methodology for simulating ammonia emissions in a similar way as for biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOCs) – a method that has been used {{for more than a decade}} in CTMs...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{because of the}} high number of lame sows in de <b>pig</b> <b>stable</b> of the Tolakker and has four aspects. The first aspect of this study involved behavioral observations of the sows and the identification of problem areas in the carrying sow stable. The second part consisted of a literature study to determine the prevalence of lameness among sows and the accompanying leg and claw problems. This literature study provided the basis {{for the development of a}} protocol for the examination of lame sows, which is the third part of the study. The last aspect of this study was done in accordance to the request of the farmer to determine whether the feeding stations in the stable were a risk to the claw health of the sows and if they cause clinical lameness. During the study it became clear that for a major part it was the setting of the feeding stations in the stable and the weekly addition of new sows to the group that caused unrest and aggression. The extent to which these issues play a part in the development of lameness is something that needs to be studied further. Literature shows that it is mostly infectious arthritis and osteochondrosis that cause clinical lameness in the sows. Though claw lesions are common, their contribution to the development of locomotion problems appears minor. The prevalence of the different lesions is highly farm specific however and the exact link between the separate claw lesions and lameness remains unclear. The protocol that was developed includes all aspects of the sow’s legs that can be examinated in a clinical investigation. The systematical examination of all lame sows and good registration of the results are essential to the identification of existing locomotion problems. The experiment with the feeding stations showed that the bolts on their floor might be a problem due to the sows standing on them when entering and leaving the stations. No clear conclusions could be drawn from the results however and further research should be done to determine if this situation poses a risk to the health of the sow’s claws...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} plasmid-mediated β-lactamases {{have emerged in}} gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{in the last ten}} years, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs are the most influential resistance genes for cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. They represent a public health treat as they limit the choice of effective antimicrobial agents for human treatment, thereby increasing morbidity, mortality, longer hospital stays and higher costs. Among Enterobacteriaceae in livestock CTX-M is the most common ESBL type, and the subtype CTX-M- 1 is most common in pigs in Europe. The most relevant human exposure route has not yet been identified. Next to, one possible exposure route could be dust. CTX-M has been already demonstrated in dust from broiler stables, but not in dust from <b>pig</b> <b>stables.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether CTX-M- 1 genes can be detected in dust, and if so, how strongly EDC CTX-M- 1 positive farms are associated with CTX-M- 1 positive pig feces farms. In addition, the relevance of CTX-M- 1 positive dust as exposure route for humans is evaluated by use of the results from individual human feces cultures. 123 compartment electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) samples and 34 household EDC samples from fourty different farms were used in this study. After stomaching, freeze drying and DNA extraction, qPCR and gel electrophoresis, ten farms and one household were tested positive. Pig feces culture of these farms shows that twelve farms tested positive by culture and ten farms tested positive by PCR. CTX-M- 1 positive EDCs were significantly more often found in farms in which feces was CTX-M- 1 positive. Odds ratios of this association were 11. 67 (2. 22 – 61. 28) for culture-positive feces, and 56. 00 (6. 78 – 462. 66) for PCR-positive feces. Similar results were obtained when limiting the analysis to compartments in which both EDC and feces were analyzed. There was also a significant association between CTX-M- 1 positive feces from farm inhabitants and farms with positive dust samples (odds ratio 25. 96 (2. 89 – 233. 59)). Thus, an inhalable exposure route seems to be possible. On the other side, the association between CTX-M- 1 positive feces from farm inhabitants and farms with positive pig feces samples was also significant (odds ratio 17. 41 (1. 96 – 155. 04)), it is difficult to disentangle the role of direct animal contact from the role of airborne exposure.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} use of {{collection}} and treatment wagon for piglets in relation to castration. The importance of good and ergonomically designed tools in <b>pig</b> <b>stables</b> can probably {{reduce the risk of}} suffering from musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). During the last 20 years the number of pig farms has decreased {{and at the same time}} the herd sizes and the number of pig keepers have increased (Statistic Sweden (SCB) 2007). As a consequence, the pig keepers have more pigs to take care of, treat and neuter and spend more of their daily work in these large confinements. This also means that the repetitive work e. g. treatment, grinding of teeth and castration of piglets increases. These work tasks are difficult to avoid because they are an important part of the pig farming. A study conducted by researchers at the Work Sciences Group in Alnarp showed that musculoskeletal symptoms among pig keepers were mainly located to the upper extremities (62 %) and back (57 %) compared to the lower extremities (38 %). This study is based on telephone interviews with 30 piglet producers. A questionnaire of thirteen questions was designed to investigate whether producers used a trolley for collection and treatment of piglets in relation to castration. The results from the interviews were compiled in a matrix and then used for further analysis. Grouping of the results was drawn from the function and application of the wagons. The results of the interview study showed that piglet producers and piglet keepers mainly used four different trolleys and ways to work with the collection and castration of piglets. About half of the producers and keepers (47 %) used some kind of trolley for collection and castration of piglets. The majority of the producers and keepers (87 %) used a special type of work bench for castration and only one fifth (17 %) did neither use a trolley nor a work bench for castration. The study showed that the producers and piglet keepers disagreed to whether the work postures in relation to collection and castration of piglets were ergonomic. Some of the producers and pig keepers stated that it was better to carry out treatment and castration without a trolley than with a trolley. Some of the respondents were not willing to replace the trolley. The conclusion of the results is that there are several advantages for using an ergonomic trolley in relation to collection, treatment and castration of piglets...|$|R

Here it clings, there bulges; and the human body, with its agreeable and lively lines, is turned into a mockery and laughing-stock. Another piece of Sunday business with the peasants is to take their ailments to the chemist for advice. It is as much a matter for Sunday as church-going. I have seen a woman who had been unable to speak since the Monday before, wheezing, catching her breath, endlessly and painfully coughing; and yet she had waited upwards of a hundred hours before coming to seek help, and had the week been twice as long, she would have waited still. There was a canonical day for consultation; such was the ancestral habit, to which a respectable lady must study to conform.|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} role of low pH in secretory vesicles {{for processing}} and secretion in the neurohypophysis was investigated. Subcellular fractionation of guinea-pig neural lobes {{revealed that a}} proton present in the membranes from this tissue could not be ascribed to secretory vesicles. However, a proton pump was found in coated microvesicles. Secretory vesicles isolated from rats and guinea <b>pigs</b> were <b>stable</b> under conditions known to lyse secretory vesicles from the adrenal medulla owing to the generation of a proton gradient. These {{results suggest that the}} internal pH of secretory vesicles from the neurohypophysis is closer to neutral than is the pH in chromaffin secretory vesicles. Processing of a neurophysin-glycopeptide intermediate from the biosynthesis of vasopressin in intact secretory vesicles incubated in vitro was activated by the addition of NH 4 Cl, known to increase the intravesicular pH. This activation of neurohormone processing was also apparent in isolated nerve endings incubated in the presence of NH 4 Cl, suggesting that NH 4 Cl {{can also be used to}} increase the intravesicular pH in intact nerve endings. However, NH 4 Cl did not affect the secretion of neurohormones, indicating that a low intravesicular pH is not important for exocytosis in the neurohypophysis. Our results indicate that a low pH generated during processing by mechanisms other than ATP-dependent proton transport may inhibit the processing enzymes, thereby preventing extensive breakdown of neurohormone precursors...|$|R
