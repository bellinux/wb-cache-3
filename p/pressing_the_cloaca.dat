50|$|Male {{and female}} birds have a cloaca, an opening through which eggs, sperm, and wastes pass. Intercourse is {{performed}} by <b>pressing</b> <b>the</b> lips of <b>the</b> <b>cloacae</b> together, which is sometimes known as intromittent organ {{which is known}} as a phallus that is analogous to the mammals' penis. The female lays amniotic eggs in which the young fetus continues to develop after it leaves the female's body. Unlike most vertebrates female birds typically have only one functional ovary and oviduct. As a group, birds, like mammals, are noted for their high level of parental care.|$|R
25|$|There is {{initially}} a cloacal membrane, composed of ectoderm and endoderm, reaching from {{the umbilical cord}} to the tail, separating <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> from <b>the</b> exterior. After {{the separation of the}} rectum from the dorsal part of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca,</b> <b>the</b> ventral part of the cloacal membrane becomes the urogenital membrane.|$|R
40|$|The {{motility}} of <b>the</b> avian <b>cloaca</b> {{is under}} neural control, but {{little is known}} about the neural network that accomplishes this function. This present study was designed to determine the distribution of nitric oxide-synthesising neurons in <b>the</b> pigeon <b>cloaca</b> by enzyme histochemistry for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d). NADPH-d-positive staining was seen in the neurons and fibres in <b>the</b> <b>cloaca.</b> <b>The</b> highest density of nerve fibres was noted in the coprodeum and the lowest in the proctodeum. In the coprodeum, NADPH-d neurons were found singly, formed small groups of 2 – 10 neurons, or were seen in plexuses in the muscle layer, lamina propria, or around the arterioles. Several NADPH-d-positive neurons were also observed in the ganglia of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca.</b> NADPH-d fibres ran in the muscle layer, lamina muscularis mucosae and lamina propria, or surrounded blood vessels. The distribution pattern of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) -stained neurons and fibres in <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> was similar to that of NADPH-d. Double staining for NADPH-d and AChE showed colocalisation of the 2 enzymes in many neurons of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca.</b> Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -immunoreactive nerve fibres originating outside <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> were also noted. In the urodeum and proctodeum, neurons or fibres positive for NADPH-d, AChE or TH were scattered in the lamina propria. Nerve fibres immunoreactive for calcitonin-gene related peptide, galanin, methionine-enkephalin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide were found sparsely in <b>the</b> <b>cloaca.</b> Our results demonstrate that nitrergic neurons constitute a subpopulation which is closely associated with the cholinergic system in <b>the</b> pigeon <b>cloaca...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{developmental}} {{process through}} which <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> transforms from one hollow structure to two separated urinary and digestive outlets remains controversial and speculative. Here, we use high-resolution episcopic microscopy to examine a comprehensive series of normal and mutant mouse <b>cloaca</b> in which <b>the</b> detailed 3 -dimensional (3 -D) morphological features are illuminated throughout the development. We provide evidence that the dorsal peri-cloacal mesenchyme (dPCM) remains stationary while other surrounding tissues grow towards it. This causes dramatic changes of spatial relationship among caudal structures and morphological transformation of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca.</b> <b>The</b> 3 -D characterizations of Dkk 1 mutants reveal a hyperplastic defect of dPCM, {{which leads to a}} significant anterior shift of the caudal boundary of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca,</b> premature occlusion of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> and, imperforate anus phenotype. Conversely, Shh knockout causes a severe hypoplastic defect of cloaca mesenchyme including dPCM and persistent cloaca. Collectively, these findings suggest that formation of the dPCM is critical for cloacal morphogenesis and furthermore, growth and movement of the mesenchymal tissues towards the dPCM lead to <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> occlusion and separation of the urinary and digestive outlets...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{experiment}} was to verify whether {{the origin of the}} DIA is ectodermal or endodermal. A rabbit serum against the epithelial cells of the final portion of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> was prepared. <b>The</b> indirect immunofluorescence method was applied to strips obtained with a cryostat, carefully cut {{in such a way as}} to include a part of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca,</b> <b>the</b> burso-cloacal stalk, the DIA, and the bursal plicae. In this way, it was possible to demonstrate that the epithelium of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca,</b> of <b>the</b> burso-cloacal stalk, and of the DIA exhibited an intense fluorescence that could not be observed at the level of the epithelium of the bursal plicae. These findings would appear to indicate that the DIA, like <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> and <b>the</b> burso-cloacal stalk, is ectodermal in origin. Furthermore, histological study revealed that the DIA exhibits close structural analogies with the dorsal wall of <b>the</b> <b>cloaca.</b> In both areas, unorganised lymphoid infiltrations of the tunica propria can be seen, and the epithelium does not show any follicle-associated epithelial cells. The glands often assume the aspect of dilated crypts containing intestinal transit material. The epithelium of these glands reveals lymphoid infiltrations at various points, and it is not uncommon to detect accumulations of cells in their lumina. Several groups of eosinophilic granulocytes can also be observed in the tunica propria of these two areas, with a clear predominance at the level of the DIA. These similarities between <b>the</b> <b>cloaca</b> and <b>the</b> DIA might lead one to suppose the existence of a functional as well as a morphological correspondence...|$|R

5000|$|In Roman mythology, Cloacina, [...] "The Cleanser" [...] (from the Latin verb cluo, [...] "to cleanse", {{from which}} also cloaca, [...] "sewer, drain") was the goddess {{who presided over}} <b>the</b> <b>Cloaca</b> Maxima ("Greatest Drain"), the main trunk {{of the system of}} sewers in Rome.

5000|$|Vent pecking is an {{abnormal}} behaviour of birds performed primarily by commercial egg-laying hens.

Tearing of the skin increases susceptibility to disease and may lead to cannibalistic, with possible evisceration of the pecked bird and ultimately, death.|$|R
