40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{article is}} {{intended}} to be a tutorial on the subject of fatigue of foam and honeycomb core composite sandwich structures. First, several different analytical models for predicting the fatigue life of sandwich composites are presented. Then representative <b>publications</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> on the major failure modes in sandwich beams under dynamic fatigue loading are summarized, along with several related publications dealing with static and impact loading. Papers dealing with the effects of loading frequency, environmental factors, and block loading on the fatigue life of sandwich composites are discussed. Finally, recent research on different types of non-destruction evaluation (NDE) techniques employed for failure investigations during fatigue testing of sandwich structures is reviewed. Conclusions and generalizations that can be drawn from the literature are presented along with discussions of areas in which further research is needed. KEY WORDS: composite sandwich, foam core, honeycomb core, fatigue...|$|E
30|$|This {{observational}} study found survival was better {{in patients with}} TNBC who received chemotherapy, and best following surgery plus chemotherapy, compared with other treatments. This may be partly due to previously reported favourable responses to chemotherapy in TNBC. However, patients with a better prognosis {{may also have been}} {{more likely to have been}} selected into receiving more aggressive treatment, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting the survival results. This study also found that the 5 -year overall survival rate for patients with TNBC was 62 %, compared to 75 % in patients without TNBC. This is comparable with several <b>publications</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> an overall 5 -year survival of between 59 - 77 % in patients with triple negative disease (Schwentner et al. 2012; Ovcaricek et al. 2011; Chu et al. 2012; Dent et al. 2007). Our findings also corroborate the previously reported poorer prognosis of patients with TNBC compared with patients without TNBC (Liedtke et al. 2008; Schwentner et al. 2012; Ovcaricek et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2011), even after adjusting for possible confounding factors (Wu et al. 2011; Schwentner et al. 2012; Von Minckwitz & Martin 2012). Of interest are those studies which have reported similar survival of patients with and without TNBC when a complete response of no invasive or in situ residuals in the breast and nodes) can be confirmed by pathology (Schwentner et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2009).|$|E
