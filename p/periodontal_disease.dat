5|$|Distortion in the molars is {{the most}} common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils. Sometimes the {{replacement}} was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease,</b> with half of these containing caries. The teeth also sometimes had cancerous growths.|$|E
5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease,</b> bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease,</b> the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease</b> often begins and could develop caries.|$|E

Results Four randomized clinical trials were analyzed in the final review process. For the primary outcome, probing pocket depth, there would be no clinical beneficial effect of probiotics. For secondary outcomes, probiotics have shown small benefits on plaque index and gingival inflammation. Conclusions Based on the results of this review, the effectiveness of probiotics on the prevention and treatment of <b>periodontal</b> <b>diseases</b> is questionable. There is currently insufficient evidence demonstrating the benefits of systematic preventative use of probiotics in patients with <b>periodontal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Clinical relevance The use of probiotics are described to prevent or treat <b>periodontal</b> <b>diseases</b> in some clinical trials; therefore, a systematic review of the evidence for the effect of <b>periodontal</b> <b>diseases</b> is needed...|$|R

5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease.</b> Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
25|$|In {{five percent}} of cases, {{advanced}} periodontitis or gum inflammation between {{the second and third}} molars precipitates the removal of wisdom teeth. Among patients with retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth, roughly 25% have gum infections (<b>periodontal</b> <b>disease).</b> Teeth with periodontal pockets of greater than 5mm have tooth loss rates that start at 10 teeth lost per 1000 teeth per year at 5mm to a rate of 70 teeth lost per year per 1000 teeth at 11mm. The risk of <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease</b> and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease</b> and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or <b>periodontal</b> <b>disease.</b> Periodontal probing depths increase over time to greater than 4mm in a significant proportion of young adults with retained impacted wisdom teeth which is associated with increases in serum inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and C-reactive protein.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To collect {{information}} on knowledge about <b>periodontal</b> <b>diseases</b> and their management among patients attending the Prince Philip Dental Hospital (PPDH) in Hong Kong for enhancing effectiveness of oral hygiene instructions and achieving better periodontal treatment outcomes. Methods: Cross-sectional self-administered pilot-tested questionnaire survey of 500 adults (mean age 48. 4 years, SD= 14. 6, 54 % female) attending the PPDH selected by convenience sampling from January to July 2010. Results: 46 % {{of the subjects}} claimed to know what gingivitis is while 64 % knew about periodontitis. 92 % reported that poor plaque control {{was the most important}} risk factor for <b>periodontal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Stress was recognized as a risk factor for <b>periodontal</b> <b>diseases</b> by 28 % of the subjects.
