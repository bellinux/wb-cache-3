50|$|There are {{two main}} sources of new {{research}} projects, namely ideas originating from the researchers themselves (“supply push”) and those coming from customers (“demand pull”). Ideas for new processes typically originate from researchers, ideas for new products from customers, respectively customer contacts. Particularly in custom manufacturing, “demand pull” prevails industrial reality. The “new product committee” is the body of choice for evaluating new and monitoring ongoing research activities. It has the assignment to evaluate all new product ideas. It decides whether a new product idea should be taken up in research, reassesses a project at regular intervals and, {{last but not least}} decides also about the abandonment of a project, once it becomes evident that the objectives cannot be reached. In a typical project the overall responsibility for the economic and technical success lies with the project champion. He is assisted by the project manager, who is responsible for the technical success. In custom manufacturing, a typical project starts with the acceptance of the product idea, which originates mainly from business development, by the new <b>product</b> <b>committee,</b> followed by the preparation of a laboratory process, and ends with the successful completion of demonstration runs on industrial scale and the signature of a multiyear supply contract, respectively. The input from the customer is contained in the “technology package”. Its main constituents are (1) reaction scheme, (2) target of project & deliverables (product, quantity, required dates, specifications), (3) list of analytical methods, (4) process development opportunities (stepwise assessment), (5) list of required reports, (6) Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) issues, (7) materials to be supplied by customer and (8) packaging & shipping information The technical part of a project usually determines its duration. Depending {{on the quality of the}} information contained in the “technology package” received from the customer and the complexity of the project as such, particularly the number of steps that have to be performed; it can be any time between 12 and 24 months. Depending on the number of researches involved, the total budget easily amounts to several million US dollars.|$|E
40|$|Regulation (EU) No. 528 / 2012 {{requires}} that {{a risk assessment}} is performed for products containing biocidal active substances. The assessment includes the evaluation of residues in food and feed. Through the use of biocides in domestic households by non-professional users food can be exposed. This may occur either via direct exposure of food or upon contact of food items with biocide residues deposited on surfaces. With active participation of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) the Working Group ARTFood (Biocidal <b>Product</b> <b>Committee</b> Adhoc Working Group for the Assessment of Residue Transfer into Foods) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has developed the “Draft Guidance on Estimating Dietary Risk from Transfer of Biocidal Active Substances into Foods – Non-professional Uses” (Draft Guidance Non-Prof Use). The draft document has been published on the ECHA website. The Draft Guidance Non-Prof Use proposes models for estimating consumer exposure to biocidal active substances in their food. In order to facilitate the performance of these exposure estimates the BfR has developed an Excel-based tool for calculating the exposure for various scenarios. Calculations are based on assumptions and default values {{as described in the}} Draft Guidance Non-Prof Use. Calculator and the draft guidance are intended to support competent authorities and industry in the estimation of dietary risk to humans from biocidal products that are used in domestic environments (households) and could contaminate food...|$|E

The objective is to provide the New <b>Products</b> <b>Committee</b> with a recommendation concerning approval of this product {{based on the information}} gathered. The portland cement concrete admixture Ipanex (Registered trademark) did not show any significant benefit in terms of improvement in areas of permeability, chloride resistance and strength in the testing performed at the Iowa DOT. The literature and reports reviewed did not provide enough credible evidence to refute this conclusion. Additionally, the benefits ascribed to this product can be more economically achieved using other currently available products such as slag and silica fume. The recommendation is that this product not be approved for use on State projects in Iowa...|$|R
