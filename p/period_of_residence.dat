5|$|Madison, {{a member}} of the Democratic-Republican Party, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E

25|$|Frances Burney died on 6 January 1840. She {{was buried}} {{with her son}} and her husband in Walcot {{cemetery}} in Bath.

For example, in the United Kingdom up to 2001, each 15 February a new electoral register came into effect, based on registration as of the previous 10 October, with the effect of limiting voting to those resident five to seventeen months earlier depending on the timing of the election.|$|E
25|$|Robert Mannyng (1264–1340) is {{credited}} with putting the speech of the ordinary people of his time into recognisable form. He is better known as Robert de Brunne because of his long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> as a canon at Bourne Abbey. There he completed his life's work, popularising religious and historical material in a Middle English dialect that was easily understood at that time. His Handlyng Synne is acknowledged to be of great value for the glimpses it gives into the ways and thoughts of his contemporaries and shows us the language then in common use.|$|E

500|$|Congress {{specifically}} passed four measures – the Naturalization Act, the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. These statutes {{were designed}} to mitigate the threat of secessionists by disallowing their most extreme firebrands. The Naturalization Act increased to 14 years the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> required for an immigrant to attain American citizenship (naturalized citizens tended {{to vote for the}} Democratic-Republicans.) The Alien Friends Act and the Alien Enemies Act allowed the president to deport any foreigner (from friendly and hostile nations, respectively) which he considered dangerous to the country. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish [...] "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" [...] against the government or its officials. Punishments included 2–5 years in prison and fines of up to $5,000. Although Adams had not promoted any of these acts, he signed them into law.|$|E
500|$|Gibbs' final {{addition}} to Tyntesfield was added between 1872 and 1877, when he commissioned Arthur Blomfield {{to add a}} Gothic chapel to {{the north side of}} the house. Modelled on Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, it housed an organ by William Hill & Sons, and below a vault in which Gibbs intended to be buried. However, combined opposition from both the vicar of the local All Saints Church, Wraxall and the church's patron, a member of the Gorges family, led to the Bishop of Bath and Wells decreeing that he would not sanction the consecration of Tyntesfield's chapel, through fears that it would take power away from the local population fully into Gibb's hands. Despite this, the chapel formed a central part of life at Tyntesfield, and prayers were said twice-daily by the family and their guests. Throughout their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> the family would also open the chapel to local people on an annual basis, often during Rogation days and at Christmas. In praise of the resultant final building, Yonge described the chapel as the final completion of the Tyntesfield project, providing [...] "a character to the household almost resembling that of Little Gidding". Little Gidding in Huntingdonshire was the home of Nicholas Ferrar during the reign of Charles I who was much idealized by 19th-century Anglo-Catholics.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, {{the terms}} [...] "nationality" [...] and [...] "citizenship" [...] {{can be used}} interchangeably, but the term [...] "citizenship" [...] (or [...] "citizen") is more {{commonly}} used, while [...] "nationality" [...] is most often used in official documents and forms. In general, a person may acquire citizenship automatically ("by operation of law") through birth in Australia or through Australian descent, or by application after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in Australia. The process of acquiring citizenship by application {{is referred to as}} [...] "naturalisation".|$|E

These <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> furthered his research on 16th-century glass, and he formed friendships with other stained-glass scholars.|$|R
2500|$|Not {{all thought}} that Harris used his power well. Alan Gibson once {{wrote that he}} was [...] "an antediluvian old tyrant", though he later {{retracted}} this, saying that Harris was a more complex figure than that. But, complex or not, Harris was never accused by contemporaries of being an intellectual. He might have robbed England of the services {{of one of its}} greatest batsmen, Wally Hammond, who had been born in Kent but chose to play for Gloucestershire, where he had gone to school. Hammond had not fulfilled the required <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> to qualify for Gloucestershire and, once Harris became aware of this, Hammond was barred from playing for them until the necessary time had elapsed. The affair resulted in Harris complaining about what he called [...] "bolshevism" [...] influencing cricket.|$|E
2500|$|There is stylistic {{development}} {{as well in}} {{that some of the}} new poems are lengthy; [...] "Salvación de la primavera" [...] amounts to 55 quatrains (220 lines) and [...] "Más allá", which eventually became the very first book in the collection, consists of 50 quatrains. [...] There are also more medium-length poems of around 40-50 lines, such as [...] "Viento saltado" [...] and [...] "El desterrado", most of which were written or started during Guillén’s <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> at Oxford. [...] The collection is grouped into 5 sections, frequently book-ended by these longer poems, so that it has a more formally pleasing shape. [...] The versification is also more varied; there are many more romances (octosyllabic lines with assonance in the even-numbered lines); Guillén starts to write sonnets; he introduces longer lines and also the assonantal quatrains of the longer poems.|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} {{legacy of}} Curtin's was the significant expansion {{of social services}} under his leadership. In 1942, uniform taxation was imposed on the various states, which enabled the Curtin Government {{to set up a}} far-reaching, federally administered range of social services. These included a widows' pension (1942), maternity benefits for Indigenous Australians (1942), funeral benefits (1943), a second form of maternity benefit (1943), a wife's allowance (1943), additional allowances for the children of pensioners (1943), unemployment, sickness and Special Benefits (1945), and pharmaceutical benefits (1945). Substantial improvements to pensions were made, with invalidity and old-age pensions increased, the qualifying <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> for age pensions halved, and the means test liberalised. Other social security benefits were significantly increased, while child endowment was liberalised, a scheme of vocational training for invalid pensioners was set up, and pensions extended to cover Aborigines.

2500|$|Pacifism and revulsion {{with war}} were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems {{on the theme}} of the {{futility}} of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, Death of a Hero by Richard Aldington, Erich Remarque's translated All Quiet on the Western Front and Beverley Nichols's expose Cry Havoc. A debate at the University of Oxford in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. Dick Sheppard established the Peace Pledge Union in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations. Many members of the Peace Pledge Union later joined the Bruderhof during it's <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in the Cotswolds.|$|E
2500|$|Jerôme {{travelled}} to {{join his}} older brother in Rome in 1621. During Anthony van Dyck’s <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in Rome, the brothers became friends with him and van Dyck painted their portraits. Jerôme worked with his brother on the baldacchino for Saint Peter's in Rome as is testified by a payment in his own name for that work received in 1627. There is no documentation on Jérôme's movements between 1627 and 1641. The assumption {{has been that the}} brothers had a falling out and split ways after which Jerôme went to work primarily in Spain, where he received court commissions, and Portugal. [...] None of his works from that period have been traced. [...] An alternative view of the lack of details on Jérôme's whereabouts and residence in Spain between 1627 and 1641 holds that Jérôme had in fact not left Rome {{for a long period of}} time but had been working inside the workshop of his brother in Rome assisting him with his various commissions. The trip to Spain would therefore have only been rather brief and occurred probably in the year 1640. When in 1641 Jérôme is documented as working in the workshop of the Flemish goldsmith Andreas Ghysels in Florence, he may have been doing so in the execution of designs of his brother.|$|E
60|$|Those {{who desire}} to do {{research}} in some academic subject will, {{for some time to}} come, need a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in some European or American university. But for the great majority of university students it is far better, if possible, to acquire their education in China. Returned students have, to a remarkable extent, the stamp of the country from which they have returned, particularly when that country is America. A society such as was foreshadowed earlier in this chapter, in which all really progressive Chinese should combine, would encounter difficulties, as things stand, from the divergencies in national bias between students returned from (say) Japan, America and Germany. Given time, this difficulty can be overcome by the increase in purely Chinese university education, but at present the difficulty would be serious.|$|E
