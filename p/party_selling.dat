50|$|When FASB {{first began}} working on FIN 46, it focused on special purpose {{entities}} such as the entities Enron used. FASB then recognized that the principles of FIN 46 should apply to all entities where a variable interest exists, so the final interpretation was broader than the original objective. Also, in a securitization, if a <b>party</b> <b>selling</b> assets to a VIE maintains an ongoing involvement with those assets (for example as a swap counterparty to the VIE with respect to asset cashflows) then Financial Accounting Standard 140 (FAS 140), which deals with de-recognition of assets upon transfer to a special purpose entity, will also be relevant.|$|E

50|$|Blackburn J {{reasoned}} that the rule of absolute liability only applied to positive, definite contracts, not to those {{in which there was}} an express or implied condition underlying the contract. Blackburn J further {{reasoned that}} the continued existence of the Music Hall in Surrey Gardens was an implied condition essential for the fulfillment of the contract. The destruction of the music hall was the fault of neither party, and rendered the performance of the contract by either party impossible. Blackburn J cited the civil code of France and the Roman law for the proposition that when the existence of a particular thing is essential to a contract, and the thing is destroyed by no fault of the <b>party</b> <b>selling</b> it, the parties are freed from obligation to deliver the thing. He further analogized to a situation in which a contract requiring personal performance is made, and the party to perform dies, the party’s executors are not held liable under English common law. Blackburn J thus held that both parties were excused from their obligations under their contract.|$|E

40|$|Since the Supreme Court {{decision}} Burlington Northern 2 ̆ 6 Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, {{courts have}} wrestled {{with what it}} means to be an arranger under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). One aspect of arranger liability that has undergone radical change in the past decade is the useful product doctrine, which allows a party to escape arranger liability by proving it was selling a useful product rather than arranging for disposal. Prior to Burlington Northern, courts applied the useful product doctrine restrictively, only allowing <b>parties</b> <b>selling</b> virgin products to escape liability and imposing liability on <b>parties</b> <b>selling</b> useful secondary products. Following Burlington Northern, this shifted, with courts requiring concrete evidence of intent in arrangements for disposal and allowing <b>parties</b> <b>selling</b> secondary products to escape liability even when their actions directly contributed to environmental contamination. This Note argues that this shift in the useful product doctrine will negatively impact the Superfund litigation landscape, and more importantly, the environment. This Note also posits that the shift in the useful product doctrine can be correlated to a shift in administrative law, away from deferring to agency decisions and towards a more searching judicial inquiry. This Note argues that the courts should scale back their permissive approach to the useful product doctrine and give greater weight to agency expertise and agency liability determinations when ruling on arranger liability cases in the useful product arena...|$|R
50|$|Dobrescu {{also found}} himself {{ignored by the}} establishment: in the session of March 10, 1898, his {{interpellation}} about bootlegging ended inconclusively, as most of his colleagues {{got up and left}} the Assembly hall. He received some attention from Ion I. C. Brătianu, the new Minister of Public Works, who agreed with him on building a railway link between Curtea de Argeș and Câineni. By then, Dobrescu had been formally indicted of falsifying an insurance policy and embezzling funds. In June, he was arrested and sent to Văcărești prison, but made bail. As reported by Filipescu's Epoca, his time in confinement was needlessly prolonged by hostile bailiffs, causing Dobrescu's mother to faint in public. However, the authorities discarded normal procedure, and left out biometrics when Dobrescu refused to comply, threatening to kill himself. He pleaded his case at the Correctional Tribunal, arguing that the counterfeiting was the work of his mistress, a Ms Ionescu. According to various accounts, he was being framed by the ruling class, although such accusations had surfaced independently in earlier years. In 1889, the peasants of Mușătești had complained that Dobrescu, hired to legalize their land claims, had absconded with their money. According to legend, Dobrescu also financed his <b>party</b> <b>selling</b> worthless bonds to peasants across the country. The scheme was only uncovered when one of his invoices showed up in a bankruptcy lawsuit. He was subsequently derided by his adversaries as Dobrescu-Chitanță ("Dobrescu-Invoice").|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to identify}} and investigate factors involved in direct sale in relation to Chinese culture. Direct sale is one form of direct marketing, which can include door-to-door, office-to-office, home <b>party</b> <b>selling,</b> etc. For a salesperson {{to be able to}} do business with people from various cultures, he/she needs to understand the differences in their values and in their consumer needs. Cultural values have implications for marketing communication and direct selling activities. After a literature review of the two areas, direct sale and Chinese culture a theoretical model was developed. This model will be helpful for companies when entering the Chinese market through direct sale. The model consists of twelve factors involved in direct sale; communication, commitment, trust, collective, friendship, empathy, respect, conflict avoidance, loyalty, functionality, behaviour, and home party. The aim is to show how important each of the factors is for direct selling in China. From the interpretations of the research review we came to the conclusion that all factors are considered to be of importance in relation to Chinese culture. In order to test the model we conducted a survey. Our population consisted of Chinese exchange students at Kristianstad University in Sweden. The result of the survey became the base of a new model. The new model showed that all factors were of importance but with different degrees. In order to see if our model might be useful in real life we chose to include a case study of Oriflame. All the factors in our model supported Oriflame’s strategy...|$|E
