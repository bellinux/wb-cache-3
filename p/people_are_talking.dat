500|$|Journalist Nicholas D. Kristof thanked Invisible Children {{for making}} the film and {{addressed}} its criticism, stating that rather than being [...] "white man's burden", when [...] "a warlord continues to kill and torture across a swath of Congo and Central African Republic ... it's a human burden." [...] He also said that complexity had long been [...] "a leading excuse for inaction during atrocities" [...] and that Kony remains a threat in Uganda's neighbour countries, so {{the simplicity of the}} film [...] "has left the American public more informed" [...] than it would be otherwise, and that if he [...] "were a Congolese villager", he would [...] "welcome these uncertain efforts over the sneering scorn of do-nothing armchair cynics." [...] Foreign correspondent Roger Cohen called it [...] "simplifying grossly and distorting adeptly to make a valid point: that no effort should be spared to arrest Kony." [...] British film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that Kony 2012, despite its flaws, [...] "lands an almighty punch. This is a principled campaign ad, and a very, very effective one." [...] Former war correspondent Gotham Chopra said that he understands [...] "the instinctive backlash (really it’s irritation)" [...] towards the film and the campaign, but [...] "there is enormous value in the fact that millions of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> today about genocide in Africa that were mostly unaware of it yesterday." [...] Jane Bussmann, author of a 2009 book about Kony and the President of Uganda Yoweri Museveni, compared the campaign favorably to the [...] "culture of charity-as-industry" [...] as [...] "at least Kony2012 linked suffering to perpetrators, and urged the young American audience it's aimed at to contact a politician." [...] Matthew Green, author of a 2008 book about Kony and the LRA conflict, The Wizard of the Nile, wrote that IC had [...] "achieved more with their 30-minute video than battalions of diplomats, NGO workers and journalists have since the conflict began 26 years ago." ...|$|E

However, she stated that she did not think there would be [...] "this much anticipation, or acknowledgement of what I was doing". She said she loves to be in the limelight and that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about her so much.

2500|$|Philip John Stead {{concluded}} {{his review}} in the Times Literary Supplement of 12 December 1958, with, [...] "The solution of Ordeal By Innocence is certainly not {{below the level of}} Mrs Christie's customary ingenuity, but the book lacks other qualities which her readers have come to expect. What has become of the blitheness, the invigorating good spirits with which the game of detection is played in so many of her stories? Ordeal By Innocence slips out of that cheerful arena into something much too like an attempt at psychological fiction. It is too much of a conversation piece and too many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> – people in whom it is hard to take the necessary amount of interest because there is not enough space to establish them. The kind of workmanship which has been lavished on this tale is not a kind in which the author excels and the reader feels that Miss Marple and Poirot would thoroughly disapprove of the whole business." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{later years}} his poetry became {{progressively}} more cryptic, fractured and monosyllabic, bearing {{comparison to the}} music of Anton Webern. He also increased his use of German neologisms, especially in his later works Fadensonnen ("Threadsuns") and Lichtzwang. In the eyes of some, Celan attempted in his poetry either to destroy or remake the German language. For others, he retained a sense for the lyricism of the German language which was rare in writers of that time. As he writes {{in a letter to his}} wife Gisèle Lestrange on one of his trips to Germany: [...] "The German I talk is not the same as the language the German <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> here". Writing in German was a way for him to think back and remember his parents, particularly his mother, from whom he had learned the language. This is underlined in [...] "" [...] (Lupin), a poem in which Paul Celan addresses his mother. The urgency and power of Celan's work stem from his attempt to find words [...] "after", to bear (impossible) witness in a language that gives back no words [...] "for that which happened".|$|E
2500|$|The last of McManaman's caps came in 2001 when Sven-Göran Eriksson {{utilised}} him for {{his first}} games in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including a game back at Anfield against Finland – where McManaman set up David Beckham's winner– but then apparently {{left a message on}} McManaman's answering machine to inform him {{that he was not going}} to be in the final World Cup squad in early 2002. Despite the pleas of McManaman's Real Madrid team mates Zidane and Fernando Hierro for McManaman's case, McManaman said he never ever heard from or met Eriksson again. Zidane went on to state England had made a mistake, and described McManaman with a rare passion as one of the highest quality players he ever played with: [...] "I was surprised when McManaman was left out of the last England squad. I couldn't believe they would ignore a player of his quality. Now <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about the fact that maybe he will get his chance because David Beckham is injured. But McManaman is far better than just being a replacement for Beckham. McManaman should be in the starting line-up anyway." [...] Support for McManaman also came before the 2002 World Cup in the British media, after Sky Sports published an article based on OPTA statistics, revealing that despite a poor goalscoring record, McManaman had in fact an 88% dribbling completion rate (having embarked on a run every 17 minutes), and an 84% pass completion rate, all three of which were higher by over 15% than any English midfield Premiership player at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In a May 17, 2010 {{article in}} The Daily Bruin, writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both {{supporters}} and {{critics of the}} protest movement were increasing: [...] "The Facebook group is 35,000 strong. To compare, the anti-Draw Mohammed Day group is almost 30,000 strong. Both are gaining members rapidly." [...] In a May 18, 2010 article, [...] "Why We're Having an Everybody Draw Mohammed Contest on Thursday May 20", Reason editor Nick Gillespie explained: [...] "No one {{has a right to}} an audience or even to a sympathetic hearing, much less an engaged audience. But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion. If we cannot or will not defend that principle with a full throat, then we deserve to choke on whatever jihadists of all stripes can force down our throats." [...] Gillespie asserted, [...] "Our Draw Mohammed contest is not a frivolous exercise of hip, ironic, hoolarious sacrilege toward a minority religion in the United States (though even that deserves all the protection that the most serioso political commentary commands). It's a defense of what {{is at the core of}} a society that is painfully incompetent at delivering on its promise of freedom, tolerance, and equal rights." [...] As May 20, 2010, came closer, Molly Norris stated she was staying away from being directly involved in the protest movement. Norris told Dave Ross, [...] "I'm against my own concept becoming a reality.... If I had wanted to be taken seriously, I would be thrilled, but now I'm horrified because people did take it as an actual day. The one-off cartoon is not good as a long term plan because it's offensive." [...] Fox News Channel reported that on May 19, 2010, a Facebook group supporting the protest movement had 41,000 members, and The Register reported this increased to 43,000 the same day. Norris told Fox News Channel in a statement on May 19, [...] "It's turned into something completely different, nothing I could've imagined it morphing into. I'm happy some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking,</b> because obviously this needs to be addressed." [...] By May 20, the Toronto Sun reported that both the [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] group and the [...] "Against 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" [...] Facebook group protesting against the initiative had attracted more than 100,000 supporters, at 101,870 members and 106,000 members respectively.|$|E
