500|$|The ancient Greek and Roman {{philosophers}} and physicians associated old age with increasing dementia. It {{was not until}} 1901 that German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer identified the first case of {{what became known as}} Alzheimer's disease, named after him, in a fifty-year-old woman he called Auguste D. He followed her case until she died in 1906, when he first reported publicly on it. During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature, some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease. The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D. He included Alzheimer's disease, also named <b>presenile</b> <b>dementia</b> by Kraepelin, as a subtype of senile dementia in the eighth edition of his Textbook of Psychiatry, published on [...] 1910.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the century a large number of papers have appeared dealing with the patho-logical and clinical aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Although electroencephalography (E. E. G.) has become a common method of investigation in neurology and psychiatry, very few E. E. G. studies have been reported on histologically proven cases of Alzheimer's disease. In some instances the E. E. G. had been carried out incidentally when the descrip-tion of the cases was mainly clinical (Stengel, 1943), while in other reports the emphasis was mainly on a therapeutic trial (Sim and Smith, 1955) or on a diagnostic problem (Parr, 1955).

The lecturer that followed Alzheimer was to speak on the topic of [...] "compulsive masturbation", which the audience was so eagerly awaiting that they sent Alzheimer away without any questions or comments on his discovery of the pathology of a type of senile dementia.|$|E
50|$|Pisa {{syndrome}} {{was discovered}} by Karl Axel Ekbom, a Swedish neurologist, in the early 1970s. Cases of the syndrome were first observed in three elderly female patients suffering from <b>presenile</b> <b>dementia.</b> Each of these women were undergoing treatment with the antipsychotic drug methylperone, haloperidol {{or a combination of}} the two. The use of neuroleptic drugs caused the patients to exhibit a lateral flexion along with a rotation of the trunk. As the patients walked they experienced an increase in rotation. The postural and gait disturbances symptoms is what set this apart from any other form of acute dystonia previously observed. These symptoms proved to be the making of a new dystonic reaction, which was termed pleurothotonus or Pisa syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The second {{patient to}} undergo methylperone {{treatment}} was a 63-year-old woman with <b>presenile</b> <b>dementia,</b> which {{caused her to}} experience restlessness and paranoid hallucinations. The methylperone treatment was able to alleviate the woman’s problems induced by her dementia. It did not {{take long for the}} woman to begin to experience symptoms of Pisa syndrome and as a result she was taken off of the methylperone treatment. Like the first patient, she was able to overcome the induced symptoms of Pisa syndrome within a month. The patient was again treated with methylperone after two months from the first treatment. Soon after the patient began to lean toward the right when standing or walking. She was then administered orphenadrine, which soon stopped the patient’s tilting posture.|$|E
40|$|Paracrystalline {{inclusions}} {{known as}} Hirano bodies characteristically {{appear in the}} hippocampal region of the brains of humans exhibiting senile and <b>presenile</b> <b>dementias</b> {{as well as several}} other neurodegenerative diseases. We present evidence that the currently accepted model for those structures based on alternating filament sheets is not correct, but that Hirano bodies are stacked sheets of membrane-bound ribosomal particles derived from partially degraded rough endoplasmic reticulum or Nissl substance. Using fluorescence staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide, were have shown that the bodies contain RNA. Spatial filtering of electron micrographs by Fourier techniques shows that the individual particles that make up the arrays have a characteristic shape previously reported for the large subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. The storage of these ribosomal particles in inclusion bodies may indicate a quiescent state of protein synthesis in the cells. This withdrawal of synthetic mechanisms in the hippocampus may have significant consequences in the loss of ability to consolidate short-term to long-term memory...|$|R
40|$|The EEGs are {{reported}} {{on a group of}} 95 patients with Huntington's chorea. Thirty one showed little activity of any kind, and in particular no alpha rhythm above 10 μV in amplitude was seen. Only those records which still met these criteria when re-examined were included in the `low voltage' category. EEGs in this category occurred significantly more frequently in institutionalized patients and in those with a positive family history of Huntington's chorea, dementia, and choreiform movements together. Computer averaged responses to light and sound were found in the three patients examined, though their routine EEGs were low voltage. Neuropathological examination confirmed a clinical diagnosis of Huntington's chorea in 14 patients investigated. There was a statistically significant association between cortical atrophy, including the frontal lobe, and a `low voltage' EEG. It was concluded that the low voltage record, though not specific for Huntington's chorea, was rare in other neurological disorders. The EEG is therefore of value in patients suspected of having Huntington's chorea as well as in various <b>presenile</b> <b>dementias...</b>|$|R

50|$|The final {{patient was}} a 69-year-old woman, {{diagnosed}} with <b>presenile</b> <b>dementia</b> after she expressing symptoms of memory dysfunction, depression and urinary incontinence. As a result, {{the woman was}} put under a methylperone treatment, which soon caused a bending and rotation to her left. These symptoms disappeared soon after being taken off of methylperone. Unlike the other two patients, when the woman was again administered methylperone she did not exhibit any previous dystonic symptoms {{after two weeks of}} treatment. The patient was then switched to a small dosage of haloperidol along with the typical dosage of orphenadrine used on the previous patients. Instead of not having symptoms of Pisa syndrome, the woman began to experience a leaning to her left side and a particular rotation of her shoulder towards the left. Once haloperidol was eliminated from the treatment the patient no longer had these symptoms.|$|E

40|$|<b>Presenile</b> <b>dementia</b> may {{be caused}} by a variety of {{different}} genetic conditions such as familial Alzheimer's disease, prion disease as well as several hereditary metabolic disorders including adult onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. We report a multigenerational family with autosomal dominant <b>presenile</b> <b>dementia</b> harboring a cerebellar phenotype. Longitudinal clinical work-up in affected family members revealed ataxia accompanied by progressive cognitive decline, rapid loss of global cognition, memory, visuospatial and frontal-executive functions accompanied by progressive motor deterioration and early death. Linkage analysis and exome sequencing identified the p. S 170 F mutation of Presenilin 1 in all affected individuals, which is known to be associated with very early onset Alzheimer's disease. Additional search for potentially modifying variants revealed in all affected individuals of the third generation a paternally inherited variant p. A 58 V (rs 17571) of Cathepsin D which is considered an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Involvement of cerebellar and brainstem structures leading to functional decortication in addition to rapid progressive <b>presenile</b> <b>dementia</b> in this PSEN 1 family may therefore indicate an epistatic effect of the p.

40|$|An Australian {{family with}} {{autosomal}} dominant <b>presenile</b> nonspecific <b>dementia</b> was recently described. The disease results in behavioral changes, usually disinhibition, {{followed by the}} onset of dementia accompanied occasionally by parkinsonism. Twenty-eight affected individuals were identified with an age of onset of 39 to 66 years (mean, 53 +/- 8. 9 years). We mapped the disease locus to an approximately 26 -cM region of chromosome 17 q 21 - 22 with a maximum two-point LOD score of 2. 87. Affected individuals share a common haplotype between markers D 17 S 783 and D 17 S 808. This region of chromosome 17 contains the loci for several neurodegenerative diseases that lack distinctive pathological features, suggesting that these dementias, collectively referred to as frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17), are caused by mutations in the same gene. The entire coding region of five genes, mapped to the FTDP- 17 candidate region, were also sequenced.

40|$|SummaryPLO-SL (polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy) is a recessively {{inherited}} disorder {{characterized by}} systemic bone cysts and progressive <b>presenile</b> frontal-lobe <b>dementia,</b> resulting in death at < 50 years of age. Since the 1960 s, ∼ 160 {{cases have been}} reported, mainly in Japan and Finland. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. In this article, we report the assignment of the locus for PLO-SL, by random genome screening using a modification of the haplotype-sharing method, in patients from a genetically isolated population. By screening five patient samples from 2 Finnish families, followed by linkage analysis of 12 Finnish families, 3 Swedish families, and 1 Norwegian family, {{we were able to}} assign the PLO-SL locus to a 9 -cM interval between markers D 19 S 191 and D 19 S 420 on chromosome 19 q 13. The critical region was further restricted, to ∼ 1. 8 Mb, by linkage-disequilibrium analysis of the Finnish families. According to the haplotype analysis, one Swedish and one Norwegian PLO-SL family are not linked to the chromosome 19 locus, suggesting that PLO-SL is a heterogeneous disease. In this chromosomal region, one potential candidate gene for PLO-SL, the gene encoding amyloid precursor–like protein 1, was analyzed, but no mutations were detected in the coding region...|$|R
40|$|Frontotemporal {{dementia}} (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two frequent {{causes of}} dementia that share both clinical and neuropathological features. Common to both disorders are the neurofibrillary tangles consisting of aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Recently, {{a number of}} different pathogenic mutations in the tau gene have been identified in families with FTD and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17). In the present study, a Swedish family with <b>presenile</b> degenerative <b>dementia</b> with bitemporal atrophy was screened for mutations in the tau gene. As a result, the R 406 W mutation in exon 13 was identified in all affected cases. This mutation has previously been reported in two different FTDP- 17 families of Dutch and Midwestern American origin. Common features to these two kindreds and our family are the late age at onset and long duration of the disease. Our pedigree as well as the American one show early memory impairment and pronounced temporal lobar atrophy similar to AD, while the Dutch cases show more FTD features. This further illustrates the large clinical variability among cases with tau mutations and stresses the importance of genetic classification in addition to the traditional clinical classification of neurodegenerative disorders.
