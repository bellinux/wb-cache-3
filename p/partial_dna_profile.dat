40|$|Background: Bloodstains often {{constitute}} the major physical evidence in criminal investi-gations. In many cases, the bloodstains {{found by the}} crime scene examiner are minute, possibly because of dissimulation efforts by the perpetrator to eliminate evidence that reveals his identity. In such cases, short tandem repeat (STR) detection procedures must be performed using the same minute bloodstain evidence on which presumptive tests had been performed earlier. In the present study, {{two of the most}} often used presumptive test reagents, phenolphthalein and leucomalachite green, were tested to determine their effects on the ability to obtain STR profiles from minute bloodstains. Methods: Dried minute bloodstains obtained from 10 donors were treated with phenolphthalein and leucomalachite green. After various times, genomic DNA was extracted from the treated samples using a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit. DNA was quantified with real-time PCR using a Quantifiler Kit. STR loci were amplified using an AmpFLSTR Identifiler Plus Kit, and the amplified products were separated via capillary electrophoresis in a 3130 Genetic Analyzer. Results: Full <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> were obtained from all minute bloodstain samples treated with phenolph-thalein when extracted after intervals ranging from 1 h to 1 week. In contrast, the DNA in minute bloodstain samples treated with leucomalachite green was severely degraded, especially after relatively long intervals, leading to poor <b>partial</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> Conclusion: Phenolphthalein is recommended as a safe presumptive test reagent for the detection of blood evidence recovered from crime scenes that might subsequently undergo <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> analysis...|$|R
25|$|Arthur Leigh Allen, of Vallejo, owned {{a mobile}} home at Sunset Trailer Park in Santa Rosa {{at the time of}} the murders. He had been fired from his Valley Springs Elementary School {{teaching}} position for suspected child molestation in 1968 and was a full-time student at Sonoma State College. Allen was arrested on September 27, 1974, by the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office and charged with child molestation in an unrelated case involving a young boy. He pleaded guilty on March 14, 1975, and was imprisoned at Atascadero State Hospital until late 1977.

40|$|When a Y-chromosomal and a (<b>partial)</b> {{autosomal}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> {{are obtained}} from one crime sample, and both profiles match the suspect's profiles, {{we would like}} to know the combined evidential value. To calculate the likelihood ratio of observing the autosomal and Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> combined, we need to know the conditional random match probability of the observed autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> given the Y-chromosomal match. We examine this conditional probability in two ways: (1) with a database containing data of 2, 085 men and (2) using a simulation model. We conclude that if the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> match, we can still regard the autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> as independent from the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> if the matching person is not a descendant of the father of the donor of the (crime) sample.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Frequently, evidentiary items {{contain an}} {{insufficient}} quantity of DNA to obtain complete or even <b>partial</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> using stand-ard forensic gentotyping techniques. Such low-copy-number (LCN) samples are usually subjected to increased amplification cylces to obtain genetic data. In this study, a 28 -cycle {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) {{was used to evaluate}} various methods of post-PCR purification for their effects on the sensitivity of fluorophore-based allelic detection subsequent to capillary electrophoretic separation. The amplified product was purified using filtra-tion, silica gel membrane, and enzyme mediated hydrolysis purification techniques and evaluated for their effect on fluorescent allelic signal intensity. A purification method was selected and its effect on fluorescent allelic signal intensity was compared with that of the unpurified PCR product. A method of post-PCR purification is described which increases the sensitivity of standard 28 -cycle PCR such that <b>profiles</b> from LCN <b>DNA</b> tem-plates (< 100 pg DNA) can be obtained. Full <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> were consistently obtained with as little as 20 pg template DNA without increased cycle number. In mock case type samples with dermal ridge fingerprints, genetic profiles were obtained by amplification with 28 cycles followed by post-PCR purification whereas no profiles were obtained without purification of the PCR product. Allele dropout, increased stutter, and sporadic contami-nation typical of LCN analysis were observed; however, no contamination was observed in negative amplification controls. Post-PCR purification of the PCR product can increase the sensitivity of capillary electrophoresis {{to such an extent that}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> can be obtained from < 100 pg of DNA using 28 -cycle amplification...|$|R

40|$|In {{forensic}} science {{it is common}} practice to work on problems where the likelihood ratio is based on observing single piece of evidence given two hypotheses. However, {{in a lot of}} cases, {{there is more than one}} piece of evidence. In this thesis three problems regarding combining <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> are discussed. First, we derived a method to combine the evidential value of different <b>partial</b> Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of different stains. The method consists of finding a lower bound for the likelihood ratio when more than two propositions are compared and where we don't need the prior probabilities of the different propositions. Second, we made a simulation model to investigate the dendence of autosomal and Y chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> by assuming that everybody with the same Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> has a common ancestor and simulating the assignment of autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> over different family tree structures. The results can be used in practice as scientific support for the assumption of independence between the Y and autosomal profile. Third, we developed a model to interpret (low-template) <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> which is able to give the likelihood of observing the <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> given any allele-combination of the donor. This model assumes that a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> is a result of a stochastic process where the input are the alleles of a possible donor. This model uses the information in peak heights without using any threshold. The model shows promising results in determining the combined evidential value of several low template <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> that were obtained from the same stain.

40|$|Questioned {{documents}} are often received into the forensic laboratories of the NSW Police Force requiring examination for both trace DNA and latent indentations using the Electrostatic Detection Apparatus (ESDA®). Recently, these documents have included extortion notes, threatening letters and white powder instances. Debate often arises {{as to what}} is the best sequence of examinations. This is a difficult question to answer and assessments need to be made on a case-­‐by-­‐case basis. The difficulty arises because unless there is an obvious bloodstain on the document it is impossible {{to determine whether or not}} trace DNA may be present. The other important consideration is that the tape lifting process adversely affects the recovery of indentations from a questioned document. This leaves investigators with the quandary of which evidence type to risk compromising. The results of this research confirmed that it is inherently difficult to recover trace DNA from a document using the tape lifting method. Even when relatively large quantities of DNA were placed in a specified area on a document, the recovery rate was extremely low. Despite the placement difficulties, two significant findings were made. Firstly, successful <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> were obtained from tape lifted samples taken after an ESDA® examination had taken place. Secondly, DNA can be transferred from a questioned document to the underside of the Mylar® film during an ESDA® examination. Swabs taken from the Mylar® showed that full and <b>partial</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> were successfully obtained. The research also showed that tape lifting a document prior to an ESDA® examination had a severely adverse effect on the ability of the ESDA® to recover and develop indentations. At worst, the tape lift can cause tears and areas of the paper’s surface to be lifted whilst at the same time effectively ‘pulling’ the indentations out of the paper (making them difficult to detect). At best, there is fibre disturbance that causes the development of background noise on the ESDA foil reducing the visibility, definition and legibility of the developed indentations. Given these findings, important consideration needs to be given to documents requiring examinations for both latent indentations and trace DNA to ensure that neither examination is compromised. In cases where it is decided that both examinations are required, the ESDA examination should be conducted before tape lifting for trace DNA...|$|R

The effect of cyanoacrylate fuming on genetic typing is negligible when DNA is extracted using Invisorb kit. It also affects the PCR products (Wurmb et al. 2001). Bhoelai et al.

40|$|DNA evidence, linking {{perpetrators}} {{to crime}} scenes, {{is central to}} many legal proceedings. However, crime scene samples often contain extraneous substances that may interfere with the PCR-based forensic analysis, resulting in <b>partial</b> or negative <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> Extensive <b>DNA</b> purification may remove inhibitors, but involves the risk of DNA loss. In this work, pre-PCR processing was applied to improve the success rate of forensic DNA analysis of “dirty” samples without interfering with {{the composition of the}} samples. An experimental model system was developed to screen for inhibitor-tolerant DNA polymerase-buffer systems. The best-performing polymerases, Bio-X-Act Short, ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF, were applied in STR DNA analysis of PCRinhibitory crime scenes samples, i. e. samples that failed to produce complete <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> in routine casework despite containing acceptable levels of DNA. A ranking index, called the forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> index (FI), was developed to quantitatively describe <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> quality. The application of analysis of variance (ANOVA) to FI values confirmed that the three alternative polymerases significantly improved <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> quality for 20 of 32 problematic samples, compared with the standard polymerase AmpliTaq Gold. ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF showed complementary inhibitor-relieving properties. A blend of the two polymerases exhibited tolerance to a broader range of extraneous compounds, improving <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> quality in 34 of 42 PCR-inhibitory forensic samples. When used separately, ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF improved the results of analysis for 26 and 23 samples, respectively. Apart from their complementarity, synergy between the polymerases was mathematically proven by calculating the geometric mean values of FI and applying ANOVA. In November, 2010, the customised DNA polymerase blend was introduced in routine casework at the Swedish National Laboratory of Forensic Science, increasing the proportion of complete <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> generated from impure samples from 38 % to 87 % for saliva, and from 69 % to 94 % for blood. Many presumed saliva crime scene stains give negative DNA results if presumptive testing is not performed. In this work, amylase activity testing was evaluated as a tool for saliva screening. No direct correlation was found between amylase activity and the DNA content of saliva.

40|$|DNA becomes {{progressively}} more fragmented as biological tissue degrades resulting in decreasing ability {{to gain a}} complete <b>DNA</b> <b>profile.</b> Successful identification of samples exhibiting very high levels of DNA degradation may be complicated by presenting in minute quantities. The industry standard method for human DNA identification utilising short tandem repeats (STR) may produce <b>partial</b> or no <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> with such samples. We report a comparative study of genotyping using STRs, mini-STRs and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with template {{at different levels of}} degradation in varying amounts. Two methods of assessing quantity and quality of a DNA sample prior to genotyping were investigated. The QIAxcel capillary gel electrophoresis system provided a rapid, cost effective screening method for assessing sample quality. A real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was able to simultaneously quantify total human DNA, male DNA, DNA degradation and PCR inhibition. The extent of DNA degradation could be assessed with reasonable accuracy to 62. 5 pg and genomic targets could be quantified to a lower limit of 15. 6 pg. The qPCR assay was able to detect male DNA to a lower limit of 20 pg in a 1 : 1, 000 background of female DNA. By considering the amount of DNA and the degradation ratio of a sample, a general prediction of genotyping success using AmpFlSTR® Profiler Plus®, MiniFiler¿ kits and SNP analysis can be made. The results indicate mini-STRs and SNP markers are usually more successful in typing degraded samples and in cases of extreme DNA degradation (= 200 bp) and template amounts below 250 pg, mini-STR and SNP analysis yielded significantly more complete profiles and lower match probabilities than corresponding STR profiles...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1994 Jane Moira TaupinThe innovative forensic technique of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> has been acclaimed {{as the most important}} advance in forensic science since fingerprinting. Whilst there is much anecdotal information on the impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on criminal investigation, prosecution and adjudication, there is little quantitative and control comparison data on the routine use of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> This study evaluates the effect of the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> in Victoria on a number of key points in the criminal justice system. The overall impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was low as determined by the percentage of criminal cases which utilise <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> However, in certain classes of cases its impact was measurable, most notably in sex offences committed by “strangers”. Less than one quarter of sexual offence cases of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiled</b> resulted in a contested trial, suggesting that the focus of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on the criminal justice system should swing to the pre-trial phase. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was most often used in sexual offence cases and a database comparison of these cases before and after the advent of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was examined. Whilst not statistically significant, trends indicated there were more solved cases, more guilty pleas and fewer trials after the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> but more individuals were drawn into the investigatory process.

However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a [...] "missing" [...] allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence.
