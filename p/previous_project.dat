5|$|After many {{internal}} {{conflicts between}} Porcelain Black and her long-time collaborator, RedOne, the artist announced via social media that plans to release her long-anticipated album were cancelled. Plans {{to release a}} new album, in the vein of her <b>previous</b> <b>project,</b> Porcelain and the Tramps, is expected for late 2017. Music from her new project will feature the same attitude of the singer's previous works with slower, mid-tempo songs and rapping.|$|E
5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was a throwback to the Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E

A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E

5|$|In June 2011, Yash Raj Films {{released}} a statement announcing a new directorial venture by Yash Chopra coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his Bollywood career. The producers also announced that the film would be released during the Diwali 2012 weekend. Chopra said the film was untitled at that time, similar to <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> Veer-Zaara (which was named {{on the day of}} its submission to the Central Board of Film Certification). The producers considered a number of titles but were not satisfied with any of them. In September 2012, it was announced that the title of the film was Jab Tak Hai Jaan. It was inspired by a similarly titled song from the 1975 film, Sholay.|$|E
5|$|Inside No. 9 is a British dark comedy {{anthology}} {{television programme}} that first aired in 2014. It is written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton and {{produced by the}} BBC. Each half-hour episode is a self-contained story with new characters and a new setting, and all star at least one (usually both) of Pemberton and Shearsmith. Aside from the writers, each episode has a new cast, allowing Inside No. 9 to attract a number of well-known actors. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place at a number 9, with settings including a suburban house, a gothic mansion and a barn. Pemberton and Shearsmith took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from an episode of Psychoville, a <b>previous</b> <b>project,</b> which was filmed in a single room. This episode was, in turn, inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. Inside No. 9 was also a reaction to Psychoville, which featured a long overarching story realised over multiple series.|$|E
5|$|Makedonsko Devojče 2 (in Macedonian Cyrillic: Македонско девојче 2, {{meaning in}} English: Macedonian Girl 2) is the eighth studio album by Macedonian singer Karolina Gočeva {{released}} on 25 February 2014. Avalon Production launched the album in Macedonia, while Croatian label Dallas Records released it throughout former Yugoslav countries in April 2015. The album consists of eight original songs written by Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova; the arrangement and production were completed by Nikola Micevski and Dejan Momirovski. Except for those eight songs, two cover versions are also included, {{one of them}} being of a Macedonian traditional song {{and the other one}} of a record originally performed by Macedonian singer Pepi Baftiroski. For Gočeva, the motivation to record the album came from the critical and commercial success of her <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> inspired by the Macedonian traditional music, Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E

Until his death shortly after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, he maintained a radio show along the molds of his <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> in Portugal – A Arte de ouvir (The Art of Listening), broadcast by local station Rádio Clube de Moçambique.|$|E
25|$|The general {{sound design}} was handled by Masato Shindo, who {{was faced with}} a {{challenge}} new to the PlatinumGames staff: in their previous projects sound echoes had been handled by individual settings created by the team, but that would not work properly in an open world setting due to its scale. Instead, Shindo designed a realistic soundscape using a system to manage echoes in real time, determining how much reverberation to generate based on current surroundings. Sound implementation was handled by Masami Ueda, and it was a greater amount of work than he had experienced on any <b>previous</b> <b>project.</b> One of the factors that helped with the smooth implementation was Ueda's previous encounters and good working relationship with Okabe.|$|E

25|$|Abbottabad {{water supply}} (since 2010). In September 2010 JICA {{approved}} a 3.644 billion Yen grant to improve water supply in Abbottabad in the Pashtun area {{through the development}} of surface water supply for the city that so far depended only on groundwater. The project has no sanitation component. In 2008 and 2010 it had approved two grants in the amount of 5.19 billion Yen for water supply in Faisalabad in Punjab. Just as the project in Abbotabad, it aims at developing bulk water supply, in this case from a well field located near a Canal, the Jhang Branch Canal. A parallel project provides training and advice on institutional reforms. The project builds on a <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> to improve the water distribution network in the city.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2006, Inspectah Deck {{released}} a street album entitled The Resident Patient, {{a prelude to}} his upcoming album, titled The Rebellion, which {{is said to be}} his final solo album. Late summer of 2006 saw the release of Masta Killa's second studio album, Made in Brooklyn, to lukewarm reviews, as well as Method Man's , on which the rapper endeavored {{to make up for the}} poor response to Tical 0: The Prequel. Around this time, he was heavily featured in the media due to his displeasure with Def Jam's handling of his <b>previous</b> <b>project.</b> Despite what the rapper felt to be little promotion compared to other Def Jam artists, 421... debuted in the Billboard Top Ten, and received much greater reviews than those of his previous album. Method Man also made the decision to fall back from Hollywood, and to only do acting work on films being handled by close friends.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{a general}} belief about the {{viability}} of his film projects, Dutt more or less produced commercially successful films. Over the years the commercial nature of his projects saw a trade-off with his creative aspirations. Movies like C.I.D., Baazi, Pyaasa, Kaagaz Ke Phool, Chaudhvin Ka Chand and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam were the first of their kind in Hindi cinema. The only movie produced by Dutt that was considered a box office disaster was Kaagaz Ke Phool, which is now a cult classic. He lost over Rs.1.7million producing that film, a large amount {{by the standards of}} that time, which was more than recovered by his next project, Chaudhvin Ka Chand. He never lost faith in his team or in the distributors of his films. Once a project was over, he would begin anew - with little concern about the commercial success of the <b>previous</b> <b>project.</b> He was part of an exclusive school of Indian film directors, including the likes of Raj Kapoor, Mehboob Khan and Bimal Roy, who were able to achieve a healthy blend of artistic and commercial success between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s.|$|E

500|$|The role of Annie Hall {{was written}} {{specifically}} for Keaton, {{who had worked}} with Allen on Play It Again, Sam (1972), Sleeper (1973) and Love and Death (1975). She considered the character an [...] "affable version" [...] of herself—both were [...] "semi-articulate, dreamed of being a singer and suffered from insecurity"—and was surprised to win an Oscar for her performance. The film also marks the second film collaboration between Allen and Tony Roberts, their <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> being Play It Again, Sam.|$|E
500|$|Eidelman's <b>previous</b> <b>project</b> {{had been}} {{creating}} {{a compilation of}} music from the past five Star Trek films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. [...] " [...] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do James Horner [...] as well as James Horner," [...] he said. Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, {{and he was able}} to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} two main stars varied {{throughout}} production. They had already had trouble getting along in their <b>previous</b> <b>project,</b> Red Dawn (1984), and worked things out enough to have an extremely positive screen test, but that initial cooperation soon faded, and they were soon [...] "facing off" [...] before every scene. There was concern among the production staff that the animosity {{between the two}} stars would endanger the filming of the love scenes. To address this, producer Bergstein and director Ardolino forced the stars to re-watch their initial screen-tests—the ones with the [...] "breathtaking" [...] chemistry. This had the desired effect, and Swayze and Grey were {{able to return to}} the film with renewed energy and enthusiasm.|$|E

500|$|DiCaprio's {{next project}} was the drama film The Beach (2000), an {{adaption}} of Alex Garland's 1996 {{novel of the}} same name. He played an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect {{way of life in}} a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $US50 million, the film became a financial success, grossing $US144 million worldwide, but as with DiCaprio's <b>previous</b> <b>project,</b> the film was negatively reviewed by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that [...] "Richard [...] is too much the American Everyman and not enough of a well-defined individual to entirely capture one's interest and imagination, and DiCaprio, while perfectly watchable, does not endow him with the quirks or distinguishing marks to make this man from nowhere a dimensional character." [...] The next year, he was nominated for another Razzie Award for his work on the film.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Stefani {{released}} her first solo single in six years, [...] "Baby Don't Lie", and following its moderate impact and reception, a new single, [...] "Spark the Fire", {{was released in}} December of the same year. However, both singles underperformed on the charts, prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release. After months with no updates on the album, Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over, since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the <b>previous</b> <b>project.</b> Stefani started writing new material in June 2015, and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later, she felt very inspired. In the same interview, Stefani claimed: [...] "I needed {{to go through what}} I needed to go through to write the record that I needed to write.
