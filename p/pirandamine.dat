50|$|<b>Pirandamine</b> (AY-23,713) is a {{tricyclic}} derivative {{which acts}} as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It was investigated in the 1970s as a potential antidepressant but clinical development was not commenced and it was never marketed. <b>Pirandamine</b> is structurally related to tandamine, which, in contrast, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|Tandamine is a {{selective}} norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with a tricyclic structure. It {{was developed in}} the 1970s as an antidepressant but was never commercialized. Tandamine is analogous to <b>pirandamine,</b> which, instead, acts as {{a selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).|$|E
50|$|Condensation of 1-indanone (1) with {{ethyl bromoacetate}} and zinc affords Reformatsky {{reaction}} product 2; then reduction with LiAlH4 gives diol 3. Dehydration with H2SO4 gives the indene ethanol 4. Acid catalyzed condensation of 4 with ethyl acetoacetate then gives the fused tetrahydropyran derivative 5 (no doubt by a scheme quite analogous to prodolic acid). The ester is then saponified to the corresponding acid, {{which is then}} converted to the dimethylamide (6). Reduction with LiAlH4 completes the synthesis of the antidepressant agent <b>pirandamine</b> (7).|$|E
