40|$|The paper {{describes}} the implementation and performance {{analysis of the}} first fully-operational beam-space MIMO antenna for the spatial multiplexing of two QPSK streams. The antenna is composed of a planar three-port radiator with two varactor diodes terminating the passive <b>ports.</b> <b>Pattern</b> reconfiguration is used to encode the MIMO information onto orthogonal virtual basis patterns in the far-field. A measurement campaign was conducted to compare {{the performance of the}} beam-space MIMO system with a conventional 2 -by-? 2 MIMO system under realistic propagation conditions. Propagation measurements were conducted for both systems and the mutual information and symbol error rates were estimated from Monte-Carlo simulations over the measured channel matrices. The results show the beam-space MIMO system and the conventional MIMO system exhibit similar finite-constellation capacity and error performance in NLOS scenarios when there is sufficient scattering in the channel. In comparison, in LOS channels, the capacity performance is observed to depend on the relative polarization of the receiving antennas. Comment: 31 pages, 23 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAimsRadiotherapy is an {{important}} treatment modality in the multidisciplinary management of rectal cancer. It is delivered both in the neoadjuvant setting and postoperatively, but, although it reduces local recurrence, it does not influence overall survival and {{increases the risk of}} long-term complications. This has led to a variety of international practice patterns. These variations can {{have a significant effect on}} commissioning, but also future clinical research. This study explores its use within the large English National Health Service (NHS). Materials and methodsInformation on all individuals diagnosed with a surgically treated rectal cancer between April 2009 and December 2010 were extracted from the Radiotherapy Dataset linked to the National Cancer Data Repository. Individuals were grouped into those receiving no radiotherapy, short-course radiotherapy with immediate surgery (SCRT-I), short-course radiotherapy with delayed surgery (SCRT-D), long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT), other radiotherapy (ORT) and postoperative radiotherapy (<b>PORT).</b> <b>Patterns</b> of use were then investigated. ResultsThe study consisted of 9201 individuals; 4585 (49. 3 %) received some form of radiotherapy. SCRT-I was used in 12. 1 %, SCRT-D in 1. 2 %, LCCRT in 29. 5 %, ORT in 4. 7 % and PORT in 2. 3 %. Radiotherapy was used more commonly in men and in those receiving an abdominoperineal excision and less commonly in the elderly and those with comorbidity. Significant and substantial variations were also seen in its use across all the multidisciplinary teams managing this disease.

An approach to reduce the down load time is to compress data before the download. Since ATE should have accurate data and also, ATEs are slow, the compression algorithm should be non lossy and decompression should be time efficient.

This paper builds on the existing literature on port systems and adapts port development models to river ports. Furthermore, we employ some statistical techniques that are common to the analysis of port systems, and introduce some techniques that have not been used much by transport geographers in ports. This paper will address the dynamics in the Yangtze River ports system by analyzing the level of cargo concentration and the degree of inequality in operations of the container ports.

Materials and Methods: Between October 1998 and August 2010, 19 patients with stage I–III uterine carcinosarcoma received curative hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without PORT at Seoul National University Hospital. Their hospital medical records were retrospectively reviewed. PORT and non-PORT groups included 11 and 8 patients, respectively. They were followed for a mean of 22. 7 months (range, 7. 8 to 126. 6 months). Results: At 5 years, the overall survival rates were 51. 9 % for entire, 61. 4 % for PORT, and 41. 7 % for non-PORT groups, respectively. There was no statistical difference between PORT and non-PORT groups with regard to overall survival (p = 0. 682).

Using an FE model including these two <b>ports,</b> different flow <b>patterns</b> of two individual metal streams were revealed. The 3 D FE simulation also showed how two unequal metal streams contacted each other and became bonded in the welding chamber under a certain hydrostatic pressure and at a certain temperature, before the metal flew through the die bearing.

40|$|Fundamental to any {{business}} {{is the concept}} of performance. This can be compared by using the competition as a benchmark for achievement or by comparing performance with previously defined goals and objectives. Stakeholders constantly demand to know whether their investmerit in a company is obtaining an adequate return and whilst there are established accounting techniques to calculate return on investment or capital employed, calculating efficiency can be rather a grey area in some industries. Ports are no exception and it is only by comparison that performance can be evaluated. Ports are, however, a complex business with many different sources of inputs and outputs which make direct comparison among apparently homogeneous ports seem difficult. The subject is further complicated by the various types of port ownership and organisational structures that exist throughout the world. This thesis seeks to determine whether there is a particular type of ownership and organisational structure that leads to a more efficient port. This aim is achieved by examining the efficiency of differently owned container ports, comparing privately owned ports against those remaining in the public sector, and those that have elements of both public and private ownership patterns. In addition, the organisational structure of those ports examined is analysed and classified with the results placed into a singular conceptual model for a clear comparison. The conceptual model can be then applied to any type of business enabling the performance of ownership and organisational structures to be compared with ease. The results of this thesis show that there is a strong relationship between the relative efficiency of ports examined and organisational structure and a weaker relationship between <b>port</b> ownership <b>patterns.</b> These results should assist governments, port administrators and port owners in determining the different ways they can structure their ports...|$|R

One {{of the most promising}} applications is on light aircraft piston engines, typically designed to provide a top brake power of 100 - 200 HP with a relatively low weight. The main advantage yielded by the 2 -Stroke cycle is the possibility to achieve high power density at low crankshaft speed, allowing the propeller to be directly coupled to the engine, without a reduction drive. Furthermore, Diesel combustion is a good match for supercharging and it is expected to provide a superior fuel efficiency, in comparison to S. I. engines. However, the coupling of 2 -Stroke cycle and Diesel combustion on small bore, high speed engines is quite complex, requiring a suitable support from CFD simulation.

This paper argues that in advanced economies, the average wage level is a better indicator of the role of ports in realizing economic wealth in a given area. Methodological issues are discussed and an empirical analysis of US port counties is presented. Results show that average wage level in core activities - transport and warehousing - are related {{to the size of the}} counties (e. g. population and workforce) and to their economic specialization. Notably, specializing in freight-related activity strengthens wage levels while additional specializations such as manufacturing, trade, and logistics are associated with lower performance of <b>port</b> counties. These <b>patterns</b> may be explained by the importance of central place over coastal locations in the firms' networks in terms of spatial division of labo...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} calibration and data-reduction algorithms for non-conventional multi-hole pressure probes. The algorithms {{that have been developed}} for conventional 5 - and 7 -hole probes are not optimal for probes with port arrangements (on the probe tip) that are non-conventional. Conventional algorithms utilize the axisymmetry of the <b>port</b> distribution <b>pattern</b> to define the non-dimensional pressure coefficients. These coefficients are typically defined specifically for these patterns, but fail to correctly represent different <b>patterns</b> of <b>port</b> arrangements, such as patterns without axisymmetry or regularity. The algorithms introduced herein can handle any <b>pattern</b> of <b>port</b> arrangement, from axisymmetric and regular to random. Moreover, they eliminate the need to separate the measurement domain of a probe to "low-angle" and "high-angle" regimes, typical in conventional 5 - and 7 -hole-probe algorithms that require two different sets of pressure coefficient definitions and procedures. Additionally, the algorithms have been formulated such that they facilitate redundancy implementations, especially in applications where such redundancy is important, such as air-data systems. The developed algorithms are first applied to a non-conventional probe, a nearly omni-directional 18 -hole probe, and demonstrate very high flow measurement accuracy. Subsequently, the algorithms were applied to a new 12 -hole, nearly omni-directional, flow velocity measurement probe capable of measuring reversed flows. The new 12 -hole design offers several advantages over a previously developed, 18 -hole, nearly omni-directional probe. The probe is optimized in the sense that, regardless of the flow direction, it allows calculation of the 4 unknown flow quantities, i. e. the two flow angles, the velocity magnitude and the static pressure, with the minimum necessary number of holes/ports on the probe tip. This probe also has a non-conventional arrangement of its pressure ports and therefore the new calibration and data-reduction algorithms can be effectively employed. With theoretically generated pressure data for the 12 -hole probe, the coefficient definitions are analyzed and found to be well-behaved...|$|R
