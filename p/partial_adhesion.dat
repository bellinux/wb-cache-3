The mechanical properties of composite materials are often not as simple to obtain as those of conventional materials, in which case micro-mechanical modelling {{could be used in}} conjunction with CAD software. A micro-mechanical model was used to predict the flexural modulus of composite materials, based on the assumption of partial interfacial adhesion between composite components. It was found that the <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> model was both practical and consistently accurate. The <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> model accounted for adhesion between components by considering an ‘effective shear value’ at the interface. The model was compared to experimental data for glass, wood and carbon-fibre reinforced polyethylene. It was shown that the adhesion coefficient ranged between 0. 1 for carbon fibre, 0. 5 for glass fibre and 0. 8 for the wood fibre composites. It was shown that using micro-mechanical modelling to predict composite mechanical properties, as opposed to simulating the comprehensive composites structure, computer processing time and file size can be reduced with little compromise in simulation accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} report proposed a gradual adhesion {{model for the}} interface of epoxy resin used as an electric insulator. The model {{can deal with the}} flow and gelling of epoxy resin but it cannot deal with the fracture of the interface. In order to solve the fracture problem, two new fracture models are proposed for the epoxy resin interface. 1) One model proposes that <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> remains after the fracture of the interface of epoxy resin occurs. The calculated strain change using this model does not give good agreement with experimental values. 2) Another model proposes that <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> remains after the shrinkage strain from the curing reaction is released by the fracture of the interface. The calculated strain change from this model gives good agreement with experimental values. These results indicate that the weak adhesion region breaks away when the fracture of the epoxy resin interface occurs. The temperature distribution of the epoxy resin during the curing reaction does not change with the fracture of the interface. The internal stress of the epoxy resin goes up with the adhesion and goes down with the fracture of the epoxy resin interface...|$|E
40|$|The {{sport and}} leisure {{industry}} in New Zealand (NZ) {{has the potential}} to become a major user of composite materials. Given the size of NZ industry, design and manufacturing strategies based on virtual engineering should be developed to suit NZ requirements. Virtual methods use computer aided engineering capabilities to find faults, explore alternatives and optimise product performance before detailed design or prototyping. When doing computer aided simulation the required mechanical properties of individual reinforcement and matrix components are well documented. However, the mechanical properties of composite materials are not as simple to obtain. Micro-mechanical modelling could therefore be used to aid the design and development of composite equipment, where mechanical properties are unknown. In this study, solids modelling was used to produce an analog model of a composite, and it was found that it lead to reductions in file size and simulation time. Representing a composite with an analog model implies that the behavioural characteristics are modelled, but not the physical characteristics of the individual components. Three micro-mechanical models were developed to predict the flexural modulus of composite materials, based on perfect, partial and no adhesion. It was found that the <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> model was both practical and consistently accurate. The <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> model accounted for adhesion between components by considering an 'effective shear value' at the interface. Validation of the models was done by flexural testing injection moulded samples of glass, wood and carbon fibre reinforced polyethylene. It was shown that the adhesion coefficient range was 0. 1 for carbon fibre, 0. 5 for glass fibre and 0. 9 for the wood fibre composites. It was concluded that the adhesion coefficient is crucial and it is recommended that further work is done to validate effective shear values by empirical means. The predicted flexural modulus values were used to enable finite element simulation of modelled analog beams as well as commercial kayak paddles. It was determined that accurate simulation is possible for composite equipment using the <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> model...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} adhesion due to London–van der Waals attraction {{between a}} thin film and a patterned surface with nanometer asperities. Depending on the surface topography and the stiffness of the film, three regimes of adhesion are identified: complete contact <b>adhesion,</b> <b>partial</b> contact <b>adhesion,</b> and glassy adhesion. For complete contact adhesion, the film conforms to the undulations of the surface, whereas for partial contact and glassy adhesion, the adhesive interface breaks down into microscopic areas of contact. When a film in the glassy regime is peeled off the surface, metastable states develop at which the crack front becomes arrested, analogously to the frustrated motion of the three-phase contact line across a heterogeneous surface. For this glassy regime, we use transition state theory to model the thermally activated progression of the crack front. This theoretical treatment suggests {{that the rate of}} the adhesive failure increases exponentially with the applied force...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Analyze the {{morphological}} {{and structural}} outcomes of {{a patch of}} expanded polytetrafluoroethylene {{in the treatment of}} an iatrogenic injury of the common bile duct. METHODS: In Group 1 (Sham), 7 dogs underwent 3 laparotomies with intervals of 30 days between them. In Group 2, 10 dogs underwent transient common bile duct obstruction. After 30 days, this biliary occlusion was undone and a patch of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene replaced a fragment removed from the duct's wall. Thirty days after this last surgery, cholangiographic assessment of prosthesis patency and macro and microscopic evaluation of the biliary tract were performed.

Avoiding cellular stress failure is crucial to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) treatment. In the present study, primary rat alveolar type II (ATII) cells were isolated to evaluate their viability and the mechanism of their survival under tonic stretch.

Manipulation of integrin adherent affinity by altering bivalent cation levels in the culture medium and applying an integrin neutralizing antibody showed that facilitated adhesion affinity promoted cell death under tonic stretch, while lower level of adhesion protected the cells from stretch-induced stress failure. Finally, a simplified numerical model was established to reveal that adequate disassembly of FAs reduced the forces transmitting throughout the cell. Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} ATII cells escape stress failure caused by tonic stretch via active cell morphological remodeling, during which cells transiently disassemble FAs to unload mechanical forces. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCharacterization of {{concrete}} behavior {{needs to know}} mechanical properties of the two phases constituting them : mortar and aggregates. Nevertheless this bi-phasic approach reaches its limits when concrete leaves the elastic domain. At that stage and according to several studies, phenomena which occur at the interface between mortar and aggregates, or in mortar between cement paste and aggregates, {{must be taken into}} account. If the occurence of an Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ), with weak mechanical properties in regard to the two others surrounding them is well knwon, the modeling of this third phase is not settled yet. This study focus on the characterization of the adhesion at interface between cement paste and aggregates. A mortar compounded by two limestone aggregates binded by a cement paste is considered, and tensile tests are performed on a sample of this composite. Based on these experimental results, a numerical study is developed in order to see influence of interface quality in tensile strength. For thar mortar is modeled by finite elements with a cohesive zone model at the interface, substituting ITZ. With the cohesive zone model used, coupling friction and adhesion at the interface, three parameters have to be fitted : normal and tangential stiffness, and decohesion energy.

30|$|Integrin-mediated cell {{adhesion}} to extracellular matrix components {{is essential for}} the organization, maintenance, and repair of numerous tissues (De and Georges-Labouesse 2000). The {{cell adhesion}} process is complex and has a series of steps (Friedl and Wolf 2003), including binding to the extracellular matrix, receptor clustering, and the recruitment of cytoskeletal elements. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion occurs via focal adhesions involving the signaling pathway through ILK (serving as a multifunctional adaptor protein that links focal adhesion to the actin cytoskeleton (Hannigan et al. 2005), FAK, phospholipase C (PLC), and the activation of Pho family proteins. Therein, FAK modulates integrin activity (Lawson et al. 2012) and increases tyrosine phosphorylation in response to integrin activation depending on an intact integrin β cytoplasmic tail (Burridge et al. 1992). The Pho family proteins are important as well. Even the exact relationships between GTPase and integrin mediated-signal pathway are not clear, the integrin-dependent regulation of intracellular PH can occur by Pho GTPase, which has necessary effects on cell spreading and cell adhesion (Tominaga and Barber 1998). The signaling molecules involved in integrin-mediated adhesion are the upstream pathways that mediate other cell functions. Therefore, {{it is easy to see}} the link between cell adhesion and other integrin-mediated biological functions such as cell proliferation, survival, and migration. This may explain why integrin α 5 β 1, after binding with FN and intracellular cytoskeletal components located in <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> sites, can induce a series of signal transductions affecting cell motility and migration (Su et al. 2005). Kiwanuka et al. (2013) also indicated that α 5 β 1, αVβ 1, and αVβ 6 integrin formed adhesions to provide points of traction for cell translocation during keratinocyte migration. Therefore, cell adhesion is the precondition of integrin-mediated biological functions.|$|E

Conditions of perfect <b>adhesion,</b> <b>partial</b> debonding, and total debonding are considered in turn.

Numerical results based on the partial debonding model are given for the critical fibre length and the extent of the debonding zone as a function of applied strain. The prediction of the total debonding model is recovered asymptotically for large strains. The authors find, however, that the critical length predicted by the partial debonding model can be lower than the one predicted by the total debonding model if the interfacial bond strength is sufficiently larger than the frictional shear stress. These theoretical results show that both bond strength and frictional shear stress {{must be taken into account}} in the interpretation of the fragmentation test data. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{adhesion}} {{of giant}} unilamellar phospholipid vesicles to planar substrates coated with extracellular matrix mimetic cushions of hyaluronan is studied using quantitative reflection interference contrast microscopy. The absolute {{height of the}} vesicle membrane at {{the vicinity of the}} substrate is measured by considering, for the first time, the refractive indices of the reflecting media. The thickness of the cushion is varied in the range of ∼ 50 – 100 nm, by designing various coupling strategies. On bare protein-coated substrates, the vesicles spread fast (0. 5 s) and form a uniform adhesion disk, with the average membrane height ∼ 4 nm. On thick hyaluronan cushions (> 80 nm), the membrane height is approximately the same as the thickness of the cushion, implying that the vesicle lies on top of the cushion. On a thin and inhomogeneous hyaluronan cushion, the adhesion is modified but not prevented. The spreading is slow (∼ 20 s) compared to the no-cushion case. The average membrane height is ∼ 10 nm and the adhesion disk is studded with blisterlike structures. Observations with fluorescent hyaluronan indicate that the polymer is compressed under, rather than expelled from, the adhesion disk. The adhesion energy density is approximately threefold higher in the no-cushion case (1. 2 μJ/m 2) as compared to the thin-cushion case (0. 54 μJ/m 2). In the thin-cushion case, the presence of short (∼ 4 nm) glyco-polymers on the vesicles results in a hitherto unreported stable <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> state—the membrane height ranges from zero to ∼ 250 nm. The minimal model system presented here mimics in vitro the hyaluronan-modulated early stages of cell adhesion, and demonstrates that the presence of a polymer cushion influences both the final equilibrium adhesion-state and the spreading kinetics...|$|E

Validity was high for both series ($ 0. 954). Inter-reliability (k) ranged from 0. 327 to 0. 858 (average, 0. 547) and 0. 433 e 0. 910 (average, 0. 620) in series A and B, respectively. The combined agreement across both series was 0. 585. Intra-rater agreement (k) of the 10 common images was 0. 605. No significant difference was observed between the scoring patterns for those with more than 10 years of working experience. Conclusion. Overall, the TDS adhesion score determined by the participants visually in this study corresponded well to those generated by photo editing software, thus rendering the scoring system highly valid. The FDA scoring system is an adequate tool for assessing fentanyl TDS adhesion in clinical practice.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{of giant}} unilamellar phospholipid vesicles to planar substrates coated with extracellular matrix mimetic cushions of hyaluronan is studied using quantitative reflection interference contrast microscopy. The absolute {{height of the}} vesicle membrane at {{the vicinity of the}} substrate is measured by considering, for the first time, the refractive indices of the reflecting media. The thickness of the cushion is varied in the range of ∼ 50 – 100 nm, by designing various coupling strategies. On bare protein-coated substrates, the vesicles spread fast (0. 5 s) and form a uniform adhesion disk, with the average membrane height ∼ 4 nm. On thick hyaluronan cushions (> 80 nm), the membrane height is approximately the same as the thickness of the cushion, implying that the vesicle lies on top of the cushion. On a thin and inhomogeneous hyaluronan cushion, the adhesion is modified but not prevented. The spreading is slow (∼ 20 s) compared to the no-cushion case. The average membrane height is ∼ 10 nm and the adhesion disk is studded with blisterlike structures. Observations with fluorescent hyaluronan indicate that the polymer is compressed under, rather than expelled from, the adhesion disk. The adhesion energy density is approximately threefold higher in the no-cushion case (1. 2 μJ/m 2) as compared to the thin-cushion case (0. 54 μJ/m 2). In the thin-cushion case, the presence of short (∼ 4 nm) glyco-polymers on the vesicles results in a hitherto unreported stable <b>partial</b> <b>adhesion</b> state—the membrane height ranges from zero to ∼ 250 nm. The minimal model system presented here mimics in vitro the hyaluronan-modulated early stages of cell adhesion, and demonstrates that the presence of a polymer cushion influences both the final equilibrium adhesion-state and the spreading kinetics...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experimental batters {{containing}} 75 to 87 % {{liquid egg}} albumen or 24. 5 % dried egg albumen were mixed {{by hand and}} applied to predusted, phosphate-soaked broiler drumsticks. Pieces were then rolled in breading and cooked by the fry/oven method. During development, batters were evaluated by analysis of fat and moisture of cooked coatings, measurement of coating pickup and exterior color, observation of interior color, and textural qualities of cooked coatings, and measurement of organoleptic acceptability of battered broiler pieces. Batters consisting of egg albumen combined with pregelatinized or modified corn flours produced coatings with acceptable exterior and interior color. Batters with higher solids contents tended to absorb less fat, but batters containing pregelatinized corn flour with relatively lower solids contents also produced cooked coatings that had high moisture contents and absorbed little fat. Percentage of coating pickup and yield values of chicken pieces were acceptable. Liquid and dried egg albumen performed equally well in batters. Both experienced and student taste panelists gave good ratings to broiler drumsticks coated with high egg albumen batters. Breading applied after the batter reduced perceived rubberiness and greasiness. <b>Partial</b> lack of <b>adhesion</b> of the cooked coating to the chicken piece was a problem. Precooked, frozen drumsticks could be successfully reheated in a microwave oven...|$|R
40|$|The essay analizes {{the concept}} of total, <b>partial</b> or no <b>adhesion</b> to the political-economic system created by US {{after the end of}} the second world war; a system based on a sharp {{division}} between the western capitalist world and the Soviet planned economy, whose fundamental assumption was the absence of any dialogue between the two parties. The absence of dialogue also concerned their commercial and financial relations, and was aimed at avoiding any acquisition of know how and equipment by Moscow, necessary to its industrial development. If at the end of the fourties the sharp division between East and West advocated by the United States was widely shared by European allies, in the mid-fifties it would become, if not anachronistic, difficult to achieve, especially in the field of trade relations. As loudly stated by Adenauer in 1958, at the climax of Berlin’s Crisis, the Western European states continued to trade with Moscow (forgetting to say that RFT was doing exactly the same). This created the conditions for a hard and lasting dispute between Western European states and US. The main reason of this conflict was the desire of West Europeans to enter into trade relationships with Eastern European states and to improve them significantly. Italy, case study of this paper, was part of this trend, especially through its Istituto per il Commercio Estero (ICE) ...|$|R
40|$|Enteric Escherichia coli {{infections are}} a highly {{relevant}} cause {{of disease and}} death in young pigs. Breeding genetically resistant pigs is an economical and sustainable method of prevention. Resistant pigs are protected against colonization of the intestine through the absence of receptors for the bacterial fimbriae, which mediate adhesion to the intestinal surface. The present work aimed at elucidation of the mode of inheritance of the F 4 ad receptor which according to former investigations appeared quite confusing. Intestines of 489 pigs of an experimental herd were examined by a microscopic adhesion test modified {{in such a manner}} that four small intestinal sites instead of one were tested for adhesion of the fimbrial variant F 4 ad. Segregation analysis revealed that the mixed inheritance model explained our data best. The heritability of the F 4 ad phenotype was estimated to be 0. 7 ± 0. 1. There are no relations to the strong receptors for variants F 4 ab and F 4 ac. Targeted matings allowed the discrimination between two F 4 ad receptors, that is, a fully adhesive receptor (F 4 adRFA) expressed on all enterocytes and at all small intestinal sites, and a partially adhesive receptor (F 4 adRPA) variably expressed at different sites and often leading to <b>partial</b> bacterial <b>adhesion.</b> In pigs with both F 4 ad receptors, the F 4 adRPA receptor is masked by the F 4 adRFA. The hypothesis that F 4 adRFA must be encoded by at least two complementary or epistatic dominant genes is supported by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium statistics. The F 4 adRPA receptor is inherited as a monogenetic dominant trait. A comparable partially adhesive receptor for variant F 4 ab (F 4 abRPA) was also observed but the limited data did not allow a prediction of the mode of inheritance. Pigs were therefore classified into one of eight receptor phenotypes: A 1 (F 4 abRFA/F 4 acR+/F 4 adRFA); A 2 (F 4 abRFA/F 4 acR+/F 4 adRPA); B (F 4 abRFA/F 4 acR+/F 4 adR-); C 1 (F 4 abRPA/F 4 acR-/F 4 adRFA); C 2 (F 4 abRPA/F 4 acR-/F 4 adRPA); D 1 (F 4 abR-/F 4 acR-/F 4 adRFA); D 2 (F 4 abR-/F 4 acR-/F 4 adRPA); E (F 4 abR-/F 4 acR-/F 4 adR-) ...|$|R
