5|$|As Hurricane Jeanne moved inland, its inner eyewall dissipated, and {{its outer}} eyewall quickly became less distinct. It turned west-northwestward over the state, curving around the western <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> the ridge to its northeast. By 14hours after landfall, Jeanne {{weakened}} to tropical storm status near the Tampa Bay area. In western Florida, offshore winds produced {{a tide of}} 4.5feet (1.4m) below normal in Cedar Key; however, after the storm passed the area, the onshore winds produced above normal tides. Despite initial forecasts that it would emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm remained over land and continued to slowly weaken. Early on September 27, dry air became entrained into the southern <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> the circulation, which diminished the thunderstorms to the south. After turning northward, Jeanne entered southern Georgia and weakened into a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained multiple cloud swirls within a common center. Banding features increased, though southwesterly wind shear {{and the lack}} of a well-defined circulation prevented initial strengthening.

Ultimately the process of pursuing feminist ideas in the mainstream and into institutional settings is a rejection of specific feminist approaches that are consequently shifted to the <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> feminist methods and remain beyond the <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> international legal discussions...|$|R

5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{described}} as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be polluted in Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> Hindu society.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} asymmetries of pulsar {{distributions}} {{relative to the}} Galactic plane in various Galactic longitudes. It is shown that the observed asymmetric distribution {{may be explained by}} the warped and flaring (i. e. increase of scale-height at the <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> the Galaxy) structure of the Galaxy. At the <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> the Galaxy, the amplitude of the warp, derived from these data, may be as high as ∼ 1 kpc. The scale-height of the pulsar distribution increases exponentially from ∼ 0. 5 kpc to ∼ 1 kpc while increasing the galactocentric distance from 5 kpc to 15 kpc. The warp and flare parameters derived from the pulsar data are compared with the stellar and gaseous warp and flare parameters of the Galaxy. ...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco-free {{policies}} {{on college campuses}} are spreading in Korea. However, {{the impact of the}} smoking ban legislation at venues on the boundary of a college campus is still limited. This study aimed to assess short-term changes in PM 2. 5 concentrations before and after the enactment of the smoking ban legislation to evaluate the impact. In this cross-sectional study, PM 2. 5 measurements (pre-ban: n = 99, post-ban: n = 64) were conducted in randomly selected billiards, pubs, and computer game rooms on the <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> college campuses in October 2013, prior to implementation of the smoking ban, and in May 2014, after the ban. The median (interquartile range, IQR) of the PM 2. 5 concentration for all venues was 31 μg/m 3 (0 – 80 μg/m 3) in the pre-ban period and 11 μg/m 3 (0 – 36 μg/m 3) in the post-ban period implying indoor PM 2. 5 concentration levels <b>of</b> the <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> college campuses likely decreased one year after implementation of the ban. However, the differences were not significant yet. The results support the introduction of more rigorous monitoring of SHS exposure levels toward the ultimate goal of encouraging a complete smoking ban in hospitality venues, including billiards, pubs, and computer game rooms located on the <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> college campuses...|$|R
