5|$|Alan and Barry {{start to}} learn about the <b>past</b> <b>of</b> Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk.

It has {{previously}} tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane—the figure in the diving suit—but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} last interment, the local rulers {{abandoned}} the shaft graves in favour {{of a new and}} more imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double ring peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic <b>past</b> <b>of</b> the older ruling dynasty. Under this context, the land surface was built up to make a level precinct for ceremonies, with the stelae over the graves being re-erected. A new entrance, the Lion Gate, was constructed near the site.|$|E

Angrily, the father reveals the sordid <b>past</b> <b>of</b> his family: Laura and her father {{are part of a}} bloodline of cannibalistic vampires, dating back to the infamous Dracula. Driven by her vampiric urges, Laura had killed and eaten her mother years ago, but it was erased from her memory by her father. As Dr. Harris demands Laura to leave one last time, he begins to transform into a vampire. If the player approaches Dr. Harris at this point, he will consume Laura's flesh and fully transform. However, if the player shoots Dr. Harris with a revolver that can be found earlier in the game, the bullet will kill him and stop his transformation. As Laura tearfully cradles her dying father in her arms, he confesses that he allowed the transformation to occur out of scientific curiosity and thanks her for stopping him. With his death, the realm created by his mind fades and is replaced by the normal surroundings of the hospital.|$|E
