25|$|Knock-down {{fasteners}} are {{a hardware}} device {{made for the}} purpose of constructing butt joints that can be assembled and re-assembled repeatedly (hence knock-down). This type of fastener is very popular in flat-pack furniture, which is typified by items such as book cases and wall units that come in a package of pre-cut and <b>pre-drilled</b> components ready to assemble by a novice. They are also very common in modern modular kitchens.|$|E
25|$|Soil nailing is a {{technique}} in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a <b>pre-drilled</b> hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Self-drilling mini-implants are {{commonly}} used in orthodontics, {{but there is little}} information regarding their fracture resistance in areas of high density bone without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Purpose: To determine the peak fracture torques of six commonly used self-drilling mini-implants, and to examine how each performs in extreme conditions without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifteen mini-implants from six different manufacturers were drilled into acrylic blocks using a custom-made insertion device incorporating a 6 -DOF load cell for torque measurements. Peak fracture torques were recorded and compared for each of the six manufacturers. Additionally, ten mini-implants from each manufacturer were inserted into high density mandibular bone substitutes (Sawbones®) without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Measures of peak insertion torque for each manufacturer were recorded. Groups that experienced fracture upon insertion into the bone substitutes underwent further testing specifically following their manufacturer <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations. Results: Resistance to fracture varied significantly among implants from different manufacturers. Tomas-pin and Aarhus experienced fractures during insertion into the non-pre-drilled bone substitutes. When manufacturer’s <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations were followed, Aarhus continued to experience fractures during insertion. Conclusions: Unitek, Vector TAS, Dual Top, and Ortho Easy can be inserted into areas of thick and dense cortical bone without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Tomas-Pin can be inserted provided manufacturer <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations are followed. The manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations for the use of 1. 5 mm Aarhus in areas of thick cortical bone may need to be modified...|$|R

25|$|Many older {{structures}} were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into <b>pre-drilled</b> holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer {{on one side}} and a bucking bar on the head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.|$|E
25|$|Also {{often called}} <b>pre-drilled</b> liner. The liner is {{prepared}} with multiple small drilled holes, then set across the production zone to provide wellbore stability and an intervention conduit. Pre-holed liner is often combined with openhole packers, such as swelling elastomers, mechanical packers or external casing packers, to provide zonal segregation and isolation. It is now quite common {{to see a}} combination of pre-holed liner, solid liner and swelling elastomer packers to provide an initial isolation of unwanted water or gas zones. Multiple sliding sleeves {{can also be used}} in conjunction with openhole packers to provide considerable flexibility in zonal flow control {{for the life of the}} wellbore.|$|E

30|$|Drillworks@—predict {{software}} provides reliable {{forecasts of}} pore pressure gradient and fracture gradient with several models and correlations available {{which are the}} basis for analysing the mud window. A major perk of the predict simulation is its capability to offer <b>pre-drill,</b> real-time as well as post-drill analysis to enhance drilling performances and to avoid difficulties throughout the entire drilling process. The <b>pre-drill</b> analysis assists in choosing the optimal mud weight setting and casing design depths for a successful well. If the <b>pre-drill</b> analysis {{turns out to be}} erroneous, the real time analysis allows the user to implement modifications to the pre-planned model to maintain an optimal drilling process. The post-drill analysis tools allow for an improved knowledge for the planning and drilling of future wells (Keaney 2005).|$|R

50|$|As an annular cutter cuts {{only on the}} {{periphery}} of the hole to be made, it has to remove much less material as compared to conventional drill bits which cut and remove the complete material of the hole. Annular cutters are considered to be 3 to 4 times faster than conventional drill bits. Also while using a twist drill bit or metal hole saw one has to do <b>pre-drilling</b> and step-drilling operations for bigger diameter holes, whereas an annular cutter requires no <b>pre-drilling</b> and step-drilling. It is a one-shot drilling operation.|$|R

2500|$|Early in {{the life}} of the Viscount {{aircraft}} type, renewal of the inner lower booms included installation of new mount fittings for attachment of the rear of the two inboard engine nacelles to the lower booms. [...] New fittings were supplied without <b>pre-drilled</b> holes and the holes were drilled during installation to correctly align the engine nacelle with the wing. However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle rear mount fittings. Re-use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely with the bushes in the new inner lower booms. [...] When new inner lower booms were installed in VH-RMQ in 1958, new engine nacelle rear mount fittings were also installed but when new booms were again installed in 1964 the fittings first installed in 1958 were re-used. [...] In the wreckage of the right wing of VH-RMQ there was evidence of an initial problem while trying to align the five holes in the old fitting with the bushes in the new boom. The bores of three bushes had been scored with a drill, possibly while maintenance personnel were trying to align three of the holes sufficiently to be able to insert the attachment bolts. Running a drill through the bush at Station 143 may have disturbed the bush and initiated a sequence of actions leading to fatal damage to the wall of the hole.|$|E
50|$|For certain {{applications}} where safety wiring is common, fasteners come <b>pre-drilled</b> {{with holes}} to accept safety wire.

40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of the impact of using the classic universal screw and screw the new generation with a sliding coating on various aspects of the production process. It was judged mainly possibility to join two operations into one: <b>pre-drilling</b> and screwing. This opportunity of screws the new generation would mean omission of <b>pre-drilling</b> at joints in hard hardwood, which would result in savings in labor time and costs for making joints. This option would therefore {{have a major impact on}} the economic factor in the production of furniture. Furthermore, it was determined the strength of cordless drill screwdriver needed to tighten screws into hardwoods - beech, and watched the wear on drill bits of cordless screwdriver associated with increased effort on tools of missed <b>pre-drilling</b> operation. This issue relates, for example, the manufacture of chairs, supporting frames of upholstered furniture as well as garden furniture or wooden constructions. During the tests it was used solid beech wood, as a classic representative of the hardwood deciduous wood, widely available and often used in the manufacture of furniture. The focus of this work was to observe the characteristics of the three selected types of wood screws in two dimensions. The results of observations and measurements were noted, photographically documented, analyzed and evaluated...|$|R
5000|$|Example: To make a 50 mm {{diameter}} {{hole with}} twist drill, {{one has to}} start making a <b>pre-drilling</b> of 10 mm, than 15 mm than 20 mm, ...up to 50 mm slowly increasing the size of holes. While with core drill one can drill directly 50 mm in one-shot.|$|R
30|$|Whenever the mini-implants {{are placed}} in the thick, dense {{cortical}} bone, insertion torque increases and thereby chances of fracture or breakage of implant increases and more amount of bone is damaged [19].
