6000|$|... "Oh, {{he took it}} off the contractors. Shut {{his eyes}} {{and held out his}} hands when they ran up rotten {{buildings}} that a strong breeze would have knocked down, and <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Pleasant Street hole without any ventilation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The Tenth {{was ordered}} to Manchester, and they could hardly expect {{me to go to}} a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Besides, I found the major monstrous rude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't have {{described}} a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> unless you had been," [...] said Miss Rose nodding. [...] "I hope {{you took the}} poor people some nice hot soup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't bear much looking at; we {{had better}} unyoke," [...] he said. [...] "If anybody had told me in England that I'd ever {{flounder}} through a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I'd--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{must have}} been a queer fellow when you were a child, confounded queer. It's odd, all that about the picture in your first paper - prosy, but told in a devilish gentlemanly sort of way. In <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I could come in with great effect with a touch of life - don't you feel that? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a time he}} {{cherished}} {{a design}} of hunting up Parsons, getting him to throw up his situation, and going with him to Stratford-on-Avon and Shrewsbury and the Welsh mountains and the Wye {{and a lot of}} <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> for a really gorgeous, careless, illimitable old holiday of a month. But alas! Parsons had gone from the St. Paul's Churchyard outfitter's long ago, and left no address.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{as he was}} any {{particular}} friend. You see, he asked {{about some of the}} other places around here too--about Jed Wallop's place, and those shacks belonging to Tony Duval, and about the old Hunker cabin and the deserted Parkingham house, and the old Crosby camp, and those shacks down at Miller's saw mill, and a lot of <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I thought maybe he had an idea of buying some place and locating here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tis dishgraceful,' he sez, 'that I {{would be}} {{expected}} to go to a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Was she a pretty woman?'' he sez, an' at that he set off double quick.|$|R
5000|$|Ah me! ah me! that I in Kedar’s tent here stay;No <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> on high; Lord thither guide my way;O happy place! When shall I be,My God, with Thee, to see Thy face? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You be off," [...] {{said the}} landlord, putting down a glass he was wiping, and eying him wrathfully. [...] "How dare {{you come into}} my <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> What {{do you mean by}} it?" ...|$|R
60|$|And, even in <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{described}} as Main Street, that comparative equality can immediately be felt. The men may be provincials, {{but they are}} certainly citizens; they consult on a common basis. And I repeat that in this, after all, they do achieve what many prophets and righteous men have died to achieve. This plain village, fairly prosperous, fairly equal, untaxed by tyrants and untroubled by wars, is after all the place which reformers have regarded as their aim; whenever reformers have used their wits sufficiently to have any aim. The march to Utopia, the march to the Earthly Paradise, the march to the New Jerusalem, has been very largely the march to Main Street. And the latest modern sensation is a book written to show how wretched it is to live there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Flambeau, [...] "I never murdered anyone, {{even in my}} {{criminal}} days, but I {{can almost}} sympathize with anyone doing {{it in such a}} dreary place. Of all God-forsaken dustbins of Nature, I think the most heart-breaking are <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> bandstand, that were meant to be festive and are forlorn. I can fancy a morbid man feeling he must kill his rival in the solitude and irony of such a scene. I remember once taking a tramp in your glorious Surrey hills, thinking of nothing but gorse and skylarks, when I came out on a vast circle of land, and over me lifted a vast, voiceless structure, tier above tier of seats, as huge as a Roman amphitheatre and as empty as a new letter-rack. A bird sailed in heaven over it. It was the Grand Stand at Epsom. And I felt that no one would ever be happy there again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Leslie {{was left}} over there alone. Dick {{had put in}} the crop before he went, and old Abner looked after it. The summer went by and the Four Sisters didn't come back. The Nova Scotia Moores investigated, and found she had got to Havana and {{discharged}} her cargo and took on another and left for home; {{and that was all}} they ever found out about her. By degrees people began to talk of Dick Moore as one that was dead. Almost everyone believed that he was, though no one felt certain, for men have turned up here at the harbor after they'd been gone for years. Leslie never thought he was dead--and she was right. A thousand pities too! The next summer Captain Jim was in Havana--that was before he gave up the sea, of course. He thought he'd poke round a bit--Captain Jim was always meddlesome, just like a man--and he went to inquiring round among the sailors' boarding houses and <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> {{to see if he could}} find out anything about the crew of the Four Sisters. He'd better have let sleeping dogs lie, in my opinion! Well, he went to one out-of-the-way place, and there he found a man he knew at first sight it was Dick Moore, though he had a big beard. Captain Jim got it shaved off and then there was no doubt--Dick Moore it was--his body at least. His mind wasn't there--as for his soul, in my opinion he never had one!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the better," [...] Dave said; [...] "we {{can make}} a fight for it in a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> and hold it till dark. They can't be far behind us now. Stop the horses a moment and listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hein! You think so, do you? See {{how it will}} be when I come to talk to him! A shrewd fellow <b>like</b> <b>that</b> who got out of the Micklethwayte concern just in time. Catch him {{giving up}} a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> though he may humbug you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Delightful," [...] her {{companion}} assented. [...] "I suppose great wealth has its obligations, but why {{any human being}} should rear such a structure as what he calls his Borghese villa, when he has a charming <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to live in, I can't imagine." ...|$|R
5000|$|Serge is not fond of Kasabian being {{compared}} to similar, older bands, including Oasis and The Stone Roses. He says [...] "The foreign fans {{listen to the}} music more and don't call us The Stone Roses or anything. I think they get us for who we are, especially in France and <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> There's no baggage like in the UK." [...] Pizzorno has also expressed admiration for Damon Albarn, the frontman of Oasis' rival Britpop band Blur.|$|E
5000|$|Drummer Bob Siebenberg recounted that [...] "Roger {{had been}} working at Malibu {{for quite a while}} on this tune. I'd hear the song in hotel rooms and <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> He had the song on a little tape when I first joined the band so I was quite {{familiar}} with the tune. We tried out various drum things and it seemed right to ride it along on the snare drum... giving it something almost like a train beat. So it's all on the snare and bass drum, with no tom-tom fills or anything." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2009, Weber, the IHR's director, {{released}} an essay titled, [...] "How Relevant Is Holocaust Revisionism?" [...] In it, he acknowledged {{the death of}} millions of Jews, a reversal of previous positions taken by Institute authors. He noted that Holocaust denial had attracted little support over the years: [...] "It’s gotten some support in Iran, or <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> {{but as far as}} I know, there is no history department supporting writing by these folks." [...] Accordingly, he recommended that emphasis be placed instead on opposing [...] "Jewish-Zionist power", which some commentators claim is a shift to a directly antisemitic position. Since then, the Institute has not published any new articles or books on Holocaust denial.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Now that Mr. Morgan has gone, Mrs. Morgan {{wants to}} go to live with her {{children}} in Vancouver. She will sell cheaply, for a big <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in a small village like the Glen will not be very easy to dispose of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, me boy, you're {{up a tree}} as far as office goes. A <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> niver suited me, because, you see, that poker of a young lord {{expected}} {{so much of a}} man; but {{you don't}} mind that kind of thing, and I thought you were as snug as snug." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How men {{can stay}} up all night and gamble in a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I can't understand," [...] he murmured to himself. [...] "I would rather be in bed and asleep. And it stands to reason the proprietors have the best of it, {{otherwise}} how could they run such a gorgeous house?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{used to call}} it Terrific Street. I can {{remember}} the time you could come across San Francisco Bay on the ferryboat and you could pick out that blaze of electric lights on Pacific Street. There wasn't any neon in them days; just millions of electric lights. There was The Midway, The Hippodrome, The Thalia, Louie Gomez's, Parenti's Saloon, Griffin's, Spider Kelly's, The Bella Union, and a slug of other <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> You could see all the lights from them for miles in any direction. I've seen good times on Terrific Street when the street was so crowded with people nobody could go through there in an automobile, and I remember the night the officers of the law come in and closed everything down..." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I did {{two seasons}} the Music Theatre of Wichita getting my Actors' Equity Association {{membership}} candidacy points, then came directly after my second season there. I was here for eight months, and I was working. I worked at Theater Under the Stars in Houston and Paper Mill and <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{and then went}} on a tour. I left about eight months after I moved here, went on a bus-and-truck tour of Me and My Girl for a year, and then did another tour and then met my now ex-husband and moved to Colorado. I lived for about seven years in Colorado, and I would work in Seattle and TUTS in Houston and Sacramento Music Circus a lot while I lived in Denver. And, then in 1998, I came back here and was here for two weeks and got a Broadway show." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brennan {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Glee based on his own experience {{as a member of}} the Prospect High School show choir. He explained: [...] "I find it interesting that there is something in everybody, a longing for something transcendent, particularly in a place like Mt. Prospect, a place that’s very suburban and normal and plain. Even in <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> there’s this desire to shine. That’s fascinating and very funny to me, especially when people try to accomplish this through show choir - which, to me, is inherently a little ridiculous." [...] In 2005, a choir director at Prospect High was accused of inappropriate behavior with a student and was later convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Brennan was inspired by these events, and in August 2005, purchased a copy of Screenwriting for Dummies and wrote the first draft of Glee, initially envisioned as a film rather than a television series. He completed the script in 2005, but could not generate interest in the project for several years.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{no doubt}} of it. Really, I'm not being funny, Miss Wetherford, when I say you've done {{something}} heroic. It's no easy thing to come into a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and make it habitable. It shows immense courage and self-reliance on your part. It's {{precisely the kind of}} work this whole country needs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The mate is asleep, and {{the fire}} has burned down; that's the explanation. Besides, fuel is not too plenty on a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Mulford inhabits just now. As we get near the spot, I shall look out for embers, which may sarve as a light-house, or beacon, to guide us into port." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel was powerfully {{shaken by}} this attack; he did feel {{responsible}} for Statira's staying in town all summer; but {{the spectacle of}} 'Manda Grier publicly crying at his side in a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> helped to counteract the effect of her words. [...] "'Sh! Don't cry!" [...] he began, looking fearfully round him. [...] "Everybody 'll see you!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1923 (Taisho 12th year), [...] "Marunouchi Building" [...] {{was built}} {{in front of the}} Tokyo station in the design of Kotaro Sakurai (8 stories in the photo, 9 stories above the {{basement}} 1st floor). It was the biggest building in the prewar era of the Showa era, and it was said that it is [...] "the building in Toyo." [...] The form of releasing the lower floors of office buildings to the general customers and developing shopping malls and the like was also introduced pioneeringly in Marunouchi in Japan and was released in 1929 (Showa 4 years) from the modern image It also became a stage for many songs such as Tokyo popular song [...] "Tokyo March" [...] and novels. Since it was a huge building representative of the time, there were times when it was cited as [...] "comparable unit of building size" [...] such as [...] "Marubiru how many cups" [...] (after that, how many cups of Kasumigaseki Building and Tokyo Dome There are <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The band's touring manager {{recalled}} that Roy Weard  {{recalled that}} [...] "Quirk Out {{was an unusual}} record in so many ways. It’s always hard for unusual things to do well, so I was very surprised {{that they were doing}} as well as they did. As it went on I realised that {{it was the sort of}} music that either grabbed people by the throat and went, listen to me, or turned them off completely and most people seemed to want to listen to it, so it was good. We did a lot of Universities and places like the Sheffield Leadmill, middle-sized venues. I think the biggest thing we ever did when I was working for them was Brixton Academy, we weren't headlining that particular show but we did some big venues all over the place. The crowd response varied a lot, especially outside of the big cities. The big cities got Stump; Edinburgh, Glasgow, London and <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> got Stump, then you’d go to smaller cities and sometimes there was a bit of bafflement. It was like, what is this?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There's a {{tone and}} feeling to the song, there's a militia, a march {{and a kind}} of rambunctious energy to it that, for me, I {{immediately}} wanted to tap into. I showed Jay some references from the classic rebellious zones of the world. We live in very orderly society in America, but when you get into Brazil, you get into the Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, when you get into <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> there's a different sort of 'we run this town' on.

[...] Nevertheless, she gazed at it longingly. [...] "I'd sure <b>like</b> <b>that</b> big garden and that porch. You could sit on that porch and see the mountains, couldn't you?

25|$|I {{had to get}} my {{grasshoppers}} from Waco, Texas. They had {{the only}} species large enough to carry focus. I could only import males because they didn't want the things to start breeding. They even had someone from the agricultural department or some <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> come out to take a head count, or wing count. The grasshoppers turned cannibalistic.|$|R
50|$|The bridge also {{incorporates}} a 3% climbing grade, a feature lacked {{on the nearby}} St. Georges Bridge. The bridge, built between 1991 and 1994, utilized pre-cast concrete segments that were made in Cape Charles, Virginia, and transported by barge until it reached the job site.
