25|$|Brazil. Eucalyptus was {{introduced}} to Brazil in 1910, for timber substitution and the charcoal industry. It has thrived in the local environment, and today there are around 7 million hectares planted. The wood is highly valued by the charcoal and pulp and paper industries. The short rotation allows a larger wood production and supplies wood for several other activities, helping to preserve the native forests from logging. When well managed, the plantation soils can sustain endless replanting. Eucalyptus plantings are also used as wind breaks. Brazil's plantations have world-record rates of growth, typically over 40 cubic metres per hectare per year, and commercial harvesting occurs after years 5. Due to continual development and governmental funding, year-on-year growth is consistently being improved. Eucalyptus can produce up to 100 cubic metres per hectare per year. Brazil has become the top exporter and producer of Eucalyptus round wood and pulp, and has {{played an important role}} in developing the Australian market through the country's committed research in this area. The local iron <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> rely heavily on sustainably grown Eucalyptus for charcoal; this has greatly pushed up the price of charcoal in recent years. The plantations are generally owned and operated for national and international industry by timber asset companies such as Thomson Forestry, Greenwood Management or cellulose producers such as Aracruz Cellulose and Stora Enso.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, Acinetobacter baumannii {{resistant}} to carbapenems {{has emerged in}} many medical centres and has been commonly associated with high morbimortality. In Brazil, this resistance is mainly attributed {{to the spread of}} OXA- 23 -producing clones and, to a lesser extent, to OXA- 143 -producing clones. Here, we describe, for the first time, two OXA- 72 -producing A. baumannii isolates in southern Brazil to a broad spectrum of antibiotics, except polymyxin B and tigecycline. Molecular typing by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) demonstrated that both OXA- 72 -producing isolates belong to a new sequence type (ST), ST 730, which was recently identified in OXA- 23 -producing A. baumannii isolates in São Paulo, Brazil. We demonstrate that the two A. baumannii ST 730 isolates carrying blaOXA- 72 share a common ancestral origin with the blaOXA- 23 <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil.</b> This observation reinforces the importance of strain-typing methods in order to clarify the dynamics of the emergence of new clones in a geographic region...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTDeterminants of {{contractual}} arrangements in agricultural credit transactionsBecause of {{a reduction in}} the supply of subsidized agricultural credit in Brazil, the economic agents in the agro-industrial systems organized themselves to tie in credit and their buying and selling transactions with farmers. Different types of agreements appeared, characterized by different finance structures. In this study, the authors aimed at verifying the causal relation between the type of financing used by soy <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> and their possible determinants. Two arrangements were chosen for analysis: getting bank loans and getting loans tied to transactions with agro-industrial chain agents. The explanatory variables used were property size, guarantees provided and reputation, measured in terms of how long the relationship had existed for. As foreseen in the theory, results showed that property size is one of the determinants of credit transactions between farmers and agro-industrial chain agents. However, the relation with government banks and the guarantees did not turn out to be relevant elements for the analysis of the determinants in the choice of {{contractual arrangements}} for soy financing with agents of the agro-industrial system...|$|E

40|$|Juvenile {{fish trade}} {{monitoring}} {{is an important}} task on Brazilian fish farms. However, the identification of juvenile fish through morphological analysis is not feasible, particularly between interspecific hybrids and pure species individuals, making the monitoring of these individuals difficult. Hybrids can be erroneously identified as pure species in breeding facilities, which might reduce production on farms and negatively affect native populations due to escapes or stocking practices. In the present study, we used a multi-approach analysis (molecular and cytogenetic markers) to identify juveniles of three serrasalmid species (Colossoma macropomum, Piaractus mesopotamicus and Piaractus brachypomus) and their hybrids in different stocks purchased from three seed <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil.</b> The main {{findings of this study}} were the detection of intergenus backcrossing between the hybrid ♀ patinga (P. mesopotamicus×P. brachypomus) ×♂ C. macropomum and the occurrence of one hybrid triploid individual. This atypical specimen might result from automixis, a mechanism that produces unreduced gametes in some organisms. Moreover, molecular identification indicated that hybrid individuals are traded as pure species or other types of interspecific hybrids, particularly post-F 1 individuals. These results show that serrasalmid fish genomes exhibit high genetic heterogeneity, and multi-approach methods and regulators could improve the surveillance of the production and trade of fish species and their hybrids, thereby facilitating the sustainable development of fish farming...|$|E
40|$|In the {{specific}} case of sugarcane, <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> are currently {{paid by the}} content of total recoverable sugars (TRS) in the raw material when it reaches the industry, according to CONSECANA: TRS = 9. 6316 *PC + 9. 15 * RSS, where PC is the Pol in cane (apparent sucrose) and RSS are reducing sugars in sugarcane (glucose + fructose). The objective {{of the project was}} to propose changes in the procedures used to mathematically determine the TRS, estimating the calorific value of moist cake and weight of moist cake. The final model is then proposed: TRS = 25. 9892 + 0. 02172 *CVmc*WMC+ 0. 536 *WMC – 4. 14 *CVmc + + 4. 8158 *PC + 4. 575 *RSS. Thus we obtain the TRS calculated according to the calorific value of moist cake (CVmc), weight of moist cake (WMC), Pol cane (PC) and the reducing sugars in sugarcane (RSS). This form is included in the estimation of TRS, the calorific value of moist cake, which reflects the bioenergy of fiber, weight of moist cake that estimates sugarcane fiber, in addition to existing factors Pol cane and reducing sugars in sugarcane. In the proposed model, the estimated values of TSR were 11. 08 % higher than the estimated values in the CONSECANA model. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Monitoring of the {{interspecific}} hybrid production and trade {{is essential for}} the appropriate management of these animals in fish farms. The identification of catfish hybrids by morphological analysis is unreliable, particularly of juveniles and post-F 1 individuals. Therefore, in the present study, we used five molecular markers (four nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene) to detect hybrids in the trade of pimelodid juvenile fish from different stocks purchased of five seed <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil.</b> Samples commercialized as pintado (pure species Pseudoplatystoma corruscans) from three fish farms were genetically identified as hybrid cachapinta (&# 9792; P. reticulatum x &# 9794; P. corruscans). In the stocks purchased as cachandiá (hybrid between &# 9792; P. reticulatum x &# 9794; Leiarius marmoratus) and cachapira (hybrid between &# 9792; P. reticulatum x &# 9794; Phractocephalus hemioliopterus), we suggested the occurrence of intergenus crosses involving the hybrid cachapinta, which was used instead of the pure species P. reticulatum. The problems involving the hybrid cachapinta production were discussed in the present study, especially because these animals have caused genetic contamination and threatened the genetic integrity of natural and cultivated populations. In order to improve the surveillance of the production and provide criteria for the correct management of catfish hybrids, genetic markers has become an excellent alternative to the morphological identification, including juveniles or post-F 1 generations...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Oebalus poecilus (Dallas 1851) {{is one of}} {{the stink}} bug species of great {{economic}} importance for rice <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> of irrigated, flood and upland cropping systems. These pentatomids are known as stink bugs of panicles, because both nymphs and adults feed mainly on panicles. Stink bug attacks result in pecky (spots) seeds, lower mass, germinative reduction and deformed grains. Bearing these factors in mind, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the quantitative and qualitative losses in commercial cultivars of upland rice (Cambará variety), submitted to different population levels of stink bugs of panicles, O. poecilus, at different reproductive growth stages. The results show that in upland rice (Cambará variety), the rice grains are susceptible to quantitative (number and weight) and qualitative (pecky, atrophy, chalky and broken grains) damage during all panicle development. However, when the insects feed during anthesis/caryopsis and milky stage cause significantly greater percentage of empty grains (up to 83 %) than when they feed of grains during later phases of panicle development. This characteristic was also observed for the reduction in grain weight. This information may benefit producers and other researchers, allowing them to focus on the monitoring efforts of O. poecilus in most susceptible phases of the attack of this insect. This will enable decision-making about what control measures should be taken, and when, in order to control stink bugs of panicles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{advances}} Williams and Thompson (1984) by updating {{their work}} and by explicitly accounting for price and yield risk {{in the analysis of}} acreage response in Brazil for soybeans and by assessing model specification. Empirical equations were estimated using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The robustness of the model was evaluated in the battery of misspecification tests suggested by McGuirk et al. (1993) and McGuirk et al. (1995). The results of the testing procedure suggest that the model is fairly robust in terms of normality, heteroscedasticity and functional form. The results point to parameter instability in the soybean model. The approach to the problem of parameter instability involved dividing the data in two periods and estimating regressions for each period. The signs of the significant coefficients were consistent with expectation, particularly for the second period. Soybean acreage is explained mainly by past acreage, expected prices of soybeans and land competing crops (cotton, rice, and corn), and price and yield risk. Results suggest that market signals played a reduced role in the soybean acreage growth in early years. In contrast, in recent years <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> became more sensitive to changes in prices and risk. Measures of short-run price elasticity of soybean acreage response are similar to the one obtained by William and Thompson (1984) for soybean supply. Long-run elasticities are significantly smaller.

40|$|Abstract: The {{regulatory}} {{process of the}} organic sector in Brazil began in 1999 and has gone through several changes, culminating in the Decree-Law of December 2007, which established rules for the production and trading of organic products in Brazil. In such Decree, the certification has become a compulsory requirement for production and trading of such products, whose rules governing their obtaining follow rigorous controls standards. As the certification process of organic products is recent {{and there is a}} lack of studies carried on this subject, this study will contribute to fill the existing gap in the international literature, mainly national about this topic, once that aimed to identify factors that influence the possibility of non-renewal of organic production certificate, according to the perception of certified <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil.</b> Through this effort, this research should contribute to wider adherence and maintenance of the producer in the certified system or, at least, proposals for further works. A total of 200 producers from several Brazilian states participated in this study, and data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and, later, exploratory factor analysis. The results achieved holds that the determining factors to the non-renewal of the certificate involve variables related to transactions among operators, organization of the supply chain and to the regulations. Furthermore, to overcome the challenges imposed to rural producers, one of the proposals is for greater effective actions from representative industry entities of the sector in aspects that are related to the certification process...|$|E
