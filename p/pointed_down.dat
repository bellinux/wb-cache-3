5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are <b>pointed</b> <b>down</b> and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E

25|$|First {{evaluation}} of the orbital insertion showed that the orbiter had reached its first milestone at Mars. The orbit was later adjusted by four more main engine firings to the desired 259km × 11,560km near-polar (86 degree inclination) orbit with a period of 7.5 hours. Near periapsis the top deck is <b>pointed</b> <b>down</b> towards the Martian surface and near apoapsis the high gain antenna will be pointed towards Earth for uplink and downlink.|$|E

25|$|The {{look was}} that of a greyhound. His arms and legs were {{extended}} more than was customary in his era of pounded post World War II roads. And the toes <b>pointed</b> <b>down.</b> Just a few years before, riders had prided their ankling motion, but Jacques {{was the first of the}} big gear school. His smooth power dictated his entire approach to the sport. Hands resting serenely on his thin Mafac brake levers, the sensation from Quincampoix, Normandy, appeared to cruise while others wriggled in desperate attempts to keep up.|$|E
25|$|This testing also {{demonstrated}} two unexpected and ultimately very useful {{features of the}} spiral scan system. The first was that since the scanning pattern crossed the ground when the antenna was <b>pointed</b> <b>down,</b> the ground returns produced a series of curved stripes along the lower portion of the display. This formed an analogue of an artificial horizon, one that radar operators found extremely useful in combat because they could immediately see if the pilot was responding correctly to their commands. Various {{members of the team}} record having been surprised by this outcome, noting that the effect was obvious in retrospect and should have been predicted.|$|E
25|$|The other effect {{occurred}} when the dish was pointed towards the ground, causing a strong return that produced a sharp return on the display. Due to the circular scanning pattern, the dish would be pointed to the sides when the beam first struck the ground, continuing to strike the ground while the scanner continued rotating until it is <b>pointed</b> <b>down,</b> and then back up until the beam no longer intersects the ground again. Since the beam strikes the ground at a point closer to the aircraft when it is pointed straight down, the returns during this period are closest to the zero ring. When the reflector rotated further to the sides the beam would strike the ground further away and produce blips further from the zero line. Conveniently, the geometry of the situation causes the returns to form a series of straight lines, producing an effect similar to an artificial horizon.|$|E

25|$|The other {{surprise}} was that ground returns caused a false signal that always {{appeared at the}} same range as the aircraft's current altitude, no matter where the dish was pointed. This was {{in much the same}} fashion as the Mk. IV, but in this case, the signal was much smaller whenever the dish was not <b>pointed</b> <b>down.</b> Instead of a wall of noise at the range of the aircraft's altitude, the signal caused a faint ring, leaving targets on either side visible. The ring was initially very wide, caused by returns not only directly under the aircraft but further away as well. After several months of work, Hodgkin and Edwards managed to provide a tuning control that muted down the weaker signals, leaving a sharp ring indicating the aircraft altitude. This too was a useful indicator for the operators, as they could see they were at the same altitude as their target when the ring overlapped the target blip.|$|E
