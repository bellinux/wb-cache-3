40|$|This article {{examines}} the oral and glottal adjustments, {{as well as their}} coordination, during the production of singleton and geminate voiceless stops in Berber using fiberscopy, <b>photoglottography</b> and acoustic analyses. Acoustically, closure duration of geminates is longer than singletons. VOT, on the other hand, does not contribute to the distinction of length. At the glottal level, voiceless stops are realized with a glottal opening covering both the closure portion and the aspiration portion. Geminates and singletons differ in terms of timing and size of glottal opening. Geminates have a larger and longer glottal opening than singletons. The interval between peak glottal opening and oral release is significantly higher for geminates than for single stops...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} is {{a summary of}} the two-year project supported by ANR with the title of "Establishing speech analysis platform with visualization and instrumentation (ESPVI) ". The results from the project were presented briefly for the topics of laryngeal, articualtory, and aerodynamic instrumentation techniques. Techniques for high-speed imaging of vocal fold vibration and non-invasive <b>photoglottography</b> were advanced by the use of recent optoelectronic devices such as high-power infrared light emitting diodes (IR LEDs). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique was employed to record normal motion images and tagged motion images together in a session so that both motion imaging and point tracking can be performed. Surface electromyography was enabled by devising miniature suction electrodes. Sononasography was tested with small vibration sensors attached on the nasal wings. Simultaneous measurement of the oral and nasal airflow was permitted by inventing a dual-channel airflow mask...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{long-term}} goal of LPP {{is to achieve}} an integrated model of phonetics and phonology. It also works on applications to clinical phonetics and language learning. LPP has recently assembled a research platform for investigating the behavior of each speech organ involved in speech production. The platform is elaborated by a joint effort between engineers, phoneticians and clinicians. It provides tools to investigate various phenomena of coordination and compensation across speech organs that are observed {{in the production of}} speech by normal or pathological speakers, foreign language learners, and singers. The paper described the instrumentation techniques, both conventional and new, that are currently used at our laboratory for investigating the behavior of the speech organs involved in speech production. The examples that were provided highlight the innovative value of the multisensory platform for phonetic studies. The first example combined fi berscopic and aerodynamic data for the study of nasality; the second combined <b>photoglottography,</b> pneumotachography and intraoral pressure measurements for the study of glottal articulation. Both illustrate the benefit of using several exploratory techniques in parallel, suggesting that data based on a single technique can be misleading. Research issues in phonetics and phonology include patterns of synchronic variation and evolutionary paths (in particular prosodic influences over the realization of segments) and typological patterns of phoneme distributions and phonotactic constraints (in particular recurrent asymmetries within sound systems). Progress in analyses and models requires the study of physiological, articulatory, acoustic, aerodynamic and perceptual parameters...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{has evolved}} {{over a period of}} tens of {{thousands}} of years as the primary means of communication between human beings. Since the evaluation of speech and of homo sapiens have proceed hand-in-hand, it seems reasonable to assume that human speech production mechanisms, and the resulting acoustic signal, are optimally adapted to human speech perception mechanisms. There a lot of method to measure and analyse the speech production, there are Electropalatography (EPG), Accelerometer, Rothenberg Mask, Optical Tracking (Strain gauge), X-ray Microbeam (Magnetometer), Ultrasound, Electromyography (EMG), X-ray cine, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Pressure Transducers, Respitrace, <b>Photoglottography</b> (PGG), Video, Electroglottography (EGG), Velotrace and Photoglossometry. The Electroglottography, sometime also known as Electrolaryngography or Laryngography (trademark of Laryngography Limited) is a non-invasive method of measuring vocal fold contact during voicing without affecting speech production. The electroglottograph or known as EGG measures the variations in impedances to a very small electrical current between the electrodes pair placed across the neck as the area of vocal fold contact changes during voicing. This method was first developed by Fabre (1957) and influential contributions are credited to Fourcin (1971 with Abbertion) and Frokjaer-Jensen (1968 with Thorvaldsen). The computer unit will process the data and display the electroglottograpgh (EGG waveform) in real time then analyse by the pathologies or therapist. They can relate the waveform with the actual movement of vocal fold. The movement here means the closure and opening phase, maximum contact and maximum open between the flap of tissue. Commercially available for this devices are produced by Laryngography Ltd. (Since 1974), Synchrovoice, F-J Electronics, Glottal Enterprise and Kay Elemetrics Corporations. Actually pathologies or speech therapist trained the patients to perform the non-medical evaluation of a voice disorder and execute a plan to improve voice. In additional the Ear, Nose and Throat department, Phoniatrics, speech scientists, phoneticts and linguistics department, foreign language teachers and so on. They can interpret the EGG waveform and analyse the voice regularity, voice quality, pitch, loudness control, fundamental frequency, voice onset time, the effects of laryngeal co-articulation and phephonatory laryngeal...|$|E
