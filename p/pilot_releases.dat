5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable, also known as [...] "relaxed static stability" [...] (RSS), to improve maneuverability. Most aircraft are designed with positive static stability, which induces aircraft to return to {{straight and level flight}} attitude if the <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> the controls; this reduces maneuverability as the inherent stability has to be overcome. Aircraft with negative stability are designed to deviate from controlled flight and thus be more maneuverable. At supersonic speeds the F-16 gains stability (eventually positive) due to aerodynamic changes.|$|E
50|$|To {{disengage}} {{from the}} maneuver, the <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> elevator {{and lets the}} plane drop into a nose dive, allowing the plane to gain speed. Once the stall speed is passed, the pilot can pull back on the stick to return to normal flight. Therefore, the pilot must ensure that there is sufficient altitude {{to recover from the}} stall when performing and exiting the maneuver.|$|E

50|$|On Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery {{aircraft}} carriers (STOBAR), conventional aircraft are launched using a ski-jump. The pilot increases the aircraft's thrust by switching on the afterburners, while holding the plane by braking. Two panels are raised {{from the deck}} of the aircraft carrier in front of the aircraft's main landing gear, ensuring the plane remains motionless. Upon command, the <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> the brake; the panels from the deck drop back into their slots; and the aircraft rapidly taxis forward under maximum thrust. Rolling over the ski ramp launches the plane both upward and forward.|$|E

50|$|The GBU-15 {{may be used}} {{in either}} a direct or an {{indirect}} attack. In a direct attack, the pilot selects a target before launch, locks the weapon guidance system onto it and launches the weapon. The weapon automatically guides itself to the target, enabling the pilot to leave the area. In an indirect attack, the weapon is guided by remote control after launch. The <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> the weapon and, via remote control, searches for the target. Once the target is acquired, the weapon can be locked to the target or manually guided via the Hughes Aircraft AN/AXQ-14 data-link system.|$|E

50|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{discovered that}} the autopilot had been inadvertently switched from altitude hold to control wheel steering (CWS) mode in pitch. In this mode, once the <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> pressure on the yoke (control column), the autopilot maintains the pitch attitude selected by the pilot until he moves the yoke again. Investigators believe the autopilot switched modes when the captain accidentally leaned against the yoke while turning {{to speak to the}} flight engineer, who was sitting behind and to the right of him. The slight forward pressure on the stick would have caused the aircraft to enter a slow descent, maintained by the CWS system.|$|E
50|$|When the {{airspeed}} is low enough, {{the pilot}} applies hard rudder input with the pedals, bringing the plane into a sweeping flat-turn, as if pivoting {{on the lower}} wingtip while the upper wing cartwheels over the top. Because one wing is moving faster than the other, {{it will have a}} tendency to impart some roll onto the aircraft, so slight aileron will usually need to be applied during the turn to keep the plane from rolling. When the plane reaches a nose-down bank and attitude, the <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> rudder and dives, pulling back on the stick to level the plane out at the original altitude.|$|E

5000|$|To {{counter air}} {{defenses}} {{en route to}} the target, remaining at a low altitude {{for as long as possible}} allows the bomber to avoid radar and visual tracking and the launch envelope of older missile systems designed to be fired at targets overflying the missile site. However, a level pass at the target at low altitude will not only expose the aircraft to short-range defenses surrounding the target, but will place the aircraft in the bomb's blast radius. By executing a [...] "pop-up" [...] loft, on the other hand, the <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> the munition well outside the target area, out of range of air defenses. After release, the pilot can either dive back to low altitude or maintain the climb, in either case generally executing a sharp turn or [...] "slice" [...] away from the target. The blast produced by powerful munitions is thus avoided.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common methods of {{launching}} sailplanes are by aerotow and by winch. When aerotowed, the glider is towed behind a powered aircraft using a rope about 60 meters (about 200 ft) long. The glider <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> the rope after reaching the desired altitude. However, the rope can be {{released by the}} towplane also in case of emergency. Winch launching uses a powerful stationary engine located {{on the ground at}} the far end of the launch area. The glider is attached to one end of 800-1200 metres (about 2,500-4,000 ft) of cable and the winch rapidly winds it in. The glider can gain about 900-3000 feet (about 300-900 metres) of height with a winch launch, depending on the head wind. Less often, automobiles are used to pull gliders into the air, by pulling them directly or through the use of a reverse pulley in a similar manner to the winch launch. Elastic ropes (known as bungees) are occasionally used at some sites to launch gliders from slopes, if there is sufficient wind blowing up the hill. Bungee launching was the predominant method of launching early gliders. Some modern sailplanes can self-launch with the use of retractable engines and/or propellers, which can also be used to sustain flight once airborne (see motor glider).|$|E
5000|$|Albatross SDC: Amongst Spectrum's {{fleet of}} various craft, the Albatross is unique. Skybase carries {{two of these}} massive VTOL Deployment Aircraft, which are used to carry {{vehicles}} - mainly a Rhino - anywhere it is needed around the world. It can carry the heaviest weight, putting it down or picking it up on any ground, and in almost any conditions. The deployment system of the Albatross is unique. The cargo doors under {{the belly of the}} craft open, and unfold to form the landing feet. Then, the vehicle it carries is lowered by a lift from the Albatross' cargo, just as it finishes its landing procedure and approach. The Rhino can be deployed at the same second the Albatross makes its landing, and once it is out, the craft can take off immediately. This 'drop-and-go' deployment, helped by the SlyFOXX anti-detection shielding with which the Albatross is equipped, makes the aircraft perfect for covert operations. However, due to its massiveness, it could attract visual attention, and therefore, the sturdy craft has been equipped with anti-missile Acoustic Disruptors - which makes it a hard target to hit, despite his size. While so massive, the Albatross nevertheless has remarkable swiftness in flight. Powerful pivoting twin multi-directional XBurn engines, set {{on each side of the}} craft, give it lifting capability, maneuverability, and in-flight velocity, even while carrying the heaviest of loads. Also unique is the launching method with which the Albatross is launched from Skybase. Set in its hangar over an airlock, the Albatross is held in place by clamps attached to its nose. During launch sequence, the airlock doors open, and the pilot powers up the thrusters. Once ready for launched, the <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> the clamps, and the Albatross drops several meters from underneath Skybase, before the thrust of the engines stops its fall and it finally leaves Skybase to carry on its mission.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for hatchery-release programs {{to augment the}} harvest rates of fisheries can be limited by environmental factors associated with survival, growth and body condition among released individuals. We assessed spatial and temporal variability in the condition of postlarval and small juvenile (1 - 10 mm carapace length) eastern king prawns Penaeus plebejus Hess sampled from an estuarine population subjected to <b>pilot</b> <b>releases</b> of 3 million postlarvae per year in southeastern Australia. Variability in the length-weight relationship {{was used as a}} measure of condition and compared between (1) autumn/winter and spring/summer periods and (2) bare and macrophytic habitats for P. plebejus sampled from a population in a closed estuarine system. At a reference carapace length of 3. 97 mm, condition was ~ 14 % higher for individuals sampled from bare habitat and ~ 16 % higher for those sampled during autumn/winter compared, respectively, with individuals sampled within macrophytic habitat and during spring/summer. Further experimental work on the factors investigated here is encouraged to increase our understanding of the environmental characteristics and mechanisms that lead to improved condition and thus persistence of stocked populations of P. plebejus...|$|E
