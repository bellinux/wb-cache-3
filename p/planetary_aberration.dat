25|$|<b>Planetary</b> <b>aberration</b> is the {{combination}} of the aberration of light (due to Earth's velocity) and light-time correction (due to the object's motion and distance), as calculated in the rest frame of the Solar System. Both are determined at the instant when the moving object's light reaches the moving observer on Earth. It is so called because it is usually applied to planets and other objects in the Solar System whose motion and distance are accurately known.|$|E

In particular, it is usually necessary to apply it to the motion of a planet or other solar system object. For this reason, the combined displacement of the apparent position due to the effects of light-time correction and aberration is known as <b>planetary</b> <b>aberration.</b> By convention, light-time correction is not applied to the positions of stars, because their motion and distance may not be known accurately.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{navigation}} uses spacecraft television {{pictures of}} a target body against a known star background in a process which relates the spacecraft trajectory to the target body. This technology {{was used in the}} Mariner-Venus-Mercury mission, with the optical data processed in near-real-time, simulating a mission critical environment. Optical data error sources were identified, and a star location error analysis was carried out. Several methods for selecting limb crossing coordinates were used, and a limb smear compensation was introduced. Omission of <b>planetary</b> <b>aberration</b> corrections was the source of large optical residuals...|$|E
