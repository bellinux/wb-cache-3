40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} examine the body {{contamination}} rates and environmental contamination levels during the removal of 3 types of personal protective clothing (PPC) by the individual accustomed removal method (IARM) and gown removal methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods: Fifty participants performed IARM and CDC-recommended gown removal methods to remove 3 types of PPC (ie, cotton gown, water resistant gown, and <b>plastic</b> <b>apron)</b> in random order at 2 separate sessions after applying Glo Germ simulated germ lotion on the gown's surface. A video demonstrating the CDC-recommended gown removal method was shown between the 2 sessions. After PPC removal, fluorescent stains were counted by an ultraviolet scan under dim light. Results: Following IARM, contaminants were splashed in the surroundings, particularly on the front part of the subject. The <b>plastic</b> <b>apron</b> and cotton gown obtained the highest and lowest contaminative hazards, respectively, to the hands, shoes, and environment. Females, nurses, and senior staff had serious hand or shoe contamination. The CDC removal method more significantly reduced body and environmental contamination of small fluorescent stains (1 cm 2), than IARM. Conclusion: The effect of gown removal, PPC type, discarding PPC location, training of infection control measures, hand hygiene, and special work shoes should be considered daily.

A study was undertaken in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons,</b> supplied by the FAO, as compared to gravel mulches. The vinyl aprons were 6 mils thick and about 1 meter square. Squash plants (Cucurbita pepo) were planted with gravel or <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> or in bare areas and under different watering schedules. The yields under <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> were considerably greater than under gravel and required slightly less water. Bare soil yields lagged far behind. Soil temperatures under the <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> were consistently higher over 24 hours than bare soil, which within limits, would facilitate faster crop growth. Additionally, the apron collects and diverts rainfall to the plant. The vinyl used lasts only 2 seasons, and gravel would probably be a more suitable mulch for developing countries where capital is scarce...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Methods for {{mulching}} {{and water}} collection around the plant were evaluated {{to develop an}} efficient way to grow vegetables where water is scarce. <b>Plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> and gravel mulch produced significantly higher squash yields than plots with no mulch. The plants with plastic performed better than those on gravel. Water conservation seems to be the main factor for increased production.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the level and}} type of microbial contamination present on the white coats of doctors {{in order to assess}} the risk of transmission of pathogenic micro-organisms by this route in a hospital setting. DESIGN [...] Cross sectional survey of the bacterial contamination of white coats in a general hospital. SETTING [...] East Birmingham Hospital, an urban general hospital with 800 beds. SUBJECTS [...] 100 doctors of different grades and specialties. RESULTS [...] The cuffs and pockets of the coats were the most highly contaminated areas. The level of bacterial contamination did not vary with the length of time a coat had been in use, but it increased with the degree of usage by the individual doctor. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from a quarter of the coats examined, more commonly from those belonging to doctors in surgical specialties than medical specialties. Pathogenic Gram negative bacilli and other pathogenic bacteria were not isolated. CONCLUSIONS [...] White coats are a potential source of cross infection, especially in surgical areas. Scrupulous hand washing should be observed before and after attending patients and it may be advisable to remove the white coat and put on a <b>plastic</b> <b>apron</b> before examining wounds. There is little microbiological reason for recommending a more frequent change of white coat than once a week, nor for excluding the wearing of white coats in non-clinical areas...|$|E
40|$|This ‘composed documentary’ {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of transplant patients and the extraordinary issues raised by this invasive, last-option medical procedure. It weaves intensely personal narratives, often recorded at the bedside, {{with the sounds of}} the hospital environment, which can have an enormous effect on patients, shifting unpredictably from comforting to irritating, from reassuring to alarming. During my time at the Harefield transplant centre with photographer Tim Wainwright, I noticed that noise seems to come in waves: sometimes it is quiet enough to hear nurses' uniforms swishing, birds singing outside and the snap of latex gloves, but the atmosphere regularly builds to a cacophony of bleeps, bells, phones, pagers, voices, trolleys, bins, bags and <b>plastic</b> <b>apron</b> dispensers. My observations and interviews confirm anthropologist Tom Rice's assertion that in hospitals sound takes on "a more affective quality because of the drought in other sensory modalities. " Particularly if they are restricted to bed, what a patient sees is limited, smells are generally overpowered by disinfectant, and the food is bland. Consequently, hearing becomes arguably the most important sense for understanding the environment and making sense of one's experience. All of the people whose voices are heard in this piece have had a heart and/or lung transplant or were waiting for one when I met them. Some have since died; others, including Ian, who lived with two ventricular assist devices (VADs) plumbed in through his abdomen {{for more than a year}} while waiting for a new heart, are doing well. All the sounds were recorded within the transplant centre, though some have been twisted and shaped afterwards, often in response to the comments or stories of patients. The piece hovers on the borders between sound and music, documentary and sound art, exploring what Rice calls 'the cacophony of disease'...|$|E

40|$|An open-roofed plastic {{isolator}} {{was built}} in a single patient isolation room in a burn unit. It was designed to prevent contact contamination only, as this had {{been shown to be}} the important route of cross-colonization in the unit. To exclude any possible effect on airborne transfer of bacteria, the isolator was first examined by means of an airborne particle tracer of the same size as bacteria-carrying particles. Such experiments indicated that the isolator might prevent some transfer out of but not into the isolator. This was not confirmed in simulated nursing experiments nor in a patient study, where the air counts of bacteria were practically the same inside and outside the isolator wall. Two patients only were nursed in the isolator. Both patients acquired exogenous colonizations from other patients, one with Ps. aeruginosa and the other with S. aureus. Nursing in the isolator was difficult and staff-demanding. In simulated nursing experiments, <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> and gauntlets as the only protective measures against contact contamination gave as much protection to a mock patient as did the isolator. S. aureus were released from nurses' clothes more easily during work with the isolator than in open nursing with aprons and gauntlets. In conclusion, the isolator {{did not seem to be}} a realistic alternative to impermeable clothes such as <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> as a means of preventing clothes-borne cross-contamination between burn patients...|$|R
25|$|Tattooing is {{regulated}} {{in many countries}} because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.|$|R
40|$|A {{report by}} the Hong Kong {{government}} noted that hospital infection control standards were inadequate, requiring audit, development and implementation. In addition, hospital staff needed training in infection control measures. We investigated infection control practices among 162 hospital health workers (109 nurses, 45 doctors and 8 therapists) and 44 support workers in one acute hospital and two rehabilitation hospitals using a non-blinded, observational design. We examined compliance with isolation precautions and infection control guidelines, including proper wearing of a mask, goggles/face shield, or gown; handling patient care equipment, linen, and laundry; routine and terminal cleaning; and terminal cleaning of an isolation room. One major breakdown in compliance was use of sleeveless disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> instead of long-sleeved gowns during procedures likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood and body fluids. In {{more than half of}} the observed episodes, participants failed to disinfect medical devices, such as stethoscopes, before re-use. Thorough cleansing of commodes between patients was also lacking. Overall compliance with local and international infection control guidelines was satisfactory, but several aspects required improvement. © 2009 The Hospital Infection Society...|$|R
40|$|NIOSH {{warns that}} tobacco {{harvesters}} {{may be at}} increased risk for developing green tobacco sickness (GTS) which is a form of nicotine (54115) poisoning. A total of 47 persons with GTS were identified during 2 months in 1992 after seeking emergency treatment in a five county area of Kentucky. Nicotine can be absorbed from the wet tobacco surface through the skin of the workers. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe weakness with changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Abdominal cramping, headaches and difficulty in breathing were frequently reported. Recommendations offered to help workers avoid this problem included not working in wet tobacco, wearing protective clothing which may reduce the amount of nicotine absorbed through the skin such as chemical resistant gloves and <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons,</b> changing to dry clothing as quickly as possible once clothes have become wet, and informing the doctor of nicotine exposure if the worker does become ill which will assist in obtaining a correct diagnosis more quickly. Since the symptoms are easily confused with those resulting from exposure to organophosphorus compounds, the correct diagnosis may be difficult to obtain. OtherOccupational Healt...|$|R
5000|$|The first nurse uniforms {{were derived}} from the nun's habit. Before the 19th century, nuns took care of sick and injured people so {{it was obvious that}} trained lay nurses might copy the nun's habit as they have adopted ranks like [...] "Sister". One of Florence Nightingale's first {{students}} (Miss van Rensselaer) designed the original uniform for the students at Miss Nightingale's school of nursing. Before the 1940s minor changes occurred in the uniform. The clothing consisted of a mainly blue outfit. Hospitals were free to determine the style of the nurse uniform, including the nurse's cap which exists in many variants.In Britain, the national uniform (or simply [...] "national") was designed {{with the advent of the}} National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and the Newcastle dress. From the 1960s open necks began to appear. In the 1970s, white disposable paper caps replaced cotton ones; in the 1980s, <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> displaced the traditional ones and outerwear began to disappear. From the 1990s, scrubs became popular in Britain, having first appeared in the USA; however, some nurses in Britain continue to wear dresses, although some NHS trusts have removed them in favour of scrubs as in many other countries.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the incidence of microbial contamination on medical students’ white coats, the way they handle and clean their white coats and their perception towards contamination. For this purpose, cross sectional survey of the bacterial contamination of white coats in a medical college has been carried out in 3 different locations; Royal College of Medicine, Perak, University of Kuala Lumpur and a private college attached to Ipoh General Hospital. It was found that the incidence of Staphylococus aureus, was 32 % on short-sleeved and 54 % on long-sleeved white coats. Bacillus species was the second most common type of bacteria found. Male collars and female pockets had higher microbial contaminations (p= 0. 01, 0. 03 respectively). Clinical students’ white coats were significantly less contaminated than non-clinical students (p= 0. 001) although they tend to wear it for a longer period (5. 75 ± 2. 19 h vs. 2. 32 ± 0. 81 h) (p= 0. 001). Clinical students owned more short-sleeved coats (p= 0. 001) and washed their coats more often (p= 0. 01) than non-clinical ones. More than eighty one percent of clinical students wear their white coats in the college the majority of whom were females (p= 0. 005). Perception of clinical and non-clinical students towards white coat contamination was similar. Medical students’ white coats are contaminated with bacteria and they are potentially source of cross infection. Student’s way of handling and washing white coats should be corrected by issuing and following standard guidelines. Students should be bared from wearing white coats in non-clinical areas. Washing hands and using <b>plastic</b> <b>aprons</b> is highly recommended before examining wounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of gram-positive bacteria, particularly multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), among patients {{is a growing}} concern. One critical aspect of bacterial transfer {{is the ability of}} the microorganism to survive on various common hospital surfaces. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the survival of 22 gram-positive bacteria (vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant enterococci and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococci) on five common hospital materials: smooth 100 % cotton (clothing), 100 % cotton terry (towels), 60 % cotton– 40 % polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), 100 % polyester (privacy drapes), and 100 % polypropylene <b>plastic</b> (splash <b>aprons).</b> Swatches were inoculated with 104 to 105 CFU of a microorganism, assayed daily by placing the swatches in nutritive media, and examining for growth after 48 h. All isolates survived for at least 1 day, and some survived for more than 90 days on the various materials. Smaller inocula (102) survived for shorter times but still generally for days. Antibiotic sensitivity had no consistent effect on survival. The long survival of these bacteria, including MRSA and VRE, on commonly used hospital fabrics, such as scrub suits, lab coats, and hospital privacy drapes, underscores the need for meticulous contact control procedures and careful disinfection to limit the spread of these bacteria...|$|R
