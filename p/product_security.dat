40|$|Attackers {{continually}} innovate {{and craft}} attacks that penetrate existing defenses. New <b>security</b> <b>product</b> purchasing decisions are key {{in order to}} keep organizations as secure as possible. Current information available to inform these decisions is often limited to individual <b>security</b> <b>product</b> detection/blocking rates for some test set of attacks. Actual security performance, however, depends on how a <b>security</b> <b>product</b> performs {{in the context of an}} organization’s existing <b>security</b> <b>products.</b> Even a <b>security</b> <b>product</b> that tests well on its own may be completely redundant when deployed into an existing environment. We propose a new metric that measures the total security granted by a combination of <b>security</b> <b>products.</b> Also, this metric makes the computation of the added benefit of an additional <b>security</b> <b>product</b> easy. We take the results of each individual <b>security</b> <b>product</b> parsing a certain data set and then, take the union of the results of all <b>security</b> <b>products</b> deployed at that organization. Our metric is the attacks in this union divided by the total attacks in the data set or, in other words, the total detection rate achieved by the whole system. This metric can be computed using existing evaluation techniques and provides a more accurate overall picture of the security posture of an organization as well as a way to measure the real contribution of a specific <b>security</b> <b>product</b> in the context of other security layers.

Examples of <b>security</b> <b>products</b> include bollards, fire alarms, and CCTV. A securing product is one that has a subsidiary (secondary) purpose (protecting the security of the government complex, that is, securing the government complex) in addition to whatever its principal purpose is (Ekblom 2012).
