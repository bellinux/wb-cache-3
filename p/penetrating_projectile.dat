The hydrocode EPIC with its mesh-to-particle algorithm was used to calculate debris fields, with the parameters that control fragment size being calibrated from the statistical data on recovered fragments.

In this test ceramic tiles and ceramic based armor are evaluated as target without a semi-infinite backing layer. An energy approach is chosen to evaluate and rank the target materials penetration resistance. By measuring the armor material’s energy absorption, subtracting the residual projectile energy after penetration from the projectile energy before impact, an objective performance parameter for the ceramic or ceramic based armor is obtained. However, this parameter is still related to the specific projectile used in the test. The presented alternative testing method for ceramic based armor uses a high speed camera technique to determine residual velocity of target material fragments and of projectile remains.
