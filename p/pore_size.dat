5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E
25|$|Polyacrylamide gel (PAG) {{had been}} known as a {{potential}} embedding medium for sectioning tissues as early as 1964, and two independent groups employed PAG in electrophoresis in 1959. It possesses several electrophoretically desirable features that make it a versatile medium. It is a synthetic, thermo-stable, transparent, strong, chemically relatively inert gel, and can be prepared {{with a wide range}} of average pore sizes. The <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> of a gel and the reproducibility in gel <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> are determined by three factors, the total amount of acrylamide present (%T) (T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer), the amount of cross-linker (%C) (C = bisacrylamide concentration), and the time of polymerization of acrylamide (cf. QPNC-PAGE). <b>Pore</b> <b>size</b> decreases with increasing %T; with cross-linking, 5%C gives the smallest <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> Any increase or decrease in %C from 5% increases the <b>pore</b> <b>size,</b> as <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> with respect to %C is a parabolic function with vertex as 5%C. This appears to be because of non-homogeneous bundling of polymer strands within the gel. This gel material can also withstand high voltage gradients, is amenable to various staining and destaining procedures, and can be digested to extract separated fractions or dried for autoradiography and permanent recording.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} into micro-architecture of scaffolds {{has revealed that}} mean <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> are cell-type specific and influence cellular shape, differentiation, and extracellular matrix secretion. In this context, the overall goal {{of this study was}} to investigate whether scaffold mean <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> affect mesenchymal stem cell initial attachment, chondrogenic gene expression, and cartilage-like matrix deposition. Collagen-hyaluronic acid (CHyA) scaffolds, recently developed in our laboratory for in vitro chondrogenesis, were fabricated with three distinct mean <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> (94, 130, and 300 [*]μm) by altering the freeze-drying technique used. It was evident that scaffolds with the largest mean <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> (300 [*]μm) stimulated significantly higher cell proliferation, chondrogenic gene expression, cartilage-like matrix deposition, and resulting bulk compressive modulus after in vitro culture, relative to scaffolds with smaller mean <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> (94, 130 [*]μm). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of scaffold micro-architecture in the development of advanced tissue engineering strategies for articular cartilage defect repair...|$|R

25|$|Polyacrylamide gel {{electrophoresis}} (PAGE) {{is used for}} separating proteins {{ranging in size from}} 5 to 2,000 kDa due to the uniform <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> provided by the polyacrylamide gel. <b>Pore</b> <b>size</b> is controlled by modulating the concentrations of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide powder used in creating a gel. Care must be used when creating this type of gel, as acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin in its liquid and powdered forms.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometric {{porosimetry}} {{measures the}} change of the optical properties and thickness of the materials during adsorption and desorption of a volatile species at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure depending on the application. The EP technique is unique {{in its ability to}} measure porosity of very thin films down to 10nm, its reproducibility and speed of measurement. Compared to traditional porosimeters, Ellipsometer porosimeters are well suited to very thin film <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> and <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distribution measurement. Film porosity is a key factor in silicon based technology using low-κ materials, organic industry (encapsulated organic light-emitting diodes) {{as well as in the}} coating industry using sol gel techniques.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} see its {{usefulness}} of porosimetry-based method for CNT agglomerates, we utilized (1) various types of CNT, (2) different forms of CNT agglomerates, (3) CNT dispersions made in different solvents, and (4) different kinds of dispersion methods. These parameters are important to control <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of CNT agglomerates. Firstly, various CNTs (Super Growth single-walled carbon nanotube (SG SWNT), HiPco SWNT, CoMoCAT SWNT, Bayern multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT), vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF)) were dispersed in solvent by a high-pressure jet mill homogenizer. The resulting suspensions were filtered to obtain Buckypapers, then their pores were characterized. The <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of these CNT agglomerates changed {{depending on the type}} of CNT (diameter, number of walls), by which we can classify diverse CNTs. Next, we investigated sparsely to densely packed forms of CNT agglomerates and found out that they are distinguishable by the different <b>pore</b> <b>sizes.</b> Furthermore, the correlation between CNT dispersibility in various solvents and <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of CNT agglomerates was demonstrated. When dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) known to disperse CNTs efficiently, the <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of CNT agglomerates became smaller than those from the poor solvents.|$|R
25|$|Fluids {{that would}} be damaged by heat, {{irradiation}} or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms. Some staphylococcal species have, however, {{been shown to be}} flexible enough to pass through 0.22 µm filters. In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> (20-50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.|$|E

However, the considerable volume change during repeated intercalation and depletion decreases their mechanical stability.

It is the most widely used adsorbent since most of its chemical (e.g. surface groups) and physical properties (e.g. <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distribution and surface area) can be tuned according to what is needed. Its usefulness also derives from its large micropore (and sometimes mesopore) volume and the resulting high surface area.|$|E

30|$|We {{propose a}} porosimetry-based method to {{characterize}} pores formed by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the CNT agglomerates for designing neat CNT-based materials and composites. CNT agglomerates contain pores between individual CNTs and/or CNT bundles (micropore <[*] 2  nm, mesopores 2 – 50  nm, and macropores >[*] 50  nm). We investigated these pores structured by CNTs with different diameters {{and number of}} walls, clarifying the broader size distribution and the larger volume with increased diameters and number of walls. Further, we demonstrated that CNT agglomerate structures with different bulk density were distinguished depending on the <b>pore</b> <b>sizes.</b> Our method also revealed that CNT dispersibility in solvent correlated with the <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of CNT agglomerates. By making use of these knowledge on tailorable pores for CNT agglomerates, we successfully found the correlation between electrical conductivity for CNT rubber composites and <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of CNT agglomerates. Therefore, our method can distinguish diverse CNT agglomerate structures and guide <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of CNT agglomerates to give high electrical conductivity of CNT rubber composites.|$|R

A borehole is drilled into rock and sedimentary strata into which {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} logging equipment is lowered. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of these boreholes is used to measure rock porosity, estimate permeability from <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distribution and identify pore fluids (water, oil and gas).

25|$|Chambers {{isolated}} by {{filters are}} proper tools for accurate determination of chemotactic behavior. The pioneer type of these chambers was constructed by Boyden. The motile cells are placed {{into the upper}} chamber, while fluid containing the test substance is filled into the lower one. The size of the motile cells to be investigated determines the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> of the filter; {{it is essential to}} choose a diameter which allows active transmigration. For modelling in vivo conditions, several protocols prefer coverage of filter with molecules of extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin etc.) Efficiency of the measurements was increased by development of multiwell chambers (e.g. NeuroProbe), where 24, 96, 384 samples are evaluated in parallel. Advantage of this variant is that several parallels are assayed in identical conditions.|$|E

Most articles about hydrogen storage in MOFs report hydrogen uptake capacity at a temperature of 77K and a pressure of 1 bar because these conditions are commonly available and the binding energy between hydrogen and the MOF at this temperature is large compared to the thermal vibration energy.
