5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> feed their chicks. A crèche may comprise {{up to several}} thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In Virginia, the Marcellus ore {{occasionally}} contained zinc, {{which produced}} a characteristic green flame in the furnace {{as it was}} consumed, but deposited a hard mass of impure zinc oxide known as cadmia, which built up over time {{near the top of}} the flue, and had to be removed <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> keep it unobstructed.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|Black Prince {{was again}} {{refitted}} in 1874–75, gaining a poop deck, and rejoined the Channel Fleet as flagship of Rear Admiral Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, second-in-command of the fleet. In 1878 Captain H.R.H. Duke of Edinburgh took command {{and the ship}} crossed the Atlantic {{to participate in the}} installation of a new Governor General of Canada. Upon her return Black Prince was placed in reserve at Devonport, and, reclassified as an armoured cruiser, she was reactivated <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> take part in annual fleet exercises. Black Prince was hulked in 1896 as a harbour training ship, stationed at Queenstown, and was renamed Emerald in 1903. In 1910 the ship was moved to Plymouth and renamed Impregnable III when she was assigned to the training school HMS Impregnable before she was sold for scrap on 21 February 1923.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E
5|$|In September 1988, {{the band}} were {{promoting}} their second album, Fingertips, when Paul's infant daughter died of SIDS. Although devastated, the group continued {{with a lower}} profile, and Anthony left to resume his university studies yet returned <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> record their later studio albums. Early in 1991 Anthony and Fatt founded a children's music group, The Wiggles. The Cockroaches alumni served as musical and performing support for the new group; John wrote much of their music, Paul became their manager, and Henry performed with them. The Wiggles used many of The Cockroaches' business practices and reworked some of their songs into the children's music genre.|$|E
5|$|Pandro Berman—who {{had filled}} in on three {{previous}} occasions—accepted {{the position of}} production chief on a noninterim basis. As it turned out, he would leave the job before the decade's turn, but his brief tenure resulted {{in some of the}} most notable films in studio history, including Gunga Din, with Grant and McLaglen; Love Affair, starring Dunne and Charles Boyer; and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (all 1939). Charles Laughton, who gave a now fabled performance as Quasimodo in the latter, returned <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> the studio, headlining six more RKO features. For Maureen O'Hara, who made her American screen debut in the film, it was the first of ten pictures she would make for RKO through 1952. After co-starring with Ginger Rogers for the ninth time in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), Fred Astaire departed the studio.|$|E

5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E

5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
5|$|Ross 695 is a {{red dwarf}} star located a mere 28.9 ± 0.6 light-years distant from Earth. At {{apparent}} magnitude 11.27, it is much too faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye. A small star, it has around 23% the mass and radius of the Sun, but only 0.7% its luminosity. VHS 1256-1257 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M7.5 located 41 ± 3 light-years distant from Earth. Around 73 times as massive as Jupiter, it is just under the mass boundary separating brown dwarves from stars. It has a companion that was first identified and documented by the 2MASS survey in 2015. It orbits at a distance of 102 ± 9 AU and has an estimated mass of approximately 11 times Jupiter's. DENIS-P J1228.2-1547 is a system composed of two brown dwarfs orbiting each other located 73 ± 3 light-years away from Earth. TV Corvi is a dwarf nova composed of a white dwarf and brown dwarf that orbit each other every 90 minutes. The system has a baseline magnitude of 17 that brightens <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> magnitude 12, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1931 and David Levy in 1990 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Weather Bureau {{office was}} moved to 2nd floor of the {{original}} Boise Air Terminal Building at Gowen Field on December 19, 1939. All operations at the U.S. Federal building and the old Boise Airport were transferred to the new office by February 20, 1940. In addition to the surface weather observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, Radiosonde observations which began September 1, 1939 at the downtown airport, were moved to a small building north of the Boise terminal building at Gowen Field in 1940. A new balloon inflation building was built east of the terminal in October 1954 with a dome on top to hold the signal receiving equipment. The building {{was moved to}} the NIFC campus in August 1969 where it is still being used today. The temperatures and precipitation were taken near the airport terminal building through 1969 though they were moved <b>periodically</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the growing airport. The wind instrument was moved several times through 1969 {{from the top of the}} United Hanger to the top of the terminal building to field northwest of the runway. The office remained on the 2nd floor of the terminal building until June 1969.|$|E
