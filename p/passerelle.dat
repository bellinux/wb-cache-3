25|$|Eight new bridges {{were put}} across the Seine during the Belle Époque. The Pont Sully, built in 1876, {{replaced}} two foot bridges that had connected the Île Saint-Louis to the Right and Left Bank. The Pont de Tolbiac {{was built in}} 1882 to connect the Left Bank with Bercy. The Pont Mirabeau, made famous in a poem by Apollinaire, was dedicated in 1895. Three bridges were built for the 1900 Exposition: the Pont Alexandre-III, dedicated by Czar Nicholas II of Russia in 1896, which connected the Left Bank with the grand exposition halls of the Grand Palais and Petit Palais; the <b>Passerelle</b> Debilly, a foot bridge that linked two sections of the Exposition; and a railroad bridge between Grenelle and Passy.

500|$|Since the {{institution}} {{is composed of}} national leaders, it gathers the executive power of the member states and has thus a great influence in high-profile policy areas as for example foreign policy. It also exercises powers of appointment, such as appointment of its own President, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the President of the European Central Bank. It proposes, to the European Parliament, a candidate for President of the European Commission. Moreover, the European Council influences police and justice planning, {{the composition of the}} Commission, matters relating to the organisation of the rotating Council presidency, the suspension of membership rights, and changing the voting systems through the <b>Passerelle</b> Clause. Although the European Council has no direct legislative power, under the [...] "emergency brake" [...] procedure, a state outvoted in the Council of Ministers may refer contentious legislation to the European Council. However, the state may still be outvoted in the European Council. Hence with powers over the supranational executive of the EU, in addition to its other powers, the European Council has been described by some as the Union's [...] "supreme political authority".|$|E

This line, had it opened, would have transformed Collinée into a major junction. The line crossed the Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest on the level at Jugon, following which it climbed in the direction of Dinan and passed through one of the few tunnels on the CdN network. At Dinan there was a bridge over the CF de l'Ouest's Dinan – La Brohinière line.
