40|$|Purpose – Our {{understanding}} of the drivers of information sharing in export supply chains (ESCs) in general, and in agri-food ESCs in particular, remains scarce. In response, the authors’ paper seeks to explore the drivers of information sharing between two key members of an agri-food ESC (<b>producers</b> and <b>exporters)</b> <b>in</b> Jordan and investigate the link to export performance. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use a two-stage qualitative approach. They initially interview seven ESC experts and a comparative case study across ten producer-exporter relationships follows. The latter involves 40 interviews (four per case) with <b>producers</b> and <b>exporters</b> <b>in</b> these relationships, supplemented with archival material and non-participant observation. Findings – Specific transaction, relationship and network drivers are found to support information sharing in these relationships and information sharing is linked to export performance. In higher performing cases, information sharing is triggered by integration-focused drivers, where {{the emphasis is on}} long-term and joint planning, based on sharing wider types of information. In lower performing cases, information sharing is triggered by more individualistic drivers and <b>producers</b> and <b>exporters</b> are sharing logistics-related information with a short-term perspective. Originality/value – This study extends current literature by identifying how different drivers influence information sharing in producer-exporter relationships and are linked to differences in export performance...|$|R

Apart from the philosophy under which these export support systems operate, they differ also in strategic orientation. A survey of stratified samples of <b>exporters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Canada</b> (271) and Austria (312) shows significant differences in perceived usefulness of services given similar exporters needs. Companies desire more tailored support as well as greater involvement of private sector institutions which are not currently providing export support. Overall, Austrian companies appear more inclined to use export support and generally seem more willing to acquire exporting know-how externally compared to Canadian firms. Conclusions are offered with respect to improving the respective export promotion systems. © 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 115 – 133...|$|R
