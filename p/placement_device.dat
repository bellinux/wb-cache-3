5000|$|Recently Colletti {{and colleagues}} {{observed}} {{high levels of}} open set speech recognition without visual cues in ABI patients who had lost their VIIIn from causes other than NF2. Many of these non-tumor ABI patients were able to achieve better than 50% recognition of sentences presented in quiet and could even achieve conversational use of the telephone. [...] This result suggested that the ABI device and electrode placement in the lateral recess of the IV ventricle was capable of providing good speech recognition. The limited speech understanding observed in NF2 ABI patients was thus thought {{to be due to}} negative factors related to NF2. However, new results in NF2 ABI patients have also showed excellent speech recognition, suggesting that the cause of improved speech understanding was not related to NF2 alone. Prior to surgery, some NF2 patients have normal hearing and speech recognition in the tumor ear even with a large tumor, suggesting that the presence of the tumor itself does not necessarily cause an auditory deficit. The loss of hearing and speech recognition in most NF2 patients {{may be due to the}} tumor interfering with the blood supply to the cochlea, VIIIn, and/or cochlear nucleus. In addition, physical compression by the tumor of the nerve and brainstem might impair neural excitability. The recently observed improvement in NF2 ABI speech recognition may be due to differences in patient etiology, surgical technique, damage to the brainstem before and during tumor removal, or electrode <b>placement,</b> <b>device</b> design, signal processing, or other factors.|$|E
40|$|During the {{placement}} of components in micro-assembly, high impact forces occur. The current approach is to reduce these impact forces by coupling the gripper to the drive unit of the <b>placement</b> <b>device</b> with 5 DOF, wherein the gripper that contacts the component has a relatively low mass. To prevent the gripper from bouncing back {{at the end of}} {{the placement}} collision a force must be exerted between gripper and drive unit, which can significantly increase the impact forces. A solution has been found to realise an adequate force build-up between gripper and drive unit such that a rebounce of the gripper is prevented without significantly increasing the impact forces. This solution can be implemented relatively easily by placing a spring between gripper and drive unit combined with a force limiter...|$|E
40|$|International audienceComposite {{materials}} are increasingly {{used in the}} demanding field of aeronautics. To meet this growing need, the company Coriolis Composites has developed an Automated Fibre <b>Placement</b> <b>device</b> already on the market. This process uses an industrial manip-ulator robot. This fibre placement task requires a com-pacting strength adapted to the material used. For the robot, the reference trajectories in position of each tape are prescribed off-line. However, accuracy problems of tape placement appear when off-line programmed robot trajectories. The proposed approach to address the accuracy problem and the manufacturing constraints is an interactive manufacturing scheme based on exterocep-tive sensor loops. This paper shows an interactive manufacturing approach based on force servoing to control the compacting strength and on visual servoing to control the lateral position of the tape {{in order to improve}} the fibre placement accuracy and then the quality of manufactured parts...|$|E

40|$|Background: Device {{therapy is}} an {{established}} therapy for preventing {{sudden cardiac death}} or managing refractory congestive heart failure in adults. However, it is performed less commonly in pediatric populations. This review aimed to examine the indications and problems associated with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantations in pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. Results: In a multicenter study in Japan, the cardiac condition of CHD patients improved by 83 % after CRT device implantation. The need for CRT devices {{is more common in}} children than in adults. After ICD implantation, 44 % of the patients experienced appropriate shocks, and epicardial lead implantation was performed in one-third of the patients. Nonendocardial electrode placement is mandatory for ICD implantation in small infants and patients with certain CHDs. Although inappropriate ICD discharges due to sinus tachycardia or other supraventricular tachycardias are common in children, the indication for ICD implantation may be higher than that reported in children. Conclusions: Despite the limited experience, limitations of device implantations owing {{to the size of the}} devices, and necessity for nonendocardial electrode <b>placement,</b> <b>device</b> implantations are required in more pediatric and CHD patients than expected...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{numerical}} control problems arising in a component insertion line for {{printed circuit board}} mounting. Such a line consists {{of a number of}} fully automated placement machines, connected by an automated, carrierless conveyor system. At each machine, the <b>placement</b> <b>device</b> consists of an arm equipped with a number of placement heads. Each head may serve certain component types; there is some freedom in the choice of equipment for each head. Components are supplied to each machine by tape feeders (each containing components of only one type) which are placed at certain feeder positions along the machine. Before actually operating such a line, a careful production preparation phase has to be completed, specifying for each printed circuit board type the exact way in which such a board should be mounted. Problems arising in this production preparation phase include: the choice of heads to be mounted on the placement arm of each machine, the choice of components to be placed at each machine (workload balancing), an assignment of feeders to feeder positions on each machine, clustering of components to be placed in one pick-and-place move (the heads mounted on one arm move simultaneously), and the sequencing of component insertions at one machine. Formulations and solutions for all these problems are given.

40|$|CFD {{analysis}} is presented of the mixing characteristics {{and performance of}} three fuel injectors at hypervelocity flow conditions. The calculations were carried out using the VULCAN-CFD solver and Reynolds-Averaged Simulations (RAS). The high Mach number flow conditions match those proposed for the planned experiments conducted {{as a part of}} the Enhanced Injection and Mixing Project (EIMP) at the NASA Langley Research Center. The EIMP aims to investigate scramjet fuel injection and mixing physics, improve the understanding of underlying physical processes, and develop enhancement strategies and functional relationships relevant to flight Mach numbers greater than eight. Because of the high Mach number flow considered, the injectors consist of a fuel <b>placement</b> <b>device,</b> a strut; and a fluidic vortical mixer, a ramp. These devices accomplish the necessary task of distributing and mixing fuel into the supersonic cross-flow albeit via different strategies. Both of these devices were previously studied at lower flight Mach numbers where they exhibited promising performance in terms of mixing efficiency and total pressure recovery. For comparison, a flush-wall injector is also included. This type of injector generally represents the simplest method of introducing fuel into a scramjet combustor, however, at high flight Mach number conditions, the dynamic pressure needed to induce sufficient fuel penetration may be difficult to achieve along with other requirements such as achieving desired levels of fuel-to-air mixing at the required equivalence ratio. The three injectors represent the baseline configurations planned for the experiments. The current work discusses the mixing flow field behavior and differences among the three fuel injectors, mixing performance as described by the mixing efficiency and the total pressure recovery, and performance considerations based on the thrust potential...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} study articulation between Oregon secondary mathematics programs and college mathematics at Oregon State University. Three main facets of the problem were studied: 1. The relationship of several factors to the CEEB Level I Mathematics Achievement Test score. 2. The feasibility of a discriminant function {{as an aid to}} mathematics placement at the college level. 3. Courses and content in upper-level mathematics programs in Oregon secondary schools. A questionnaire requesting information on upper-level mathematics programs was sent to 234 Oregon public and private secondary schools. Returns were received from 198 schools, and these were summarized with respect to course titles, textbooks, and topics reported for the various courses. Student records were used to obtain data on the factors of sex, high school grade point average, size of school attended, number of grades in the school, level of mathematics reached, and high school mathematics grade point average. In addition, SAT-M, SAT- V, CEEB-EN, and CEEB Level I scores were taken from the records, Complete information was available for 2355 students graduating from Oregon secondary schools in 1966 and entering Oregon State University as members of the 1966 - 67 freshman class. A multiple-regression analysis was used to study the relationship of the other nine factors to the CEEB Level I Test score, In addition, the possible effectiveness of the SAT - -M and other factors as placement devices for college freshman mathematics was compared with the results obtained through current use of the CEEB Level I Test. Discriminant function analysis was conducted with 14 pairs of dichotomous groups to investigate the effectiveness of combinations of the various factors in identifying members of each group. Grouping was based upon the college mathematics course taken and the grade received. One three-group discriminant function analysis was done to examine the possible value of a single computer program utilizing the best combination of factors for placement into the freshman mathematics program at Oregon State University. The following findings were a result of this investigation: 1. The CEEB Level I Test measures something in addition to that measured by the SAT-M and other factors used in this investigation. 2. The CEEB Level I Test is an effective <b>placement</b> <b>device</b> when used with a cutoff score system despite its limitations in identifying relatively large groups of weak students. 3. The SAT-M Test shows promise of being as effective an instrument in mathematics placement as the CEEB Level I Test. 4. The discriminant function technique was approximately 70 percent effective in identifying members of the various groups. As such, it offers promise of becoming an effective placement instrument. 5. The use of additional factors increases the power of the discriminant function; after a certain point, the results may not justify the effort. 6. Most Oregon secondary students have upper-level mathematics courses available to them. 7, Oregon secondary mathematics courses have more in common than the variety of course titles and textbooks suggest. 8. Calculus courses in Oregon secondary schools serve only one-half of one percent of the twelfth grade students and do not represent the typical fifth-level mathematics program. 9. Students entering Oregon. State University with fifth-level backgrounds other than calculus do better in the first term of calculus.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPatients {{in acute}} {{cardiogenic}} shock may require placement of left ventricular assist devices before undergoing standard pretransplant evaluations. This practice raises ethical and logistic concerns and has {{led us to}} investigate the short- and long-term outcomes for this patient population. Methods and resultsWe examined our adult bridge-to-transplant left ventricular assist device population over a 6 -year period to characterize those patients with acute cardiogenic shock who received left ventricular assist devices on an emergency basis (ie, <b>placement</b> of a <b>device</b> within 24 hours of being listed for cardiac transplantation). Outcomes before and after transplant were {{compared with those of}} candidates with nonemergency evaluations by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Fisher exact test where appropriate. Of the 115 patients who required left ventricular assist device support, 73 (63 %) patients required emergency placement; 70 % of these patients survived to transplant compared with 83 % of those with nonurgent device implantation (not statistically significant). Posttransplant survival curves were similar for patients with emergency <b>device</b> <b>placement</b> and those with nonurgent placement (not statistically significant). Twenty-two patients having emergency <b>device</b> <b>placement</b> did not undergo heart transplantation because of multisystem organ failure (14), device support withdrawal from irreversible neurologic injury (4), device or technical problems (2), and left ventricular assist device explant due to myocardial recovery (2). ConclusionsAt our institution, the majority of left ventricular assist devices are placed on an emergency basis. Few of these patients require discontinuation of device support due to undetected conditions during abbreviated preoperative evaluation.

40|$|AbstractCongenital heart defects such as Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), {{which are}} the most common ones, are treated with {{minimally}} invasive surgery using occlusion devices. Newer devices have been proposed on micro- and nano-materials. To improve efficiency and to reduce failure of this mode of treatment, it is important to simulate blood flow through defect before and after <b>placement</b> of <b>device</b> and calculate shunting of blood volume. We present here blood flow through atria and aorta in normal and defect conditions. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used for modeling and simulation using ANSYS 14. 5. Blood is simulated as Newtonian and incompressible with pulsatile nature. The model of upper two chambers of heart is modeled with and without ASD. The simulation showed shunting from left atrium to right atrium in case of ASD and volume of shunted blood is calculated with variation in shape and size of defect. PDA is modeled as tube between pulmonary artery and aorta, and shunting is calculated with variation in shape and size of PDA. The simulation can be extended further by simulating <b>placement</b> of <b>device</b> in defect and evaluating its efficiency in terms of occluding the defect.
