40|$|Archaeopteryx {{has been}} {{regarded}} as an icon of evolution ever since its discovery from the Late Jurassic limestone deposits of solnhofen, Germany in 1861. Here we report the first evidence of colour from Archaeopteryx based on fossilized colour-imparting melanosomes discovered in this isolated feather specimen. using a phylogenetically diverse database of extant bird feathers, statistical analysis of melanosome morphology predicts that the original colour of this Archaeopteryx feather was black, with 95 % probability. Furthermore, reexamination of the feather’s morphology leads us to interpret it as an upper <b>primary</b> <b>covert,</b> contrary to previous interpretations. Additional findings reveal that the specimen is preserved as an organosulphur residue, and that barbule ultrastructure identical to that of modern bird feathers had evolved {{as early as the}} Jurassic.

In 1911, Réunion resident Eugène Jacob de Cordemoy recalled his observations of the bird about 50years before, suggesting that only males had a white crest, but this is thought to be incorrect. A presumed female (MNHN 2000-756) in the Paris museum appears to have a smaller crest, a smaller and less-curved beak, and smaller <b>primary</b> <b>coverts.</b> A juvenile specimen has a smaller crest and <b>primary</b> <b>coverts,</b> with a brown wash instead of ash grey on the crest, lore, and superciliary stripe, and a light-brown (instead of ash-brown) back.

The chin, throat, chest, and belly can appear to be white or a pale-buffy white, although the chest and belly contain keenly blackish oval shapes. The underwing is buffy-white. The iris is typically either orange or orange-yellow, with a dull brown bill with its base of the lower mandible appear to be pinkish grey. T. c. curvirostre is similar with an exception to being smaller, darker, and have a red-tinged appearance with buffy-white underparts.|$|R
50|$|The plumage of the Indian bush lark is {{pale and}} it has a cheek patch {{completely}} bounded by a white supercilium and post-auricular border. The crown and upper-parts are heavily streaked. The pale underparts have large spots on the breast. Most of its wing coverts, tertials and central tail feathers have pale centres. The <b>primary</b> <b>coverts</b> look all brown. The rufous wing bars are diagnostic but care must be taken not to confuse the bird with Jerdon's bush lark in the central Western Ghats and country around where their ranges overlap. Jerdon's bush lark is darker with more rufous on the wings.|$|R

The underwing <b>primary</b> <b>coverts</b> are red tipped yellow. A prominent white eye ring gives this species its name. In addition to the nominate, there are two very similar subspecies, callogenys and nicefori, although the validity of the latter, based on a single specimen, is questionable. Juveniles have little or no red and yellow in their plumage.|$|R

The <b>primary</b> <b>coverts</b> are tipped cinnamon and the secondary and tertiary coverts are black with white tips on the upperwing; the underwing coverts are all grey. As in many antbirds, there is a white patch between the shoulders; it has some black specks around it. The iris is red, the bill black, and the feet are lead-grey.|$|R
50|$|This parrot {{is smaller}} than the yellow-billed amazon and {{measures}} between 10.5 and 11.5 in. In males, the bill is very dark grey, almost black, becoming paler towards the base. The cere is very dark grey, as is the skin around the eyes, and the iris is dark brown. This bird's plumage is predominantly green, paler and more yellowish on the underparts. The feathers of the neck are edged with dusky black. Ear-coverts are blackish and <b>primary</b> <b>coverts</b> are red. <b>Primaries</b> are violet-blue and black, secondaries are blue at the tips, becoming green towards the base.

50|$|Ranging from 30 to 36 cm in length, {{it is one}} of the {{smallest}} species of duck. It has a 48 to 60 cm wingspan. It has a small bill and compact form. The breeding male has a predominantly dark green back, neck and crown, white cheeks and dark green, pale grey and white scalloped underparts. The tail and primary flight feathers and <b>primary</b> <b>coverts</b> are black, while the secondary flight feathers are white. The secondary coverts are a dark iridescent green. This iridescence is lost outside of the breeding season and the plumage is duller. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, the female has a barred rather than green neck and otherwise resembles the non-breeding male. Immature birds are duller, and have mottled dark brown heads.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue-headed}} macaw is 41 cm (16 in) long. It has mainly green plumage (often tinged olive, esp. below) with the head, flight feathers and <b>primary</b> <b>coverts</b> blue.

The undertail and underwing are greenish-yellow {{similar to that of}} several other small macaws (e.g. red-bellied and golden-collared macaw). The medium-sized bill is pale greyish-horn with a black base (extent varies, but upper mandible in adults typically appears mainly pale). The iris is whitish with a narrow, often barely visible, maroon eye-ring. Unlike most other macaws, the facial skin and lores are dark greyish. The legs are dull pinkish. Juveniles resemble adults, but with the entire bill black, greyer legs, darker iris and the facial skin and lores white.|$|R
