50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that {{business}} and economic competition in most countries is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the case with a government monopoly or a government-granted monopoly. Tariffs, subsidies or other protectionist measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic policy, <b>pure</b> <b>competition</b> is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by competition policy and competition law. Another component of these activities is the discovery process, with instances of higher government regulations typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched.|$|E
5000|$|The best-known of the {{resulting}} models, the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem (H-O) depends upon the assumptions of no international differences of technology, productivity, or consumer preferences; no obstacles to <b>pure</b> <b>competition</b> or free trade and no scale economies. On those assumptions, it derives {{a model of the}} trade patterns that would arise solely from international differences in the relative abundance of labour and capital (referred to as factor endowments). The resulting theorem states that, on those assumptions, a country with a relative abundance of capital would export capital-intensive products and import labour-intensive products. The theorem proved to be of very limited predictive value, as was demonstrated by what {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Leontief Paradox" [...] (the discovery that, despite its capital-rich factor endowment, America was exporting labour-intensive products and importing capital-intensive products) Nevertheless, the theoretical techniques (and many of the assumptions) used in deriving the H-O model were subsequently used to derive further theorems.|$|E
40|$|In our {{paper we}} show that when {{countries}} compete in taxes and infrastructures, coordination through a uniform tax rate or a minimum rate does not necessarily create the welfare effects observed under <b>pure</b> tax <b>competition.</b> The divergence is even worse when the competing jurisdictions differ {{in the quality of}} their institutions. If tax revenue is used to gauge the desirability of coordination, our model shows that imposing a uniform tax rate is Pareto-inferior to the non cooperative equilibrium when countries compete in taxes and infrastructures.

5000|$|This view on fair wages {{changed in}} 1886: [...] "Clark himself, {{it will be}} remembered has song down the doom of {{competition}} in The Philosophy of Wealth. But now â€¦ he has reversed his position and builds up a body of economic laws based on competition" [...] writes Homan (1928) and Everett (1946) finds: [...] "Soon after writing The Philosophy of Wealth, however, Clark started to make defences for the competitive system. What caused the change is unknown. This much we can say. By the time he wrote The Distribution of Wealth {{he was convinced that}} <b>pure</b> <b>competition</b> was the natural and normal law by which the economic order obtained justice." [...] One cause that prompted this reorientation could be the Haymarket Riot (1886) in Chicago when some strikers were shot and others hanged. In the US it resulted in a cleansing of higher education from socialist reformers and the ruin of the Knights of Labor.|$|E
50|$|More of a family/children's event than a <b>pure</b> <b>competition,</b> night {{shooting}} {{consists of}} archers {{going out on}} a short, one round course using flashlights to light their way through the course and use the lights to shine the targets which often have reflective tape or paint on them. The course, laid out and roped off in advance before dark, is designed to keep all participants safe. The distances to the targets are very short, often not more than twenty yards (18.28 metres) and the targets are typically quite large in size. In some cases there can be two shooting distance markers: a far one for adults, and a short one for children; the rules do allow for children to move closer if necessary in order to shoot. The short shooting distances are necessary since, at night, complete misses would mean the loss of an arrow(s). Though there is no inherent practical purposes for night shooting, it is just a different form of competition that is enjoyably fun. There are two variants: the Monster Shoot and the Raccoon Shoot.|$|E
50|$|Foucault {{turns his}} {{attention}} to ordoliberalism's view on social policy and how this can be woven into society's political power which differentates from Adam Smith's liberalism two centuries earlier. This problem was faced head on by ordoliberalism; how can the overall exercise of political power be modeled {{on the principles of}} a market economy? To accomplish this the old version of classic liberalism had to be subjected to a whole series of modifications. The first set of transformations was the dissociation of the market economy from the political principle of laissez-faire, this uncoupling of the market and laissez-faire was replaced with, not abandon by a theory of <b>pure</b> <b>competition</b> which produced a formal structure and formal properties which could lay the fundamental principle of the compective structure that assured economic regulation through the price mechanism. This is a break from traditional liberalism principles.Founded by traditional liberals such as Walter Lippmann and expressed by many other traditional liberals such as Jacques Rueff, Wilhelm RÃ¶pke, Alexander RÃ¼stow, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Marjolin, Ludwig von Mises, and their intermediaries and a non-economist, but however, was highly influential, according to Foucault Raymond Aron.|$|E
40|$|In the {{original}} model of <b>pure</b> price <b>competition,</b> due to Joseph Bertrand (1883), firms have linear cost functions. For {{any number of}} identical such price-setting firms, this results in the perfectly competitive outcome; the equilibrium price equal the firms' (constant) marginal cost. This paper provides a generalization of Bertrand's model from linear to convex cost functions. I analyze <b>pure</b> price <b>competition</b> both in a static setting - where the firms interact {{once and for all}} - and in dynamic setting - where they interact repeatedly over an indefinite future. Sufficient conditions are given for the existence of Nash equilibrium in the static setting and for subgame perfect equilibrium in the dynamic setting. These equilibrium sets are characterized, and it is shown that there typically exists a whole interval of Nash equilibrium prices in the static setting and subgame perfect equilibria in the dynamic setting. It is shown that firms may earn sizable profits and that their equilibrium profits may increase if their production costs go up...|$|R

Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident in the World economy, where countries the US, Japan, the constituents of the European Union, China and the East Asian Tigers each try to outdo the other in the quest for economic supremacy in the global market, harkening to the concept of Kiasuism. Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For example, East Asian economies like Singapore, Japan, and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector, and by implementing programmes such as gifted education, which some detractors criticise as indicative of academic elitism.|$|E
