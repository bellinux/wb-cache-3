A year later, the economy had improved, but the <b>Council's</b> <b>placements</b> were mainly in Ontario and Quebec, where Canada's industry was concentrated.|$|R
50|$|The {{first sign}} of {{the revival of the}} dispute was at the Council of Tours, called in 1163 by Pope Alexander III. While there, Roger and Becket disputed over the {{placement}} of their seats in the council. Roger argued, that based on Gregory the Great's plan that primacy should go to the archbishop who had been consecrated first, he had the right to the more honourable <b>placement</b> at the <b>council.</b> Eventually, Alexander placed them both on equal terms, but not before the council spent three days listening to the claims and counter-claims, as well as Roger relating the whole history of the dispute. In 1164 Alexander gave Roger a papal legateship, but excluded Becket from its jurisdiction. The pope did, however, decline to declare that Canterbury had a primacy in England. Alexander on 8 April 1166 confirmed Canterbury's primacy, but this became less important than the grant of a legateship on 24 April to Becket. This grant, though, did not cover the diocese of York, which was specifically prohibited.|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{explore the}} {{perceptions}} of BN student nurses regarding the influence of preceptors on their clinical learning Research question What helps or hinders BN students’ learning from preceptors during clinical <b>placements?</b> The Nursing <b>Council</b> of New Zealand education standards stipulate that students completing a programme of study leading to registration as registered nurses (RNs) must complete between 1100 - 1500 clinical hours. This occurs in healthcare settings where students work alongside RNs. Known as preceptors, these RNs supervise, teach and sometjmes assess students. Within these preceptor-student interactions, the future of nursing is co-created as students begin {{to develop their own}} professional identities. Previous research has determined that the student-preceptor relationship is complex and challeng­ing on many levels for both parties. In New Zealand in particular, little is known about how students manage to successfully achieve their clinical competencies in environments that are not always conducive to their learning. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore student nurse perceptions of the influences of pre­ceptors during clinical placements. Twenty-three third year students from a New Zealand nursing school participated during their transition semesters prior to the Nursing Council State Final Ex­amination. Data gathered from focus groups and individual interviews were analysed using a general inductive approach (Thomas, 2006). The themes identified were 'the Learning Environment; 'The Student-Preceptor Relationship' and 'Managing the Challenges'. Knowledge generated by this study adds breadth and depth to what is already known about the student-preceptor relationship and has potential benefits for students, nursing schools and health­care facilities which provide clinical experience for students. It implies that knowing informs what may be done in order to nurture the very foundation of nursing's future - today's student nurses...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, teacher {{education}} has drawn greater attention from international and European policy makers (Caena, 2014; European Commission, EACEA, & Eurydice, 2015; OECD, 2005). In Ireland policy directives and guidelines (DES, 2011; Teaching Council, 2011 b; 2011 c; 2011 d; 2013) {{have begun to}} blur the established boundaries between stakeholders in schools and higher education institutions (HEI). Initial {{teacher education}} (ITE) programmes have been reconceptualised and the time student teachers spend on placement has been extended. These changes require greater co-operation between multiple actors and increased involvement by school-based stakeholders in <b>placement</b> practices (Teaching <b>Council,</b> 2013). This study drew {{on the concept of}} communities of practice (Wenger, 1998), which provided a theoretical framework to establish the collaboration needed for HEI and school-based stakeholders to develop and sustain new models of partnership. By examining various partnership models, the seemingly generic term of school-university partnership (SUP) was problematised. This study set out to investigate the perspectives of post-primary school management and co-operating teachers concerning a) recent changes to school placement, within the broader context of emerging SUPs; and b) the formalisation of their responsibilities vis-à-vis ITE. This mixed methods study comprised a survey within a multiple case study. The research design was based on the epistemological position of pragmatism and drew on both post-positivist and interpretive theoretical stances as necessary. Findings suggest a willingness by school-based stakeholders to engage in collaborative partnerships with HEIs, this willingness is tempered however by a sense of frustration with a perceived lack of support being offered to schools. Moving beyond managerial challenges, infrastructural realities and cultural restraints, findings indicate that development of shared understandings around the concept of partnership is required. This study will potentially stimulate reflection on, critique of and dialogue around the pedagogy of SUPs and the role of school-based stakeholders in ITE in Ireland. ...|$|R
