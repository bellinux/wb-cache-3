5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 2015, {{debate over}} venues and <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> {{dismissals}} ensued. Ultimately, the case moved to Nevada federal courts, where Zuffa was denied its motion to stay discovery for 15 {{years of its}} financial records.|$|E
25|$|Possibly a {{licensed}} pilot, {{a man with}} his name was registered as having trained at the Spartan Aeronautics School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, although the school denies that he ever attended, indicating a <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity.|$|E

25|$|In the 1998 film Stigmata, {{a priest}} named Father Kiernan, while {{investigating}} a <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of stigmata suffered {{by a woman}} played by Patricia Arquette, mentions Padre Pio and wrongly claims he only had two wounds {{in a conversation with}} her, during which a photo of Padre Pio as a young man is shown on screen.|$|E
25|$|This {{iconographic}} type– {{very often}} represented among the Nuragic bronze figurines– {{has been reported}} only twice among the Mont'e Prama statues, plus a third <b>possible</b> <b>case,</b> of which only one is in a good state of preservation. However, a reassembled shield, not assigned {{to any of the}} former three specimens, and numerous other fragments of a shield and (possibly) of a torso, suggest that the number of warriors was larger.|$|E
25|$|The second method {{improves}} on {{the first}} by having investigators examine student or patient records looking for probable cases, to catch cases {{that have not been}} identified yet. The third method, which is arguably the best, screens a large sample of an entire community to identify possible cases, and then evaluates each <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> in more detail with standard diagnostic procedures. This last method typically produces the most reliable, and the highest, prevalence estimates.|$|E

25|$|In Game 4 of the 1978 World Series, another <b>possible</b> <b>case,</b> also uncalled, of {{offensive}} interference happened when New York Yankees outfielder Reggie Jackson, on first base, {{stayed in the}} baseline when, after forcing him out at second base, Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Bill Russell threw to first base to try to complete a double play. Jackson let the ball hit him, but batter Lou Pinella was not called out as Jackson was not charged with interference.|$|E
25|$|Baldness {{is not a}} trait {{unique to}} human beings. One <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> study is the maneless male Tsavo lion. The Tsavo lions' prides are unique in that they {{frequently}} have only a single male lion with usually seven or eight adult females, as opposed to four females in other lion prides. Tsavo males may have heightened levels of testosterone, which could explain their reputation for aggression and dominance, indicating that lack of mane may at one time have had an alpha correlation.|$|E
25|$|In endemic areas, people (rice-paddy {{farmers in}} particular) are warned to avoid contact with soil, mud, and surface water where <b>possible.</b> <b>Case</b> {{clusters}} {{have been described}} following flooding and cyclones and probably relate to exposure. Other case clusters have related to contamination of drinking water supplies. Populations at risk include patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, chronic lung disease, or an immune deficiency of any kind. The effectiveness of measures to reduce exposure to the causative organism have not been established. A vaccine is not yet available.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jimmy Savile scandal, Newsnight investigated the North Wales child abuse scandal. On 2 November 2012, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home was reported on Newsnight claiming that a prominent, but unnamed, former Conservative politician had sexually abused him during the 1970s. The rumour was spread by users of Twitter and other social media which identified the politician. After The Guardian reported a <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity, Lord McAlpine issued a strong denial that he was in any way involved, asserting that the allegations were wholly false and seriously defamatory. The accuser unreservedly apologised, admitting that, {{as soon as he saw}} a photograph of the individual, he realised he had been mistaken. The BBC also apologised.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which {{believed}} that Madden was using the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA; the primary federal law governing labor relations in the U.S.) and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The NLRB and NLRA were under intense pressure from employers, the press, Congressional Republicans, and conservative Democrats. From {{the time it was}} established in August 1935, management lawyers had challenged the constitutionality of the NLRA and the authority of the NLRB to act. The Justice Department and NLRB legal staff wanted the Supreme Court to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA. But the Board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's Lochner era legal philosophy made it unlikely that the Court would uphold the Act. Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> could be brought to the Court. The Supreme Court eventually upheld the NLRA in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, 301 U.S. 1 (1937), and Madden personally argued the case (along with NLRB General Counsel Charles H. Fahy and Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr., a special assistant {{in the office of the}} United States Solicitor General) before the Court. The ruling marked the Court's abandonment of Lochner era jurisprudence and led to a series of cases upholding New Deal legislation.|$|E
500|$|Breeding in the bluespotted ribbontail ray occurs {{from late}} spring to summer; the male follows the female and nips at her disc, {{eventually}} biting and holding onto her for copulation. There {{is also a}} documented instance of a male holding onto the disc of a smaller male bluespotted stingray (Dasyatis kuhlii), in a <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity. Adult males have been observed gathering in shallow water, which may relate to reproduction. Like other stingrays, this species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are initially sustained by yolk, which later in development is supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk", containing mucus, fat, and proteins) produced by the mother. The gestation period is uncertain, but {{is thought to be}} between four and twelve months long. Females bear litters of up to seven young, each a miniature version of the adult measuring around [...] across. Males attain sexual maturity at a disc width of the maturation size of females is unknown.|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he {{sit down with the}} mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E

2500|$|A draft report, {{published}} on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, {{saying that the}} long-term health effects on the population were still unknown {{and that there was}} insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination. Woods called for further studies and said: [...] "We will be putting the strongest <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside." ...|$|E

2500|$|In one <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> {{indicative}} of the law related to parenting and polyamory in the United States, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court in 2006 voted 5–1 that a father in a custody case {{had the right to}} teach his child (age 13) about polygamy (and hence possibly by implication about other multiple partner relationships), and that this right [...] "trumped" [...] the anti-bigamy and other laws that might apply and was not deemed inherently harmful to the child. (Note: this decision was made in the context of religious freedom, but religious freedom would not apply if there was harm to the child.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Hardin's efforts, however, {{are still}} {{resisted}} by the Board of Trustees and its chairman, Dr. Lewis Pirenne. To remove this obstacle, Hardin and his chief advisor, Yohan Lee, plan a [...] "coup d'état" [...] designed {{to remove the}} Board of Trustees from its politically powerful position {{on the same day}} that, in the city's Time Vault, a holographic recording of Hari Seldon is programmed to play. The recording will contain psychohistoric proof of Hardin's success or failure; Hardin realizes that his coup is a great gamble due to the <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> that his beliefs are incompatible with Seldon's original goals.|$|E
2500|$|NASA jokingly {{measures}} SAS {{using the}} [...] "Garn scale", named for United States Senator Jake Garn, whose sickness during STS-51-D {{was the worst}} on record. Accordingly, one [...] "Garn" [...] {{is equivalent to the}} most severe <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of space sickness. By studying how changes can affect balance in the human body—involving the senses, the brain, the inner ear, and blood pressure—NASA hopes to develop treatments that can be used on Earth and in space to correct balance disorders. Until then, astronauts rely on medication, such as midodrine and dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patches, as required (such as when space suits are worn, because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal).|$|E
