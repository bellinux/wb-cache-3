40|$|Finds of {{metallic}} copper {{from various}} primary smelting {{sites in the}} Sia valley in Cyprus have been analysed by ICP-OES for their composition and by optical and electron microscopy for metallography. Results show a characteristic <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> {{for each of the}} sites examined which allow an assignment to specific types of ore body and geological matrix. Different zones of the Cyprus Ophiolite Complex were exploited in different periods in antiquity, but these results show different types could be exploited contemporaneously within a specific period, especially during the first millennium BC. One location in this area, Agia Varvara-Almyras, an Iron Age copper smelting site with the only complete chain of operation recorded in ancient Cypriote metallurgy, is used to show how analytical work can guide future field surveys to find ancient furnaces, slag heaps and mines. The ultimate goal of the project is to extend it to reconstruct the complete history of copper production in a well-defined mining district over the last 4000 years...|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{reproducing}} experimental results in <b>impurity</b> compression <b>of</b> Ar, {{as well as the}} screening of recycling and non-recycling impurities from reaching the core plasma. As part of the study the code was upgraded in order to track the impurity flow from source till it reaches the core, include the energy dependence on recycled impurity atoms, and allow for more realistic impurity recycling in the SOL. This added capability allows the determination of which source locations are dominant in determining the core impurity level, where they cross the separatrix into the core and where they leave the core. The modeling reproduces within a factor of 2 the experimentally observed compression of Ar in the divertor of Alcator C-Mod. In addition it was found that under attached conditions recycling at the outer plasma edge (limiters located there) was the dominant source of Ar ions reaching the core (over 60 %). For detached conditions divertor recycling replaces the outer edge in supplying the majority of Ar ions reaching the core. (cont.) There appear to be two general flow <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> through the core plasma: Outboard launched impurities enter the core at the outside edge and flow out of the core on the inboard edge; Divertor launched impurities enter the core just outboard of the x-point and return to the divertor just inboard of the x-point. The study <b>of</b> non-recycling <b>impurities</b> was also carried out and {{it was found that the}} penetration factor (PF) for outboard-launched impurities (Carbon was used as the prototype) were a factor of 3 times more likely to reach the core than inboard-launched impurities (experimental result gave the ratio as 20). Increasing the background SOL plasma flow to the experimental levels doubles the model ratio and other factors capable of reducing the discrepancy are studied. Thus the experimental poloidal variation in PF is qualitatively reproduced. Values of PF for recycling impurities (a global quantity) matched the experimental magnitudes when experimental values for SOL flow were used. by Taekyun Chung. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Because of the favorable segregation <b>of</b> some <b>impurities</b> {{to the surface of}} the material, a very small concentration <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> in the bulk of the sample can lead to a very significant coverage <b>of</b> the <b>impurity</b> on a cleaved surface of the sample. In applications where an ultra-pure surface is needed (for example, in some nanotechnology applications), the segregation <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> to surfaces requires a much higher purity of bulk material than would be needed if segregation effects didnâ€™t exist. The following figure illustrates this concept with two cases in which the total fraction <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms is 0.25 (25 impurity atoms in 100 total).

In the representation to the right, however, the same number <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms are shown segregated on the surface, so that an observation of the surface composition would yield a much higher impurity fraction (in this case, about 0.69). In fact, in this example, were impurities to completely segregate to the surface, an <b>impurity</b> fraction <b>of</b> just 0.36 could completely cover the surface of the material.
