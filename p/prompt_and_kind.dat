Thank {{you for your}} <b>prompt</b> <b>and</b> <b>kind</b> answer, little as I {{deserved}} it, though I hope to show you I was less undeserving than I seemed. But just might I delete two words in your testimonial? The two words [...] "and legal" [...] were unfortunately winged by chance against my weakest spot, and would go far to damn me.|$|E

40|$|A {{functional}} analysis of prosociality considers how predispositions for prosocial behavior <b>prompt,</b> reinforce, <b>and</b> propagate <b>kind</b> {{behaviors in the}} real world. To {{examine the effects of}} practicing, receiving, and observing everyday prosociality-as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects-we randomly assigned employees in a Spanish corporate workplace (N = 111) to be Givers, Receivers, and Controls. Givers practiced 5 acts of kindness for a personalized list of Receivers over 4 weeks. We found that Givers and Receivers mutually benefited in well-being in both the short-term (e. g., on weekly measures of competence and autonomy) and the long-term (e. g., Receivers became happier after 2 months, and Givers became less depressed and more satisfied with their lives and jobs). In addition, Givers' prosocial acts inspired others to act: Receivers paid their acts of kindness forward with 278 % more prosocial behaviors than Controls. Our results reveal that practicing everyday prosociality is both emotionally reinforcing and contagious (inspiring kindness and generating hedonic rewards in others) and that receiving everyday prosociality is an unequivocally positive experience (which may further reinforce Givers' actions). Prosociality's benefits shed light on its surprising ubiquity in humanity compared with our closest evolutionary cousins. (PsycINFO Database Recor...|$|R
40|$|For several reasons, {{not least}} because of the {{information}} and communica-tions technological revolution, there is an increasing need for deep qualita-tive transformation in business activities involving {{the development and implementation}} of entirely new concepts. Traditionally this kind of change process has involved the top-down imposition of a pre-existing new model. This approach does not stimulate the local initiative or creative experimentation needed for carrying out complex transformations, howe-ver. There is therefore a need for an intervention method that allows for practitioners not only to apply a given new concept in transforming their activity, but also to analyze the need for change and to develop and imple-ment a new concept in order to meet current challenges. This calls for the breaking away from given frames of action and the taking of initiatives to transform them collaboratively. The Change Laboratory is an intervention method specifically designed for <b>prompting</b> <b>and</b> supporting this <b>kind</b> of shared transformative agency. Many steps have to be taken before a work community evolves form independently acting individuals into a collective subject of sustained transformation effort. This article describes some of the major dilemmas involved in building shared transformative agency on the basis of experience in carrying out Change Laboratory interventions in various organizations. The possibility of creating cross- organizational col-laboration in developing a new concept for a certain type of activity is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In popular cinema, {{paranoia}} {{and conspiracy}} plots often {{go hand in}} hand with questions of technological innovation. For example, A Scanner Darkly (Richard Linklater, US 2006) combines issues such as audiovisual surveillance, conspiracy, and manipulation without disambiguating between paranoid delusion and conventional causality. By foregrounding the possibility of all audiovisual media to colour our perceptions, the film emphasises its own functioning as a mediated and synthetic presentation of a story. Moreover, its mode of presentation mimics the themes of delusion, conspiracy, blurred boundaries, and unfixed identities, drawing the spectator fully into its state of confusion. Films such as A Scanner Darkly signal a current shift in narrative cinema, <b>and</b> <b>prompt</b> a <b>kind</b> of spectator-engagement much in line with posthumanist views on subjectivity. Rather than pertaining to traditional notions of illusionism and suspension of disbelief, these "mind-game films" (Thomas Elsaesser) employ unreliability and spectacle for the creation of unstable and synthetic storyworlds. While firmly embedded in the institution of narrative fiction cinema, A Scanner Darkly presents novel and significant modes of signification and agency (even if limited or dystopian), both for those "trapped" within its filmic story and for the spectators on its other end...|$|R

40|$|Students {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) often lack independent task initiation skills, have difficulty staying {{actively engaged in}} academic tasks, <b>and</b> may require <b>prompting</b> to complete <b>and</b> transition between tasks or activities. In response to these difficulties, teachers often provide additional attention to students {{in the form of}} frequent verbal <b>prompts</b> <b>and</b> individual support. Unfortunately, these instructional strategies may have negative academic and social implications as students become dependent on adults for <b>prompts</b> <b>and</b> social supports. This article highlights the importance of fostering student independence for students with ASD and presents three evidence-based strategies to improve student task engagement and decrease reliance on adult prompts: activity schedules, tactile <b>prompting,</b> <b>and</b> peer support interventions...|$|R
