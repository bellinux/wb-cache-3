40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The Farm Enterprise Committee of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation {{requested}} that an evaluation {{be made of}} the Reservation land resource for the purpose of acquisition by the Tribe {{as a part of a}} study of the feasibility of an expanded farm enterprise. The Committee's primary goal is to regain control of Reservation lands for Indians, but they realize that the economic success of the farm enterprise will determine the ability of the Tribe to buy more land. The first step in satisfying the Committee's request was to determine the kinds of information necessary to an evaluation of the land resource and the availability of information compiled by public and private agencies to satisfy these information needs. Specific information needs included owner and operator data, land and improvements costs, and agricultural characteristics such as soil, slope, precipitation, productivity, potential crops, and irrigated agriculture potential. Where possible, information was collected on a parcel by parcel basis. Where parcel by parcel data were not available, information was developed for each of 11 regions into which the Reservation was divided. The data were analyzed and organized into forms that would convey to the Committee the information collected and the understandings formed. Two forms of descriptive analysis of the variation in land quality were produced to form a backdrop for evaluating individual parcels. In one analysis, the spatial variation of each variable was described verbally and cartographically. The second analysis describes the agricultural characteristics and potential of each of the 11 relatively homogenous regions. The economic analysis of the larger study characterizes the economic potential of the typical parcel in each region. The information collected on individual parcels is organized into a set of index files of owners and <b>parcel</b> <b>codes,</b> a map which locates parcels by their codes, and a set of parcel data cards on which all the information on each parcel is recorded. Finally, each parcel is ranked on a scale of 1 - 100 by means of a parcel rating scale which integrates the parcel characteristics of nine different variable categories into one ranking. This ranking is then used to differentiate between poorer than average, average, and better than average parcels within each region. The information collected in the land resource analysis can thus be integrated with the economic analysis of each region...|$|E

40|$|As Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) {{move into}} the {{petascale}} age, where the output from global high-resolution model runs can be {{of the order of}} hundreds of terabytes in size, tools to analyse the output of these models will need to scale up too. Lagrangian Ocean Analysis, where virtual particles are tracked through hydrodynamic fields, is an increasingly popular way to analyse OGCM output, by mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic particulates. However, the current software stack of Lagrangian Ocean Analysis codes is not dynamic enough to cope with the increasing complexity, scale and need for customisation of use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes are developed for stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate virtual particles at runtime of the OGCM. Here, we introduce the new <b>Parcels</b> <b>code,</b> which was designed from the ground up to be sufficiently scalable to cope with petascale computing. We highlight its API design that combines flexibility and customisation with the ability to optimise for HPC workflows, following the paradigm of domain-specific languages. Parcels is primarily written in Python, utilising the wide range of tools available in the scientific Python ecosystem, while generating low-level C-code and using Just-In-Time compilation for performance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example of its API, and validate the accuracy of the code against seven idealised test cases. This version~ 0. 9 of Parcels is focussed on laying out the API, with future work concentrating on optimisation, efficiency and at-runtime coupling with OGCMs. Comment: Submitted to Geoscientific Model Development (GMD...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} developing the Exploration and Mining Cadastre System (EMCS), which involves all activities related to exploration areas, including registration and subsequent legal issues in a broader sense. It is built with two main purposes in mind: (1) enable necessary surveys, observe applicant 2 ̆ 7 s reserved parcel, register the parcel online, and issue and follow up necessary permits/licenses {{in the field of}} exploration, (2) provide a mutual platform for data exchange among various service systems in the field of exploration and mining in Iran. The EMCS model is designed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) with three main sets of classes: (1) RegisterObject (2) ActivityLicense, and (3) Person. Other relevant features of the model are also specified at the class level. These include: conditional registered parcels, unregisterable areas such as prohibited or protected areas, legal borders around registered or serving parcels, reference documents such as legal survey results documents, responsibilities, and restrictions. The model also considers issues related to exploration cost, <b>parcel</b> <b>code,</b> tax, royalty, commodity, priorities, facilitations, evaluation, transfer of ownership, changing parameters, and temporal registration. The temporal aspects of the classes are also supported by the model {{to take care of the}} time periods that involve the general procedures in the registration of exploration and mining properties. We anticipate that the framework and model structure provide a platform for data storage, improve the supervision of exploration and mining process, change manual into online registration system, prevent administrative corruption, and reduce bureaucracy...|$|R

50|$|During her life, Anne wrote a four-million-word diary. It {{began in}} 1806 as scraps of paper, {{recording}} in secret <b>code</b> <b>parcels</b> sent {{to and from}} Eliza Raine, and eventually became the 26 Quarto volumes ending at her death in 1840. In addition to her handwriting being incredibly difficult to decipher, around one-sixth of the diary is encrypted in a simple code she and Eliza had devised, combining the Greek alphabet, zodiac, punctuation and mathematical symbols, and it describes quite graphically her lesbian nature and affairs, {{as well as the}} tactics she used for seduction. The diaries also contain her thoughts on the weather, social events, national events and her business interests. The majority of her diary deals with her daily life, and not merely her lesbianism, and provides detailed information on social, political and economic events of the time.|$|R
50|$|Geocoding is interpolating spatial {{locations}} (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or {{any other}} spatially referenced data such as ZIP <b>Codes,</b> <b>parcel</b> lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to geocode individual addresses, such as a road centerline file with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided {{in the form of}} a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address 1 and ends with address 1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.|$|R

All batches of test material were stored under – 18 ºC and protected from light prior to and after packaging.   Aflatoxins in the test materials were determinated by immunoaffinity with liquid chromatography (LC) with pos-column derivatization and thin layer chromatography (TLC).   Zearalenone in the test materials were determined by solid phase column (Romer 224 TM) with LC.   Four homogeneus maize materials were prepared: blank for zearalenone, blank for aflatoxins and two naturally contaminated for aflatoxins.   These samples were used to validated analytical methods and as reference samples for proficiency test.   The participating laboratories received refrigerated <b>parcel</b> containing: <b>coded</b> maize samples and blank for spiking purpose, test material receipt form, additional instructions, results reporting sheets and analytical work questionnaire in 3 rounds.   The results were evaluated by using z-score function being calculated considering the best value representing the true measure of mycotoxin in the sample (as per evaluation in the homogeneity tests).   Additional FAPAS test material for mycotoxins were purchased in order to assess the laboratory performance and to validated the reference materials.   In case of “questionable” or “unsatisfactory” results, the Laboratory were advised to treate them as non conforming work, make the necessary modifications and adjustments in the methods, taking into account the method performance criteria (CEN).   The laboratories were strongly recommended to write a report containing the analysis of the causes and correctives actions proposed, giving special attention to: correct use of calibrated pipettes; chromatographic condition including the calibration curve and injected volume of extract and standard...|$|R
