One Way Productions came to an agreement with MGM {{that it would take}} care of the costs associated with advertising and distributing the film, if MGM agreed to distribute Inchon for a <b>profit</b> <b>share</b> of only 15 percent. The normal fee for the film distributor was thirty percent of profits. The film, cut to 105 minutes, was released in the United States on the weekend of September 17, 1982. It was swiftly pulled from theater distribution because of its poor performance at the box office, and was never shown in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{a simple}} {{accounting}} error to think, that the gross <b>profit</b> <b>share</b> of value-added is equal to true business profit, or that constant capital invested in physical assets (fixed equipment and inventories) represents the capital that an enterprise owns, other than a fund to pay wages, or that profits from product sales are the only net income the corporation has. That can be verified from any corporate balance sheet. If an enterprise borrows or leases capital for production, rather than investing its own, this affects the cost of capital that is tied up at any particular time. How the profitability of capital is accounted for, depends very much on who owns the capital, as distinct from who borrows it, or who uses it. So the rate of profit concept which Marx uses in his theoretical analysis of capitalist production (i.e. S/(C+V)) differs from the actual business concept of the rate of profit, because it disregards all sorts of financial and ownership issues, and because it concerns only part of the total circuit of capital.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{questions}} associated with flexible outsourcing both with committed and flexible <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> under imperfect domestic labour markets. How does <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> influence flexible outsourcing? What {{is the relationship}} between outsourcing cost, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> and equilibrium unemployment, when <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> is also a part of the compensation schemes in other industries? In the case of committed <b>profit</b> <b>sharing,</b> outsourcing cost increases wage. Optimal flexible <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> is smaller than in the absence of outsourcing, but outsourcing cost and wage will have ambiguous effect on optimal flexible <b>profit</b> <b>sharing.</b> Implementing <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> can help to avoid outsourcing due to a direct productivity effect and a wage effect. For equilibrium unemployment the effects of outsourcing cost and <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> are ambiguous both in case of committed and flexible <b>profit</b> <b>sharing.</b> In the case of zero effort elasticity there is no committed or flexible <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> in the absence or presence of outsourcing and in this case lower outsourcing cost will decrease unemployment. flexible outsourcing, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing,</b> labour market imperfection, employee effort, equilibrium unemployment...|$|R

Overall, growth in employee earnings during the three-year period subsequent to adoption of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> {{did not differ significantly}} between establishments that had or had not adopted <b>profit</b> <b>sharing.</b> However, growth in employee earnings was significantly higher among <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> adopters that paid above-market wages prior to adoption of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing.</b> This suggests that <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> may be financially beneficial to employees in establishments making high investments in human capital.

Additionally unusual for Skybus flight crew was that there were very few if any overnight trips thus giving the crew far fewer hours away from home (known as TAFB or time away from base) and higher crew utilization rates for more efficient work schedules. Typical Skybus pilot workdays were 8–10 hours long (FAA maximum is 16 hours), which was lower than the industry average of 12–14 hours. Typical pilot work months were 14–15 days with no overnights. The average pilot in the US has a work month of 16–17 days, and the average airline pilot wage is approximately $135,000 averaged between first officer and captain pay.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{reforms to}} the NHS have {{included}} {{changes to the}} GP contract. General practitioners are now not required to work unsociable hours, and get paid to some extent according to their performance, e.g. numbers of patients treated, what treatments were administered, {{and the health of}} their catchment area, through the Quality and Outcomes Framework. The IT system used for assessing their income based on these criteria is called QMAS. The amount that a GP can expect to earn does vary according to the location of their work and the health needs of the population that they serve. Within a couple of years of the new contract being introduced it became apparent that there were a few examples where the arrangements were out step with what had been expected. A full-time self-employed GP, such as a GMS or PMS practice partner, might currently expect to earn a <b>profit</b> <b>share</b> of around £95,900 before tax while a GP employed by a CCG could expect to earn a salary in the range of £54,863 to £82,789. This can equate to an hourly rate of around £40 an hour for a GP partner.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} prior studies {{investigating}} {{the determinants of}} <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption fail to consider the effect of current earnings changes on future expected compensation payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> that underlie the success of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> in motivating employees. When current earnings changes are caused by factors that make earnings too volatile then the payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> are volatile and their predictability is reduced. In this situation, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> {{is not expected to}} be successful in motivating employees and would not be a preferred means of compensation. In contrast, if earnings changes are caused by factors that produce more sustainable effects on earnings, rendering them more reliable and predictable, then compensation payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> will be more predictable and representative of employees' efforts. In this case, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> would be more successful in motivating employees and {{is more likely to be}} adopted as a preferred compensation scheme. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that a positive association exists between the level of permanence of current earnings changes and the adoption of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plans. Permanence of earnings changes is measured by the level of earnings persistence which is computed using two alternative time-series models: IMA (1, 1) and ARIMA (2, 1, 0). A Logit model is used to evaluate the effect of earnings persistence and control variables on the probability of adoption of employee <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plans. <b>Profit</b> <b>sharing</b> data is extracted from the U. S. IRS 5500 Form while financial data for the sample firms are retrieved from Compustat. The final sample includes 298 firms that are equally split between <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> and non-profit sharing firms. The test results indicate that information about persistence of earnings innovations is a significant determinant of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption. Earnings persistence is positively associated with the probability of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption. This result is robust when the alternative measure of earnings persistence is used and the control variables are included. These results should lead to a richer model of employee <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption and use...|$|R
