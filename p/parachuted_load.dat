40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the structural design and analysis of the upper pressure shell section of a carbon composite demonstration structure for the Composite Crew Module (CCM) Project. The project is managed by the NASA Engineering and Safety Center with participants from eight NASA Centers, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and multiple aerospace contractors including ATK/Swales, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Collier Research Corporation, Genesis Engineering, and Janicki Industries. The paper discusses details of the upper pressure shell section design of the CCM and {{presents the}} structural analysis results using the HyperSizer structural sizing software and the MSC Nastran finite element analysis software. The HyperSizer results showed that the controlling load case driving most of the sizing in the upper pressure shell section was the internal pressure load case. The regions around the cutouts were controlled by internal pressure and the main <b>parachute</b> <b>load</b> cases. The global finite element analysis results showed {{that the majority of the}} elements of the CCM had a positive margin of safety with the exception of a few hot spots around the cutouts. These hot spots are currently being investigated with a more detailed analysis. Local finite element models of the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) interface ring and the forward bay gussets with greater mesh fidelity were created for local sizing and analysis. The sizing of the LIDS interface ring was driven by the drogue <b>parachute</b> <b>loads,</b> Trans-Lunar Insertion (TLI) loads, and internal pressure. The drogue <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> controlled the sizing of the gusset cap on the drogue gusset and TLI loads controlled the sizing of the other five gusset caps. The main <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> controlled the sizing of the lower ends of the gusset caps on the main parachute fittings. The results showed that the gusset web/pressure shell and gusset web/gusset cap interfaces bonded using Pi-preform joints had local hot spots in the Pi-preform termination regions. These regions require a detailed three-dimensional analysis, which is currently being performed, to accurately address the load distribution near the Pi-preform termination in the upper and lower gusset caps...|$|R

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{project is}} {{executing}} {{a program to}} qualify a parachute system for a next generation human spacecraft. Part of the qualification process involves predicting parachute riser tension during system descent with flight simulations. Human rating the CPAS hardware requires {{a high degree of}} confidence in the simulation models used to predict <b>parachute</b> <b>loads.</b> However, uncertainty exists in the heritage added mass models used for loads predictions {{due to a lack of}} supporting documentation and data. Even though CPAS anchors flight simulation loads predictions to flight tests, extrapolation of these models outside the test regime carries the risk of producing non-bounding loads. A set of equations based on empirically derived functions of skirt radius is recommended as the simplest and most viable method to test and derive an enhanced added mass model for an inflating parachute. This will increase confidence in the capability to predict <b>parachute</b> <b>loads.</b> The selected equations are based on those published in A Simplified Dynamic Model of Parachute Inflation by Dean Wolf. An Ames 80 x 120 wind tunnel test campaign is recommended to acquire the reefing line tension and canopy photogrammetric data needed to quantify the terms in the Wolf equations and reduce uncertainties in <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> predictions. Once the campaign is completed, the Wolf equations can be used to predict loads in a typical CPAS Drogue Flight test. Comprehensive descriptions of added mass test techniques from the Apollo Era to the current CPAS project are included for reference...|$|R

In detail, it is the goal to detect actuator failures occurring during flight and reconfigure the guidance and control system {{in a way that}} a precise landing is still possible. The document summarizes the results of a feasibility study to demonstrate model based failure detection for selected actuator faults of a steerable parachute system. The reconfiguration of guidance-, navigation-, control- algorithms (GNC) under faulty conditions is also presented...|$|R

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) project conducts {{computer}} simulations {{to verify that}} flight performance requirements on <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> and terminal rate of descent are met. Design of Experiments (DoE) provides a systematic method for variation of simulation input parameters. When implemented and interpreted correctly, a DoE study of parachute simulation tools indicates values and combinations of parameters that may cause requirement limits to be violated. This paper describes one implementation of DoE that is currently being developed by CPAS, explains how DoE results can be interpreted, and {{presents the results of}} several preliminary studies.

40|$|Parachute test {{programs}} employ Monte Carlo simulation {{techniques to}} plan testing and make critical decisions related to <b>parachute</b> <b>loads,</b> rate-of-descent, or other parameters. This paper describes {{the development and}} use of a MATLAB-based Monte Carlo tool for three parachute drop test simulations currently used by NASA. The Decelerator System Simulation (DSS) is a legacy 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) simulation used to predict <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> and descent trajectories. The Decelerator System Simulation Application (DSSA) is a 6 -DOF simulation that is well suited for modeling aircraft extraction and descent of pallet-like test vehicles. The Drop Test Vehicle Simulation (DTVSim) is a 2 -DOF trajectory simulation that is convenient for quick turn-around analysis tasks. These three tools have significantly different software architectures and do not share common input files or output data structures. Separate Monte Carlo tools were initially developed for each simulation. A recently-developed simulation output structure enables the use of the more sophisticated DSSA Monte Carlo tool with any of the core-simulations. The task of configuring the inputs for the nominal simulation is left to the existing tools. Once the nominal simulation is configured, the Monte Carlo tool perturbs the input set according to dispersion rules created by the analyst. These rules define the statistical distribution and parameters to be applied to each simulation input. Individual dispersed parameters are combined to create a dispersed set of simulation inputs. The Monte Carlo tool repeatedly executes the core-simulation with the dispersed inputs and stores the results for analysis. The analyst may define conditions on one or more output parameters at which to collect data slices. The tool provides a versatile interface for reviewing output of large Monte Carlo data sets while preserving the capability for detailed examination of individual dispersed trajectories. The Monte Carlo tool described in this paper has proven useful in planning several Crew Exploration Vehicle parachute tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} reconstructing {{inflation}} <b>loads</b> of Capsule <b>Parachute</b> Assembly System (CPAS) has been updated {{as the program}} transitioned to testing Engineering Development Unit (EDU) hardware. The equations used to reduce the test data have been re-derived {{based on the same}} physical assumptions made by simulations. Due to instrumentation challenges, individual <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> are determined from complementary accelerometer and load cell measurements. Cluster inflations are now simulated by modeling each parachute individually to better represent different inflation times and non-synchronous disreefing. The reconstruction procedure is tailored to either infinite mass or finite mass events based on measurable characteristics from the test data. Inflation parameters are determined from an automated optimization routine to reduce subjectivity. Infinite mass inflation parameters have been re-defined to avoid unrealistic interactions in Monte Carlo simulations. Sample cases demonstrate how best-fit inflation parameters are used to generate simulated drag areas and loads which favorably agree with test data...|$|R
40|$|Recovery and reuse of the Space Shuttle {{solid rocket}} {{boosters}} was baselined {{to support the}} primary goal to develop a low cost space transportation system. The recovery system required for the 170, 000 -lb boosters was for the largest and heaviest object yet to be retrieved from exoatmospheric conditions. State-of-the-art design procedures were ground-ruled and development testing minimized to produce both a reliable and cost effective system. The ability to utilize the inherent drag of the boosters during the initial phase of reentry was {{a key factor in}} minimizing the <b>parachute</b> <b>loads,</b> size and weight. A wind tunnel test program was devised to enable the accurate prediction of booster aerodynamic characteristics. Concurrently, wind tunnel, rocket sled and air drop tests were performed to develop and verify the performance of the parachute decelerator subsystem. Aerodynamic problems encountered during the overall recovery system development and the respective solutions are emphasized...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{adverse weather}} conditions, the takeoff, planned for September 15, was {{postponed}} several times [...] Finally, the Council decided that October 14 {{would be the}} final attempt, as winter in the Tatra mountains comes earlier than in the plains.On the scheduled day, {{a large group of}} spectators showed up in the Chocholowska Valley, brought by special buses and taxis. There were also numerous journalists, including those from the National Geographic. As the Kraków's Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny newspaper wrote later, the crew, dressed in special uniforms with <b>parachutes,</b> <b>loaded</b> into the gondola.

A mathematical elastic model of suspension-system geometry is coupled to the planar equations of motion of a general vehicle and canopy.

50|$|The {{amount of}} space {{available}} on the spacecraft for the parachute is so small that the parachute had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly folded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the parachute. The <b>parachute</b> team <b>loaded</b> the <b>parachute</b> in a special structure that then applied a heavy weight to the parachute package several times. Before placing the parachute into the backshell, the parachute was heat set to sterilize it.|$|R
40|$|Although antispin tail parachutes {{have been}} used {{successfully}} in spin demonstrations for some time, very little published information is available concerning the size of parachute, the bridle-line length, and the type and location of pack to use for particular airplane. The present paper {{is an attempt to}} supply data relating to these factors. The paper is in two parts. The first part reviews the principles of operation of the antispin parachutes, views the principles of operation of the antispin parachutes, summarized available information on actual installations, and discusses <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> and pack locations. The second part of the paper reports on systematic tests in the NACA- 15 -foot and 20 -foot free-spinning tunnels at the Langley memorial Aeronautical Laboratory to determine the minimum size and the optimum bridle-line lengths for antispin tail parachutes for current military airplanes. It is concluded that airplanes weighing between 7500 and 14, 000 pounds require parachutes 8 feet in diameter and bridle-line lengths between 20 and 50 feet. A positive-ejection mechanism is desirable to throw the parachute clear of the tail and to assure rapid opening. The pack and attachment point must be so located that the equipment will not foul the tail surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Costs and {{complexity}} of parachute system greatly reduced. Rigidtowline parachute system operates in three steps: (1) When aircraft begins to spin, parachute compartment opened up, and parachute unfolds; (2) Parachute deployed and spin terminated; and (3) Parachute released.

40|$|Because {{simulations}} of the Orion Crew Module (CM) dynamics with drogue parachutes deployed were under-predicting {{the amount of}} damping seen in free-flight tests, an attach-point damping model {{was applied to the}} Orion system. A key hypothesis in this model is that the drogue parachutes' net load vector aligns with the CM drogue attachment point velocity vector. This assumption seems reasonable and has historically produced good results, but has never been experimentally verified. The wake of the CM influences the drogue parachutes, which makes performance predictions of the parachutes difficult. Many of these effects are not currently modeled in the simulations. A forced oscillation test of the CM with parachutes was conducted in the NASA LaRC 20 -Ft Vertical Spin Tunnel (VST) to gather additional data to validate and refine the attach-point damping model. A second loads balance was added to the original Orion VST model to measure the drogue <b>parachute</b> <b>loads</b> independently of the CM. The objective of the test was to identify the contribution of the drogues to CM damping and provide additional information to quantify wake effects and the interactions between the CM and parachutes. The drogue parachute force vector was shown to be highly dependent on the CM wake characteristics. Based on these wind tunnel test data, the attach-point damping model was determined to be a sufficient approximation of the parachute dynamics in relationship to the CM dynamics for preliminary entry vehicle system design. More wake effects should be included to better model the system...|$|R

A Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) is being developed for preliminary parachute drop tests at the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) to simulate high-speed reentry to Earth from beyond Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) and to provide measurements of landing parameters and <b>parachute</b> <b>loads.</b> The avionics systems on CPAS also provide mission critical firing events to deploy, reef, and release the parachutes in three stages (extraction, drogues, mains) using mortars and pressure cartridge assemblies. In addition, a Mid-Air Delivery System (MDS) is used to separate the capsule from the sled {{that is used to}} eject the capsule {{from the back of the}} drop plane. Also, high-speed and high-definition cameras in a Video Camera System (VCS) are used to film the drop plane extraction and parachute landing events. To verify Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of the CPAS system from unintentional radiation, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) measurements are being made inside a semi-anechoic chamber at NASA/JSC at 1 m from the electronic components of the CPAS system. In addition, EMI measurements of the integrated CPAS system are being made inside a hanger at YPG.

40|$|Detailed opening loads data is {{presented}} for 18 tests of DGB parachutes of varying geometry with nominal diameters ranging from 43. 2 to 50. 1 ft. All {{of the test}} parachutes were deployed from a mortar. Six of these tests were conducted via drop testing with drop test vehicles weighing approximately 3, 000 or 8, 000 lb. Twelve tests were conducted in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex 80 - by 120 -foot wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center. The purpose of these tests was to structurally qualify the parachute for the Mars Exploration Rover mission. A key requirement of all tests was that peak <b>parachute</b> <b>load</b> had to be reached at full inflation to more closely simulate the load profile encountered during operation at Mars. Peak loads measured during the tests were {{in the range from}} 12, 889 to 30, 027 lb. Of the two test methods, the wind tunnel tests yielded more accurate and repeatable data. Application of an apparent mass model to the opening loads data yielded insights into the nature of these loads. Although the apparent mass model could reconstruct specific tests with reasonable accuracy, the use of this model for predictive analyses was not accurate enough to set test conditions for either the drop or wind tunnel tests. A simpler empirical model was found to be suitable for predicting opening loads for the wind tunnel tests to a satisfactory level of accuracy. However, this simple empirical model is not applicable to the drop tests...|$|R

The aeroshell was then erected at the desired conditions by ground command. When the desired parachute test conditions were reached, another ground command deployed the test parachute. The test Mach number and dynamic pressure obtained at the <b>parachute</b> peak <b>load</b> were 2. 62 and 19. 4 pounds per square foot respectively.

Day two saw the new soldiers learn the skills of ambushing the enemy; first they practiced setting squad-size ambushes, then moved up to using platoons. The third day covered squad, platoon, and company-size ambushes, as well as booby traps. The first two ADC companies in Momentum graduated on 20 January 1961.

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) has flight {{tested the}} first two generations of the Orion {{parachute}} program. Three of the second generation tests instrumented the dispersion bridles of the Main parachute with a Tension Measuring System. The goal of this load measurement was to better understand load asymmetry during the inflation process of a cluster of Main parachutes. The CPAS Main parachutes exhibit inflations that are much less symmetric than current parachute literature and design guides would indicate. This paper will examine loads data gathered on three cluster tests, quantify the degree of asymmetry observed, and contrast the results with published design guides.

At the time of parachute deployment the aeroshell-payload combination was oscillating through an angle-of-attack range of plus or minus 40 deg. Continued oscillatory motion of the aeroshell-payload combination and similar motion of the parachute caused rapid changes in <b>parachute</b> shape and <b>loading</b> which resulted in extensive cloth damage in the band and outer disk-edge areas of the parachute canopy.

40|$|During the {{developmental}} testing program for CPAS (Capsule Parachute Assembly System), the parachute {{system for the}} NASA Orion Crew Module, simulation revealed that high loads may be experienced by the pilot risers during the most devere deployment conditions.

40|$|The aerodynamics, both {{static and}} dynamic, {{of a test}} vehicle are {{critical}} to determining {{the performance of the}} parachute cluster in a drop test and for conducting a successful test. The Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) project is conducting tests of NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) parachutes at the Army Yuma Proving Ground utilizing the Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV). The PTV shape is based on the MPCV, but the height has been reduced in order to fit within the C- 17 aircraft for extraction. Therefore, the aerodynamics of the PTV are similar, but not the same as, the MPCV. A small series of wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics cases were run to modify the MPCV aerodynamic database for the PTV, but aerodynamic reconstruction of the flights has proven an effective source for further improvements to the database. The acceleration and rotational rates measured during free flight, before parachute inflation but during deployment, were used to con rm vehicle static aerodynamics. A multibody simulation is utilized to reconstruct the parachute portions of the flight. Aerodynamic or parachute parameters are adjusted in the simulation until the prediction reasonably matches the flight trajectory. Knowledge of the static aerodynamics is critical in the CPAS project because the <b>parachute</b> riser <b>load</b> measurements are scaled based on forebody drag. PTV dynamic damping is critical because the vehicle has no reaction control system to maintain attitude - the vehicle dynamics must be understood and modeled correctly before flight.

There were 12 souls on board, however, no additional <b>parachutes</b> were <b>loaded</b> aboard for these observers' use, if necessary. The E-3 Aircraft Commander and the crew were into their 7th hour of a normal 14-hour mission. The refueling was uneventful, but rather than the normal post-A/R vertical separation maneuver, the E-3 commander asked {{if it would be}} OK to join the tanker off the right wing so the passengers could get some good pictures. Contributing to the accident was the tanker pilot flying was in the left seat and the E-3 pilot flying was in the right seat. After several minutes on a collision course the E-3 contacted the tanker's right wing with its left wing. The E-3 wing outside of the number one engine broke off after cutting into the tanker's skin and severing the throttle cables. The wing pieces embedded themselves into the tanker fuselage, causing a rapid decompression. A break-away maneuver was conducted, and the aircraft were able to complete control checks. The tanker landed at Riyadh Military airport with two engines out on one side, while the E-3 had to dump all the fuel it just received before it was able to land there as well. The missing wing pieces that did not strike the tanker were never found, and appeared to cause no damage on the ground. The investigating board recommended that both Rated E-3 pilots and the enlisted flight engineer be permanently assigned duties other than flying, and that cameras not be allowed on the flight-deck without Wing approval.|$|R
