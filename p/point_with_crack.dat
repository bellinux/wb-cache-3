By {{taking advantage of the}} same stiffness and similar mass of similarly shaped elements, the combined stiffness matrix and combined inertia matrix in area Ω can be expressed by the displacement row matrix of outer polygon. The global stiffness matrix will be obtained if the combined stiffness matrix and combined inertia matrix of area Ω are assembled to those of another elements according to corresponding nodes. The small set of generalized coordinates can be obtained through solving the equation, and then the dynamic stress intensity factor of crack will be obtained. The three <b>points</b> bending <b>with</b> single <b>crack</b> and shearing model <b>with</b> double <b>cracks</b> in explosive loading were calculated with finite geometrically similar element method...|$|R

(Poales: Poaceae)) kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls for reproduction when these kernels are mixed with intact kernels. Differing amounts of kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls (0, 5, 10, and 20 %) of the varieties Francis and Wells were mixed with intact kernels, and the number of adult progeny emerging from intact kernels and from kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls was determined. The Wells variety had been previously classified as tolerant to R. dominica, while the Francis variety was classified as moderately susceptible. Few F 1 progeny were produced in Wells regardless of the percentage of kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls, few of the kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls had emergence holes, and little frass was produced from feeding damage. At 10 and 20 % kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls, the progeny production, number of emergence holes in kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls, and the amount of frass was greater in Francis than in Wells. The proportion of progeny emerging from kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls increased as the proportion of kernels <b>with</b> <b>cracked</b> hulls increased.

40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} tests were {{performed}} on four <b>point</b> bend specimens <b>with</b> <b>crack</b> like defects intentionally placed in A 302 B low-alloy pressure vessel steel clad with 308 / 309 L weld deposited stainless steel. The defects {{were placed in the}} base metal under the cladding by machining a cavity from the side opposite the cladding, electric-discharge machining a very sharp flaw, fatigue pre-cracking the flaw, and then filling up the cavity by a weld repair process. The specimens were stress relieved before fatigue testing. The specimens were fatigue cycled at positive load ratios until the defects broke through to the surface. The specimens were then fractured at liquid nitrogen temperatures to reveal the fracture surfaces. Seven different sub-clad flaw specimens were tested in room temperature air and each test provides a record of cycles to defect break-through. Changes in defect size and shape as a function of applied load cycles were obtained by benchmarking the crack at various stages of the load history. The results provide a set of embedded defect data which can be used for qualifying fatigue crack growth analysis procedures such as those in Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. A comparison between calculated and measured values shows that the ASME B and PV Section XI fatigue crack growth procedures conservatively predict cycles to defect break-through for small sub-clad defects...|$|R

40|$|When {{analyzing}} the scatter and discrepancies arising among the fracture toughness resulting for differentmaterials and given mixity ratio KIIC/KIC three factors {{seems to be}} influential in contributing to the still unsatisfactory state of affairs in this field: a) the lack of established requirements as regards geometry and minimal in- and out-ofplane dimensions of specimens regulating the test for determining mode-II fracture toughnessKIIC or, in the more general case, its equivalent in mixed mode cases, b) {{the role played by}} the micro-cracking present in the process zone, acknowledged as a microstructural phenomenon already pointed out by Kalthoff and co-workers, needs to be experimentally investigated, and is not considered in the mainly analytical and numerical focussing pursued here, and c) the insufficient attention paid to the particularity of the stress fields around the crack front before and after the daughter crack is formed. In this work, the last question is addressed with the intention of contributing to the clarification of some <b>points</b> <b>with</b> regard to <b>crack</b> instability under mode-II and mixed-mode loading, in particular, why it is difficult to formulate a sufficiently simple failure model for mechanical components or real structures for which the type of load or the geometry results in stress states from which the potential of mixed mode failure arises...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{structural}} reliability under processes of deterioration presents very important problem in design. The structure’s wear shows {{a reduction of}} bearing capacity in time that for one’s turn leads to increasing the probability of failure. The reasons for long duration and irreversible change {{of structural}} features can be corrosion in steel structures, decomposition in wood structures, ageing in polymer structures, and processes of abrasion or erosion also. The problem of defects accumulation should be mentioned too, when reduction of the bearing capacity connects with load’s value and its duration. The models and peculiarities of corrosion wear and its influence on bearing capacity are discussed in this paper. 1. MODELS OF CORROSION WEAR Corrosion {{is an important factor}} in reducing of reliability and durability due to different kinds of structures or equipments. From 10 % to 12 % of fabricated and used steel is lost annually due to destructive effects of corrosion. In spite of widely used protection methods, the quantity of steel destroyed is growing almost proportionally to the accumulated stores of steel. Losses from corrosion average are between 2 % to 4 % of GDP in almost every country. About 30 % of structural steel is subjected to atmospheric corrosion, and 75 % is subjected to atmospheric and aggressive corrosion simultaneously [1]. Under corrosion’s influence the initial cross-section of a structural element is decreased, and consequently so its bearing capacity. Fig. 1 presents the types of corrosion for structural steel.
