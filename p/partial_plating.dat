50|$|Conte Verde was {{the third}} of three s built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy), though she {{differed}} in several respects from her sisters. Unlike the other two members of her class, she did not receive complete iron armor, instead relying on <b>partial</b> <b>plating</b> at her bow and stern. She was laid down in February 1863, she was launched in July 1867, and she was completed in December 1871. Conte Verde was a broadside ironclad armed with a battery of four 8 in guns and eighteen 164 mm guns. Her career was limited, owing {{to the emergence of}} more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. She was discarded in 1880 and sold to ship breakers to help pay for new ironclads then under construction.|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen a surge of novel {{applications}} of the Luria-Delbrück fluctuation assay protocol in bacterial research. Appropriate analysis of fluctuation assay data often requires computational methods that are unavailable in the popular web tool FALCOR. This paper introduces an R package named rSalvador to bring improvements to the field. The paper focuses on rSalvador’s capabilities to alleviate three kinds of problems found in recent investigations: (i) resorting to <b>partial</b> <b>plating</b> without properly accounting {{for the effects of}} partial plating; (ii) conducting attendant fitness assays without incorporating mutants’ relative fitness in subsequent data analysis; and (iii) comparing mutation rates using methods that are in general inapplicable to fluctuation assay data. In addition, the paper touches on rSalvador’s capabilities to estimate sample size and the difficulties related to parameter nonidentifiability...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to shell-bodied grabs, there are tine grabs, {{exemplified by the}} orange peel grab which has tines (typically 6 or 8) fitted with full plates completely enclosing the product when closed. Other tine grabs have no plate, some have a <b>partial</b> <b>plate.</b> Tine grabs {{have the ability to}} penetrate into dense and integrated products such as scrap metal and ores. They are also often used in recycling plants, handling general waste.|$|R
50|$|<b>Partial</b> <b>plate</b> armour, which {{protected}} {{the chest and}} the lower limbs, {{was used by the}} ancient Greeks (muscle cuirass) and Romans (lorica segmentata), but it fell into disuse {{after the collapse of the}} Roman Empire because of the cost and work involved in producing a piece of metal plate or cuirass. Parthian and Sassanian heavy cavalry units known as Clibanarii used cuirasses and small, overlapping plates in the manner of the manica for the protection of arms and legs.|$|R
5000|$|In East Asia {{many types}} of armour were {{commonly}} used at different times by various cultures including, scale armour, lamellar armour, laminar armour, plated mail, mail, plate armour and brigandine. Around the dynastic Tang, Song, and early Ming Period, cuirasses and plates (mingguangjia) were also used, with more elaborate versions for officers in war. The Chinese, during that time used <b>partial</b> <b>plates</b> for [...] "important" [...] body parts instead of covering their whole body since too much plate armour hinders their martial arts movement. The other body parts were covered in cloth, leather, lamellar, and/or Mountain pattern. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armour was made out of various animals, with more exotic ones such as the rhinoceros.|$|R
30|$|Using the {{description}} of the car and the <b>partial</b> license <b>plate</b> number, the police have located a set of a dozen suspects. Of these, only four were anywhere close to the area of the crime scenes. None of these four have any police records. However, the phone number of one of these persons was listed as a recent call on the cell phone left at the scene.|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} 13 {{children with}} <b>partial</b> growth <b>plate</b> arrest {{who had been}} treated by epiphyseolysis. Eight were followed to skeletal maturity and five {{for at least four}} years. In three cases the affected limb was restored to normal and in five the operation was successful in improving angular deformity and leg length discrepancy such that further surgery was not necessary. In the five failures, angular deformity had progressed or limb length discrepancy had increased. There were no significant complications and the procedure did not prevent subsequent osteotomy or limb length equalisation. Epiphyseolysis was most effective for small bars and those affecting only the central area of the <b>plate.</b> Premature <b>partial</b> growth <b>plate</b> arrest is an infrequent complication of epiphyseal injury. It may result in progressive angular deformity and limb length dis-crepancy necessitating multiple corrective osteotomies and limb length equalisation. Excision of the bony bar (epiphyseolysis) to restore normal growth plate function was first described in man by Langenskiold in 1967. Since then several authors have reported a wide experience in the use of epiphyseolysis, it has been increasingly advocated in selected cases (Langenskiol...|$|R

Another report described a blond man with a mustache who drove from the scene in a Chevy Nova without turning on its headlights. Police speculated that the dark-haired man was the shooter, and that the blond man had observed the crime.|$|R
5000|$|On March 13, 1963, Miranda's {{truck was}} spotted and license plates {{recognized}} by the brother of a 17-year-old kidnapping and rape victim, Lois Ann Jameson (the victim had given the brother a description). With {{his description of the}} car and a <b>partial</b> license <b>plate</b> number, Phoenix police officers Carroll Cooley and Wilfred Young confronted Miranda, who voluntarily accompanied them to the station house and participated in a lineup. At the time, Miranda was a person of interest, and not formally in custody.|$|R
30|$|Two homicides {{occurred}} in a particular town within two weeks. The police {{are trying to find}} a possible suspect or suspects and motives. They have several pieces of information. At the scene of the first homicide, a witness saw a car leave the area and is able to recall a <b>partial</b> license <b>plate.</b> An iPhone was dropped at the second scene and police believe {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the phone is not associated with the victim or the victim’s friends or family.|$|R

The police {{estimated}} that the abductor was 5'10" [...] and weighed around 170 pounds. He had long light-colored hair, and appeared to be around 25 years old. Witnesses reported that they had seen a black pick-up truck circling the area around the convenience store that evening. One of the witnesses gave a <b>partial</b> license <b>plate</b> number (three numbers and a letter).|$|R

30|$|The {{connected}} homicides {{use case}} {{does not have}} a strong temporal element as other law enforcement cases typically have. There is sufficient information that can be considered known items including the <b>partial</b> license <b>plate,</b> description of the car, and geolocation, as well as data that can be retrieved from the phone recovered: swipe gesture, fingerprints, contacts, user names, and other content. The unknown items of identity revolve around identifying information to discover any correlations between the perpetrators. In particular, the user wants to know if the perpetrator in each case is really the same person.|$|R
50|$|After Jewell was cleared, the FBI {{admitted}} {{it had no}} other suspects, and the investigation made little progress until early 1997, when two more bombings took place at an abortion clinic and a lesbian nightclub, both in the Atlanta area. Similarities in the bomb design allowed investigators to conclude {{that this was the}} work of the same perpetrator. One more bombing of an abortion clinic, this time in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured nurse Emily Lyons, gave the FBI crucial clues including a <b>partial</b> license <b>plate.</b>|$|R
30|$|Acute hyperextension {{injuries}} of {{the fingers}} are common. The joint most often affected is the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, and the most common causes of injury are ball sport [1, 2] and fall accidents [3, 4]. Most often we find the joint to be stable, and the injury is treated as a sprain. A small palmar lip avulsion is commonly {{seen as part of}} a total or <b>partial</b> palmar <b>plate</b> rupture. Various complications to hyperextension injuries to the PIP joint have been described and may include pain, reduced range of motion, and hyperextension laxity.|$|R

A second specimen, IVPP 18406, has also been assigned to Ikrandraco; it consists of a skull and jaws and the first three neck vertebrae. Both specimens come from the Aptian-age Lower Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, with an estimated date of 120 million years ago. The type and only described species is I. avatar, a second reference to the movie Avatar. It was described in 2014 by Wang Xiaolin and colleagues.|$|R
40|$|Branched DNA (bDNA) assays to {{quantify}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) consist of three distinct steps, including sample processing, hybridization, and detection, and utilize the System 340 platform for plate incubation and washing. Sample processing differs: HIV- 1 from 1 ml of plasma is concentrated by high-speed centrifugation, whereas HCV plasma or serum samples are used without concentration. The first step of hybridization involves viral lysis at 63 °C: HIV- 1 is performed in a heat block, whereas HCV is performed in System 340. The remaining hybridization and detection steps are similar for HIV- 1 and HCV and executed on System 340. In the present study, the HIV- 1 bDNA assay was adapted for viral lysis in the System 340 platform. The adaptation, test method 2, includes a 20 -s vortex of concentrated viral pellet and lysis working solution, transfer of viral lysate to the 96 -well capture plate, and transfer to System 340 programmed for HCV assay specifications. With test method 2, specificity and quantification were within assay specifications. HCV bDNA methodology remains unchanged. Hence, an HIV- 1 and an HCV bDNA can be run simultaneously on System 340. With simultaneous testing, laboratories can run full plates, as well as combinations of full and <b>partial</b> <b>plates.</b> Also, simultaneous HIV- 1 and HCV bDNA permits labor consoli-dation and improved workflow while maintaining multitasking and rapid patient result turnaround.

The accuracy of the numerical procedure was verified through comparisons with laboratory tests results. The numerical procedure {{was found to be}} numerically stable over the full range of response, including post-peak behaviour. The numerical analyses of plated RC columns also show that steel plating can be used to improve a column’s strength, ductility, or both. Yu-Fei Wu, Michael C. Griffith and Deric J.

40|$|License Plate Recognition (LPR) is {{a fairly}} well {{explored}} problem and is already a component of several commercially operational systems. Many of these systems, however, require sophisticated video capture hardware possibly combined with infrared strobe lights or exploit the large size of license plates in certain geographical regions and the (artificially) high discriminability of characters. In this paper, we describe an LPR system that achieves a high recognition rate {{without the need for}} a high quality video signal from expensive hardware. We also explore the problem of car make and model recognition for purposes of searching surveillance video archives for a <b>partial</b> license <b>plate</b> number combined with some visual description of a car.

5000|$|... 265 {{investigators}} from multiple agencies {{were assigned to}} work on the case. Investigators found a cellphone outside at the scene, which was concluded to have been the one mentioned by Joshua Turnidge in the first call. The phone was traced back to a Walmart, where surveillance videos showed a man purchasing the phone and later driving away in a blue truck. A <b>partial</b> license <b>plate</b> identification showed the truck was owned by Bruce Turnidge, of Jefferson, Oregon. While Turnidge was not the man in the video, further investigation found a record of the truck having been stopped for a traffic violation while being driven by Turnidge's son Joshua, who matched the recorded image. Two days after the explosion, Joshua, age 32, was arrested at his home in Salem. Several hours later, Bruce Turnidge, age 57, was arrested at his own home.|$|R
30|$|Venous {{congestion}} after artery-only fingertip replantation (zone I) is {{an inevitable}} phenomenon (Hattori et al. 2003). If not addressed early, it becomes problematic and may cause failure (Buntic and Brooks 2010; Venkatramani and Sabapathy 2011). Adequate restoration of venous outflow {{is required to}} obtain success. Various techniques, such as pulpar incision, <b>partial</b> nail <b>plate</b> removal, and paraungual area stab incision {{have been used to}} allow post-operative bleeding to maintain adequate venous outflow (Hasuo et al. 2009; Yabe et al. 2001; Gordon et al. 1985). In addition, some other techniques, such as application medicinal leech and mechanical leech have also been used (Han et al. 2002; Streit et al. 2014). These techniques have been extremely successful. However, bleeding is often very profound and may require blood transfusion. Erken et al. (2013) reported controlled nail bed bleeding protocol for artery-only fingertip replantation and 15 of 22 patients required blood transfusion.|$|R
30|$|Tamai (1982) zone I (distal to {{the nail}} base) replantation possess {{considerable}} challenge to hand surgeons, because venous anastomosis is extremely difficult, and venous congestion {{is a leading}} cause of failure (Barbary et al. 2013; Hattori et al. 2003). Despite having some limitations, artery-only replantation for zone I amputations has gained popularity over the years (Han et al. 2002; Streit et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2014; Whitaker et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013, 2014; Jeon et al. 2016; Matsuda et al. 1993). Many authors have described various techniques, including external bleeding protocol using pulpar incision (Hasuo et al. 2009), <b>partial</b> nail <b>plate</b> removal (Yabe et al. 2001), and paraungual area stab incision (Gordon et al. 1985) and application of medicinal leech (Han et al. 2002) and mechanical leech (Streit et al. 2014) to counter venous congestion. However, none has provided entirely satisfactory results.|$|R
30|$|To this end, we use an {{intuitive}} modeling approach that, in an investigative mode, allows {{the capture of}} these rich identities in addition to documenting both the processes by which the pieces of identity were derived and the confidence associated with each piece. To illustrate, consider the <b>partial</b> license <b>plate</b> gathered as evidence from the exemplar use case. Any identification performed will have a moderate level of uncertainty attached to it because the correctness of the license plate is in question. Inferences suffer the same potential uncertainty, depending {{on the nature of}} the inference. An investigator might infer a relationship between a phone’s owner and a person listed in the contact list, but uncertainty exists about the nature and strength of that relationship. Knowing how the inferences were made (their derivation) and their associated confidence is necessary to yield a complete picture of what is known, and what is unknown, about a particular identity.|$|R
