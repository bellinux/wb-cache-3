Although soybean survival in this soil was high, its presence did not enhance the degradation of the chemicals. Tests with nonvegetated soils and rhizosphere soils from Kochia sp., a herbicide-tolerant plant, showed enhanced degradation of these chemicals in rhizosphere soil.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades Oman has {{experienced}} rapid economic development but this has been accompanied by environmental problems. Manufacturing and agricultural output have increased substantially but initially this was not balanced with sufficient environmental management. Although agriculture in Oman is not usually considered a major component of the economy, government policy has been directed towards diversification of national income and as a result there has been an increasing emphasis on revenue from agriculture and an enhancement of production via the use of irrigation, machinery and inputs such as pesticides. In recent years this has been tempered with a range of interventions to encourage more sustainable production. Certain pesticides have been prohibited; there has been a promotion of organic agriculture and an emphasis on education and awareness programs for farmers. The last point is of especial relevance given the nature of the farm labour market in Oman and a reliance on expatriate and often untrained labour. The research, through a detailed stratified survey, explores the state of knowledge at farm-level regarding the safe disposal of <b>pesticide</b> <b>waste</b> and what factors could enhance or indeed operate against the spread and implementation of that knowledge. Members of the recently constituted Farmers Association expressed greater environmental awareness than their non-member counterparts in that they identified a more diverse range of potential risks associated with pesticide use and disposed of <b>pesticide</b> <b>waste</b> more in accordance with government policy, albeit government policy with gaps. Workers on farms belonging to Association members {{were also more likely to}} adhere to government policy in terms of waste disposal.

FAO {{called for the}} adoption of minimum standards for the safe and efficient application of agrochemicals through good quality equipment and better training of farmers. According to FAO, farmers and equipment operators have insufficient knowledge about pesticides and correct methods of application. Extension services rarely have technicians with any specialized knowledge of application technology. In many countries the only specialist offering advice to farmers on application technology, handling and calibration of their equipment are the representatives of pesticides companies. Many farmers mistakenly believe that high volumes, high pressure and high doses, are the most appropriate way to apply pesticides. In addition, in many countries, much of the spraying equipment is in extremely poor condition with worn-out sprayer nozzles not being replaced, or worse, enlarged deliberately to achieve higher flow rates. FAO has developed Guidelines for the basic requirements for pesticide application equipment and Standards for pesticide application equipment which includes test procedures. They suggest that incentives for improved equipment quality should be created. A certification system could be introduced {{on a voluntary basis}} by manufacturers using the certificate as a quality trade mark and for sales promotion.

At {{a time when the}} unions, social service and legal aide agencies, and other structures that supported social movements of the past are suffering declining resources and public legitimacy or are failing to move with the needs of the new working poor, privately funded non-profit organizations have become the primary vehicle for organizing poor and marginalized communities. Relatively few scholars have investigated the opportunities and consequences of the new model of philanthropic organizing. Drawing on post-Marxist Gramscian theory, studies in governmentality, and feminist materialism this paper outlines a theoretical framework and research agenda for investigating large philanthropic initiatives. It is proposed that California’s Central Valley, a place sharply defined by the production of poverty through industrial agriculture, provides a useful lens for looking at how philanthropic initiatives reorganize and depoliticize the work of groups originally founded to address issues such as unfair labor practices, <b>pesticide</b> <b>waste,</b> and other abuses by large-scale farmers. It is argued, based on preliminary research 1, that private foundations manage the work of granted organizations through program frameworks that put poor people at the center of their own salvation while excluding reference to the power structures and economic relationships that created the situations they seek to ameliorate. Ultimately, this project is concerned with what the rise of largescale private philanthropic initiatives {{has to do with the}} current moment in which political, social, and economic agendas are overwhelmingly dominated by alliances of global capital...|$|E

The {{survey was conducted}} with a Geonics EM- 31 Terrain Conductivity Meter along north - south oriented traverses with 5 -ft station intervals to produce a 5 -ft by 5 -ft square grid node pattern. Both conductivity and in-phase components were measured at each station for vertical dipole orientation with the common axis of the dipoles in the north - south and east - west orientations. The conductivity data clearly show elevated conductivities (2. 1 to 7. 0 mS/m) associated with the material over the pits, as compared with the surrounding area that is characterized by lower conductivities (1 to 2 mS/m). This is probably the result of the higher clay content of the fill material relative to the surrounding area, which has a higher sand to clay ratio and the presence of a plastic cover beneath the fill that has probably trapped water. Many metal objects are present in the survey area including manhole covers, monitoring well heads, metal, signs, drain culverts, abandoned wells, and BP waste unit marker balls. AU of these exhibit associated conductivity and in-phase anomalies of various magnitude. In addition to these anomalies that can be definitely associated with surface sources, conductivity and in-phase anomalies are also present with no obvious surface source.

The results showed that farmers learned the use and dangers of pesticides mainly by oral communication (p 70 %) was the most common mode of personal hygiene, relative to wearing masks, showering, and changing clothes, but no significant differences were observed between the selected regions. Most pesticide wastes were dumped directly onto the land or into water, suggesting that educational measures should be taken to address the potential risks from the residues in the wastes.

40|$|Six chlorpyrifos-degrading {{bacteria}} {{were isolated}} from an Australian soil and compared by biochemical and molecular methods. The isolates were indistinguishable, and one (strain B- 14) {{was selected for}} further analysis. This strain showed greatest similarity {{to members of the}} order Enterobacteriales and was closest to members of the Enterobacter asburiae group. The ability of the strain to mineralize chlorpyrifos was investigated under different culture conditions, and the strain utilized chlorpyrifos as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus. Studies with ring or uniformly labeled [14 C]chlorpyrifos in liquid culture demonstrated that the isolate hydrolyzed chlorpyrifos to diethylthiophospshate (DETP) and 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol, and utilized DETP for growth and energy. The isolate was found to possess mono- and diphosphatase activities along with a phosphotriesterase activity. Addition of other sources of carbon (glucose and succinate) resulted in slowing down of the initial rate of degradation of chlorpyrifos. The isolate degraded the DETP-containing organophosphates parathion, diazinon, coumaphos, and isazofos when provided as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus, but not fenamiphos, fonofos, ethoprop, and cadusafos, which have different side chains. Studies of the molecular basis of degradation suggested that the degrading ability could be polygenic and chromosome based. Further studies revealed that the strain possessed a novel phosphotriesterase enzyme system, as the gene coding for this enzyme had a different sequence from the widely studied organophosphate-degrading gene (opd). The addition of strain B- 14 (106 cells g− 1) to soil with a low indigenous population of chlorpyrifos-degrading bacteria treated with 35 mg of chlorpyrifos kg− 1 resulted in a higher degradation rate than was observed in noninoculated soils.

The pest control facility at Ft. Eustis has a unique waste drainage system whereby all pesticide wastewater is collected from mixing operations, storage area spills, container rinsing and washdown of dispersal equipment. This waste-water drains into a s~mrp in the floor of a waste treadnt room adjunct to the main building.
