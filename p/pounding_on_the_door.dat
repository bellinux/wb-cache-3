2500|$|In April 2014, Corbyn {{wrote an}} article for the Morning Star {{attributing}} the crisis in Ukraine to {{the actions of the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He said the [...] "root of the crisis" [...] lay in [...] "the US drive to expand eastwards" [...] and described Russia's actions as [...] "not unprovoked". He has said it [...] "probably was" [...] a mistake to allow former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO: [...] "NATO expansion and Russian expansion– one leads to the other, and one reflects the other". Corbyn's views on Ukraine, Russia, and NATO were criticised by a number of writers, including Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, Anne Applebaum in The Sunday Times, Ben Judah in The Independent, and Roger Boyes in The Times. Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Edward Lucas [...] saw Corbyn as having a [...] "desire to appease Russia by sacrificing Ukraine" [...] and [...] said that Corbyn's [...] "anti-imperialist sentiments did not stretch to understanding countries such as Ukraine". Lithuanian ambassador Asta Skaisgirytė disagreed with Corbyn's portrayal of NATO, saying her country was not [...] "forced or lured into NATO as part of an American global power grab. We were <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the alliance, demanding to be let in".|$|E

60|$|Some {{minutes later}} he lifted Millicent from the saddle, and she leaned against him almost {{powerless}} as he <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> loud knocking was answered by voices within, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> swung open, and Millicent reeled into a long hall.
