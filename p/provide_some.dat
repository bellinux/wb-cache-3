5|$|Hurricanes are a {{substantial}} concern {{during the fall}} season. Though Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> shielding, the Bay Area still faces more danger than Houston and other inland communities, particularly because of storm surge.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2005 review, due to {{the high}} levels of {{mortality}} and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P.falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} studies, it is {{not known}} whether {{increased}} fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness, and there is a similar lack of data for the use of heated humidified air. One study has found chest vapor rub to <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Eddy {{returned}} to Massachusetts in August. While the Second Continental Congress and George Washington would not authorize, fund, or otherwise support military activities in Nova Scotia, Eddy {{was able to}} convince the Massachusetts Provincial Congress to <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> material support (primarily muskets, ammunition, powder, and other military supplies) for an attempt on Fort Cumberland. It also allowed Eddy to engage in recruiting in the District of Maine.|$|E
5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes are an ever-present threat {{during the}} summer and fall season, which puts Galveston in Coastal Windstorm Area. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are {{generally}} at the greatest risk among the communities near the Galveston Bay. However, though the island and peninsula <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge.|$|E

5|$|Language and {{personal}} names <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> difficulties. The former {{is an important}} indicator of culture but {{there is very little}} direct evidence for its use in specific circumstances during the period under consideration. Pictish, Middle Irish and Old Norse would certainly have been spoken and Woolf (2007) suggests that a significant degree of linguistic balkanisation took place. As a result, single individuals often appear in sources under a variety of different names.|$|E
5|$|Scouting in South Africa grew rapidly, and in 1912 Robert Baden-Powell visited South African Scouts. Due to {{the rapid}} spread of Scouting it became {{necessary}} to <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> form of local co-ordination. Provincial Councils were formed in South Africa between 1912 and 1916. These councils had no direct {{contact with each other}} and reported directly to Imperial Scout Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|Several caves {{occur within}} the Gorge, of which Bridged Pot and Gully Cave <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> {{of the best}} Late Devensian small-mammal assemblages known from Britain. Most of the {{deposits}} remain in situ and include steppe pika, Arctic lemming, Norway lemming, various voles, red deer and reindeer. Bronze Age finds include pottery from the Beaker culture, a stone axe and flint knife.|$|E

5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking {{them back to the}} ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{acquisition}} of the Hunter had solved part of the Swiss dilemma of needing to support both its ground forces and to deploy an air-to-air capability, but while the Hunter could <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> counter-air defense over a battlefield and escort ground-support fighters it was not supersonic nor was it capable of defending Swiss airspace. In 1961, the Swiss Parliament voted to procure 100French Dassault Mirage IIICs for this purpose and 67BL-64 Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles from the British.|$|E
5|$|The last {{passenger}} train services in Radstock closed in 1966, {{and the last}} coal mines closed in 1973. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> local employment.

5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|Two {{books were}} {{released}} {{related to the}} original series: Mr. Bean's Diary in 1992 and Mr. Bean's Pocket Diary in 1994. The two books have identical content and differ only in the format {{in which they are}} printed. The content of both is a template diary with handwritten content scrawled in by Mr. Bean. They <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> additional information on the setting: for example, they establish that Mr. Bean lives in Highbury and rents his flat from a landlady named Mrs. Wicket.|$|E
