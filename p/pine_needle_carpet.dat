40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} report {{was to develop}} a stronger understanding of <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> combustion behavior in a semi-gasifier, in order to ultimately design an effective <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> cook stove for people in the developing world. <b>Pine</b> <b>needles</b> are a cheap, energy-dense fuel source that can be harnessed for cooking purposes, but they are often physically or chemically altered prior to being used as a fuel. The challenge remains to develop a stove that uses unprocessed <b>pine</b> <b>needles.</b> Using principles of a semi-gasification biomass stove, this paper explores the combustion and burn characteristics of unprocessed <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> by measuring the effects of temperature in a configured burner when altering primary and secondary airflow into the burner. Experiments showed that <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> in a semi-gasifier combust in two regimes [...] one characterized by secondary combustion of volatiles released from the primary burn of raw <b>pine</b> <b>needles,</b> and another characterized by the smoldering of <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> charcoal. Each regime needed unique balances between primary air and secondary airflow. The first regime required a relatively low primary airflow with a high secondary airflow, while the second regime needed a high primary airflow to maintain charring and low or no secondary airflow. The balance of airflow in the first regime was crucial in determining whether the volatiles combusted or were released as plumes of smoke.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants known to be hazardous to human health. <b>Pine</b> <b>needles</b> and mosses are useful bio-indicators for assessing PAH pollutions; however, the differences in their PAH uptake mechanisms have not been sufficiently discussed.

Five sets each of <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> and moss samples were collected from circular sampling plots and analyzed for 16 PAHs. A comparison of PAH profiles revealed that the proportion of lower molecular weight PAHs (2 - 3 aromatic rings; LMW PAHs) was signifi-cantly higher in <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> (78. 5 % ± 4. 8 %) than in mosses (35. 4 % ± 6. 8 %).

Processed <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> are currently used as a fuel source, but in areas where the process of turning raw <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> into another fuel form is not feasible, the use of unprocessed <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> as a fuel source is required. Two stove top configurations, a spiral and C-shape configuration, were designed and tested in a semi-gasifier system under forced convection.
