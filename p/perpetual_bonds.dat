40|$|This paper {{develops}} a valuation {{model for a}} <b>perpetual</b> convertible <b>bond</b> when the price dynamics of the underlying share are governed by continuous-time Markovian regime-switching models. We suppose that the appreciation rate and the volatility of the underlying share are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, observable Markov chain. The states of this chain are interpreted as the states of an economy. Here the valuation problem of the <b>perpetual</b> convertible <b>bond</b> {{can be viewed as}} that of valuing a perpetual stock loan, or a perpetual American option with time-dependent strike price. With the presence of the regime-switching effect, the market in the model is, in general, incomplete. To provide a convenient method to determine a price kernel for valuation, we employ the regime-switching Esscher transform introduced in Elliott, Chan and Siu (2005) [4]. We then adopt the differential equation approach in Guo and Zhang (2004) [7] to solve the optimal stopping problem associated with the valuation of the <b>perpetual</b> convertible <b>bond.</b> Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed model. © 2009 Academic Publications. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Ruan was {{credited}} with explosive infrastructure growth, such as {{the construction of the}} Second Ring Road of Wuhan, the Baishazhou Avenue, and the Wuhan Metro Line 8. The projects significantly reduced commute times and eased congestion across the city. However, the endless construction also burdened the city's financial system. In 2011, total planned investment amounted to over 70 billion yuan (~$10 billion). To recoup the massive construction costs, the city issued debt through special financial vehicles, backed up by municipal land as collateral, which typically did not show up on the city's balance sheet (although this practice was common in other Chinese cities as well, at the time), including <b>perpetual</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|E
40|$|Would {{you prefer}} to receive a fixed rent {{for a period of}} 50 years, 75 years or {{perpetual}}ly? Well, if you have chosen the perpetual option, you are absolutely right. However, when considering a mathematical and financial approach, they may all end up roughly the same whenever the Net Present Value (NPV) is approximately identical. It makes common sense to choose the perpetual option even if the NPV exhibits myopia when computing the discount value of a fixed yearly rent. After a certain period, the discount value becomes approximately the same even when adding more yearly fixed rents. Corporations and governments issue <b>perpetual</b> <b>bonds</b> while recognizing these may not represent a very good financing strategy and thus implying that most of these issues are either callable or convertible on the issuer’s request. In approaching the existing perpetual debt related NPV myopia, this paper holds two main goals: firstly, we intend to study the behaviours of perpetual debt yields against other perpetual instruments and, secondly, we consider the financial methods for assessing the value of money before proposing a formula adjustment that might serve to overcome default NPV when evaluating fixed rents in perpetuity. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that vulnerable financial conditions of the corporate sector can trigger or worsen an economy-wide recession. This paper proposes a measure of corporate vulnerability, the Corporate Vulnerability Index (CVI) and analyses whether it can explain the probability and severity of recessions. The CVI is constructed as the default probability for the entire corporate sector, using the model of corporate debt by Anderson, Sundaresan, and Tychon (1996). The CVI is {{shown to be a}} significant predictor of the probability of a recession 4 to 6 quarters ahead, even controlling for other leading indicators. An increase in the CVI is also associated with an increase in the probability of a more severe and lengthy recession 3 to 6 quarters ahead.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{calculate}} the cost of debt capital which is theoretically compatible with long-term applications, and which can be used for firm valuation, as well as in cases where the equity value and its volatility are not known a priori. Our approach is based on a structural asset-value model, like the Merton model. However, we do not follow Merton’s restrictive assumption of modeling debt as a single zero bond with finite maturity. Instead, debt is modeled as a <b>perpetual</b> <b>bond</b> which pays a continuous coupon. This approach is compatible with the common method of discounted cash flows for firm valuation, where an infinite time horizon is considered. Furthermore, our approach has the advantage of no debt maturity being necessary as a model parameter. The approach basically builds on the model of Leland (1994). In Goldstein et al. (2001), we do not model the asset value directly, but instead consider the flow of earnings as the source of firm value.|$|R

He {{participated in the}} Vilnius Conference and {{was elected to the}} 20-member Council of Lithuania, but his role was more honorary and ceremonial. He formally presented thanks to the German officials for allowing the conference and sent a letter to Pope Benedict XV, but was not one of the active officers of the proceedings. On 11 December 1917, the council adopted an act that was demanded by German Chancellor Georg von Hertling and that called for [...] "a firm and <b>perpetual</b> <b>bond</b> of alliance" [...] with Germany. Such concessions to the Germans created a rift in the council and four members - Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis - resigned from the council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of 11 December, temporarily stepped down and Basanavičius chaired the session that adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918. He was the first to sign the Act.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the effect}} of capital {{structure}} policy on credit spreads? In a widely cited paper by Huang and Huang (2003), a few representative structural models of credit spreads have been calibrated and compared. Among them are the model by Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001) and the one by Leland and Toft (1996). The former assumes exogenously given stationary mean-reverting leverage, the latter optimizes its capital structure endogenously. Their study shows that all the models they calibrated perform similarly in that they all explain a very small portion of the observed spreads. We make three improvements based on that study. First, we correct a mistake in their calibration for the CG model. Second, the Leland (1994) model of <b>perpetual</b> <b>bond</b> was used for simplicity. We strictly calibrate the LT model with finite maturities. Third, we use the same set of targets, so the model comparison is more meaningful. We argue that leverage ratio cannot be an appropriate target for calibrating the Leland-Toft model. This differentiates our calibration approaches. All these three issues have not been recognized thus far and we address them in this paper...|$|R
30|$|The vast {{majority}} of literature studying portfolio allocation strategies across fixed-income securities has focused on a single source of defaults. Kraft and Steffensen (2005) analyze optimal investment in an asset defaulting when an economic state process falls below a given threshold. Bielecki and Jang (2006) derive optimal investment strategies for an investor allocating her wealth among a defaultable bond, risk-free account and stock, assuming constant default intensity. Bo et al. (2010) consider a logarithmic investor maximizing utility from consumption in market model consisting of a defaultable <b>perpetual</b> <b>bond,</b> default-free stock, and money market account. Capponi and Figueroa-López (2014) study an economy consisting of a stock and of a defaultable bond whose price processes are modulated by an observable Markov chain. Jiao and Pham (2011) decompose a global optimal investment problem into sub-control problems defined in a progressively enlarged filtration in an economy consisting of a risk-free bond and a stock subject to counterparty risk. Few other studies have considered portfolio frameworks consisting of multiple defaultable securities. Using a static model, Giesecke et al. (2014) study the portfolio selection problem of an investor who maximizes the mark-to-market value of a fixed income portfolio of credit default swaps. Bielecki et al. (2008) study how dynamic investment in credit default swaps {{may be used to}} replicate defaultable contingent claims.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of short-term debt on equityholders risk taking decisions. We show that if short-term debt limits the expropriation of debtholders by equityholders, it does not however reduce the loss in tax shields associated to a low leverage. We then examine the incentive for equityholders to increase the firm risk when debtholders rather hold the option to swap their <b>perpetual</b> coupon <b>bond</b> with short-term debt. We find that, compared to standard short-term debt, this restructuring option dramatically limits debtholders expropriation, increases leverage and reduces the loss in tax shields due of asset substitution...|$|R
