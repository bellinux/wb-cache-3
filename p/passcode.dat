25|$|On January 28, 2013, CapitolCouture.PN, {{a promotional}} {{site for the}} film's fashion and culture, opened and could only be {{unlocked}} with a <b>passcode.</b> Once in, {{a picture of a}} blue chair appeared and told readers to check back on March 4. On March 4, 2013, the site began to release portraits of the various characters.|$|E
25|$|Still another {{technique}} {{relies on}} a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time <b>passcode</b> for the login, requires active participation from the user, and {{is very difficult for}} a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.|$|E
25|$|Numbers racket: buying {{computer}} <b>passcodes</b> {{for industrial}} theft.|$|R

25|$|For those reasons, law {{enforcement}} now attempts to apprehend suspected cybercriminals with their computers on and in use, all accounts {{both on the}} computer and online open and logged in, thus easily searchable. If they do not succeed in seizing the computer in that condition, there are some methods available to bypass password protection, but these may take more time than police have available. Nor may it be legally possible to compel the suspect to relinquish his or her password—in the United States, where many computer-crime investigations take place, courts have distinguished between forcing a suspect to use material means of protecting data such as a thumbprint, retinal scan or key {{as opposed to a}} password or <b>passcode,</b> which is purely the product of the suspect's mental processes and is thus protected from compelled disclosure by the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{telephone}} calls between North Dakota and Tokugen Numataka (chairman of the Japanese computer company Numatech) reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado {{in order to}} gain access to the <b>passcode</b> on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. At the NSA, Fletcher's investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to bypass Gauntlet (NSA's virus/worm filter). However, Chartrukian is murdered after being pushed off the catwalk in the sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Chartrukian's fall also damages TRANSLTR's cooling system.|$|E
25|$|At first, Android {{did not use}} a gesture-based lock screen, electing to just {{require the}} user to press the phone's Menu button. On Android 2.0, a new gesture-based lock screen was introduced, {{displaying}} two icons: one for unlocking the phone, and one for setting the volume mode, activated by dragging the relevant icon {{to the center of}} the screen on a curve (similarly to a rotary dial). On Android 2.1, the rotary dial was replaced by two tabs on either end of the screen. Android 3.0 introduced a new design: a ball with a padlock icon is dragged to the outside of a circular area. On 4.0, the option to unlock straight to the camera is provided, while 4.1 adds the ability to unlock into a Google Search screen by dragging up. Android 4.2 makes additional changes to the lock screen, allowing users to add widgets to pages accessible on the lock screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen. The camera is accessed in a similar manner by swiping from the right edge of the screen. Android also allows devices to be locked using a password, <b>passcode,</b> a pattern on a grid of 9 circles, fingerprint sensing, or with facial recognition.|$|E
5000|$|As {{they are}} {{constantly}} changed, dynamically generated <b>passcodes</b> are safer to use than fixed (static) log-in information.|$|R
5000|$|... "it {{will enable}} the FBI to submit <b>passcodes</b> to the SUBJECT DEVICE for testing {{electronically}} via the physical device port, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other protocol available" ...|$|R
5000|$|Depending on the solution, <b>passcodes</b> {{that have}} been used are {{automatically}} replaced {{in order to ensure that}} a valid code is always available; acute transmission/reception problems do not therefore prevent logins.|$|R
500|$|Several craft {{are also}} {{available}} when unlocked. Both the Millennium Falcon and a TIE interceptor are initially present in the craft selection screen. However, neither may be selected until the player enters the correct passcodes or achieves all bronze or silver medals, respectively, on the bonus levels. Two other craft can be unlocked, but each is confined to a specific level. One is the T-16 Skyhopper in [...] "Beggar's Canyon", and an AT-ST is playable in a basic demonstration level unlocked only via <b>passcode.</b> A playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 based on a car owned by the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember, is {{also included in the}} game as an Easter egg.|$|E
500|$|Rogue Squadron {{includes}} {{a number of}} unlockable secrets. The player can unlock three bonus levels: [...] "Beggar's Canyon", [...] "The Death Star Trench Run" [...] and [...] "The Battle of Hoth". These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze, silver or gold medals, respectively, on each level. Alternatively, they can be unlocked via <b>passcode.</b> Unlike the game's primary levels, the bonus levels are adaptions of events from the Star Wars films. [...] "Beggar's Canyon" [...] allows the player to reenact the race mentioned in , while [...] "The Death Star Trench Run" [...] allows the player to execute an alternate version of the movie's climactic battle. In the [...] "Battle of Hoth" [...] bonus level, the player can join the Rebel Alliance's combat against Imperial troops, as depicted in The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 2016, Pitchfork Media {{reported}} that Jai and A.K. Paul {{had created the}} Paul Institute. Although {{the nature of this}} project was not disclosed at the time, a press release revealed that it is a collaboration between the brothers, and artist Muz Azar, with the intent of also potentially introducing other artists. Devoid of information, its website prompted visitors to provide their country and telephone number in order to receive a <b>passcode</b> which granted access to updates. DIY writer Tom Connick commented on the attention the project captured saying: [...] "With little effort and even less output, Jai and A.K. Paul quickly built up the kind of mystique thousands of bedroom producers and their pricey publicists would kill for. Zane Lowe premiered [...] "Landcruisin three days later on his Beats 1 radio programme, where it was played three consecutive times; he described it as [...] "Blade Runner pop". The song was made available that day for Paul Institute members through digital download and streaming, while public SoundCloud and iTunes releases were enabled on 25 March. A limited-edition, autographed 7" [...] vinyl record, exclusive to registered users of the Paul Institute, was also released.|$|E
50|$|Game {{progress}} is marked with numerical <b>passcodes</b> that are given after specific {{points of the}} game (12 in the disc version, 16 in the CD), allowing the player to resume playing from that chapter.|$|R
50|$|Instant Group Calling - One-touch {{calling from}} within the app between any number of {{coworkers}} without dial-in <b>passcodes.</b> A dedicated number is saved into the phone's contact list so the user knows when they receive a group call.|$|R
25|$|Sirius Stiletto 2– {{the newest}} {{portable}} Sirius radio. A slimmer, improved {{version of the}} Stilleto 100. Has microSD slot behind battery for storing MP3/WMA files and playlists (not Sirius content). Wi-Fi support expanded to handle WPA and WPA2 (non-Enterprise) with <b>passcodes.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Sega Channel service (also {{known as}} [...] "Sega On The Line") hosted up to 50 Genesis games {{at any one}} time. [...] Titles would rotate monthly; however, some updates {{happened}} on a weekly basis. [...] Games for the service included titles developed by Sega, such as Sonic & Knuckles, Eternal Champions, and Space Harrier II; as well as titles developed by licensees of Sega, such as Bubsy 2 and Aladdin. Some of these games had reduced content compared to their cartridge release {{so that they could}} fit the adapter's memory, such as Super Street Fighter II. Sega Channel also hosted games in some regions that would not receive a cartridge release, such as Pulseman, , and Alien Soldier, which were hosted on the service in North America. [...] The service also offered demos of upcoming games, such as Primal Rage. [...] Though games and demos rotated on a regular basis, categories into which games were placed remained static and did not change. [...] With parental controls in mind, all games for the service received a rating from the Videogame Rating Council. [...] The service also contained a lockout system which would allow parents to set a <b>passcode</b> in order to access mature rated content.|$|E
2500|$|... iOS 7.0.2 was {{released}} on September 26, 2013. The update fixed bugs that could allow someone to bypass the lock screen <b>passcode,</b> and reintroduced a Greek keyboard option for <b>passcode</b> entry.|$|E
2500|$|Apple {{has made}} clear its stance on privacy and as such has made {{available}} Transparency Reports on the Governmental Requests it receives. Apple states plainly, [...] "On devices running iOS 8 and later versions, your personal data is placed {{under the protection of}} your <b>passcode.</b> For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user's <b>passcode,</b> which Apple does not possess." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{publishing}} industry practice {{that has been}} highly criticized is [...] "bundling," [...] or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a textbook. [...] Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and workbooks to online <b>passcodes</b> and bonus material. Students do not always {{have the option to}} purchase these items separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.|$|R
2500|$|The devices {{on display}} in stores are {{equipped}} with special demo versions of their respective operating systems. iOS devices prevent <b>passcodes</b> from being enabled and Mac computers revert to original state after a reboot. Additionally, in case of theft, a security measure renders devices useless, by activating a [...] "kill switch" [...] disabling them once out-of-reach of the store's Wi-Fi network.|$|R
50|$|Generally this {{is harder}} to achieve because the device {{original}} equipment manufacturer needs to secure against arbitrary reading of memory; therefore, a device may be locked to a certain operator. To get around this security, mobile forensics tool vendors often develop their own boot loaders, enabling the forensic tool to access the memory (and often, also to bypass user <b>passcodes</b> or pattern locks).|$|R
2500|$|... iOS 9 {{introduces}} multiple security enhancements. It {{introduces a}} 6-digit <b>passcode</b> as a default, an extra two digits {{from the previous}} 4-digit default, as well as support for two-factor authentication.|$|E
2500|$|An [...] "Emergency SOS" [...] feature {{has been}} added that {{disables}} Touch ID after pressing the Sleep/Wake button five times in quick succession. It prevents Touch ID from working until the iPhone's <b>passcode</b> has been entered.|$|E
2500|$|... iOS 7.0.1 was {{released}} on September 20, 2013 specifically for the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S. The update included bug fixes that allow users to purchase iTunes content with the Touch ID fingerprint recognition scanner rather than with a <b>passcode.</b>|$|E

50|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised by cyber {{forensics}} experts at the University of Massachusetts who have developed a way to steal smartphone and tablet passwords using Google Glass. The specialists developed a software program that uses Google Glass to track finger shadows as someone types in their password. Their program then converts the touchpoints into the keys they were touching, allowing them to catch the <b>passcodes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Grappling Hook is a first-person shooter {{video game}} which {{contains}} both platform and puzzle elements. It {{was released on}} September 18, 2009 for the Windows platform and on September 21 for Mac OS X, a Linux version was later released. The player must collect <b>passcodes</b> from throughout 31 three dimensional stages, using the titular grappling hook to swing from green surfaces in order to progress.|$|R
2500|$|Around 11:30, two {{armed and}} hooded men burst {{first into the}} wrong address at number 6 Rue Nicolas-Appert, {{shouting}} [...] "Is this Charlie Hebdo?" [...] and threatening people. [...] After realising their mistake and firing a bullet through a glass door, the two men left for number 10. There, they encountered cartoonist Corinne [...] "Coco" [...] Rey outside. They used threats to force her to key in the <b>passcode</b> to the door.|$|E
5000|$|... iOS 7.0.2 was {{released}} on September 26, 2013. The update fixed bugs that could allow someone to bypass the lock screen <b>passcode,</b> and reintroduced a Greek keyboard option for <b>passcode</b> entry.|$|E
5000|$|Passcodes {{are used}} in this version to save progress. When Snake is killed by the enemy, the player is given a choice to {{continue}} the game from the last checkpoint or quit and resume later with the given <b>passcode.</b> The <b>passcode</b> keeps track of Snake's rank (which also determines his checkpoint in this version), inventory, hostages rescued, bosses defeated and certain event flags. One particular <b>passcode</b> featured in the Japanese and North American version, in which the player types the expletive [...] "fuck me" [...] and fills the remaining spaces with [...] "1", will transport the player to the final battle with no equipment. This resulted in the <b>passcode</b> system being altered for the European versions of the game.|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} data being stored on Mobile Devices, {{particularly}} Android Devices, is increasing rapidly. Using <b>passcodes</b> to lock applications solves this problem to some extent but, this only protects the data and does not provide any information about the intruder’s identity. This paper explores existing technologies {{that can be used}} to store the identity of the intruder and inform the users about intrusion in real time...|$|R
50|$|The fireflies freed {{show the}} {{location}} of Knightbrace's Cavity Cave, from where Numbuh 1 must find the <b>passcodes</b> to open the path to Knightbrace's lair. Once here, Numbuh 1 will have to cross a river of pure floride and get to a Dentadrone spawner to short circuit the entrance to Knightbrace's lair. Once in the lair, Numbuh 1 finds Knightbrace in his Dental Assault Chair.|$|R
50|$|Later, Grand Admiral Thrawn and Tyber (in his new flagship, the Merciless) clash {{in space}} above Imperial planet Carida. During the battle, Bossk steals the {{artifact}} and heads towards Thrawn's ship, the Star Destroyer Admonitor. Thrawn retreats shortly after, however Tyber planted a tracking device on the artifact earlier, {{allowing him to}} track it to Coruscant where he, Urai, and Silri raid the Emperor's personal data center, retrieving the Sith artifact and obtaining <b>passcodes</b> for the Emperor's flagship, the under-construction Eclipse-class Super Star Destroyer.|$|R
