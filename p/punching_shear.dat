40|$|A {{significant}} challenge faced {{when using}} blanking/piercing to machine sheet metal is {{the handling of}} the shearing force required for high strength and thick stock. Increased shearing forces lead to the requirement of higher performance expected from the pressing machine and result in increased wear on the punch tool and die.

One of the techniques used to reduce the force required is the employment of a <b>punch</b> <b>shear</b> angle.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of slender flat slabs with minimised column dimensions lead to higher stresses {{in the vicinity of}} the loaded area. Therefore the application of <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> reinforcement or prestressing is often necessary. Despite different design concepts in international building codes the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> resistance without shear reinforcement shows only minor differences. In contrast considerable differences can be observed for the maximum <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of stirrups as shear reinforcement. For the experimental verification 21 punching tests on interior and edge column-slab connections with and without prestressing have been performed. Stirrups, double-headed studs, lattice girders, steel plates and shearheads have been used as shear reinforcement. The experimental investigations and the comparison with tests from literature prove that the anchorage behaviour of the shear reinforcement significantly influences the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of thin flat slabs. This applies in particular for the usable design steel stress and therefore the efficiency of the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> reinforcement. Furthermore the tests with double-headed studs and steel plates showed higher <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacities with increasing amount of shear reinforcement {{in the vicinity of the}} column due to decreased shear crack widths. The calculation of the maximum <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacity in analogy to the capacity of the concrete compression strut of beams as used in Eurocode 2 leads to inapplicable results for all investigated types of <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> reinforcement. The evaluation of the test results proves that in dependence of the geometric parameters noticeable higher as well as lower <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> resistances can be observed. In fact, the maximum <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacity is limited by the resistance of the concrete compression zone at the column face. Therefore, the maximum <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacity should be described by a multiple of the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacity without shear reinforcement. This will lead to applicable results for slabs with thin to medium slab heights. For thick slabs the influence of the anchorage behaviour will decrease. The numerical investigations on prestressed slabs showed good correlation between the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> resistance and the slab rotation at the column face due to prestressing. The consideration of the vertical components of inclined tendons at the control perimeter as often used in building codes is not appropriate.

Through <b>shear</b> <b>punch</b> and miniature tensile testing techniques involving annealed 304 stainless steel, it was demonstrated that surface roughness had no influence on the observed mechanical properties.

A continuum material model for ice rubble was developed and implemented into commercial finite element software ABAQUS/Standard. The constitutive law was written in similar form to that used in the plasticity theory based on the strain decomposition into elastic and plastic parts.

Good agreement in the load-displacement relationship was achieved by calibrating the material parameters to fit the full-scale measurements.

The failure progression in the keel and the relation between the failure modes (compaction and shear) depended strongly on the friction angle.

The contribution of the platform to the bearing capacity is computed using a coefficient of <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> which reflects the mobilised shearing resistance within the granular fill from which the platform is constructed. This paper investigates the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> coefficients using in computing the bearing capacity of layered soils. Finite Element Limit Analysis is used to obtain {{upper and lower bounds}} on the ultimate bearing capacity of layered soil system. <b>Punching</b> <b>shear</b> coefficients are obtained by back-calculating the ultimate bearing capacity of layered soils following the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> model by Meyerhof. The presented coefficients predict the actual ultimate bearing capacity of working platforms {{for a wide range of}} design conditions with 5 percent error or less...|$|E
40|$|The <b>shear</b> <b>punch</b> {{experiment}} {{is a small}} specimen testing technique {{that has been used}} to assess the flow properties, such as strength and ductility, of traditional engineering alloys when material availability is limited. In the present study, the applicability of a laboratory <b>shear</b> <b>punch</b> testing system, which was fabricated to evaluate the mechanical properties of different materials (steels, aluminium alloys, copper alloys, titanium alloys and cobalt alloys), was extended to include tensile mechanical property assessment of discontinuously reinforced metal matrix composites. In employing this testing technique to discontinuously reinforced composites, the <b>shear</b> <b>punch</b> load 2 ̆ 013 displacement data were examined to identify the critical regions of the flow curve, i. e. elasticity followed by yielding, work hardening, ultimate tensile strength and fracture. The load 2 ̆ 013 displacement curves and the fracture characteristics generated by <b>shear</b> <b>punch</b> testing were then compared with the conventional tensile data and failure behaviour in order to calibrate the method for composite materials. It was determined that the flow characteristics from <b>shear</b> <b>punch</b> testing can be used to predict the mechanical properties of discontinuously reinforced metal matrix composites through linear correlations for the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and percent elongation.

2500|$|Having secured these contracts, Roach {{set about}} {{equipping}} the Etna Iron Works {{for its new}} role. He began by hiring Thomas Main, a leading engineer with experience {{in a number of}} the world's most advanced engine works, as the plant's superintendent. Roach then began reorganizing the Works, adding a boilershop, machine shop, coppersmith shop and blacksmith, and equipping the plant with a host of new machines including traveling and swing cranes and the steam engines to power them, along with planers, lathes, boring mills, <b>punches,</b> <b>shears</b> and rollers. Amongst the new equipment was a planer capable of finishing 100-ton iron plates, and a lathe capable of boring a [...] cylinder—the two largest machine tools in the entire country.|$|R
40|$|Dam-bar cutting is a {{mechanical}} trimming {{process in which}} the dam-bar between the leads of an integrated circuit (IC) package after post-molding process and deflashing is pieced out. Premature wear of the dam-bar cutting tool leads to higher operating costs and loss of production. In this paper, an investigation has been made to study the effects of punch-die clearance, leadframe materials, tool materials, tool coatings, <b>punch</b> <b>shear</b> and cutting speed on the wear of dam-bar cutting tools. The relationships between the punch flank wear, burr height and the dam-bar cutting force are also explored. Hence, critical factors are determined to optimize the tool life and improve the quality of the dam-bar cutting process. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
