40|$|Welding in a MIG/MAG <b>protection</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is the {{the most}} used and most {{widespread}} method for welding. This method is very extensively used. Its only limitation {{is in an}} outdoor environment while working in the field, when the effects of external influences (wind) can breach the gas containment.

An important part of the welding device is the contact tip, which energizes the welding wire by electric current. There are many types of contact tips from the cheapest to more expensive ones. The requirement is to increase the lifetime of tips to the maximum in order to minimize replacement times. An Australian company making MIGfast tips has tried to increase the lifetime by using a ceramic insulator. This tip producer claimed as much as five times longer lifetime than conventional tips. Tests carried out by us, however, showed a very negative result in comparison with commonly used conventional tips...|$|E

In this paper, CZTS thin films have been successfully prepared on soda-lime glass substrates by solution-based deposition techniques. The CZTS nanocrystals were synthesized by hot-injection method from copper (II) acetylacetone, zinc (II) acetate, tin (II) chloride and sulfide powder in an argon <b>protection</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The as-synthesized nanocrystals were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The structure, morphology, composition, and optical properties of the CZTS films were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and UV-vis spectrometry. The XRD analysis demonstrated that CZTS thin films possessed a single- phase kesterite structure and no secondary phases were observed in the XRD diffraction pattern. The SEM micrographs showed the CZTS films were uniform, dense and had almost no voids. The chemical composition of CZTS films was nearly stoichiometric. The band gap was about 1. 57 eV and the annealed CZTS thin films are very suitable for the absorber of solar cells...|$|E

The {{purpose of this article is}} to present and systematise pollution reduction assessment methods and illustrate theoretical analyses with empirical data. Empirical results confirm theoretical considerations, which proved that the only method for judging pollution reduction, free of apparent disadvantages, is the Eco 99 -ratio method. To make decisions on environmental projects, financing institutions should take into account a rationality rule. Therefore the Eco 99 -ratio method could be applied to make decisions relating to environmental investments in the area of air protection.

30|$|Corals reefs harbor a {{significant}} proportion of marine diversity. Ocean acidification threatens to dissolve coral skeletons and convert reefs into algal dominated systems (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007; Pandolfi et al. 2011). The economic impact on ecosystem services provided by reefs are difficult to assess (Stoeckl et al. 2011), but there will be serious consequences for fisheries, tourism and coastal protection (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). Estimates suggest that current global loss in shellfish production due to ocean acidification amounts to some 6 billion dollars (US) per annum, and that this could rise to $ 100 billion, based on increased demand in the Asia-Pacific region (Narita et al. 2012). Degradation of marine habitats, loss of ecosystem services and the resultant decline in harvests are likely to have disproportionate effects in some regions, particularly those with high dependency on marine resources (Cooley and Doney 2009). The number of peer-reviewed analyses on the economic impact of ocean acidification is still small, but is likely to increase sharply, given the rapid rise in research papers now being published in this area. Appropriate methods for estimating costs have been identified and applied to ecosystem services in Norwegian waters. There were both positive and negative effects of acidification, but overall there was a large net negative outcome (Armstrong et al. 2012). In the final analysis, protection of the ocean may be more important than <b>protection</b> of <b>atmosphere</b> or land because it stores more carbon, mediates climate variability and provides essential ecosystem services (Steffen et al. 2011 b).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} research on ecological-economic modeling {{carried out in the}} Natural Environment and Climate Monitoring Laboratory (GOSKOMGIDROMET) in the period 1979 - 1987, embodied as a multi-goal, automated system (MARS). The system is designed to assist in developing air quality management strategies for urban and mesoscale regions. Management decisions on controlling atmospheric pollution are made in practice at several administrative levels, i. e., that of a republic, an economic region, a territorial-production complex, a separate state and so on. Such a territorial scale corresponds to the concept of a mesoscale region. One can consider a city as an elementary territorial administrative unit. At the present time, management goals for air quality are not simple. In addition, it is impossible to formulate a model capable of estimating realistically the state of the near-earth layer of the atmosphere. In cities and mesoscale regions, some hundred or even thousand sources of pollutants are situated and the emissions contain various harmful components. To decrease the pollution of the near-earth layers of atmosphere, some concrete measures (usually from 5 to 15) can be taken at each of the sources. Thus the task of identifying and analyzing the effectiveness of various <b>atmosphere</b> <b>protection</b> strategies is important. The MARS program package solves this complicated task for stationary sources. A mesoscale region and a city are represented in MARS by a regular grid of 0. 5 km to 10 km (usually 1 km for a city and 10 km for a region). MARS is able to analyze the effectiveness of various control measures. The application of MARS requires a relatively small data bank comprising two parts: (a) information on natural climatic features of the territory and parameters of emission sources; (b) information on technology to reduce emission sources. The first part of the data bank is well worked out and does not cause any difficulties. The second part of the data bank requires a design study of possible technological measures for reducing effluents at the sources. For this it is also necessary to generalize analogues for use in other cities/regions. Proposed models, algorithms, and program packages are used in the USSR as a basis for strategies of <b>atmosphere</b> <b>protection</b> in cities and regions...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedWithout the <b>protection</b> of <b>atmosphere,</b> space systems have to mitigate radiation effects. Several different technologies {{are used to}} deal with different radiation effects {{in order to keep}} the space device work properly. One of the radiation effects called Single Event Upset (SEU) can change the state of a component or data on the bus. A single error is possible to cause a system failure if it is not corrected. Besides error correction, a space system also needs the flexibility to be modified or upgraded easily. Consequently, the idea of having a TMR design instantiated in an FPGA to construct a Configurable Fault-Tolerant Processor (CFTP) developed. The TMR, which runs one program in three identical soft-core processors with voters, is a scheme used to mitigate an SEU. The full design of TMR running in an FPGA functions as a System-On-a-Chip (SOC). Both soft-core processor and FPGA offer the CFTP a great flexibility to be reconfigured. A complete TMR design includes some fundamental components besides processors and voters such as the Reconiler, Interrupt, and Error Syndrome Storage Device (ESSD). These components have their unique function in the TMR design. They are created and simulated. Factors that affect test bench-settings like processor pipelining are important to always keep in mind. A component is designed to implement proper functions first. Then it is revised to work with the processor and memory. The full design for the TMR in this thesis proves its ability to detect and correct an SEU. The follow-on research suggested is to improve the efficiency and performance of this design.
