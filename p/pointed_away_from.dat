25|$|Dawn was {{scheduled}} to be inserted into orbit at 05:00 UTC on July 16 after a period of thrusting with its ion engines. Because its antenna was <b>pointed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Earth during thrusting, scientists were not able to immediately confirm whether or not Dawn successfully made the maneuver. The spacecraft would then reorient itself, and {{was scheduled}} to check in at 06:30 UTC on July 17. NASA later confirmed that it received telemetry from Dawn indicating that the spacecraft successfully entered orbit around Vesta. The exact time of insertion could not be confirmed, since it depended on Vesta's mass distribution, which was not precisely known and at that time had only been estimated.|$|E
500|$|By 1902 they {{realized}} that wing-warping created [...] "differential drag" [...] at the wingtips. Greater lift {{at one end of}} the wing also increased drag, which slowed that end of the wing, making the glider swivel—or [...] "yaw"—so the nose <b>pointed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the turn. That was how the tailless 1901 glider behaved.|$|E
500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence <b>pointed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E

2500|$|Although no {{one else}} was charged, and {{evidence}} points to Simpson's guilt, the murders continue to be the subject of research and speculation. For example, Detective William Dear conducted a lengthy investigation, and his evidence and conclusions, among those of other experts (e.g., Dr. Henry Lee) who have reviewed the crime, trial, and evidence, were addressed in the BBC documentary, OJ: The True Untold Story (2000). The documentary claims that the police and prosecution had contaminated or planted evidence pointing to Simpson as the killer, and ignored exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, it asserts that the state eliminated too hastily other possible suspects, including Simpson's elder son, Jason Simpson, and individuals linked to the drug trade, in which Brown, Goldman, and Faye Resnick participated.

2500|$|Lou Smit, {{a detective}} {{who came out}} of {{retirement}} to assist the District Attorney's office with the case in early 1997, presented the case to the Boulder police in May 1998 [...] together with other staff of the District Attorney's Office. They presented 437 items of evidence, and concluded that the evidence <b>pointed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Ramseys. However, they were unable to successfully challenge the police department's steadfast belief that the Ramseys were guilty. The District Attorney's office sought {{to take control of the}} investigation. Due to the animosity between the police department and the DA's office and the pressure to obtain a conviction, Roy Romer, the governor of Colorado, interceded and named Michael Kane as special prosecutor to initiate a grand jury. Two of the lead investigators in the case who had opposing views, Lou Smit and Steve Thomas, resigned. Smit, who had worked for the DA's office, resigned because he believed that the investigation had incompetently overlooked the intruder hypothesis. Thomas, a police detective who later wrote a book about the case, initially cited health concerns when resigning, but later said he had done so because the DA's office had interfered with and failed to support the police investigation of the case.|$|E

There have been a great many theories about comets, but there is only one of them in which I have placed any belief. You know that as a comet passes around the sun, its tail is always <b>pointed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the sun, so that no matter how rapidly the head shall be moving in its orbit, the end of the tail--in order to keep its position--must move with a rapidity impossible to conceive. If this tail were composed of nebulous mist, or anything of that sort, it could not keep its position. There is only one theory which could account for this position, {{and that is that the}} head of a comet is a lens and the tail is light. The light of the sun passes through the lens and streams out into space, forming the tail, which does not follow the comet in the inconceivable manner generally supposed, but is constantly renewed, always, of course; stretching away from the sun!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{rejoice in}} your charming letter {{and find it}} most kind. I wrote to Bourget {{four or five days}} ago, so that you are not without my news (unless my misconstruction of the name of your villa has {{deprived}} you,) and meanwhile it is an immense satisfaction to have something of the detail of yours. It rather sounds, indeed, as if it were summed up in the one word (con rispetto parlando) perspiration--but I doubt if the difference between Rye and Nauheim has been other than that of the frying-pan and the fire. Here we have very sufficiently fried, and I have been moved to see the finger of Providence in the large, fat, dirty index of the bouncing dame who, to your vision, <b>pointed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Watchbell St. I have said to myself on the torrid afternoons: [...] "Les malheureux--boxed up with that staircase in that stuffiness--comment y eussent-ils survécu!" [...] Such reflections are what has principally happened to me--except, thank heaven, to get on more or less with my novel, the serial publication of which begins, in New York, on October 1st. I hope with all my heart that, in spite of everything, you feel your cure to be deep-based and wide-striking.... I am distressed that [...] "Maisie" [...] hasn't yet reached you, and will immediately write to London to see how my publishers have envisagé the address I sent them. But I trust she may perhaps be in the act of arriving--now. It is a volume the merit of which is that the subject--and there is a subject--is, I think, exhaustively treated--over-treated, I dare say. But I feel it--suppose it--to be probably what I have done, in the way of meeting the artistic problem, of best. The elements, however, are none of the largest. Let me thank you more directly for the solid cadeau of your so accomplished translation. I am only waiting for the first cool day to begin it: I shrink a little, otherwise, under the dog-star, from Naples and the ardent Matilda. But you will neither of you lose by it.... My affectionate greeting to Bourget. Believe me, dear Madame Paul, yours very constantly, ...|$|E
