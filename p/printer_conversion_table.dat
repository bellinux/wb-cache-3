40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate relation between Transcutaneous Bilirubin Index (TCBI) and Plasma Bilirubin Concentration (PBC) and to make a <b>conversion</b> <b>table.</b> One hundred and seventy five newborns (102 term and 73 preterm) that were been hospitalized because of hyperbilirubinemia in 2004 in Ali-Asghar Pediatric Hospital and Ghods Maternity Hospital were studied during 8 months. Serum and transcutaneous bilirubin of these cases were measured and recorded at the time of admit. Results showed that there is no relation between bilirubin and gestational age, newborn age, sex, weight and race but by using stepwise regression model a significant relation between glabellar TCBI and serum bilirubin in both term and preterm newborns (r= 0. 953 in term newborns and r= 0. 964 in preterm newborns) was observed. There was a positive correlation coefficient between two methods. With these two formulates: SBil=(0. 86 *TCBI) - 0. 82 for term neonates and SBil=(0. 88 *TCB) - 1. 32 for preterm neonates. A <b>conversion</b> <b>table</b> for changing TCBI to PBC was developed. Bilitest can be recommended for screening and evaluation of icteric neonates using the <b>conversion</b> <b>table...</b>|$|R

When examined in detail, it has been determined that neither grade <b>conversion</b> <b>table</b> of Council of Higher Education nor that of universities that have different pass grades {{have been able to}} provide a standard. It has been seen that while Council of Higher Education's grade <b>conversion</b> <b>tables</b> provide a transformation in favor of the students studying at universities with 50 pass grade the university, it provides a disadvantageous transformation for the students studying at universities with passing 60 and 70 pass grade and students' opinion also fully support this finding.

The increasing use {{of the international system}} of units for expressing the results of clinical chemistry and haemato-logy sets doctors, biologists and paramedical workers the problem of converting the results from the previous con-fused system of units into the SI system. We propose a simple method for establishing a conversion scale from one system to the other, irrespective of the parameter. This is based on a Hewlett-Packard 9830 A calculator equipped with a 9862 A plotter. The BASIC language is used.
