40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if there is a proper press sequence for a specific set of <b>process</b> <b>inks</b> on a specified type of paper. In the past, the literature on this subject has been of a qualitative and generalized nature. This study attempts to put the matter on a quantative basis under strict controls. A standard set of <b>process</b> proofing <b>inks</b> for web offset are chosen to be printed onto a coated type of offset paper by an IGT Printability Tester. Various techniques are devised for printing solid strips of the inks with minimum density variation across each strip and from strip to strip. The density range of each ink is found by employing various techniques devised by the manufacturer of the IGT, and by using mathematical formulas. The density of each ink is plotted against its ink quantity, as read by each of three filters on a densitometer: Green, Yellow and Blue. The GATF formulas for determining the color characteristics of <b>process</b> <b>inks</b> are then employed. The results are tables for each ink showing the theoretical density of each filter reading at specified ink quantities, with the GATF Hue Error, Grayness and Efficiency factors included for those ink quantities. These tables allow for the predicted result of any overprints at specified ink quantities by adding the density of each filter reading at the desired ink quantity of each ink. In order to be as accurate as possible, a special technique is devised to read both single and overprint densities of ink films printed on the IGT. Overprints are made using an IGT Printability Tester, and a densitometer to compare actual to predicted values. Under controlled trapping, all conditions are kept constant, but the sequence is reversed. The sequence that comes the closest to the predicted values is the preferred sequence. This is found to be: Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. Although a preferred color sequence does exist for the set of inks used in this study, it is pointed out that a change in this sequence may help the overall result in certain cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{permanence}} of printed documents and books {{appears to be}} primarily dependent on paper stability. Other researchers implicate pH as {{a major factor in}} the deterioration rate of paper and acidity as major the cause of this deterioration. During the lithographic printing <b>process,</b> <b>ink</b> is in direct contact with fountain solution, which can be acidic or alkaline. Fountain solution is a mixture of water and chemicals used to keep the non-image areas of a lithographic plate moist. On press the intimate contact of ink with fountain solution creates a fountain solution-in-ink emulsion. The emulsion used here is a stable suspension of fountain solution droplets within the ink. The objective of this study was to determine if ink/fountain solution emulsion, which is printed on paper during lithographic printing, affects the rate of deterioration of paper. The stability of four commonly available papers was observed. These paper types were groundwood, publication grade, coated book, and uncoated book. Samples of the four paper groups were printed with four different ink formulations. The ink formulations were ink, ink and distilled water, ink and acidic fountain solution, and ink and alkaline fountain solution. Samples of the unprinted and printed paper were subjected to an accelerated - aging process by heating the samples for 72 hours at 100 C. The properties of unaged and aged papers were evaluated by pH determination, folding endurance, and tearing resistance. On the basis of statistical analysis of the data, inferences were made about the effect of the ink formulations on the paper properties. This experiment indicates that ink/fountain solution emulsion did affect the paper pH, but this effect is due to the ink with little change in pH due to the addition of acidic or alkaline fountain solution to the ink. The results of folding endurance and tearing resistance tests after accelerated aging established no clear pattern of variance that would indicate the differences observed in these properties were due to the pH change associated with the ink/fountain solution emulsions. Several unexpected occurrences were exhibited by this experiment. These include: groundwood was the paper least affected by the aging process; the pH of coated paper increased with the application of ink/fountain solution emulsion; a decrease in tearing resistance was associated with alkaline fountain solution...|$|E

The control units are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with control units towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the control units at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the control units and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the control units more strongly at the matrix. When the control units are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the control units are given an intermediate hardening. The control units are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing <b>process,</b> <b>ink</b> jet printing or by dispensing. The control units are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The control units can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The control units can also be light waveguides. The transducers are piezo electric, magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The control units are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the control unit application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The control units are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems.

40|$|The {{curing time}} and the end use {{properties}} {{are as important as}} printing quality for the printer. Shorter curing time equals more jobs and higher productivity each week. The latest available technology for decreasing curing time is Ultraviolet curing technology. This technology uses ultraviolet radiation as the energy source to excite the active site of the monomer in the ink to start the polymerization process. The desired result is a hard polymerized ink film. Another advantage of Ultraviolet curing technology is that the ink is solventless. The screen printing process has the advantage of being a single-fluid printing <b>process.</b> <b>Ink</b> is the only chemical compound to be considered in this printing process. Lithography requires compatibility between ink and fountain solution. Extensive research has been done to better understand the relationship between fountain solution and ink, primarily with conventional ink. The water pickup characteristics of conventional ink is mainly studied for the effect of water on the printing quality. Due to the nature of Ultraviolet ink, the water-ink relation is more complicated. The water pickup by the ink is thought to {{have an effect on the}} curing process. This thesis studies the effect of water pickup of ultraviolet ink on curing time and end use properties. The water pickup of the ink was varied by using three levels of acidity for the fountain solution. To simulate the actual printing condition, the fountain solutions used were those commonly used on press. Three resistance properties including film hardness, abrasion resistance and adhesion resistance were measured in this study for responses relating to end use. The effect of the substrate absorptivity on the curing time was also reviewed. This study indicates that the higher water pickup of the Ultraviolet ink needed longer curing time. There is a significant effect of acidity of fountain solution on water pickup of the ink. Curing time is considerably affected by the color of the ink or by the transmission properties of the pigment. Cyan acts like a neutral density filter on the printed film. Increased absorptivity of the substrate helps shorten the curing time. Water pickup of the UV inks affects its film hardness. High water pickup decreased film hardness. On the other hand, the effect of water pickup of the ink with regard to abrasion resistance and adhesion resistance is insignificant. Tack as a rheological property of the ink and the curing stages are also reviewed in this study...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} known that {{apparent}} trapping percentages caused by changing printing sequence (or printing order) affect the color appearance of the overprint areas. However, no other studies in the past were done in a standard color measurement system- that is the CIE system. This thesis was conducted {{in order to learn}} how the selected printing sequences yellow- magenta-cyan-black, black-cyan-magenta-yellow, yellow-magenta-cyan-black, and cyan-magenta-yellow-black- of a monotack <b>process</b> <b>ink</b> yield the color gamuts on the CIE LAB color space. Since the two sequences: yellow-magenta-cyan-black and cyan-magenta-yellow-black, were recommended to be adopted as standard sequences for SWOP inks, this reseach attempted to prove that these sequences printed by a web-offset press yielded the similar color gamut on the CIE LAB color space. How the abovementioned selected printing sequences affected the changes in the apparent trapping percentages were also studied. The color differences between the color patches printed by changing printing orders and those of the ideal inks were calculated and compared with one another in order to find out whether the overprint colors visually differed from one another or not. Moreover, how the trapping changed the color appearance of the print from what was expected in terms of hue angles and chroma shifts were studied. Last but not least, the colorimetric trapping percentages were also studied. It can be concluded from the findings that the changes of ink sequence of the monotack ink in the web-offset printing caused the wet-trapping percentages change. Thus caused the hue angle and chroma shifts which resulted in different color gamuts. It was proved that the two sequences yellow-magenta-cyan-black and cyan-magenta-yellow-black did not have the similar color gamut on the CIE LAB color space; they produced visually different green. The relationships between ink trapping percentages and visually different color appearance in this study can be explained as follows. It is found that the trapping of yellow over magenta did not yield different color appearances from the trapping of magenta over yellow. The trapping of cyan over yellow yielded different color appearances from the trapping of yellow over cyan, but the trapping of cyan over magenta did not yield different color appearances from the trapping of magenta over cyan. The densitometric apparent trapping percentages calculated from the Preucil 2 ̆ 7 s equation failed to explain the relationships between the red trapping and the color difference of the red printed patches from the red ideal ink. The colorimetric trapping percentages using the Preucil’s concept was proved invalid. Larger sample sizes and other ink sequences are recommended for the next study...|$|E

Decrease of rotogravure inks particle size was most obvious in black (from 482 nm to 231 nm), while the decrease of particle size in all other colors was rather similar: from 257 to 173 (yellow), from 270 to 193 nm (magenta) and from 282 to 207 nm (cyan).

40|$|It {{is known}} that colour {{reproduction}} of inkjet comprises a range of mechanisms. It was possible to understand and explain some of these mechanisms by evaluating print tests with standard optical measurement and by calculations using algorithms of the Kubelka Munk and Murray Davies theories. The combined interaction of the substrate, the ink penetration, the optical properties of the inks and the dot size were clarified. Large colour gamut is governed by low ink penetration, low light scattering of the substrate and small dot size. The non-ideal property of <b>process</b> <b>inks</b> and the continuous tone character of colour reproduction of the studied desktop inkjets explained the observed convex shape of the colour gamut. For plain paper, dye-based and pigment-based inks were shown to follow different mechanisms, with lower penetration of the pigment-based ink.

In a multicolor press the inks will be printed wet on wet.

The adhesive power between the wet inks is different and less compared to the adhesive power between one inkprinted {{on the top of a}} less wet ink or even a completely dry ink. The adhesive power between the substrate and printed ink isalso different from the adhesive power of one ink on the top of another one. Depending on this adhesive power and the inks’inner cohesion power the thickness of the second printed ink varies. The thickness or amount of the second printed ink on thefirst one can be determined; its value is called trapping. The amount of the trapping will also be changed due to differentparameters such as ink temperature, dampening, printing speed etc. An important outcome is that the gray balance and thecolor appearance (secondary and tertiary colors) of the printed product also depend very much on the trapping’s amount. Thatshows how important it is to have an explicit value for the trapping. The amount of the second printed inks will bedetermined by trapping formulas. This value should be useful for the printer at the press. Unfortunately, the conventionaltrapping formulas are only useful for the “relative” comparison of trapping between two print products. All the conventionalformulas for trapping only deliver the amount of the second printed ink on the top of the first one in percent. This value for itsown (e. g. 63 %) is not really useful and meaningful for print machine operators. There are three different formulas fordetermining trapping. These are Preucil, Ritz, and Brunner.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} method of using {{reflection}} density readings taken with a conventional graphic arts densitometer to provide a numeric measure of the visual difference between a sample press sheet and a reference sheet. This numerical measure was developed based {{on the theory that}} human response to variation in process color printing is more affected by changes in the proportions of <b>process</b> <b>inks</b> to each other than by variation in the overall inking level of the press sheet. The thesis then goes on to explain how the proposed system was tested. First, a set of color samples was generated. Observer evaluations of these color samples were converted to numeric values using psychometric evaluation methods. Using statistical methods, observer evaluations in numeric form were then tested against values obtained by using the proposed system. Observer evaluations of the color samples were also compared statistically with values from the Total Color Difference system as an additional test. The thesis concludes that the proposed system is a reliable predictor of observer response to color variation when the system is used for the purpose of comparing reference press sheets to sample press sheets...|$|R
