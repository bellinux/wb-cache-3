50|$|His {{partnership}} with John Mitchell ended in 1851. Shortly afterwards his factory on Little Marlborough Street {{was destroyed by}} fire. The last business premises was 38 Euston Road, London. He applied for several patents, including improvements in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>apparatus</b> for pumping or forcing air. and improvements in organs.|$|E
5000|$|James Watt Junior had {{collaborated with}} Thomas Beddoes in {{constructing}} the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>apparatus,</b> a short lived piece of medical equipment that incorporated a gazomètre. He then adapted the gazomètre for coal gas storage. The term gasometer, anglicisation {{was adopted by}} William Murdoch, the inventor of gas lighting, in 1782, as the name for his gas holders.|$|E

In acoustic inspection, inlet and outlet {{ports of}} component connected to <b>pneumatic</b> hoses of <b>apparatus</b> that rapidly reverses induced pressure differential. If loose particles inside this component, they will generate noise detected by series of contact microphones attached to component. Noise indicates general location of contaminants, and its characteristic helps in identifying particles from their acoustic signatures...|$|R

All laboratories are fully equipped with advanced teaching and research equipment. These include a wave basin, open channel flumes, water hammer and surge tank, rainfall simulators, hydrology apparatus, model sedimentation <b>apparatus,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> membrane casting, ion and gas chromatograph, autoclave, shaker bath, fume bath, and water quality apparatus and equipment.|$|R
40|$|Titanium {{coatings}} {{produced by}} in situ oxidation of Ti powder when air plasma sprayed were investigated using two different preheating temperatures, which induce different conditions of oxidation produced by moderate cooling (via high preheating temperature) and maximum cooling (via low preheating temperature). Surface morphology and microstructure were characterized using optical microscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis, while microhardness measurements and friction and wear tests were also performed. In addition, coated specimens were adhesion tested using a <b>pneumatic</b> adhesion tester <b>apparatus</b> in accordance with ASTM D 4541. Coatings produced with high preheating temperature presented enhanced surface properties compared with those obtained using low preheating temperature. More specifically, coatings formed using high preheating temperature presented higher microhardness, higher adhesion strength and enhanced wear behavior. © ASM International...|$|R
40|$|An organ-on-chip device, called Cytostretch (Philips NV), that {{is capable}} of {{mechanically}} stimulating cultured cells, {{is the subject of this}} study. The device comprises a microthin PolyDiMethylSiloxane membrane that is highly elastic, on which titanium nitride electrodes have been embedded. Its utility is projected in cardiac research to emulate the mechanically beating on the muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) of the beating heart and record the extracellular potentials simultaneously. The device is in its nascent state and requires validation through suitable experiments, for which a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>apparatus</b> was built. Following an overnight cyclic stretching, the membrane deforms permanently owing to hysteresis, which inhibits the formation of a uniform monolayer of cells on the membrane. There was a wide device-to-device variation in the noise levels at the electrodes in the MircoElectrode Array (MEA) recordings. Field potential recordings during spontaneous beating of cardiomyocytes cultured on the membrane were obtained successfully in the relaxed state of the membrane. The MEA recordings are however, accompanied by artefacts at the instance of stretching or relaxing the membrane which interfere with the field potential of the cardiomyocytes. The cardiomyocytes in the device died after their cyclic stretching, thought they were not detached from the membrane. In conclusion, the permanent deformation challenges the utility and re-usability of the device when uniform monolayer of cells is desired. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the membrane and metallic interconnect should be revised. The interference from the stretching artefacts hampers the quality of MEA recordings. The method of stretching needs revision to prevent damage to the cells and high frequency stretching artefacts. The susceptibility of the silicon chip toward optical noise during MEA recording omits the microscopic investigation together with MEA recording.

40|$|The {{selection}} {{of objects in}} the visual environment is important in everyday life when acting in a goal-directed manner. Here we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to investigate brain activity while healthy subjects (N = 15) selectively reached to grasp a three-dimensional (3 D) target stimulus presented either in isolation or in the presence of 3 D non-target stimuli. A <b>pneumatic</b> MRI compatible <b>apparatus</b> was designed to precisely control the presentation of 3 D graspable stimuli within the scanner. During scanning subjects were instructed to reach and grasp towards a target presented at an unknown location either in isolation or flanked by two distractor objects. Results indicated that reaching towards and grasping the target object in the presence of other non-target stimuli was associated with greater activation within the contralateral primary motor cortex and the precuneus as compared to the execution of reach-to-grasp movements towards the target presented in isolation. We conclude that the presence of non-targets evokes a differential level of neural activity within areas responsible for the planning and execution of selective reach-to-grasp movement...|$|R
