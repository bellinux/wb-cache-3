5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short <b>pulse</b> <b>on</b> the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the ways}} in which {{statistical}} dependence is manifested between frequency and amplitude deviations produced by a white noise perturbing an FM wave, is examined: it is shown that the noise <b>pulses</b> present <b>on</b> instantaneous frequency have a correspondence, probability near 1, with analogous negative <b>pulses</b> <b>on</b> the amplitude deviation. A detailed study on this fact is reported. An amplitude-phase correlation FM demodulator is proposed which, exploiting the above phenomenon, largely eliminates the effect of noise <b>pulses</b> <b>on</b> output, though giving rise to some non-linear distortion of the demodulated signal. This distortion can be kept within modest values as soon as the modulation index is sufficiently above 1...|$|R

40|$|In a {{wavelength}} division multiplexed fiber system, where <b>pulses</b> <b>on</b> different wavelength beams may co-propagate in {{a single}} mode fiber, the cross-phase-modulation (CPM) effects caused by the nonlinearity of the optical fiber are unavoidable. In other words, <b>pulses</b> <b>on</b> different wavelength beams can interact with and affect {{each other through the}} intensity dependence of the refractive index of the fiber. Although CPM will not cause energy to be exchanged among the beams, the pulse shapes and locations on these beams can be altered significantly. This phenomenon makes possible the manipulation and control of <b>pulses</b> co-propagating <b>on</b> different wavelength beams through the introduction of a shepherd pulse at a separate wavelength.
