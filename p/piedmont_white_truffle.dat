50|$|Oaks are {{keystone}} species {{in a wide}} range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. For example, oak trees are important components of hardwood forests, and certain species are particularly known to grow in associations with members of the Ericaceae in oak-heath forests. A number of kinds of truffles, including the two well known varieties, the black Périgord <b>truffle</b> and the <b>white</b> <b>Piedmont</b> <b>truffle,</b> have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. The European pied flycatcher is an example of an animal species that often depends upon oak trees.|$|R

The wild black truffles Tuber aestivum, T. uncinatum, T. brumale and T. melanosporum and the <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> T. borchii and recently T. magnatum are picked {{in a variety of}} forest ecosystems all over the country. The information which has been collected has initiated a national programme on truffle cultivation which, so far, has immense appeal, especially among young farmers. The discovery of carpophores of T. magnatum, the most valued <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> in the market, triggered the interest in studying the site characteristics, botanical and pedological, in order to help farmers to cultivate the species in similar sites. All carpophores were found under hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) along the banks of a creek on alluvial sediment. Soil analyses of four soil samples from truffle nests showed a narrow range of values of pH in water (7. 57 – 7. 78) and 1 N KCL (6. 94 – 7. 07) and a similar granulometric soil texture.
