40|$|This essay {{intends to}} provide an {{understanding}} of the developments in the right of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> and recreational activities in the forests of Sweden, and which factors and prerequisites that have affected this development. The forest and its history, along with recreational development has in many ways shaped today’s rights of <b>public</b> <b>access,</b> but there is also an age-old tradition of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> that has affected how we have used the forest, and that also has enabled the development of outdoor recreation. Many are unaware of this, which causes misunderstanding to appear around the rights of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> and how {{it is supposed to be}} used. The essay opens with historical descriptions of <b>public</b> <b>access,</b> the Swedish forest and outdoor recreation, to thereby provide a picture of how these three fields have influenced each other over the centuries. This is followed by a description of the current access rights and the problems associated with those, and a description of other countries' equivalent of the right of <b>public</b> <b>access.</b> The purpose of this is to see the differences between countries, and thereby clarifying what it is that affects whether a country has a tradition of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> or not. The essay concludes with a longer discussion in which the author weaves together the different areas and conducts a discussion around the essay’s questions of issue and supplementary questions to those. A discussion on the rights of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> and its history is necessary since there is a general ignorance on the field today. This ignorance is a serious threat towards of the rights of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> and can in the future lead to restrictions on our right to the nature...|$|R

40|$|Since 1972, the Coastal Zone Management Act {{requires}} all Washington State Shoreline Master Programs {{implemented by}} Island County and public shorelines managed by Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to promote <b>public</b> <b>access</b> while ensuring environmental protection. Human trampling of intertidal organisms poses serious threats to fragile populations and requires strategic management to maintain accessibility and biodiversity along public shorelines. Representing {{various levels of}} <b>public</b> <b>access</b> intensity classified by Washington Department of Ecology, <b>public</b> <b>access</b> criteria sheets and intertidal survey techniques {{were used to determine}} the amount of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> and biodiversity at 10 WDNR and 8 Island County sites. Biodiversity at previously sampled sites were compared to select study sites to validate sampling techniques. Management documents, interviews, and field surveys were used to determine the level of management at all <b>public</b> <b>access</b> sites using indicators established by Kreutzwiser et al. (1993). No significant differences were found in biodiversity between study and comparison sites, while several species were more abundant at high <b>public</b> <b>access</b> sites, suggesting higher accessibility does not negatively impact biodiversity, pre-determined levels of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> were not accurate, or other variables may be impacting biodiversity. Management scores indicated both agencies were very similar in protecting biodiversity and did not recognize unique environmental characteristics among sites that may be more related to varying biodiversity levels. However, Island County had a clear disadvantage in regards to budget, staff, and potential for collaboration. Despite the lack of site-specific plans, high <b>public</b> <b>access</b> sites are still effective in preserving biodiversity...|$|R

40|$|Libraries, telecentres and cybercafés are {{key points}} of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to {{information}} around the world. In this first study of its kind, named the <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> Landscape Study, a global research {{team led by}} the University of Washington’s Center for Information & Society (CIS) researched <b>public</b> <b>access</b> venues (libraries, telecentres, cybercafés) in 25 countries around the world. The goal {{of the project was}} to better understand the needs and opportunities to strengthen institutions that offer <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to information and communication, especially to underserved communities, and with a particular emphasis on the use of information and communication technology (ICT). This paper reports findings from this study, particularly in relation to the users of the different types of venues. Given that most <b>public</b> <b>access</b> venues are located in urban areas, and given the strong prevalence of cybercafés as the most common <b>public</b> <b>access</b> venues in the majority of the countries studied, a strong urban bias was confirmed. An age divide was by far the most significant characteristic of the surveyed population, with youth (15 - 35 year-olds) accounting {{for the vast majority of}} users of these venues. Also significant was that most users were high-school educated, and most were lower to middle-income.

40|$|Abstract: This Article {{examines}} {{the desirability of}} the universal recognition {{of the right of}} <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to legal information as a human right and therefore as part of a legal framework for improving national and global access to legal information. It discusses the right of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to legal information as a legal right and the importance of its international human rights framework. The Article argues that every person has the right of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to legal information, which casts a legal and moral duty on every government and every intergovernmental organization (IGO) with judicial and legislative functions to provide adequate and free access to its laws and law-related publications. It argues further that every government can afford the provision of adequate <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to its legal information and that the lack of political will to do so is the preeminent factor responsible for inadequate—and in some cases extremely poor—public access. Additionally, this Article advocates the universal recognition of the right of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to legal information as a human right and makes a proposal for a UN Convention on the Right of <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> to Legal Information. It provides the essential contents of the proposed UN Convention which incorporate The Hague Conference Guiding Principles to be Considered in Developing a Future Instrument. These contents provide valuable input for urgent interim national and regional laws and policies on <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to legal information, pending the Convention’s entry into force. The proposed UN Convention will significantly enhance global access to official legal information that will promote widespread knowledge of the law. It will also facilitate national and transnational legal research and remedy the chronic injustice from liability under inaccessible laws under the doctrine of “ignorance of the law is no excuse”—which is similar to liability under ex post facto and nonexistent laws—and promote the proposed doctrine of “ignorance of inaccessible law is an excuse. ” Keywords: Human right of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to legal information; <b>Public</b> <b>access</b> to law as a human right; United Nations Convention on the Right of <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> to Legal Information; Ignorance of inaccessible law is an excuse; Huricompatisation: human rights-compliant <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to the customary law of indigenous communities; Ignorance of the law is no excuse; <b>Public</b> <b>access</b> to legislation; <b>Public</b> <b>access</b> to judicial decisions; <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> to administrative memoranda; <b>Public</b> <b>access</b> to government legal documents;Public access to regional and international legal instruments; Free access to law; Free access to law movement; Legal information institutes Leesi Ebenezer Mitee, HND Town Planning and LLB (Rivers State University, Nigeria); BL (Nigerian Law School, Lagos); LLM (University of Huddersfield, United Kingdom); PhD Candidate, Tilburg University Law School, The Netherlands; Chief Lecturer in Law, Institute of Legal and Global Studies, Port Harcourt Polytechnic, Rivers State, Nigeria; former legal research consultant to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 1998, on a project that provided the juridical foundations for the ECOWAS Declaration of a Moratorium on Importation, Exportation and Manufacture of Light Weapons in West Africa (31 October 1998) which culminated in the ECOWAS Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons, their Ammunition and other Related Matters 2006.
