While the species is rarely eaten today due to its rarity, decades ago the species was so common that it was easily captured when it approached nearby villages.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have {{the same set of}} distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} hosts more than 12 species of helminth, with Cathaemasia hians and Dicheilonema ciconiae {{reported}} {{to be the most}} dominant. The juvenile black stork, although having a less diverse helminth population, is parasitized more frequently than the adult. A new species of Corynebacterium—C. ciconiae—has been isolated from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> flora of the species. A diverse array of predatory mesostigmatid mites—particularly the genera Dendrolaelaps and Macrocheles—have been recovered from black stork nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.|$|E
5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E

Action {{languages are}} formal models <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> language that are used for talking about <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> actions. Central to this method of formalizing actions is <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> a transition system, which is defined in Section 2. Then we consider action languages of two kinds. Action description languages serve for describing transition systems; examples of such languages are given in Sections 3 [...] 6.

25|$|Because of {{its origins}} in the Old Testament, early Church Fathers, {{especially}} those in the West, saw natural law as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> foundation of Christianity.

25|$|During {{the advance}} of Islamic science some of the {{practices}} of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were conjectural rather than empirical, and conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars through {{the suggestion that the}} Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance. Such refutations mainly concerned 'judicial branches' (such as horary astrology), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as medical and meteorological astrology, these being seen as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> sciences of the time.|$|E

25|$|As slavery {{disputes}} intensified in the 19th century, there emerged two doctrines {{within the}} Methodist Church. Churches in the South were primarily proslavery, while northern churches started antislavery movements. The apologia of the Southern churches was largely based in Old Testament scriptures, which often represent slavery as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> order of things. New Testament writings were sometimes {{used to support}} the case for slavery as well. Some of the writings of Paul, especially in Ephesians, instruct slaves to remain obedient to their masters. Southern ideology also argued that slavery was beneficial for slaves, {{as well as their}} owners, saying that they were offered protections from many ills because of their slavery.|$|E

50|$|As an art form, penjing is an {{extension}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden, since it enables an artist to recreate <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> landscape in miniature.

Penjing pots grace pavilions, private studies or living rooms, and public buildings. They are either free-standing elements within the gardens or are placed on furniture such as a table or bookshelf. Sometimes a lattice display stand is built which adds particular prominence to the penjing specimen and exemplifies the interplay between architecture and nature.|$|R
