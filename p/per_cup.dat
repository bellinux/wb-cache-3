This study investigated the relationship between habitual coffee consumption and renal impairment in Korean women, in consideration of diabetic status. Methods: This study involved 2, 673 women aged 35 to 84 years who had participated in the Fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, conducted in 2008. Habitual coffee consumption was classified into three categories: less than 1 <b>cup</b> <b>per</b> day, 1 <b>cup</b> <b>per</b> day, and 2 or more <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day. Renal function impairment was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Results: The prevalence of diabetes and renal function impairment was higher in women who drank < 1 <b>cup</b> of coffee <b>per</b> day. Compared with drinking < 1 <b>cup</b> of coffee <b>per</b> day, the odds ratio (OR) for renal function impairment was significantly lower (OR, 0. 59; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 37 to 0. 95; P = 0. 03) in those who habitually drank ≥ 2 <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day after adjusting for multiple confounding factors.

Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) of HNC risk associated with tea drinking, adjusted for sex, age, education, cigarette smoking, betel quid chewing, and alcohol drinking. Results: A reduced HNC risk associated with tea drinking (OR for every <b>cup</b> <b>per</b> day = 0. 96, 95 % CI: 0. 93 – 0. 99; OR for § 5 <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day = 0. 60, 95 % CI: 0. 39 – 0. 94) was observed.

40|$|Objectives The health {{benefits}} of ‘drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day” in healthy individuals are largely unproven. We aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between total fluid and the sources of fluid consumption, risk of rapid renal decline, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and all-cause mortality in elderly women. Design, setting and participants We conducted a longitudinal analysis of a population-based cohort study of 1055 women aged ≥ 70  years residing in Australia. Main outcome measures The associations between total daily fluid intake (defined as total volume of beverage excluding alcohol and milk) and the types of fluid (water, black tea, coffee, milk and other fluids) measured as <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day and rapid renal decline, CVD and all-cause mortality were assessed using adjusted logistic and Cox regression analyses. Results Over a follow-up period of 10  years, 70 (6. 6 %) experienced rapid renal decline and 362 (34. 4 %) died, of which 142 (13. 5 %) deaths were attributed to CVD. The median (IQR) intake of total fluid was 10. 4 (8. 5 – 12. 5) <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day, with water (median (IQR) 4 (2 – 6) <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day) and black tea (median (IQR) 3 (1 – 4) <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day) being the most frequent type of fluid consumed. Every <b>cup</b> <b>per</b> day higher intake of black tea was associated with adjusted HRs of 0. 90 (95 % CI 0. 81 to 0. 99) and 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 86 to 0. 98) for CVD mortality and all-cause mortality, respectively. There were no associations between black tea intake and rapid renal decline, or between the quantity or type of other fluids, including water intake, and any clinical outcomes. Conclusions Habitual higher intake of black tea may potentially improve long-term health outcomes, independent of treating traditional CVD risk factors, but validation of our study findings is essential...|$|R
40|$|Aims/hypothesis. Coffee {{contains}} several {{substances that}} may affect glucose metabolism. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the relationship between habitual coffee consumption and the incidence of IFG, IGT and type 2 diabetes. Methods. We used cross-sectional and prospective data from the population-based Hoorn Study, which included Dutch men and women aged 50 - 74 years. An OGTT was performed at baseline and after a mean follow-up period of 6. 4 years. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders including BMI, cigarette smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption and dietary factors. Results. At baseline, a 5 <b>cup</b> <b>per</b> day higher coffee consumption was significantly associated with lower fasting insulin concentrations (- 5. 6 %, 95 % CI - 9. 3 to - 1. 6 %) and 2 -h glucose concentrations (- 8. 8 %, 95 % CI - 11. 8 to - 5. 6 %), but was not associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations (- 0. 8 %, 95 % CI - 2. 1 to 0. 6 %). In the prospective analyses, the odds ratio (OR) for IGT was 0. 59 (95 % CI 0. 36 - 0. 97) for 3 - 4 <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day, 0. 46 (95 % CI 0. 26 - 0. 81) for 5 - 6 <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day, and 0. 37 (95 % CI 0. 16 - 0. 84) for 7 or more <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day, as compared with the corresponding values for the consumption of 2 or fewer <b>cups</b> of coffee <b>per</b> day (p= 0. 001 for trend). Higher coffee consumption also tended to be associated with a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (OR 0. 69, CI 0. 31 - 1. 51 for ≥ 7 vs ≤ 2 <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day, p= 0. 09 for trend), but was not associated with the incidence of IFG (OR 1. 35, CI 0. 80 - 2. 27 for ≥ 7 vs ≤ 2 <b>cups</b> <b>per</b> day, p= 0. 49 for trend).
