For the past 17 years it has been dedicated fulltime to SETI, {{and it is now}} being considered by NASA for selection as the NASA dedicated SETI observatory. The telescope was originally designed, optimized, and used as an all-sky survey instrument to create detailed maps and catalogs of the radio astronomical sky. For the SETI Program, some re-optimizations are required. Right ascension tracking for one to two hours (depending on the declination) was achieved by exploiting the exceptionally large f/d ratio of the telescope. The feed horns were mounted on a large moveable, rubber-tired cart which is capable of a total motion of 100 feet. The cart can carry many horns, making possible simultaneous observations at many sky directions and frequency ranges. Rapid declination movement and its automation will be accomplished through simplification of the existing braking system, and replacement of older mechanical sensors by modern electronic inclinometers and <b>proximity</b> <b>detectors.</b> Circular polarization capability will be achieved through {{an increase in the number}} of horizontal wires in the reflector mesh, or addition of a finer mesh on top of the existing one.

40|$|State-of-the-art {{smartphones}} and tablets {{have evolved}} {{to the level of}} having feature-rich applications comparable to those of interactive desktop programs, providing high- quality visual and auditory experiences. Furthermore, mobile processors are becoming increasingly complex in order to respond to this more diverse and demanding application base. Many mobile processors, such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, have begun to include features such as multi-level data caches, complex branch prediction, and multi-core architectures. The high-performance mobile processor domain is unique in a number of ways. The mobile software ecosystem provides a central repository of robust applications that rely on device-specific framework libraries. These devices contain numerous sensors, such as accelerometers, GPS, and <b>proximity</b> <b>detectors.</b> They are always-on and always-connected, continuously communicating and updating information in the background, while also being used for periods of intensive computational tasks like playing video games or providing interactive navigation. The peak performance that is demanded of these devices rivals that of a high-performance desktop, while most of the time a much lower level of performance is required. Given this, heterogeneous processor topologies have been introduced to handle these large swings in performance demands. Additionally, these devices need to be compact and able to easily be carried on a person, so challenges exist in terms of area and heat dissipation. Given this, many of the microarchitectural hardware structures found in these mobile devices are often smaller or less complex than their desktop equivalents. This thesis develops a novel three-pronged optimization framework. First, the compiler-device interface is enhanced to allow more high-level application information to be relayed onto the device and underlying microarchitecture. Second, application-specific information is gleaned and used to optimize program execution. Lastly, the microarchitecture itself is augmented to dynamically detect and respond to changes in program execution patterns. The high-level goal of these three approaches is to extend the continuum of the heterogeneous processor topology and provide additional granularity to help deliver the necessary performance for the least amount of power during execution. The proposed optimization framework is shown to improve a broad range of structures, including branch prediction, instruction and data caches, and instruction pipeline...|$|E

The robots calibrate themselves by driving each axis slowly to a target sensed by a <b>proximity</b> <b>detector.</b> Incremental optical encoders then track along with the motors to check for errors.

40|$|The Tag, Track and Location System (TTL) Program is {{investigating}} methods of tracking an asset using perfluorocarbon tracers (PFT). The success of any TTL method requires sound detection/location instrumentation. Tracer Detection Technologies Corp (TDT), through {{a contract with}} the Office of Naval Research (ONR), {{is investigating}} different detection systems. The detections systems generally fall into two categories; <b>proximity</b> <b>detectors</b> and standoff detectors. <b>Proximity</b> <b>detectors,</b> as the name implies, need to be in close proximity (e. g., meter to 10 's of meters) to the PFT source. Standoff detection searches for the PFT from a greater distance away from the source (e. g., 100 's of meters to kilometers). Gas Chromatographs (GC) are generally considered a proximity detection systems, {{but in the case of}} PFTs should be considered for both proximity and standoff detection with the caveat that in standoff use the GC needs to be somewhere in the PFT plume, i. e., generally downwind of the source. With a properly sized PFT source, the right GC can afford fairly large standoff (distance from the source) distances; 100 's of meters to kilometers downwind. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has such a GC system and offered to demonstrate the CDTA for TTL as a no cost addition to the TDTTTL project, of which BNL was a participant. BNL is a leading authority on the sampling, collection, release and detection of PFTs. In addition, the BNL team has extensive background in atmospheric dispersion, the application of PFTs to such studies and the development of applications utilizing PFTs such as building infiltration measurements, control room integrity determination, leak location and environmental investigations. This experience and expertise is essential in developing any PFT application were dispersion, dilution and overcoming environmental conditions and interferences are integral to success. BNL has developed sophisticated gas chromatography methods and instruments that allow detection of up to seven PFTs at part per quadrillion levels (1015) with sample times as short as 60 seconds. The Continuous Dual-Trap Analyzer (CDTA) was developed for leak hunting applications and can continuously sample the air for PFTs without interruption. Sample time can be as short as 60 seconds. The CDTA has been extensively used in the commercial sector to detect PFTs that have been introduced to leaking buried dielectric fluid-filled cables or leaking subsurface gas lines. The PFTs travel through the cable or pipe until they reach the leak site. PFTs then escape into the surrounding soil and permeate/diffuse to the surface where they can be detected with the CDTA. Typically a cable is tagged with ppm levels of PFTs resulting in ppt to ppq concentrations in the air at the leak site. The CDTA is proven to be rugged, reliable and has a proven track record of successful leak location. The application of the CDTA to PFT detection for TTL is identical to application for leak detection. The CDTA operator has a general idea, with a few miles of roadway, where the leak is located, but no specific knowledge of the location (it can be any where along the road). The CDTA is mounted in a Chevy Astro Van and is dispatched to the field. In the field the van is driven at nominally 15 mph along the road. The CDTA continuously samples the air outside the van (via a 1 / 4 -inch plastic sample tube stuck out a side window) until a positive detection occurs. The van then covers the road section where the detection occurred at a slightly slower pace to pin-point the area where the leak is and to direct soil probe samples. The soil probe samples take soil gas samples every 10 yards or so and the samples are analyzed on the CDTA. The leak can be located to within a few feet in 95 % of the cases. To date the CDTA has been successful in every leak hunt performed by BNL. One interesting case was a leak hunt that resulted in repeated negative detections. The confidence in the CDTA forced the utility to recheck its 'plumbing' which lead to the discovery that a valve was turned that shouldn't have been so that gas was being diverted rather than leaking (the pressure drop was due to this diversion of the gas to another line). For TTL application, a tagged item or person is known to be in a general area and can be located by detecting the PFT emanating from the tagging source. The CDTA can be deployed in the area and by sampling in a grid fashion (starting on the downwind side of the area of interest) can easily find even very small sources. The CDTA is a perfect match for this application and the leak hunt use basically a simulation of Track and Locate. No other PFT detection technology has the detection sensitivity, proven track record and ruggedness of the CDTA. For these reasons, BNL offered to demonstrate the CDTA for TTL as a no cost addition to the TTL lidar demonstration project. This report details the demonstration scenario and results...|$|E
40|$|Range-imaging {{instruments}} {{of a type}} now under development are intended to generate the equivalent of three-dimensional images from measurements of the round-trip times of flight of laser pulses along known directions. These instruments could also provide information on characteristics of targets, including roughnesses and reflectivities of surfaces and optical densities of such semi-solid objects as trees and clouds. Unlike in prior range-imaging instruments based on times of flight along known directions, {{there would be no}} moving parts; aiming of the laser beams along the known directions would not be accomplished by mechanical scanning of mirrors, prisms, or other optical components. Instead, aiming would be accomplished by using solid-state devices to switch input and output beams along different fiber-optic paths. Because of the lack of moving parts, these instruments could be extraordinarily reliable, rugged, and long-lasting. An instrument of this type would include an optical transmitter that would send out a laser pulse along a chosen direction to a target. An optical receiver coaligned with the transmitter would measure the temporally varying intensity of laser light reflected from the target to determine the distance and surface characteristics of the target. The transmitter would be a combination of devices for generating precise directional laser illumination. It would include a pulsed laser, the output of which would be coupled into a fiber-optic cable with a fan-out and solid-state optical switches that would enable switching of the laser beam onto one or more optical fibers terminated at known locations in an array on a face at the focal plane of a telescope. The array would be imaged by the telescope onto the target space. The receiver optical system could share the aforementioned telescope with the transmitter or could include a separate telescope aimed {{in the same direction as}} that of the transmitting telescope. In either case, light reflected from the target would be focused by the receiver optical system onto an array of optical fibers matching the array in the transmitter. These optical fibers would couple the received light to one or more photodetector(s). Optionally, the receiver could include solid-state optical switches for choosing which optical fiber(s) would couple light to the photodetector(s). This instrument architecture is flexible and can be optimized for a wide variety of applications and levels of performance. For example, it is scalable to any number of pixels and pixel resolutions and is compatible with a variety of ranging and photodetection methodologies, including, for example, ranging by use of modulated (including pulsed and encoded) light signals. The use of fixed arrays of optical fibers to generate controlled illumination patterns would eliminate the mechanical complexity and much of the bulk of optomechanical scanning assemblies. Furthermore, digital control of the selection of the fiber-optic pathways for the transmitted beams could afford capabilities not seen in previous three-dimensional range-imaging systems. Instruments of this type could be specialized for use as, for example, <b>proximity</b> <b>detectors,</b> three-dimensional robotic vision systems, airborne terrain-mapping systems, and inspection systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We are {{developing}} a non-invasive procedure for measuring contractile responses of both adult and neonatal mam-malian cardiocytes. This method can be em-ployed to quantify pharmacological effects of drugs on myocytes. Methods for quantifying neonatal cell contraction reported in the lit-erature have required the use of elaborate equipment such as a <b>proximity</b> <b>detector</b> or an atomic force microscope (to measure the increase in cell elevation as a cardiocyte con-tracts), and typically interfere with simulta-neous optical recording of cell signals. Such contraction quantification methods are ex-pensive due to the equipment needed. Our approach to contractile measurement is be-ing developed with the goal to be a practical and relatively inexpensive method. Our approach uses two different image processing procedures {{that allow us to}} pro-duce contractility records of both adult and neonatal cardiocytes. In our first procedure we analyze neonatal myocytes. Contraction curves generated from neonatal cells with our new method exhibit a very similar pro-file and time course to those produced by more sophisticated and expensive methods [11, 15]. Our second image processing procedure is an application that allows measurement of the adult cardiocytes area in each frame. Application of our two dimensional quan-tification technique to the study of adult cardiocytes produces contraction vs. time records virtually identical in time course and shape to records obtained from traditional one dimensional, cell boundary tracking pro-cedures [12]. The contractility graphs created by the two image processing procedures are consis-tent with the expected results and graphs re-sulting from past studies performed on my-ocytes [10].

40|$|This thesis investigates {{a number}} of transition-metal {{coordination}} polymers and iron-pnictide superconductors {{through the use of}} high magnetic fields, low temperatures, and on occasion, high pressures. The thesis will begin by describing my development of the <b>proximity</b> <b>detector</b> dynamic susceptometer, a novel technique {{that can be used for}} magnetometery and transport measurements in high magnetic fields. This technique is highly compact and has no moving parts, making it suitable for use in pressure cells, hence opening the way for a variety of new experiments. Through high-field magnetometery and other measurements, I will demonstrate that the pressure can be used to directly control the magnetic properties of the polymeric magnet CuF 2 (H 2 O) 2 (pyrazine). In particular, I observe a transition from quasi-two-dimensional to quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnetism at 9 ~kbar, driven by the rotation of the Jahn-Teller axis. I will then present a series of measurements on two coordination polymers, showing how a small chemical difference can lead to drastically different magnetic properties. I show that [Cu(pyrazine) H 2 O(glycine) 2]ClO 4 is an excellent spin-chain, while the sister compound [Cu(pyrazine) (glycine) ]ClO 4 is a dimerised material that shows a spin-gap and is disordered down to very low temperatures, but then undergoes a field-induced phase transition to an ordered phase. I will also describe a series of pulsed-field measurements of the upper critical field of the iron-based superconductors NaFe 1 - x Co x As across the whole of the doping phase diagram. It is shown that paramagnetic pair-breaking effects dominate the critical field when the field is parallel to the crystal planes. In the parent compound the paramagnetic limit is equal to that expected from BCS theory, but becomes significantly enhanced above the BCS limit upon doping. It is shown that the multi-band nature of the superconductivity leads to a convex curvature in the evolution of the critical field as the temperature is reduced.
