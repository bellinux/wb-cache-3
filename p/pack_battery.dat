500|$|The New Zealand riflemen soon {{gained a}} footing on Mount Royston, aided by {{accurate}} and rapid shooting from the Somerset Royal Horse Artillery Battery. By 16:00, the attack had proceeded {{to a point}} where Chaytor arranged with the 5th Mounted Brigade for a squadron of Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and two troops of the Worcestershire Yeomanry to gallop against the southern spur of Mount Royston. They easily took the spur, the defenders not waiting for the onslaught of the mounted charge. [...] From the crest of the spur, the Gloucestershire squadron shot down the horse teams of an Austrian, German or Ottoman battery of pack guns concentrated in the hollow behind the spur, and the attacking force began to surrender. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades were supported by leading infantry battalions of the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (which had just arrived) when Ottoman and German soldiers began to surrender en masse. At about 18:00, 500 prisoners, two machine guns and the <b>pack</b> <b>battery</b> were captured, and the outer flank of the attacking force was completely routed.|$|E

5000|$|The formal {{citation}} for Wilson's VC, {{published in}} the London Gazette in October 1940 {{when he was still}} presumed dead, reads: The KING has been pleased to approve of the award of The Victoria Cross to :Lieutenant (acting Captain) Eric Charles Twelves Wilson, The East Surrey Regiment (attached Somaliland Camel Corps).For most conspicuous gallantry on active service in Somaliland. Captain Wilson was in command of machine-gun posts manned by Somali soldiers in the key position of Observation Hill, a defended post in the defensive organisation of the Tug Argan Gap in British Somaliland. The enemy attacked Observation Hill on August 11th, 1940. Captain Wilson and Somali gunners under his command beat off the attack and opened fire on the enemy troops attacking Mill Hill, another post within his range. He inflicted such heavy casualties that the enemy, determined to put his guns out of action, brought up a <b>pack</b> <b>battery</b> to within seven hundred yards, and scored two direct hits through the loopholes of his defences, which, bursting within the post, wounded Captain Wilson severely in the right shoulder and in the left eye, several of his team being also wounded. His guns were blown off their stands but he repaired and replaced them and, regardless of his wounds, carried on, whilst his Somali sergeant was killed beside him. On August 12th and 14th the enemy again concentrated field artillery fire on Captain Wilson's guns, but he continued, with his wounds untended, to man them. On August 15th two of his machine-gun posts were blown to pieces, yet Captain Wilson, now suffering from malaria in addition to wounds, still kept his own post in action. The enemy finally over-ran the post at 5 p.m. on the 15th August when Captain Wilson, fighting to the last, was killed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> under high-rate {{discharge}} conditions produces thermal aggregation phenomena.

In this work a method has been developed which automatically dimensions an optimized battery system for defined vehicle requirements and a given set of battery cells.

40|$|The {{inconsistent}} {{characteristics of}} individual power batteries in {{a battery pack}} can seriously affect the performance and service life of the whole <b>pack.</b> <b>Battery</b> grouping is an effective approach {{for dealing with the}} inconsistency problem by grouping batteries with similar characteristics in the same battery pack. In actual production, the battery grouping process still relies on the traditional manual method, which results in high labor and time costs. In this paper, a robust and effective battery grouping method based on the characteristic distribution model is developed. Specifically, a novel characteristic distribution model is proposed to determine the grouping priority of different batteries. Then, an improved k-nearest-neighbor algorithm is used to decide which batteries should be group into the same battery pack. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E
