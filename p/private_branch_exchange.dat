25|$|During {{its first}} several years the company's {{business}} model consisted mainly of reselling <b>private</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PBX) switches imported from Hong Kong.

By 1990 the company had approximately 600 R staff, and began its own independent commercialization of PBX switches targeting hotels and small enterprises.|$|E
25|$|For {{corporate}} or enterprise use, {{a private}} telephone exchange {{is often referred}} to as a <b>private</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched telephone network. A PBX is installed in enterprise facilities, typically collocated with large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the local private telephone system and any private leased line circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a PBX or key telephone system in the office of a receptionist.|$|E

50|$|The term PBX {{originated}} when switchboard operators managed company switchboards manually using cord circuits. As automated electromechanical {{switches and}} later electronic switching systems gradually replaced the manual systems, the terms <b>private</b> automatic <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PABX) and <b>private</b> manual <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PMBX) differentiated them. Solid-state digital systems were {{sometimes referred to}} as electronic <b>private</b> automatic <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> (EPABX). , the term PBX {{is by far the most}} widely recognized.

We use least cost routing as an example service and describe an architecture which allows dynamically exchanging least cost routing data and logic while the PBX keeps running.

50|$|A {{business}} {{telephone system}} differs from an installation of several telephones with multiple central office (CO) lines in that the CO lines used are directly controllable in key telephone systems from multiple telephone stations, and that such a system often provides additional features related to call handling.
