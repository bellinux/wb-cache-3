40|$|Currently, the {{construction}} in Malaysia {{is using the}} common size for wall. The common size of wall is 102. 5 x 3000 x 3200 (width: length: height). However, {{in the use of}} small size for <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> which is called short <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> has not been utilized. By using the short <b>wall</b> <b>panel,</b> time and cost can be reduced which in the end contributed to intelligent use of time and cost towards the economic recession. This research is conducted to determine the structural behaviour of the reinforced concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> using short <b>wall</b> <b>panel.</b> The <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> is subjected to direct axial load through experimental work. Two <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> reinforced with single layer steel fabric of type B 375 (B 7) with a dimension 75 x 500 x 1000 (Width: Height: Length) were prepared. The aspect ratio (H/L) and slenderness ratio (h/t) of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> are 0. 5 and 7 respectively. Grade 30 normal Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with water cement ratio of 0. 55 was used. The wall tested under compressive axial load (without eccentricity). The end conditions of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> for this study are fixed-pinned. Experimental results show that both <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> failed in compression. The average ultimate load of both samples is 280. 62 kN. The average maximum lateral displacement 5. 06 mm, occurred at 375 mm height. The structural behaviour of single layer steel fabric reinforced concrete short <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> is similar to double layer steel fabric reinforced concrete short <b>wall</b> <b>panel.</b> This research is hope to provide evidence of short <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> and can be commercialized to the_construction field.

40|$|Steel fabric {{reinforced}} concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> currently use in high rise building especially construction industry in Klang Valley, Malaysia. However, practices use of recycled concrete aggregate as coarse aggregate in concrete mix for production of <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> {{is very limited}} as caused by limited of knowledge. Since that, {{a better understanding of}} <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> using concrete waste as coarse aggregate is important to wide spread use of concrete waste as course aggregate and to construct a safety and effective building. Thus, this research will study the structural behaviour of the {{reinforced concrete}} <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> with recycled concrete aggregate as aggregate. This research will be carrying out experimentally involve two steel fabric reinforced concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> with double layer of steel fabric type B 7 with size 75 x 1000 x 1500 mm (Width: Length: Height). The aspect ratio (h/L) is 1. 5 and the slenderness ratio (h/L) is 20. The <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> construct using concrete Grade 30 Normal Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and recycle concrete waste as course aggregate with a water cement ratio of 0. 55. The <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> will be tested under compressive axial load with eccentricity, e = t/ 6 with fixed at bottom and pinned at above edge until failure. Information found from this study will enhance the knowledge of reinforced concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel.</b> Experiment result showed that <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> 1 showed buckling failure where <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> 2 showed cracking at top and middle of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel.</b> The average ultimate load of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> is 1274 kN. This value was higher than <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> using natural aggregate and lower than <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> using concrete waste but tested under axial load without eccentric loading. Using concrete aggregate will increase the ultimate load of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> and <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> will easier to fail under eccentric loading. Using concrete waste as course aggregate in construction of <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> is better than using natural aggregate as the ultimate load is higher. The structural behaviour is same with natural aggregate in term of properties studied. Concrete waste as aggregate can be as an alternative to replace the shortage natural aggregate. Utilization of concrete waste also promotes reduction of wastage of construction material...|$|R

5000|$|Somewhere in the 1968-1969 timeframe, Muehleisen {{shifted from}} paddleball to racquetball, {{and won the}} first {{national}} championship in 1969, {{at the age of}} 37, by narrowly defeating his protÃ©gÃ©, Charlie Brumfield. Brumfield has explained that respect for Muehleisen ran so deep that when Muehleisen shifted sports, a large number of other players in Southern California (including Brumfield himself) also made the shift. Though racquetball was somewhat less gentle, Muehleisen extended etiquette to that sport as well, by establishing the official rules for the sport early on. His dedication to the sport brought him a devoted national following, and for many years, he had his own racquetball club (Muehleisen's Courts) in El Cajon, CA, with a dozen finely built concrete wall racquetball courts. He worked with contractors to build courts at other clubs throughout Southern California, and in the late 1970s there were dozens of clubs sporting [...] "Muehleisen-style courts". That expression came to mean a four-walled racquetball court with smoothly plastered concrete walls, a varnished suspended maple floor, and an overhead viewing gallery. Players tend to favor this style of court as the ball bounces more true than with the hollow <b>panel</b> <b>wall</b> courts that are also common. Muehleisen's courts contributed to Southern California's prominence in early racquetball, and while most of those courts have been converted or destroyed over the years, a few still remain in daily use. When a Los Angeles area club re-purposed their Muehleisen-style courts in 2009, they brought Muehleisen backâ78 years old at the timeâto video tape him taking the last swing on the courts before they were converted for indoor rock climbing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{national}} {{greenhouse gas}} {{reduction in the}} building sector, heating and cooling energy in buildings should be reduced. The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various thermal bridges. In particular, a metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall</b> comprises a number of thermal bridges at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce thermal bridges in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing thermal bridges. For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall</b> were evaluated. The alternative metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall</b> that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges. As results, the effective U-value of the alternative metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall</b> was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall.</b> In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall</b> building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall.</b> In conclusion, the alternative metal <b>panel</b> curtain <b>wall</b> considerably influenced the savings in building energy needs by reducing thermal bridges...|$|R

The influences of eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio on the bearing capacity of the compression <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> were studied, and the failure mechanism and bearing capacity of compression <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> were gained through the experiments of twenty-seven(nine groups) axial compression <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> specimens and twenty-seven(nine groups) eccentric compression <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> specimens. The analysis results indicate that the bearing capacity of compression <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> is obviously affected by the eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio, and there is a linear relation between bearing capacity and eccentricity distance. The bearing capacity calculation formula of the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> is obtained by regression analysis, which provides reliable gist for structural design of concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> buildings...|$|R
