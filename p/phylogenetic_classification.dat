5|$|With the <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>classification,</b> the taxon Labyrinthodontia {{has been}} {{discarded}} {{as it is}} a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem-based or a node-based classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy, and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy. If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in Amphibia, it becomes a paraphyletic group.|$|E

In current literature, P. alternata has been classified as potentially synonymous with another species, Parischnogaster timida discovered by Williams in 1928. These two synonymies may result in future renaming of the species. The closest relative is Parischnogaster striatula. In a <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>classification</b> study, P. striatula was misclassified for P. alternata suggesting close genetic relatedness.

500|$|Fish are the gill-bearing aquatic craniate {{animals that}} lack limbs with digits. They form a sister {{group to the}} tunicates, {{together}} forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term [...] "fish" [...] is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology.

40|$|Cadherin genes encode a {{superfamily}} of conserved transmembrane {{proteins that}} share an adhesive ectodomain composed of tandem cadherin repeats. More than 100 human cadherin superfamily {{members have been}} identified, which can be classified into three families: major cadherins, protocadherins and cadherin-related proteins. These superfamily members are involved in diverse fundamental cellular processes including cell-cell adhesion, morphogenesis, cell recognition and signaling. Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is the founding cadherin family member. Its cytoplasmic tail interacts with the armadillo catenins, p 120 and beta-catenin. Further, alpha-catenin links the cadherin/armadillo catenin complex to the actin filament network. Even genomes of ancestral metazoan species such as cnidarians and placozoans encode {{a limited number of}} distinct cadherins and catenins, emphasizing the conservation and functional importance of these gene families. Moreover, a large expansion of the cadherin and catenin families coincides with the emergence of vertebrates and reflects a major functional diversification in higher metazoans.

40|$|All recent <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>classifications</b> of {{flowering}} plants are never field-oriented {{and thus the}} teacher and the taught find them difficult to understand and practise. Therefore a new student-friendly, yet phylogenetic system is proposed here. Since the spectacular diversification and related dominance of the flowering plants are primarily due to the flowers, especially to the petals, the apetalous taxa are grouped separate emerging parallel to the petaliferous taxa. In the present system, the Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms) are divided to two classes Magnoliopsida (Dicotyledonous plants) and Liliopsida Monocotyledonous plants). At the base of Magnoliopsida are the primitive subclasses Magnoliidae and apetalous Hamamelidae. The Caryophyllidae evolved from the latter subclass while the former gave rise to the subclasses Malvidae, Rutidae, Rosidae, and Ebenidae. The highly evolved subclasses, Lamiidae and Asteridae are derived from Ebenidae. The Liliopsida contain five subclasses with Alismatidae at the base from which evolved Cyperidae and Arecidae on one side and Zingiberidae and Liliidae on the other side. The evolutionary strategies and phylogeny of all these classes are also explained. This article can be downloaded from www. ijpbs. ne...|$|R

Using these four novel cp genome {{sequences}} {{and five other}} previously sequenced cp genomes, features of the cp genomes were characterized in detail among species in the genus Lilium and other related genera in the order Liliales. The lengths and nucleotide composition showed little variation. No structural variation was found among the cp genomes in Liliales. Gene contents were conserved among four newly sequenced cp genome in Lilium species, the only differences being in two pseudogenes. We identified 112 genes in 13 functional categories, 18 of which carried introns that were conserved among the species in Liliales. There were 16 - 21 SSR loci (> 12 bp, > 3 repeats) in the cp genomes in Lilium and the genomic locations of these loci were highly variable among the species. Average mutations were 15 SNPs per 1 kb and 5 indels per 1 kb, respectively, in the cp genomes of the newly sequenced four Lilium species. <b>Phylogenetic</b> <b>classifications</b> revealed some discrepancies between trees based on the cp genomes and previous classifications based on the morphology and geographic distributions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDengue is a {{major public}} health problem worldwide. It is caused by four dengue virus serotypes, each further divided into {{distinct}} genetic subtypes. Strain typing is important for understanding the epidemiology and viral factors associated with disease transmission. However, most of the existing subtyping methods are expensive and technically unwieldy for timely, practical applications in developing countries. Here we describe a simple, rapid, PCR-based subtyping method, restriction site-specific (RSS) –PCR, which we used to analyze dengue virus serotypes 2 and 3. For each serotype, four primers targeted to sequences spanning polymorphic endonuclease restriction sites in the envelope gene were used to reverse transcribe and amplify viral RNA. These RT–PCR products generated distinct electrophoretic band patterns for different strains. Analysis of 73 dengue- 2 strains and 54 dengue- 3 strains representing a broad geographic distribution over several decades revealed that the RSS–PCR fingerprints reproducibly fell into 7 and 3 groups, respectively. These groups correlated well with previous <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>classifications.</b> This one-step assay should be widely accessible and allow more detailed epidemiologic investigations in dengue-endemic countries.

First, we introduce the use of <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>classifications</b> of the sequences to model parameterization. We also cluster the sequences, grouping together those that likely originated from the same organism. Analogous to iterative schemes that are useful for whole genomes, we retrain our models within each cluster on the initial gene predictions before making final predictions. Finally, we model both insertion/deletion and substitution sequencing errors using a different approach than previous software, allowing Glimmer-MG to change coding frame or pass through stop codons by predicting an error. In a comparison among multiple gene finding methods, Glimmer-MG makes the most sensitive and precise predictions on simulated and real metagenomes for all read lengths and error rates tested...|$|R
