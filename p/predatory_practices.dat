The settlement created a $72 million foreclosure avoidance program to provide relief to household borrowers who were at risk of losing their homes. The settlement came on the heels of an earlier $484 million settlement between Household, Attorneys General, and bank regulators from all 50 U.S. states.|$|E

500|$|Mikengreg first {{announced}} {{the game on}} March 1, 2012, and it was later released for iPad on August 9, 2012. Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with in-app purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that {{a quarter of the}} top grossing games on iOS used in-app purchases (albeit with <b>predatory</b> <b>practices)</b> and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, [...] "So far, humanity is proving to us that we can't have it both ways." [...] They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed. Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well. Gasketball had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads. The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.|$|E

In recent years, the number of predatory journals has risen and {{it is necessary to}} present a solution for this challenge.

Our ranking approach is based on Beall’s criteria for detection of predatory journals and it can help editors to improve their journals or convert their questionable journals to non-predatory ones. Moreover, our approach could help young editors to protect their journals against <b>predatory</b> <b>practice.</b> Finally, we present a case study to clarify our approach...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Serious financial problems can adversely affect unit morale and readiness as well as servicemembers' credit histories and military careers. If servicemembers experience serious financial problems, they {{may be subject to}} adverse actions such as loss of security clearances, criminal or nonjudicial sanctions, or adverse personnel actions including possible discharge from the military. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Social Compact, which is part of its human capital plan, notes that mission readiness and quality of life depend on whether servicemembers use their financial resources responsibly. For these reasons, Congress and DOD officials have expressed concerns about servicemembers' financial conditions. DOD is particularly concerned about the use and effects of certain consumer loans that DOD identified as being predatory. The 2006 National Defense Authorization Act required DOD to issue a report on predatory lending directed at servicemembers and their dependents. The mandate required DOD's report to include: (1) a description of the prevalence of <b>predatory</b> lending <b>practices</b> directed at servicemembers and their families; (2) an assessment of the effects of predatory lending on servicemembers and their families; (3) a description of DOD's strategies and programs to educate servicemembers and their families about predatory practices; (4) a description of DOD's strategies and programs to reduce or eliminate the prevalence of <b>predatory</b> lending <b>practices</b> directed at servicemembers and their families, as well as the negative effects of such practices; and (5) recommendations for additional legislative and administrative action to reduce or eliminate <b>predatory</b> lending <b>practices.</b> Following the publication of DOD's 2006 report, private-sector groups associated with segments of the financial industry raised concerns about the report's preparation, quality, and recommendations. Congress requested that we review DOD's 2006 report on <b>predatory</b> lending <b>practices.</b> Specifically, we evaluated DOD's approach and support in preparing its mandated report on <b>predatory</b> lending <b>practices.</b> This report documents findings that we briefed to your offices on August 17, 2007. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Predatory</b> lending <b>practices</b> in the {{mortgage}} industry cost Americans an estimated $ 9. 1 billion each year. Predatory lending steals hard-earned equity from individuals and disproportionately affects minorities, low-income families, the elderly, {{and their respective}} communities. On August 9, 2004, the Massachusetts legislature approved legislation to combat this growing problem. This recent legislation provides strong protection against predatory lending. Despite this positive step, nationally-chartered institutions remain virtually unregulated {{as a result of}} weak federal protections and the unwillingness of federal agencies to investigate or prosecute <b>predatory</b> lending <b>practices.</b> This Note concludes that true reform in lending requires a greater delegation of regulatory authority to the states or, in the alternative, stronger federal protections that match the efforts of states such as Massachusetts...|$|R
