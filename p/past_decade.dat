5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable.

In the <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E

Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
30|$|Standard {{numerical}} {{methods for}} partial differential equations are established {{under the assumption}} of classical differentiability. Routine finite difference schemes of first order usually smear or smoothen the solution {{in the vicinity of}} discontinuities as they come with intrinsic numerical viscosity. Standard second-order methods often suffer from the Gibbs phenomenon, where oscillations around shocks emerge. In the <b>past</b> <b>decades</b> so-called high-resolution methods have been developed in order to achieve proper accuracy and resolution for nonlinear, discontinuous problems as they appear also in RHD or MHD. High order explicit Gudonov schemes have been dominating numerical applications and literature for the <b>past</b> <b>decades.</b> This trend was amplified by the enormous advancements made in parallel computing over the <b>past</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|R

Over the <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> though, as Gifu's fashion industry has declined steeply, the city has begun developing other industries to support the local economy.|$|E

5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal.

For the <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
