50|$|FLD {{produces}} rapidly progressive {{weakness of}} tongue, face and pharyngeal muscles {{in a clinical}} pattern similar to myasthenia. Neuromuscular transmission may be abnormal in these muscles because of rapid denervation and immature reinnervation. Paralysis occurs secondary to degeneration of the motor neurons of the brain stem. It causes <b>progressive</b> <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> due to involvement of motor neurons of the cranial nerve nuclei. The most frequent symptoms at onset of <b>progressive</b> <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> of childhood has been a unilateral facial paralysis. It is followed in frequency by dysarthria due to facial weakness or by dysphagia. Palatal weakness and palpebral ptosis also {{have been reported in}} few patients. Both sexes can be affected.|$|E

He {{graduated}} at Heidelberg University in 1845 and he received his medical degree in 1855. He made original descriptions, such as the ophthalmoscope, the gastroscope or endoscope, and Kussmaul signs, besides the respiration named after him. He {{was the first to}} perform a thoracocenteses, peritoneal and gastric lavages. He rediscovered <b>progressive</b> <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> (previously described by Guillaume Duchenne in 1861), polyarteritis nodosa (which was described by Karl von Rokitan-sky en 1852), dyslexia, (described by Thomas Willis in 1672) and pulsus paradoxus named after him, but that was reported by Richard Lower in 1669. During his 80 years of life, he wrote about different issues and topics (cardiology, rheumatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and neurology). Kussmaul was a student and professional without limits in his observation capacity. He preached with his own example in pursuit of science: observation, hypothesis, experimentation and analysis...|$|E
40|$|Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease, typified by progressive bilateral sensorineural deafness, and neurological disorders, usually involving the lower cranial nerves. Rarely, the upper cranial and spinal nerves may also be involved. Typical symptoms presented by patients include neurosensory deafness, weakness of facial and neck muscles, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulties, atrophic tongue with facsiculations, and occasional mental retardation and vocal cord paralysis. Only a few more than 30 cases of this disease have been reported worldwide. It {{has been reported that}} the sex ratio for the disease is 1 male: 5 females, with an even greater bias towards females in familial cases. Differential diagnosis includes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <b>progressive</b> <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> of Fazio-Londe, Nathalie syndrome, Boltshauser syndrome, and Madras disease. Molecular Genetics BVL syndrome has been known to show familial, as well as sporadic occurrence. Majority of the familial cases show an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

40|$|In this {{retrospective}} (1980 - 1998) study, we have analyzed clinico-demographically, {{from the}} records of the University Hospital of Fortaleza (Brazil), a group of 87 patients showing signs and symptoms of motor neuron diseases (MNDs). Their diagnosis was determined clinically and laboratorially. The WFN criteria were used for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnosis. The clinico-demographic analysis of the 87 cases of MNDs showed that 4 were diagnosed as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), 5 cases as ALS subsets: 2 as <b>progressive</b> <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> (PBP), 2 as progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) and 1 as monomelic amyotrophy (MA), and 78 cases of ALS. The latter comprised 51 males and 27 females, {{with a mean age of}} 42. 02 years. They were sub-divided into 4 groups according to age: from 15 to 29 years (n= 17), 30 to 39 years (n= 18), 40 to 69 years (n= 39) and 70 to 78 years (n= 4). From the 78 ALS patients, 76 were of the classic sporadic form whilst only 2 were of the familial form. The analysis of the 87 patients with MNDs from the University Hospital of Fortaleza showed a predominance of ALS patients, with a high number of cases of juvenile and early onset adult sporadic ALS...|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} PBP is unknown. One form of PBP {{is found to}} occur within {{patients}} that have a CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutation.

40|$|SUMMARY Haptoglobin (Hp) {{groups were}} {{investigated}} in 81 patients with motor neuron disease. A significant excess of heterozygotes was observed, accentuated among males {{and in the}} {{progressive spinal muscular atrophy}} subgroup. The results are discussed in terms of a possible influence of Hp in the immunological response. Motor neuron disease is a progressive disorder of the upper and lower motor neurons. Affected individuals become severely disabled and many die within a few years. Most cases are sporadic but 5 - 10 % occur in a familial pattern suggesting autosomal dominant in-heritance. 1 A slight male overrepresentation is often observed. Three clinical varieties are recognised, de-pending on involvement of upper or lower motor neu-rons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shows signs of upper and lower motor neuron disorder, whereas <b>progressive</b> <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> (PBP) and progressive spinal muscular atrophy (PSMA) show only lower motor neuron signs. With time the symptomatologies of these variants often merge and in late stages of the disease subgroups are difficult to distinguish. The cause and pathogenesis of motor neuron dis-ease are unknown and various aetiologies, such as viral, immunological, genetic and environmental, have been proposed. 2 3 On the island of Guam, with a focus of high incidence for motor neuron disease, ex-tensive investigations of genetic markers have been performed without finding any striking associ-ations. 46 Apart from histocompatibility antigens genetic markers have not, to our knowledge, pre-viously been investigated in cases of motor neuron disease outside the high incidence areas. 7 Haptoglobin (Hp), the major haemoglobin-binding serum protein, is an acute phase reactant with various properties of unknown biological significance.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} reports {{the case of}} a 68 -year-old male patient who {{presented}} to Tokyo Rosai Hospital for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease. A high density was observed in liver segment S 2, while a tumor, 30 mm in size, exhibiting a low density was observed in the delayed phase upon contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), which was performed prior to admission. The tumor appeared slightly poorly defined upon abdominal ultrasound and was observed as a 30 mm low-echoic nodule that was internally heterogeneous. A 5 -mm thick contrast enhancement effect was observed in the tumor border in the vascular phase on Sonazoid contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, while a defect in the entire tumor was observed in the post-vascular phase. Dysphagia had commenced three months prior to presentation and a weight loss of ~ 3 kg was observed. Therefore, the patient was admitted to Tokyo Rosai Hospital due to the presence of a hepatic tumor, and to undergo a close inspection of the cause of the tumor. Upon close inspection, it was determined that the weight loss and aphagia were caused by <b>progressive</b> <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis.</b> A contrast-enhanced CT was performed on post-admission day 29 as a follow-up regarding the hepatic tumor. As a result, although no change in the tumor size was observed, the contrast enhancement in the tumor borderline had disappeared. Necrosis of the tumor was considered. However, as viable persistence of the malignant tumor could not be excluded, a hepatic left lobe excision was performed. The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on the morphology of the cellular necrosis. In addition, occlusion due to thrombus was observed within the blood vessels passing inside the fibrous capsule. It was hypothesized that the formation of a thick fibrous capsule and occlusion due to thrombus in the feeding vessel were possibly involved as the cause of complete spontaneous necrosis. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient...|$|E
