[...] The Special <b>Project</b> <b>Analysts</b> also handled special requests {{for such things as}} very accurate orbital elements or decay information for a satellite (as might be required by research or educational groups).

40|$|Uniqueness {{is a major}} {{characteristic}} of any project systems. Hence it is virtually in-feasible for <b>project</b> <b>analysts</b> to utilize data from past projects as references for subsequent project planning and scheduling. Most <b>project</b> <b>analysts</b> would then depend on intuition, gut feeling and experiences to develop quantitative models for project scheduling and analysis which, according to past studies, is prone towards systematic errors. This study attempts to investigate the perfor-mance of both ‘experts’ and ‘non-experts’ when utilizing their cognitive capability to estimate pro-ject durations in group/non-group settings. A cognitive ergonomics perspective -which views human capability to make judgment as rationally bounded - is utilized in this investigation. An empirical approach is used to inquiry data from ‘projects’ on which ‘experts’ and ‘non-experts’ are required to provide prior estimate on project durations. The estimates are then gauged against the actual duration. Results show that some systematic cognitive judgmental errors (biases) are observable for both experts and non-experts. The identified biases include: anchoring bias as well as accuracy bias...|$|R

40|$|The author {{argues for}} {{a shift in}} the focus of {{economic}} analysis of <b>projects.</b> First, <b>project</b> <b>analysts</b> need to make full use of project information, especially identifying the source of the divergence between market prices and economic costs as well as the source of the divergence between economic and private flows, and the group that pays the cost or enjoys the benefits. This information identifies gainers, and losers, likely project supporters and detractors, and fiscal impact. Second, <b>project</b> <b>analysts</b> {{need to look at the}} project from the perspective of the main stakeholders, principally the implementing agency, the government, and the country. Third, they should also assess whether all of the main actors have the economic and financial incentives to implement the project as designed. Fourth, they should take advantage of advancesin technology and attempt to identify and measure any external effects of projects, as well as the benefits of education and health projects. Finally, they should take advantage of the advances in personal computing to provide a more systematic assessment of risk.

40|$|Abstract — An {{introduction}} to agile principals through agile manifesto has been shown. To prove the functionality of agile methods, qualitative (or quantitative) comparisons {{have been carried}} out with the other regular methods. It’s always a complicated task for a <b>project</b> <b>analyst</b> to analyze the development of a software project; {{especially when it comes to}} evaluation of the development methodology and estimation of the project’s success considering every related aspect. The goal of this paper is to simplify this task for the analyst and clarify the important aspects of a project which develop with agile methodologies...|$|E

40|$|The infant {{mortality}} rate (IMR) is a key in-dicator of the health status of a community, and reduction of {{infant mortality}} {{is one of the}} stated goals of the Healthy People 2010 consensus document. 1 Racial disparities in IMR have been documented repeatedly; African Americans and other racial/ethnic minority groups experience an IMR that is significantly higher than the IMRWhites experience. 2 Factors influencing the birth of extremely preterm infants as well as access to specialized obstetric and pediatric care primarily determine disparities in neonatal mortality. 2 Because neonatal mortality accounts for about 67 % of the national IMR, risk of preterm birth is an important factor to assess when seeking to decrease infant mortality. 3 The Hamilton County, Ohio, IMR averaged 11 deaths per 1000 live births during 2003 – 2007 according to data compiled and provided via e-mail by J.

40|$|AbstractIn project {{investment}} decisions, it {{is often}} assumed that estimated values of project parameters are certain {{and they would not}} deviate by the time. However, project parameters normally change during a life cycle of the project. Therefore, an existence of a deviation or gap between forecasted values and actual values is inevitable. Because of the uncertainty of the future, forecasting the true and exact values of project parameters is almost impossible. In this study, an integrated decision support approach based on simulation and fuzzy set theory is proposed for project investors in risky and uncertain environments. This approach determines the risk levels of the projects and helps investors to make investment decisions. In the scope of the study, a flowchart is presented to guide to decision maker in different situations of information uncertainty that belongs to project parameter values. Via this flowchart, the values of project parameters can be chosen depending on how they are determined (deterministic, stochastic or fuzzy) by <b>project</b> <b>analyst.</b> Besides, calculating and analyzing the project risk in all possible situations would be easier. Illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the application of this approach...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that a project’s net present value (NPV) {{is the most important}} criterion for the financial and the economic evaluation of a project from either the owner’s or economic perspective [...] The NPV criterion requires that a <b>project</b> <b>analyst</b> recommend only projects with positive NPV. The next step is to endeavor to maximize the NPV. The reason for trying to maximize the NPV is to extract as much value from the project as possible. Ideally, we should strive to maximize the NPV of incremental net cash flows or net economic benefits. Of course, optimization cannot be pursued blindly; there may be repercussions for other stakeholders that need to be considered in the final decision making. There are other important considerations project analysts often encounter. These considerations include changes in project parameters like the scale of investment, the date of initiation of a project, the length of project life or interdependencies of project components. Each of them is addressed in this chapter by using the criterion of a project’s net present value. This chapter explains how project analysts use the criterion of a project’s net present value to make such decisions...|$|E

Ongoing and planned future activities include: cold {{testing of the}} sluicing and pumping system; readiness assessment; equipment relocation and assembly; isotopic dilution of fissile radionuclides; sluicing and transfer of the tanks contents; and preparation of the Removal Action Completion Report. The most significant change is that the sluicing and pumping system has been configured by and will be operated by CDM Federal Programs Corporation. In addition, a new technical lead and a new <b>project</b> <b>analyst</b> have been designated within Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. and Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp. The schedule for tanks contents removal has been accelerated, with transfer of the final batch of tank slurry now scheduled for March 31, 1998 (instead of November 10, 1998). The OHF sluicing and pumping project is proceeding as a non-time-critical removal action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The purpose of the project is to remove the contents from five inactive underground storage tanks, designated T- 1, T- 2, T- 3, T- 4, and T- 9.
