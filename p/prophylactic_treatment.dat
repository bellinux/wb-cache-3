25|$|The {{disease can}} be managed by {{controlling}} the vector and thus reducing the incidence of the disease by disrupting the transmission cycle.

Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative vaginal intercourse is 0.05 to 0.15 percent. HIV can also be contracted through the oral route but is considered rare. Other recommendations are that the patient be treated prophylactically for HIV if the perpetrator is found to be infected.|$|E

25|$|The disease nagana or African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes gradual health {{decline in}} {{infected}} livestock, reduces milk and meat production, increases abortion rates, and animals eventually {{succumb to the}} disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has {{an enormous impact on}} the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> with trypanocidal drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|In bipolar disorder, SGAs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used to rapidly control acute mania and mixed episodes, often in conjunction with mood stabilizers (which {{tend to have a}} delayed onset of action in such cases) such as lithium and valproate.

SGAs are also used to treat other aspects of the disorder (such as acute bipolar depression or as a <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatment)</b> as adjuncts or as a monotherapy, depending on the drug. Both quetiapine and olanzapine have demonstrated significant efficacy in all three treatment phases of bipolar disorder.

25|$|AF often occurs after {{cardiac surgery}} {{and is usually}} self-limiting. It is {{strongly}} associated with age, preoperative hypertension, {{and the number of}} vessels grafted. Measures should be taken to control hypertension preoperatively {{to reduce the risk of}} AF. Also, people with a higher risk of AF, e.g., people with pre-operative hypertension, more than 3 vessels grafted, or greater than 70 years of age, should be considered for <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatment.</b> Postoperative pericardial effusion is also suspected to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. Prophylaxis may include prophylactic postoperative rate and rhythm management. Some authors perform posterior pericardiotomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF. When AF occurs, management should primarily be rate and rhythm control. However, cardioversion may be employed if the person is hemodynamically unstable, highly symptomatic, or persists for 6 weeks after discharge. In persistent cases, anticoagulation should be used.|$|E

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. : A methodological {{systematic}} review. OBJECTIVE. : To critically appraise {{the validity}} of preventive effects attributed to <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatments</b> for surgical site infection (SSI) after spinal surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. : As {{a result of a}} rapidly increasing number of spinal procedures, health care expenditure is expected to increase substantially in the foreseeable future. Administration of effective <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatments</b> may prevent occurrence of SSIs and may thus result in lower costs. To date, however, no review appraising the methodological quality of studies evaluating <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatments</b> for spinal SSIs has been published. METHODS. : Contemporary studies evaluating the preventive effect of prophylactic interventions on the rate of SSI after spinal surgery were searched through the Medline and EMBASE databases (January 2001 to December 2010). References were retrieved and bias-prone study features were abstracted individually and independently by 2 authors. RESULTS. : Eighteen eligible studies were identified, including 6 randomized controlled trials and 12 comparative cohort studies. Most often, antibiotic prophylaxis administration was investigated (n = 7). Included studies covered a wide variation of indications and surgical procedures. Except for 5 studies (28 %), applied definitions of SSI outcomes were ambiguous. Although several important methodological aspects, including blinding of outcome assessors and attrition, were poorly reported in randomized controlled trials, these studies were far less susceptible to bias and confounding as observed in nonrandomized studies. None of the 12 cohort studies adjusted for confounding by matching, stratification, or multivariate regression techniques. CONCLUSION. : Given the plethora of previously hypothesized confounding risk factors for a spinal SSI, conduct of nonrandomized comparative therapeutic studies is strongly discouraged. On the other hand, methodological safeguards, including use of standardized definitions of putative confounders and outcomes, should be considered in more detail during the design phase of a randomized trial...|$|R
25|$|Mixing {{of fetal}} cells {{carrying}} paternal RhD antigens into maternal blood {{may result in}} the sensitization of an RhD-negative mother. Rhesus blood group (D antigen) is {{used to determine the}} risk of hemolytic disease in the fetus. In hemolytic disease, the maternal antibodies destroy RhD-positive fetal red blood cells. This leads to lethality for the fetus. A significant amount of blood can be exchanged between mother and infant during birth, CVS, amniocentesis and accidents. 50 defined antigens on the surface of red blood cells indicate Rhesus blood group and E antigens {{are one of the most}} important. RHD gene determines the Rhesus D status. Chinen et al. 2010 shows that 15% of Caucasian females, 3-5% of black African females and <3% of Asian females are RhD-negative. In the United Kingdom and other countries, cffDNA tests are now routinely being offered to RhD-negative patients at increased risk of isoimmunization. Anti-RhD immune globulin, a blood derivative, is only offered in the event of a RhD-positive fetus for these women (21, 48, 54). In United States, <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> is recommended for all RhD-negative pregnant women to prevent isoimmunization in case of RhD incompatibility. In the United States, amniocentesis still serves as the gold standard diagnostic tool for those women who require antenatal fetal blood genotyping, but it has been suggested that technology using cell-free fetal DNA may ultimately replace this invasive procedure.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the late}} 60s to early 70s, {{physicians}} began using [...] "bubbles", which were plastic enclosures used to house newborns suspected to have SCIDS, immediately after birth. [...] The bubble, {{a form of}} isolation, was a sterile environment which meant the infant would avoid infections caused by common and lethal pathogens. On the other hand, <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatments</b> used today for X-linked SCID {{are similar to those}} used to treat other primary immunodeficiencies. [...] There are three types of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>treatments,</b> namely, the use of medication, sterile environments, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG). First, antibiotics or antivirals are administered to control opportunistic infections, such as fluconazole for candidiasis, and acyclovir to prevent herpes virus infection. In addition, the patient can also undergo intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) supplementation. [...] Here, a catheter is inserted into the vein and a fluid, containing antibodies normally made by B-cells, is injected into the patient's body. Antibodies, Y-shaped proteins created by plasma cells, recognize and neutralize any pathogens in the body. [...] However, the IVIG is expensive, in terms of time and finance. [...] Therefore, the aforementioned treatments only prevent the infections, and are by no means a cure for X-linked SCID.|$|R

Using conventional haematoxylin-eosin staining, we detected a protective effect of <b>prophylactic</b> insulin <b>treatment</b> in NOD females on the lymphocytic insulitis, significant at 13 weeks, but not at 9 weeks of age. However, when assessed by immunostaining for early infiltration of ER-MP 23 + macrophages around islets, the reduction in severity of insulitis could already be detected as early as 9 weeks of age. With regard to the early accumulation of ER-MP 23 + cells, we observed that their numbers per mm 2 surface area of the exocrine pancreas and per micron at the circumference of the islet were higher in placebo-treated NODs (197 +/- 13. 8 and 14 +/- 0. 9, respectively) as compared to age-matched BALB/c mice (123. 1 +/- 7. 1 and 3. 5 +/- 0. 9, respectively). <b>Prophylactic</b> insulin <b>treatment</b> of NODs lowered the attraction of ER-MP 23 + macrophages to the exocrine pancreas and to the circumference of the islets (156. 3 +/- 8. 5 and 7. 9 +/- 1, respectively).
