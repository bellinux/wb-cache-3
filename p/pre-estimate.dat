This rate is a genuine <b>pre-estimate</b> of damages that the owner will incur if the project is not completed by the authorised date for completion.

50|$|The {{motivation}} for <b>pre-estimate</b> aggregation {{may be that}} no ground truth data are available. This may occur in situations where diagnostics {{does a good job}} in detecting faults that are resolved (through maintenance) before system failure occurs. Therefore, there are hardly any run-to-failure data. However, there is incentive to know better when a system would fail to better leverage the remaining useful life {{while at the same time}} avoiding unscheduled maintenance (unscheduled maintenance is typically more costly than scheduled maintenance and results in system downtime). Garga et al. REF describe conceptually a <b>pre-estimate</b> aggregation hybrid approach where domain knowledge is used to change the structure of a neural network, thus resulting in a more parsimonius representation of the network. Another way to accomplish the <b>pre-estimate</b> aggregation is by a combined off-line process and on-line process: In the off-line mode, one can use a physics-based simulation model to understand the relationships of sensor response to fault state; In the on-line mode, one can use data to identify current damage state, then track the data to characterize damage propagation, and finally apply an individualized data-driven propagation model for remaining life prediction.|$|E

The <b>pre-estimated</b> position is the predicted current position of the destination, even if the destination already traveled a substantial distance from its initially known location. In Figure[*] 6, the distance of <b>pre-estimated</b> position P and the last known position C is S[*]=[*]TS[*]×[*]v, where the TS signifies the time elapsed since the destination at C, and v recorded in the evolutional state indicates the destination’s velocity. Obviously, sending data packets towards the predictive positions enhances the efficiency of data packet delivering process, reducing the path length and delay.|$|R

We propose the alternating direction method of multipliers for solving the semidefinite inverse eigenvalue problem, where three related iterative algorithms are presented.

5000|$|Hybrid {{approaches}} {{attempt to}} leverage the strength from both data-driven approaches {{as well as}} model-based approaches. [...] In reality, it is rare that the fielded approaches are completely either purely data-driven or purely model-based. More often than not, model-based approaches include some aspects of data-driven approaches and data-driven approaches glean available information from models. An example for the former would be where model parameters are tuned using field data. An example for the latter is when the set-point, bias, or normalization factor for a data-driven approach is given by models. Hybrid approaches can be categorized broadly into two categories, 1) <b>Pre-estimate</b> fusion and 2.) Post-estimate fusion.|$|E

Considering a two-echelon Logistics Service Supply Chain (LSSC) consisting of one Logistics Service Integrator (LSI) and several competitive FLSPs, we establish an order allocation optimization model of LSSC based on the <b>pre-estimate</b> and competitive behavior of FLSPs. The model considers three objectives: to minimize the cost of LSI, to maximize the order satisfaction of FLSPs and to match the different logistics capacities of FLSPs as much as possible. Numerical analysis is performed to discuss the effects of the competition among FLSPs on the order allocation results. The results show that with the rational expectations equilibrium, competitions among FLSPs help improve the comprehensive performance of LSSC...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear autoregressive {{models are}} very useful for {{modeling}} many natural processes, however, {{the size of}} the class of these models is large. Functional-coefficient autoregressive models (FCAR) are useful structures for reducing {{the size of the}} class of these models. Although this structure reduces the class of nonlinear models, it is broad enough to include some common time series models as specific cases. A recent development in estimating nonlinear time series data is the spline backfitted kernel (SBK) method. This method combines the computational speed of splines with the asymptotic properties of kernel smoothing. To estimate a component function in the model, all other component functions are <b>pre-estimated</b> with splines and then the difference is taken of the observed time series and the <b>pre-estimates.</b> This difference is then used as pseudo-responses for which kernel smoothing is used to estimate the function of interest. By constructing the estimates in this way, the method does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we adapt the SBK method to FCAR models.
