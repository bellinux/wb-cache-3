As is noted by the Spanish scholar Inés Fernández Ordoñez, Menéndez Pidal always maintained the idea that the Spanish language (or the common Spanish language, [...] "la lengua común española", as he sometimes called it) evolved from a Castilian base which would have absorbed, or merged with, Leonese and Aragonese. In that sense, in his works, [...] "Historia de la Lengua Española" [...] (History of the Spanish language) and especially [...] "El español en sus primeros tiempos" [...] (Spanish in its early times), this author explains the stages of this process, taking into account the influence caused in the first steps of the Spanish language, both by the Leonese dialect and the Aragonese dialect, and finally and in last place by Castilian, which, nowadays, due to the <b>political</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> produced during the last eight centuries, has absorbed almost completely to the other two dialects.|$|E

Within the EU and NATO, Minister Terzi was a strong advocate for a renewed “Pratica di Mare” partnership with the Russian Federation in order to settle energy and rule of law issues, as well as European security concerns raising from East-West diverging positions on conventional and nuclear forces. He gave impulse to policies of diversification of energy supplies to Italy, by negotiating and signing during the 2012 UNGA in New York the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) between Albania, Greece and Italy, by strengthening relations with transitional governments in Libya, and enhancing economic cooperation with Mozambique, Angola and Algeria. He pursued a reinforced Mediterranean political and economic cooperation in the Mediterranean region in the “5+5 Dialogue” framework, with Spain, France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia, and other bilateral and multilateral initiatives through the EU, NATO and the UN. At the same time Minister Terzi did strive for a closer EU political, economic, and scientific cooperation with Israel and for the reactivation of the MEPP on the base of the two-state solution. During his tenure, Minister Terzi engaged in a more active Italian diplomacy for the Horn of Africa, by visiting and signing new agreements with Ethiopia and Somalia.|$|E

These non-cooperative behaviors of countries when they decide on their delegation rule induce negative political externalities between countries, which cancel the gains achieved by the internalization of economic externalities in the case of political integration. We then propose two extensions. First, we assume a pre-play game where the countries choose whether or not to initiate political integration. Secondly, we examine the consequences of ratification by referendum.

In the initial years following {{the introduction of the}} single currency, the compromise as set down in the Maastricht Treaty-the speedy introduction of the single currency, on the one hand, and better cooperation in fiscal policy matters on the other-neither strengthened the institutional foundations of the monetary union nor advanced the <b>political</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process.</b> This resulted in economic divergence and tension in the euro area, which in recent years culminated in a severe crisis. It was only in response to this crisis that some of the necessary changes to the institutional structures of the monetary union were made. There is much evidence to suggest that, when the monetary union was originally being created, such tension and even crisis situations were consciously tolerated because of the stimulus for deeper integration this would provide. Such political maneuvering is very risky, however, since it can lead to the loss of public support for the integration process, thereby threatening the very existence of the common currency. To advance the European project, it is imperative that governments do not rely on the momentum inherent in crisis situations, but instead press ahead with the next stages of integration and take an active approach to bolstering the institutional foundations of the currency union...|$|E

We do this by comparing two simulation scenarios; one scenario based on the assumption of further European integration versus another scenario where fragmentation is assumed to prevail. Both scenarios cover the period from 1991 to 2020. The focus of the report is on consequences for future demand for fossil fuels, emissions of CO 2, SO 2 and NO., and transport and deposition of sulphur and nitrogen. Average annual growth in GDP in the integration scenario is 2. 3 per cent, while demand for energy, emissions of CO 2, SO 2 and NO., and nitrogen deposition all show average annual growth rates from 1. 7 to 1. 9 per cent. Deposition of sulphur grows at the slightly lower rate of 1. 4 per cent per year in this scenario. In the fragmentation scenario all growth rates are reduced by 0. 5 - 0. 7 percentage points, except the rate of annual average growth in SO 2 emissions which is reduced by 0. 8 percentage point. The results vary considerably, however, over countries, sectors and fuel types.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} transformation of specific public spaces in eastern Berlin after 1990. The underlying question of this study is: Why do some GDR-era structures still stand in post-Wall Berlin, while others were demolished? Memory, politics, symbolism, and financial considerations all {{play a role in}} answering this question. In this dissertation, I examine the political decision-making processes involved in determining the fate of particular built spaces in the German capital. In so doing, I analyze how history, memory, and identity figure into the reappropriation of the sites across time. In addition, I address how the visual environment of these sites affects decisions about their future. That is, in addition to staking out the historical and political significance of the sites, I ask what role optic experience in the urban landscape plays in the moment of political upheaval and transition. I argue that ultimately the aesthetic unification of Berlin is a goal which parallels the <b>political</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> during the post-Wall period. I take as examples in this study two locations in eastern Berlin: the Soviet War Memorial in Treptower Park and the Schlossplatz in Berlin-Mitte. The city of Berlin and federal German government not only saved the former, but renovated it in the 2000 s. Demolition of the Palace of the Republic, which was located on the latter, began in 2006 after years of standing vacant. In comparing these two public spaces, I argue that the Soviet War Memorial remains today, not least because of the constraints of a German-Russian treaty, but rather {{because of the way the}} memorial grounds visually figure into its surroundings. Alternatively, the construction and later dismantling of the Palace of the Republic are part of a longer history of attempting to create an optically cohesive Berlin center.

However, this criticism is opportunistic because it does not take into account all that has been achieved in such a short period of time given the number of different countries involved, especially after the introduction of the EMU and the adoption of the euro as a common currency.

40|$|This {{book has}} two {{overarching}} objectives. Firstly, {{in an age}} of increasing globalization and cross-border political activities it seeks to contribute to the debate on the limits and possibilities of democracy in the present and in the future. Even though this objective brings to the fore the issue of democracy in a national context, the main ambition is to examine democratic values and institutions beyond the nation-state’s traditional realms. What possibilities exist for realising democratic values and institutions in a context aside from the traditional boundaries of the nation-state? In what way are the decision-making processes different for such a democracy? To answer these questions, the author address normative theories (i. e. what is desirable?) and empirical theories (i. e. what is possible?) in order to finally answer the constructive question: How can a new understanding of democracy beyond the nation-state unfold, and by which means can we reach that new democracy? In the thesis the European <b>political</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> is used as a paradigmatic case for the discussion on the overall discourse about the desired and possible future of democracy beyond the nation-state. The author concludes that the present institutional governing of the European Union demonstrates a number of democratic shortcomings regarding democratic norms such as participation, accountability, openness, deliberation and constitutional rule by law for the citizen, but also that it is both desirable and possible to democratize those institutions along a civic democratic line. The second objective of the study is a meta-theoretical and methodological desire to demonstrate why - and how - a constructive political science approach to politics and democracy can be created and achieved. This should be conceived {{as a response to the}} general lack of constructive methodological works within the realms of political research. In order to fulfil this objective the thesis gives space to a more profound discussion on the epistemological and methodological aspects which function as cornerstones for the study...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Economic Governance in a Constitution for Europe: An Initial Assessment by Roberto Miccú The {{introduction}} of the euro gave rise to two problems for the European Union: how to adapt economic policy institutions to the Monetary Union and how to adapt the Union’s economic policy institutions to a totally new structure that calls for a supranational institution, the ECB, to coexist with a system of economic governance entrusted mostly to national governments. This challenge {{goes hand in hand with}} the new goal that the Union set at the European Council in Lisbon: making the EU the most advanced knowledge-based economy. However, behind these visible macroeconomic aspects, far-reaching change processes in the economic and social structure are taking place, requiring equally complex governance mechanisms. In fact, there is no doubt that globalisation is generating new problems, which cannot be solved by the traditional economic and social actions taken by national states. In particular, a growing de-coupling has been occurring between production circuits, based on increasingly mobile resources, and citizenship circuits, which are still mostly tied to rights related to a fixed geographic dimension, such as national rights. The result is a basic mismatch between increasingly global market processes and forms of control and democratic governance, as well as of solidarity-based resource redistribution, of a national nature. Concerning Europe in particular, since economic integration processes have historically been necessary to give impetus to the <b>political</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process,</b> there is a strong need to strengthen democratic decision-making circuits capable of shaping an economic governance consistent with community policies. Surely many of the chickens of a Europe that has introduced the single currency, but has left fiscal and economic policies in the hands of the Member States, have come to the Convention home to roost. As an example, reference can be made to the fiscal coordination problem, an issue that for all its importance has so far been neglected, compared with the attention devoted to the single market and currency and which we too shall not dwell on at this time. Coordination should help the Member States to face the growing threat of erosion of their national tax bases. It does not intend to combat competition per se but its harmful and unfair forms. In fact, if redistribution and social protection can no longer occur through political prices, but must be financed by general taxation, what can Member States increasingly engaged in tax competition do? As transaction costs and exchange-rate risks have disappeared, tax differentials will increasingly become a determinant in the allocation of resources, for both enterprises and savers. Tax competition will be fierce, enhancing the need for coordinating the relevant policies. Thus, it would have been necessary for the Constitution to attribute more competences to the Union, to be handled by the Council on the basis of a majority vote, instead of the current paralysing unanimity. However, plans to change this were strongly opposed by the English delegation, thus hindering any significant progress. “Economic governance” is a wide-ranging concept, whose intellectual underpinnings should be dealt with separately, given their multifaceted nature. Besides, there is an awareness that the rules on economic governance cannot be properly interpreted without considering the entire constitutional draft (suffice it to think, for instance, about the provisions on the source system, the allocation of competences between the Member States and the Union and, in turn, among its Institutions, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the development of a more complete political and participative circuit, as well as the provisions on the so-called “enhanced cooperation” and on the careful attempt to implement decision-making mechanisms moving increasingly away from the still-resistant unanimity principle). By the same token, account has to be taken of the outcomes of the debates on general issues (e. g. the legal nature of a Treaty establishing a Constitution or that of the characters of the new Union). This initial assessment of the activities of the Convention and their results will discuss only some of these issues, basically in line with the remit and the schedule adopted by the two working groups that focused on the themes: the Working Group on “Economic Governance” and the “Social Europe” Group. The discussion will be centred on a general theoretical profile and on two specific themes. I will focus on the model of social market economy and on selected issues – monetary policy and ECB accountability; the Union’s budget procedures and policies - to try to provide an overview of the positions emerged during the Convention’s debate and to highlight the main issues the Convention is confronted with. Towards the constitutionalisation of the social market economy? Rethinking the model An accurate review of the complex debate on the European economic constitution is unfeasible in this context. However, I will attempt to cast light on the possible implications of the innovations brought to the fore in the European “constituent” debate and the scope of such implications. The main starting point is the constitutionalisation, in Art. 3 of the draft Constitution, of “social market economy” as a concept capable of containing the key features of the economic system. Perhaps it is because the idea lends itself to different interpretations that the Convention added the qualification “highly competitive”. In the Convention’s text, at least in the initial version, where “highly competitive” had not been included yet, the formula seemed to capture the middle ground between economic values and social values, thus modifying the original model propounded by the community Treatises. In order to assess the significance of this expression, it is necessary to adopt a two-pronged approach: on the one hand, a systematic interpretation of the draft constitution is undertaken, to find a meaning consistent with the basic text of the constituent process, and, on the other, the theoretical and historical background of the formula “social market economy” is explored. The inclusion of “social market economy” into Article 3, on the Union's objectives, is the result of proposals by the Working Group on “Social Europe”, XI, and, to a minor extent, by the Group on “Economic Governance”. Both suggested to include this formula into the draft Constitutional Treaty. However, the Group on “Economic Governance” does not advocate the inclusion of this concept in accordance with the same terms and meaning as the those attributed to it by the Group on “Social Europe”. To this end, the proposal outlined in the Group’s final report does call for the inclusion of social and economic objectives in the Constitutional Treaty but these “must be based on the contents of the European Constitutional Treaty” (ECT). Consequently, the “social market economy” model is defined by these precepts. The Group on Social Europe spells out its proposal in different terms. In paragraph II of its report (transposition of the social objectives into the Draft Constitutional Treaty), its “social market economy” appears as a link between economic and social development when it refers to the “European social model” and grants equal, not subordinate, standing to economic and social objectives. Furthermore, the “social market economy” formula overlaps with the “open market economy” contained in Article 4 ECT, that is «open market economy with free competition». As already stated, the final expression in the draft submitted to the Thessaloniki Council is different from that proposed in the Group XI report, in that it adds “highly competitive” to “social market economy”. Such addition seems dictated by the goal to weaken the compromise that, in the proponents' mind, already contained both the social and economic dimensions. The correction introduced by the new provision should be assessed, in particular, in light of the precepts on economic and monetary policies in part III. Basically, these provisions reproduce the current wording of the corresponding parts of the ECT and old Article 4, thus further assimilating the model to the formula “open market economy with free competition”. The debate on the core principles of the European economic constitution seems not to have gone beyond the contents of the current Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the ECT, whose fundamental traits are contained in Article 4 ECT. On the other hand, the statement whereby, as a model for the relations between market and public authority, the “social market economy” is a compromise linked to the welfare State, and a response to the crisis of liberalism, bears scrutiny, though within the limits of this work. The tenets of the Freiburg School have been playing an influential role in the definition of the model since the beginning of European integration. They clearly shaped the rules on competition and the organisation of the common market. This leads inevitably to the evaluation of this School’s proposals in the debate on the link between the legal and political system and the economic order (“ordo”). Monetary policy and the accountability of the ECB Concerning monetary policy and its governance institutions, it is relatively easy to point out the prevailing stances of the Economic Governance Group” which were eventually included in the final Plan drawn up by the Convention. In fact, it was immediately clear that, at least at government level, with the “natural” convergence of that which is the most important among the community institutions involved there was an implicit agreement to regard as untouchable the provisions on monetary policy in the Treaty in force. A review of articles I- 29 and from III- 77 to III- 85 shows that the new constitutional treaty maintains the current structure for the governance of the single currency set out in the Maastricht Treaty. The framework outlined in the Draft Constitution is the same as that in the Maastricht Treaty (and the Protocol on the statute of the European System of Central Banks, which is also referred to in the Draft), also with reference to the constitutional role attributed to monetary institutions, the ECB and the ESCB. However, it should be underlined that while in the Preliminary Draft Constitutional Treaty of October 2002, the European Central Bank was included in Title IV, together with all the other “Union Institutions”, eventually a decision was made to “remove all references to the European Central Bank” and “place the ECB…. as a support body for the Union”. Whilst in the Thessaloniki text the ECB was not defined as a mere “support body for the Union”, it was not included under Chapter I which, under Institutional Framework, includes in article 3 among Union Institutions only the policy-making bodies and the Court of Justice are included. The European Central Bank is placed in the following Chapter, among Other institutions and bodies, together with the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, that is with the two advisory bodies. Perhaps, this choice was determined not so much by the absence of a full assessment of the role of central banks in general and the European Central Bank in particular, but by fears of criticism by those who think that the role of the monetary institutions in the European integration process is being overestimated. Monetary policy since Maastricht has been understood as a form of discipline contributing to define the model of economic Constitution outlined in the Treaties rather than an instrument of economic governance. The objectives of monetary policy (now Article III- 77), are clear: based on the current wording of the provision, price stability, also in terms of support to general economic policies, suffers from the strong influence of the basic objective of Article III- 69. Clearly, when these provisions make reference to the general context of the model "open market economy with free competition", they reflect the compatibility between public action based on a monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation under control and on the protection of an open and competitive market. The key principles in Article III- 69. 3 outline a system of economic discipline that introduces the economic constitutionalism model into the power-sharing system between Union and Member States, thus anticipating a mechanism underlying the integration of the States into the European economic Constitution. The objectives of economic policy are then completed by the procedure for the monitoring of excessive budget deficits (III- 73) which, despite the criticism levied, is a mere reproduction of Article 104 ECT. This does not necessarily mean ruling out a priori that the inclusion of old provisions in a text qualified as “Constitution” or “Constitutional Treaty” does not have additional implications for rules that might be (and mostly are) the same as the previous ones. First of all, it should be noted that the large number of constitutional provisions on monetary policy and institutions in the European Draft Constitution is an exception among contemporary constitutions: all basic features of monetary governance in the EU have constitutional import. However, the significance of this “choice” is that, at this particular time in history, more than ten years after the Maastricht Treaty, «the objective…. to maintain price stability» and the right-duty for monetary institutions to remain independent, at both national and community levels, are deemed as key objectives and requirements and a cornerstone for the firming up and progress of the European integration process. Obviously a large majority in the Convention thought, for instance, that the slightest difference in the definition of independence for the monetary authorities could undermine the foundations of the process toward a political Union. The constitutionalisation of a large number of aspects, related to both the implementation of monetary policy and the institutions responsible for monetary governance, attest to the significant number of checks and balances that came into being around the single currency and the role the euro plays in fostering the <b>political</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process.</b> On the other hand, it should be said that an initial assessment of the Thessaloniki Draft revealed a tendency to underestimate the constitutional import of part III of the Draft - that on the Union’s policies and operations - thinking that only «parts I and II (…) make up the actual European Constitution» (together with part IV), since part III is a «duplication of provisions included in the treaties in force which have been modified and adapted to fit them into the new rules laid down in part I». One should not be quick to forget, however, that a provision in a text qualified as constitutional does entail legal effects, on one side, and that also part III reflects the condition of the constitutionalisation process, on the other (including, as a matter of fact, to give a constitutional basis to important aspects of Union policies). In other words, in addition to the provisions on the single currency and its institutions, constitutionalising, for instance, the prohibition to run “excessive budget deficits”, «the basic tasks to be carried out through the European System of Central Banks», detailed rules on institutional profiles of «monetary governance», the different position of the Member States which have adopted the euro and of those which have not adopted it, contributes to determine the same characters of the Union at this particular juncture in history. Nor can one play down the meaning of the inclusion in the draft constitution of such provisions as those included in articles 104, 104 A and 104 C of the Maastricht Treaty, whose content appears to be purely technical. Actually they are a way to reiterate the non-negotiable nature of an oft-repeated constitutional principle of the Union: monetary and economic integration must occur in an «open market economy with free competition»...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{multiple}} forms of European continental regionalism, which takes the overall {{shape of a}} complex set of concentric circles, with a substructure of a core group within the EU based on the euro and Schengen areas, and several rings of neighbours outside, including the European Economic Area, the regions of the EU’s neighbourhood policy and finally some pan-European organisations. While all world regions have their own unique features, the European case offers some important lessons that should be of interest to other world regions. The first is {{what appears to be a}} relatively robust model for single market integration. The second consists of the lessons currently being learned on the hazards on monetary integration without adequate fiscal and <b>political</b> <b>integration.</b> The third lesson is another warning, over the difficulties of anticipating the <b>political</b> dynamics of <b>integration</b> <b>processes</b> once set in motion, often described in Europe as a ‘journey to an unknown destination’. The fourth consists of the EU’s current efforts to develop a comprehensive neighbourhood policy, which is encountering difficult issues of matching ambitious objectives with incentives of adequate weight. Nevertheless, the policy sees a landscape of positive and constructive relations between the EU and its neighbours, in marked contrast to some ugly conflictual or coercive features seen in the cases of other continental hegemons – the three BRIC states of China, India and Russia, but not the fourth one, Brazil...|$|R

Despite the momentum that European integration gained over this period, the key finding is that the geography of manufacturing employment has remained almost intact. Processes operating at the European scale appear to have the largest impact on labour outcomes in each member state, while there is little deviation from the widespread declining trends.

40|$|Our study {{analyses}} changes undergoing in {{the relation}} system of metropolitan areas 2 {{and the issues}} {{of social and economic}} relations arising from the restructuring of spatial and regional disparity systems. Global-scale economic, social and <b>political</b> <b>integration,</b> the <b>processes</b> of global urbanisation, globalising urban networks and the transformation of their subsystems are increasing the importance of large cities and their metropolitan areas. They are squeezing out the earlier systems of spatial relations having shaped up behind nation-state boundaries in the past. All these trends are also manifested by the vigorously increasing importance of cities (Barta, 1998; Cséfalvay, 1999; Enyedi, 2001, 2003, 2006; Knox, 2002). The spatial structuring force of cities and metropolitan areas is leaving its marks on the relation system of cities and their urban areas as well. The earlier hierarchical, mono-centric and core-periphery 3 based spatial disparity model of urban areas is now in transition (Ascher, 1995; Baron et al., 2005; Barta - Beluszky, 1999; Enyedi, 2003; Merlin, 2003; Mirloup, 2002; Szirmai et al. 2007). The social, economic and environmental impacts of the newly structured and urbanised regions (Enyedi, 2001, 2003) will reconfigure the system of earlier spatial disparities (Beckouche et al. 1997; Marcuse, 1989; Szirmai, 2004). Besides (and partly instead of) monocentric and hierarchical schemed relations, horizontal cooperation models based on the functional division of labour and networked organisational systems will operate as the driving engines of spatial organisation [...] ...|$|R

Currently, {{there is}} an {{academic}} debate on whether economic <b>integration</b> precedes <b>political</b> <b>integration</b> or vice versa: this debate mainly focuses on explaining whether regional integration is caused by political or economic factors. Some assert that political decisions have been motivated by economic reasoning 3, and explain that historical evidence proves that “descriptions of fluctuations of international economic integration identify clear economic dynamics behind political decisions. ” 4 Others believe that political decisions are the propellers of regional integration and, as Balassa states, “political motives may prompt {{the first step in}} economic integration. ” 5 Regardless of this debate, this paper will explain how the introduction of the euro has facilitated the EU’s regional <b>integration</b> <b>process,</b> which encompasses both economic and <b>political</b> <b>integration,</b> and has allowed Europe to blossom ¨into a continent that is widely admired as prosperous, diverse and caring. ¨...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we will attempt to analyse the {{dialectic}} relation of European economic integration under the prism of the European Union public finance. The course of European integration will be examined via the Community Budget. The vital question in our selected subject, seeking for a persuasive answer, is the relation of economic completion and unequal growth. It is, as we will prove, an ambiguous phenomenon. This ambiguity is consisted {{in the fact that}} the European <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> is developed in the base of social oppositions and is determined by the objecting interests of capital and labour. It is impossible to comprehend the European economic and <b>political</b> <b>integration,</b> outside the <b>process</b> of production internationalisation and supranational mechanisms of social classes regulation. In order to enlighten the relation between economy and policy, it is necessary to present extensively the public finances of the Union. Thus, we can achieve the necessary mediation between the European completion and the E. U. budgetary policy. For all the above reasons, we will proceed in a comparative analysis of the Community budget and that of the member states of the E. U. Furthermore, we will proceed to an analytic sectoral structure of the Community budget, where important redeployments in the Community financing are observed. Policies recede, like the Common Rural Policy, and policies are found in rise, as for example the European Regional Policy. We will emphasize in the critical question: how it is possible for the EU, having a budget which hardly comes to the 1...|$|R
