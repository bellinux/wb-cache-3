5|$|In 1637 Bogislaw XIV, Duke of <b>Pomerania</b> died. He was {{the last}} of the Slavic Griffins Dynasty of the Duchy of <b>Pomerania.</b> Sweden {{acquired}} the Pomeranian rule, while the Commonwealth was only able to get back its fiefs, Bytów Land and Lębork Land. Słupsk Land was also sought by Władysław IV at the peace conference, but it ended up a part of Brandenburg, which after the Peace of Westphalia controlled all of <b>Pomerania</b> adjacent to the border of the Commonwealth, extending south to where it met with Habsburg lands. Portions of <b>Pomerania</b> were populated by the Slavic Kashubians and Slovincians.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburgian margraves {{had long}} sought to expand northwards, {{connecting}} land-locked Brandenburg to the Baltic Sea. The Treaty of Grimnitz (1529) guaranteed Brandenburgian succession in the Duchy of <b>Pomerania</b> upon {{the extinction of}} the local House of <b>Pomerania,</b> and would have come into effect {{by the death of}} Pomeranian duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637. By the Treaty of Stettin (1630) however, Bogislaw XIV had also effectively handed over control of the duchy to Sweden, who refused to give in to the Brandenburgian claim. The Peace of Westphalia settled for a partition of the duchy between Brandenburg and Sweden, who determined the exact border in the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Sweden retained the western part including the lower Oder (Swedish <b>Pomerania),</b> while Brandenburg gained the eastern part (Farther <b>Pomerania).</b> Frederick William was dissatisfied by this outcome, and the acquisition of the whole Duchy of <b>Pomerania</b> was {{to become one of the}} main goals of his foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Philippa (1394–1430)married Eric of <b>Pomerania,</b> king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, in 1406.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} monument of {{this style}} in {{the territory of the}} former Duchy of <b>Pomerania</b> is the Ducal Castle in Szczecin.|$|E
5|$|By the Peace of Westphalia, {{which ended}} the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brandenburg gained Minden and Halberstadt, also the {{succession}} in Farther <b>Pomerania</b> (incorporated in 1653) and the Duchy of Magdeburg (incorporated in 1680). With the Treaty of Bromberg (1657), concluded during the Second Northern War, the electors were freed of Polish vassalage for the Duchy of Prussia and gained Lauenburg–Bütow and Draheim. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679) expanded Brandenburgian <b>Pomerania</b> {{to the lower}} Oder.|$|E
5|$|Fighting the Veleti {{from the}} {{beginning}} of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany. The alliance was natural at this point, because the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when Wichmann, this time leading forces of the Volinians, was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law Boleslaus, had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his Italian policies. This new status allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent bishopric. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older. The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with Margrave Hodo that followed in the Battle of Cedynia of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of <b>Pomerania.</b> Wolin however remained autonomous and pagan. Kołobrzeg, where a strong gord was built around 985, was probably the actual center of Piast power in <b>Pomerania.</b> Before, a Scandinavian colony in Bardy-Świelubie near Kołobrzeg functioned as the center of this area. The western part of Mieszko controlled <b>Pomerania</b> (the region referred to by Polish historians as Western <b>Pomerania,</b> roughly within the current Polish borders, as opposed to Gdańsk <b>Pomerania</b> or Pomerelia), which became independent of Poland during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005, when Poland was ruled by Mieszko's son Bolesław.|$|E
5|$|Hans Karl von Winterfeldt {{was born}} at Vanselow Castle (now in Siedenbrünzow, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) in Swedish <b>Pomerania.</b> His {{education}} was imperfect, and in later life he always regretted his lack of familiarity with the French language.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Dmowski {{laid out}} {{a plan for the}} borders of a re-created Polish state; it would include Greater Poland, <b>Pomerania</b> with Gdańsk, Upper Silesia, south strip of East Prussia and Cieszyn Silesia.|$|E
5|$|In the Peace of Westphalia, Frederick William was {{compensated}} for Western <b>Pomerania</b> with the secularized bishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden {{and the right}} of succession to the likewise secularized Archbishopric of Magdeburg. With Halberstadt, Brandenburg-Prussia also gained several smaller territories: the Lordship of Derenburg, the County of Regenstein, the Lordship of Klettenberg and the Lordship of Lohra. This was primarily due to French efforts to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg emperor by strengthening the Hohenzollern, and while Frederick William valued these territories lower than Western <b>Pomerania,</b> they became step-stones {{for the creation of a}} closed, dominant realm in Germany in the long run.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} Koniecpolski {{returned}} to <b>Pomerania</b> {{to prepare for}} another war against Sweden, but it was rendered unnecessary by the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Poland-Pomerania {{alliance}} {{ended up}} in regaining the fortresses in Gdańsk and the complete expulsion of the Brandenburg forces from <b>Pomerania.</b> Although soon after Mestwin II decided to conclude a separate peace with the Margraviate, the alliance with Greater Poland signed in 1272 remained in force. The continuous threat of Brandenburg and {{the uncertainty of the}} alliance with Mestwin II, caused that Bolesław the Pious began to seek new allies in case of war. For this purpose, Bolesław decided to seek an agreement with Duke Barnim I of <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{into the}} Lithuanian dynasty that had ruled since about 1289 might have lent legitimacy {{to the rule}} of Władysław I of the Piast dynasty, who was crowned in 1320, replacing the Přemyslid dynasty. But Aldona died unexpectedly at the end of May 1339 and was buried in Kraków. Aldona had two daughters: Cunigunde (d. 1357) married Louis VI the Roman, the son of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Elisabeth (d. 1361) married Duke Bogislaw V of <b>Pomerania,</b> an area in modern-day Germany and Poland. Elisabeth's daughter, Elizabeth of <b>Pomerania,</b> was the fourth wife of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Archeology {{nevertheless}} {{shows the}} evolution of the Oksywie culture to be the fundamental source of the Wielbark culture, as the two cultures extended over exactly the same territory and continuously used the same cemeteries. The locally present Veneti and Rugians became influenced by the Goths or their Scandinavian protoplasts. It is presently believed that the Scandinavian arrivals directly settled the areas where the great cult kurgan and stone burial grounds are found. They are referred to as the Odry-Węsiory-Grzybnica type, were established {{in the second half of}} 1st century AD and occur in parts of <b>Pomerania</b> west of the Vistula, up to the Koszalin area. The contemporary and rather closely related Wielbark culture in (previously settled by the Przeworsk culture) Greater Poland, represented by the Kowalewko cemetery, lacks however for the most part the kurgans and the stone structures. The Wielbark people came here from <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the forces}} of the Swedish Empire {{dominated}} Northern Germany, and along with her ally France, Sweden became guarantee power of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Swedish aim of controlling the Baltic Sea by establishing dominions on the coastline ("dominium maris baltici") thwarted Frederick William's ambitions to gain control over the Oder estuary with Stettin (now Szczecin) in <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bolesław's expansionist {{policies}} were costly to the Polish state {{and were not}} always successful. He lost, for example, the economically crucial Farther <b>Pomerania</b> in 1005 together with its new bishopric in Kołobrzeg; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko.|$|E
5|$|Brandenburg changed {{sides in}} return for Polish {{withdrawal}} of claims to Ducal Prussia, declaring Frederick William the sole sovereign in the Duchy with the treaties of Wehlau on 19 September and Bromberg on 6 November. In addition, the aforementioned treaties secured Brandenburg the Lands of Lauenburg and Bütow at the border of Brandenburgian <b>Pomerania,</b> while the Bishopric of Ermeland was returned to Poland.|$|E
5|$|By 1678, Frederick William {{had cleared}} Swedish <b>Pomerania</b> and {{occupied}} most of it, {{with the exception}} of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in {{what became known as the}} Great Sleigh Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish ally, and forced Frederick William to basically return to the status quo ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian <b>Pomerania,</b> the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the crusade, the {{countryside}} of Mecklenburg and <b>Pomerania</b> was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion. This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.|$|E
5|$|In Royal Prussia (Eastern <b>Pomerania</b> in {{contemporary}} Poland), Thorn had fallen already in December 1658, but Elbing and Marienwerder withstood. On 24 November, Sweden had to abandon Funen and Langeland after the {{defeat in the}} Battle of Nyborg. In January 1660, Sweden lost the Livonian fortress Mitau.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was <b>Pomerania.</b> It was also characterized by the most extensive contacts with the external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural richness and diversity. <b>Pomerania</b> was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as Wolin, Pyrzyce or Szczecin. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the Velunzani ("Uelunzani") and Pyritzans ("Prissani") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite {{the high level of}} economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in Farther Pomeranian societies, except for the Wolin city-state.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd century AD the Proto-Gothic {{people of}} the Wielbark culture began their own great migration, moving east, south and south-east. In {{the first half of}} the 3rd century they left most of <b>Pomerania</b> except for the lower Vistula region, where a small Wielbark {{population}} remained; <b>Pomerania</b> west of there became mostly settled by the Dębczyn group. Also evacuated at that time northern Greater Poland was retaken by the Przeworsk culture people. The Wielbark people successively took over eastern Masovia, Lesser Poland, Podlasie, Polesie and Volhynia. They settled in Ukraine, where they encountered other peoples, which resulted in the early 3rd century AD in the rise of the Chernyakhov culture. This last culture, which in the 4th century encompassed large areas of southeastern Europe, was of a mixed ethnic composition; in the more western part it was made-up of the Wielbark culture people, as well as other Germanic people and the Dacians. It was within the Chernyakhov culture that the Gothic tribes assumed their mature form.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of 1284 Przemysł II was {{involved}} on the side of Denmark and Brandenburg in an armed conflict against Western <b>Pomerania</b> and Rügen. Details about this event are limited, and the peace, which was concluded on 13 August, didn't bring any real benefits to Greater Poland.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Polish forces led {{by general}} Stefan Czarniecki ravaged {{southern}} Swedish <b>Pomerania,</b> and destroyed and plundered Pasewalk, Gartz (Oder) and Penkun. The Habsburg and Brandenburg allies however {{were reluctant to}} join Czarniecki, and against John II Casimir's wish decided against taking the war to the Holy Roman Empire fearing {{the start of a}} new Thirty Years' War.|$|E
5|$|Mieszko thus {{strove to}} subdue <b>Pomerania</b> at the Baltic coast. The area {{was the site}} of wealthy trade emporia, {{frequently}} visited by traders, especially from the east, west and north. Mieszko had {{every reason to believe that}} great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as Wolin, Szczecin and Kołobrzeg.|$|E
5|$|The 13th century brought {{fundamental}} {{changes to the}} structure of Polish society and its political system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western Farther <b>Pomerania</b> broke its political ties with Poland {{in the second half of}} the 12th century and from 1231 became a fief of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the Sławno and Słupsk areas. Pomerelia or Gdańsk <b>Pomerania</b> became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, Bolesław II the Bald granted Lubusz Land to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the Neumark and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, Leszek the White was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the Halych area of Rus', a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is thought}} to have {{acquired}} its name by association with the area known as <b>Pomerania</b> which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} Army Group Vistula, {{under the command}} of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, {{attempted}} a counter-attack, but this had failed by 24 February. The Red Army then drove on to <b>Pomerania,</b> clearing the right bank of the Oder River, thereby reaching into Silesia.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} to five areas: Warsaw (Obszar Warszawski, with some sources {{differentiating}} between left- and right-bank areas – Obszar Warszawski prawo- i lewobrzeżny), Western (Obszar Zachodni, in the <b>Pomerania</b> and Poznań regions), Southeastern (Obszar Południowo-Wschodni, in the Lwów area); sources vary on {{whether there was a}} Northeastern Area (centered in Białystok – Obszar Białystocki) or whether Białystok was classified as an independent area (Okręg samodzielny Białystok).|$|E
5|$|When Prince Mestwin {{was buried}} in Oliwa, Przemysł arrived in Gdańsk and took {{possession}} of the duchy of <b>Pomerania.</b> Then he received from the Holy See the crown of the Polish Kingdom. He lived another year and was captured by {{the men of the}} Margrave of Brandenburg, Waldemar, who killed him to avenge the holy Lukarda his wife, suspecting that he had strangled her.|$|E
5|$|After a power struggle, Bolesław III Wrymouth (r. 1102–1138) {{became the}} duke of Poland by {{defeating}} his half-brother Zbigniew in 1106–1107. Zbigniew {{had to leave the}} country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, who attacked Bolesław's Poland in 1109. Bolesław was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see Battle of Głogów). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Bolesław's other major achievement was the conquest of all of Mieszko I's <b>Pomerania</b> (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father Władysław I Herman and completed by Bolesław around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and Western <b>Pomerania</b> up to Rügen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Bolesław's fief, to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from <b>Pomerania</b> and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom he describes as a sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a central figure in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Frederick III's war on Sweden gave Charles X Gustav {{a reason}} to abandon the Polish–Lithuanian {{deadlock}} and fight Denmark instead. After marching his army {{to the west and}} making a dangerous crossing of the frozen straits in the winter of 1657/58, he surprised the unprepared Frederick III on the Danish isles and forced him into surrender. In the Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to abandon all Danish provinces in what is now Southern Sweden. The anti-Swedish allies meanwhile neutralized the Transylvanian army and Polish forces ravaged Swedish <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|E
5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and supplementary units. They {{were able to}} bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of <b>Pomerania,</b> East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E
5|$|In 1320, {{the kingdom}} was {{restored}} under Władysław I the Elbow-high, then strengthened and expanded {{by his son}} Casimir III the Great. The western provinces of Silesia and <b>Pomerania</b> were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of {{two members of the}} Capetian House of Anjou between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful kingdom of Poland that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of various}} provinces of today's Poland, Christianity's spread was slowest in <b>Pomerania,</b> where it gained a {{significant}} following only around the 12th century. Initially, the clergy {{came from the}} Western Christian European countries; native Polish clergy took three or four generations to emerge, and were supported by the monasteries and friars that grew increasingly common in the 12th century. By the 13th century Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout Poland.|$|E
5|$|Swedish forces entered Poland–Lithuania from Swedish <b>Pomerania</b> in the west, and Livonia in the north. The {{division}} {{on the western}} flank consisted of 13,650 men and 72 artillery pieces commanded by Arvid Wittenberg who entered Poland on 21 July 1655 and another 12,700 to 15,000 commanded by Charles X Gustav who followed in August, while the {{division on}} the northern flank consisted of 7,200 men commanded by Magnus de la Gardie who had already seized Dünaburg with them on 12 July.|$|E
