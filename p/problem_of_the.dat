5|$|After Anne's accession, the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{succession}} re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated {{that the}} English Parliament did not consult {{them on the}} choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the Act of Security 1704, threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the Acts of Union 1707, under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first to address the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of our work on H∞-optimal control problems. In two previous articles a controller degree bound was established for problems in which both P 12 (s) and P 21 (s) are square (<b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first kind). Here we switch our attention to <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind. We allow P 12 (s) to have more rows than columns (with P 21 (s) square), or alternatively, we allow P 12 (s) to have more columns than rows (with P 12 (s) square). Our main result shows that the degree bound derived previously for <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first kind carries over to <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind without change. Our analysis suggests a number of modifications which are easily made to currently available computer programs. Test calculations (for <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind) show that these improvements result in a marked reduction in computation time and also enhance <b>the</b> numerical robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> software...|$|R

5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy loads and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point above the river means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes.
