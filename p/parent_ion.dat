40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that collisional activation in an ion trap mass spectrometer {{can be achieved by}} storing <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> within a narrow zone extending close to the theoretical boundaries beta(r) = 0 or beta(z) = 0 of the stability diagram. This procedure can be used for obtaining collision-induced dissociation of selected <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> without the need to apply a precisely tuned resonant 'tickle' potential between the end-cap electrodes. In this investigation a comparison was made between the two methods ('tickle' and 'boundary') of activation based on the efficiency of parent-to-daughter conversion and on the relative abundance of daughter ions for a model system (the m/z 91 / 92 ratio for n-butylbenzene). The data show that, under conditions of maximum efficiency, a comparable amount of internal energy is present in the ions after activation with the two methods. However, with the 'tickle' technique it is possible to increase the internal energy of the <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> even further, although {{at the expense of the}} efficiency, whereas in the case of the "boundary' activation, the conditions for optimum efficiency almost coincide with those for maximum activation and a drastic loss of ions follows any attempt to overcome these limits. It is also found that at any given q(z) value used for storing and activating <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> the permitted mass difference between <b>parent</b> and fragment <b>ions</b> is greater with 'boundary' than with 'tickle' excitation...|$|R

50|$|Scanning the photon energy {{corresponds}} to shifting the internal energy {{distribution of the}} <b>parent</b> <b>ion.</b> The <b>parent</b> <b>ion</b> sits in a potential energy well, in which the lowest energy exit channel often {{corresponds to}} {{the breaking of the}} weakest chemical bond, resulting in the formation of a fragment or daughter ion. A mass spectrum is recorded at every photon energy, and the fractional ion abundances are plotted to obtain the breakdown diagram. At low energies no <b>parent</b> <b>ion</b> is energetic enough to dissociate, and the <b>parent</b> <b>ion</b> corresponds to 100% of the ion signal. As the photon energy is increased, a certain fraction of the parent ions (in fact according to the cumulative distribution function of the neutral internal energy distribution) still has too little energy to dissociate, but some do. The <b>parent</b> <b>ion</b> fractional abundances decrease, and the daughter ion signal increases. At the dissociative photoionization threshold, E0, all parent ions, even the ones with initially 0 internal energy, can dissociate, and the daughter ion abundance reaches 100% in the breakdown diagram.|$|E

5000|$|A post-source decay (PSD) is {{a process}} {{specific}} to the ion source utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and operating in vacuum. In the post-source decay, <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> (typically of several keV kinetic energy) fragment {{in a process of}} laser-induced fragmentation or high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HE CID). Time interval suitable for observation of the post-source decay in the reflectron starts after the precursors (<b>parent</b> <b>ions)</b> leave the ion source and ends prior to the moment when the precursors enter the ion mirror. The kinetic energy of fragment ions of mass m in the post-source decay significantly differs from that of <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> of mass M and is proportional to m/M. So, the distribution of kinetic energies for the PSD ions is extremely large. Not surprisingly, it cannot be compensated in [...] "classic" [...] single or double-stage reflectrons. To achieve acceptable mass resolution for PSD ions which masses typically distributed over broad mass range, these ions are accelerated to energies substantially (at least, a factor of 4 [...] ) exceeding the initial energy of precursor ions. Use of gridless curved-field mirror or that with time-dependent field also improves the mass resolution for fragment ions generated in the post-source decay.|$|R

The fragmentation processes of multiply charged transient molecular ions were analyzed {{by means of a}} time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometer. Most ion peaks consisted of one broad and one sharp component. From the analysis of the peak profiles the kinetic energies of the molecular and atomic fragment ions have bean measured. On the basis of these energy values and the estimated charge separation distances, it is concluded that, for furan, it is probable that Coulomb explosion takes place in multiple charged <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> with deformed molecular structure. The doubly charged <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> of furan and pyrrole fragments through charge separation processes.

Pyridine and pyrazine multiple charged ions seem to follow different dissociation routes. The abundance ratios C+/A(+) (A = N, O) for the singly charged atoms were found to be equal to the stoichiometric ratio for all the molecules studied, while a divergence has been observed for the C- 2,C- 3 +/A(2, 3 +) (A = N, O) ratios...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{hydrocarbon}} molecules, {{unsaturated fatty acid}} and low molecular weight polystyrene deposited on different metal substrates (silver, copper and gold) were bombarded by 15 keV Ga ions and the secondary ions were mass- and energy-analysed {{by means of a}} time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. The samples were studied in order to evidence the effects of different substrates and coverages on the emission of the parent and cationised molecular ions, and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the large molecular ion emission processes. Ion beam degradation studies were realised for fundamental purposes too. In general, the kinetic energy distributions of metal-cationised molecules are broad in comparison with those of the <b>parent</b> <b>ions,</b> and of the smaller polystyrene fingerprint ions. In addition, the velocity distributions of the <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> and of the metal-cationised molecules are similar. <b>Parent</b> <b>ions</b> of aromatic molecules are, on average, more energetic than those of aliphatic molecules. In the case of metal-cationised molecules, the three hypotheses of emission of a preformed complex, recombination in the selvedge and metastable decay of larger aggregates are critically reviewed in comparison with the experimental data. The recombination hypothesis cannot account for the whole set of observations. On the other hand, the very different evolutions of the <b>parent</b> <b>ions</b> and of the metal-cationised molecules in the degradation experiments cannot be explained solely in the frame of metastable decay reactions, although the kinetic energy measurements show that a significant fraction of the parent-like ions are produced in the vacuum. The augmentation of the secondary ion kinetic energy with increasing molecule size for triacontane monomers and dimers, and for silver-cationised polystyrene oligomers, is in disagreement with the sputtering by a single cascade atom, too. Finally, the discussion outlines the conditions that must be satisfied to model the experimental observations and proposes a view of the sputtering of these large molecular cations based on multiple collision processes and possible subsequent dissociation in the vacuum.

Hence tandem mass spectrometry is one of the tools used in proteomics to identify the presence of proteins in different cell types or subcellular locations. While the presence of a moonlighting protein in an unexpected location may complicate routine analyses, at the same time, the detection of a protein in unexpected multiprotein complexes or locations suggests that protein may have a moonlighting function.

50|$|The data {{analysis}} becomes more demanding {{if there are}} competing parallel dissociation channels or if the dissociation at threshold is too slow to be observed on the time scale (several μs) of the experiment. In the first case, the slower dissociation channel will appear only at higher energies, an effect called competitive shift, whereas in the second, the resulting kinetic shift means that the fragmentation will only be observed at some excess energy, i.e. only when it is fast enough to {{take place on the}} experimental time scale. When several dissociation steps follow sequentially, the second step typically occurs at high excess energies: the system has much more internal energy than needed for breaking the weakest bond in the <b>parent</b> <b>ion.</b> Some of this excess energy is retained as internal energy of the fragment ion, some may be converted into the internal energy of the leaving neutral fragment (invisible to mass spectrometry) and the rest is released as kinetic energy, in that the fragments fly apart at some non-zero velocity.|$|E
50|$|Neutral atoms or {{condensed}} matter cannot emit EUV radiation. Ionization {{must take}} place first. EUV light {{can only be}} emitted by electrons which are bound to multicharged positive ions; for example, to remove an electron from a +3 charged carbon ion (three electrons already removed) requires about 65 eV. Such electrons are more tightly bound than typical valence electrons. The existence of multicharged positive ions is only possible in a hot dense plasma. Alternatively, the free electrons and ions may be generated temporarily and instantaneously by the intense electric field of a very-high-harmonic laser beam. The electrons accelerate as they return to the <b>parent</b> <b>ion,</b> releasing higher energy photons at diminished intensities, which {{may be in the}} EUV range. If the released photons constitute ionizing radiation, they will also ionize the atoms of the harmonic-generating medium, depleting the sources of higher-harmonic generation. The freed electrons escape since the electric field of the EUV light is not intense enough to drive the electrons to higher harmonics, while the parent ions are no longer as easily ionized as the originally neutral atoms. Hence, the processes of EUV generation and absorption (ionization) strongly compete against each other.|$|E
5000|$|The Kerr {{effect can}} be {{described}} as a [...] as well. At high peak powers the Kerr effect can cause filamentation of light in air, in which the light travels without dispersion or divergence in a self-generated waveguide. [...] At even high intensities the Taylor series, which led the domination of the lower orders, does not converge anymore and instead a time based model is used. When a noble gas atom is hit by an intense laser pulse, which has an electric field strength comparable to the Coulomb field of the atom, the outermost electron may be ionized from the atom. Once freed, the electron can be accelerated by the electric field of the light, first moving away from the ion, then back toward it as the field changes direction. The electron may then recombine with the ion, releasing its energy {{in the form of a}} photon. The light is emitted at every peak of the laser light field which is intense enough, producing a series of attosecond light flashes. The photon energies generated by this process can extend past the 800th harmonic order up to a few KeV. This is called high-order harmonic generation.
