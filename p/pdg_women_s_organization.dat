40|$|Recent {{legal and}} {{institutional}} reforms in Morocco, particularly the amended constitution of 2011, which guarantees gender equality and <b>women</b> <b>s</b> political participation, {{along with the}} reform of the Family Code in 2004, have significantly impacted democracy and the modernization process in Moroccan society. Unlike Libya and Egypt, Morocco did not experience a revolution. Yet, it did not escape the tumult of the so-called Arab spring. Thousands of protesters {{took to the streets}} in a dozen of cities led by the February 20 Movement, which demanded the end of corruption and the right to social justice and gender equity. Women were strongly represented in these protests for democracy; they came from different ethnic and political backgrounds and marched alongside the men, demanding social and political change. The post Arab Spring government has committed to implement the new constitution through <b>women</b> <b>s</b> increased political participation. As a result, more women joined parliament through the quota system for women and youth. The 2011 constitution reserved ten per cent of seats for women and ten percent for youth, in the hope of encouraging their political participation and their representation in parliament and government. Despite the positive changes in Morocco and the growing emancipation of women in all domains, there are still hurdles that hinder their emancipation and participation in public life, such as illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, lack of education and professional training, insufficient resources, difficult access to loans, and weak representation in decision and policy-making. <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>organizations</b> today {{play a major role in}} sensitizing women, families, and social actors as to the importance of integrating women in economic, social, and cultural development.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD takes a social constructionist approach (see Burr, 2003) to explore how professional women in Sri Lanka make sense of and enact their careers. By explaining career through the recursive relationship between social context and individual agency, this study adds new insights into existing understandings of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers which are dominated by psychological models of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> development over their lifespans (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005; Pringle and Dixon, 2003). Most importantly this study which addresses <b>women</b> <b>s</b> experiences in Sri Lanka fulfils a significant gap in the extant literature which has paid only little attention to careers in South Asian nations. This study is based on qualitative interviews (see King, 2004) conducted with 24 professional Sri Lankan women: eight in early career, eight in mid-career and eight in late career (see O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005). All respondents aspired to reach the highest possible level in their organisations hierarchies and therefore continuously engaged with work organisations, home and family and wider contextual structures in Sri Lanka in pursuit of achieving their career goals, contributing towards maintaining and/or transforming these social structures in the process. Based on these findings I developed a theoretical framework to understand <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in a dynamic and contextually significant manner. This framework highlights eight different strategies women use to develop their careers which has four possible social outcomes. In illuminating specifically what women do to advance their careers within their social contexts and with what implications this framework makes {{a significant contribution to}} the careers literature which gives only little attention to individuals career strategies. Moreover by appreciating both social context and individual agency as explanations of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers this model refrains from taking an overly deterministic (see McRae, 2003; Crompton, 2011) or voluntaristic (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005) stance to conceptualising <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development. Second, I outline a South Asian model of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development highlighting family, moral notions, religious philosophies and wider belief systems such as astrology and horoscopes as central constituents of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers. I highlight how these understandings could be used to identify blind spots in existing literature and further develop prevailing ideas of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in the West. Specifically I argue that traditional notions do not altogether disappear as societies develop (see Gerth and Mills, 1991), but rather individuals use these notions to walk towards modernity. Finally I conclude the thesis by outlining how scholars could develop my work further, calling upon authors to bring moral character, traditional notions and enchantment back to the careers field.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and analyse some foreign <b>women</b> <b>s</b> perspectives on their first meeting with the Swedish school and to identify and illuminate patterns and processes on different levels that facilitate respectively obstruct {{the development of their}} school careers. The women arrived in Sweden in their teens and attended Swedish upper secondary school, completed their education with good results, applied for and were enrolled as students at University. The <b>women</b> <b>s</b> descriptions are studied as individual interpetations. Description and analysis are based on symbolic interactionalism, based on the concepts interaction, empathy, self- image, confirmation and congruousness/ incongruousness. Also conceptions focusing on schooling are required. These conceptions are connected to the symbolic interactionalistic perspective and to Code theory by Bernstein. Conceptions used are career turning points, integration and inclusion, motivation, framing, and visible and invisible pedagogy. The school years and school careers have been affected by, and are thus related to, migration. The descriptions are analysed within the dimensions of ethnical background, gender and class. The material consists of thematically structured in-depth interviews with twelve women. The interviews were subsequently constructed as case-studies. Interactive patterns on structural, institutional and individual levels were identified in the analyse.
