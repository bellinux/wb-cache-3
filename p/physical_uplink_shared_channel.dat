30|$|Random access {{protocols}} can {{be categorized}} into two families: ALOHA family and tree family [82]. Andres et al. [15] claim that ALOHA-based RACH procedure is not suitable for MTC. Instead, they mention that RACH procedure based on distributed queuing (DQ) is more promising. The concept of DQ [82] was proposed 20 years ago and then demonstrated in other literatures in terms of stability and near-optimum behavior. DQ {{is based on the}} combination of a m-array tree splitting algorithm with a smart set of simple rules that allow organizing every device in one out of two virtual queues. Due to the rules of DQ, it behaves as a random access method for low traffic loads, and it switches smoothly and seamlessly to a reservation access method as the traffic load increases. The authors conduct some ongoing research efforts applying DQ ideas within LTE/LTE-A systems. Dhillon et al. [47] suggest to implement a load-dependent access scheme wherein uncoordinated strategy is for light load and coordinated strategy for heavy load. Bontu et al. [83] propose a new <b>uplink</b> (UL) <b>physical,</b> transport, and logical channel: common traffic channel (CTCH), UL simultaneous-access <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> (UL-SSCH), and <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> simultaneous access <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> (PUSSCH). The aforementioned channels enable M 2 M devices to simultaneously transmit data packet in the same radio resource. They also propose to transmit control signaling through in-band transmission in the user plane control.|$|R

3000|$|To {{evaluate}} network performance, the 3 GPP defines integrity {{as one of}} {{the basic}} categories for KPIs [4]. It attempts to measure how the RAN impacts the service quality provided to the users. Within this category, two different types of metrics are commonly defined: latency and throughput. In the downlink, the former is related to the delay experienced by the users, measured as the time from the reception of data in the e-NodeB to the transmission of the first packet over the radio interface. The latter is the data rate experienced by the users, measured as the data volume per elapsed time unit on the radio interface. In this work, the session throughput (Ses_Thp) is computed to identify users whose performance in terms of QoS is degraded. This requires the activation of the trace event that provides the corresponding data to compute the throughput for each UE in the downlink radio interface. In particular, this event periodically (every 2 s) reports the data rate for each radio bearer on the Downlink <b>Shared</b> <b>Channel</b> (DL-SCH) and <b>Uplink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channel</b> (UL-SCH), which are the main transport channels for downlink and uplink data transfer, respectively.

The objective is to design the optimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold for adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) that can satisfy the target frame loss rate (FLS) under a delay constraint associated with real-time multicasting services. A common <b>uplink</b> feedback <b>channel</b> <b>shared</b> by all users is introduced to reduce the redundant transmission of the random network-coded packets, so that no unnecessarily redundant transmission can be made when the multicast packet is successful for all receivers, avoiding the overhead of the uplink wireless resource associated with each user for individual feedback.

40|$|Uplink Power Control (ULPC) is a {{key feature}} of mobile networks.

First, the FPC planning problem is formulated analytically on a cell basis through the combination of multiple regular scenarios built on a per-adjacency basis from a live scenario. Secondly, detailed inspection of the FPC parameter values aims to identify the most important variables in the scenario impacting optimal FPC settings.

40|$|Passive Optical Networks (PONs) bring {{high speed}} {{broadband}} access via fiber to the business, curb and home. Among {{various types of}} PONs, Ethernet PONs (EPONs) are gaining more and more attention since they are built upon widely used Ethernet technology and can offer high bandwidth, low cost, and broad service capabilities. EPONs use a point-to-multipoint topology, in which multiple optical network units (ONUs) <b>share</b> one <b>uplink</b> <b>channel</b> to transmit multimedia traffic to a control element, optical line terminal (OLT). To avoid data collision on the <b>shared</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>channel,</b> a key issue in EPON is that the OLT needs a contention-free MAC protocol to schedule the transmission order of different ONUs. In this paper, we propose a two-layer bandwidth allocation (TLBA) scheme implementing weight-based priority for this need. With TLBA, different traffic classes proportionally share the bandwidth based on their instantaneous demands, and higher priority traffic is served prior to lower priority traffic. The weight set for each class not only prevents a (possibly high priority) traffic class from monopolizing the bandwidth under heavy load but also ensures a minimum bandwidth allocated to each (possibly low priority) traffic class. 1...|$|R

30|$|In the literature, several {{power control}} schemes have been proposed. Fractional power control (FPC) has been {{selected}} for the <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> (PUSCH) in LTE [10, 11]. A performance analysis of open-loop FPC is presented in [12, 13]. Such an analysis is extended in [14 - 16] to closed-loop behavior. Later studies have evaluated more sophisticated power control schemes for LTE, which take into account interference and load conditions [17, 18]. In [19], a parameter sensitivity analysis for the standardized FPC algorithm is carried out based on system-level simulations. As a result, a suboptimal parameter configuration is suggested for interference-limited and noise-limited macro-cellular scenarios. However, finding the best parameter configuration for every cell in the network is a more challenging task, since the underlying problem is a large-scale non-separable non-linear optimization problem. In [20], the adjustment of ULPC parameters in a single cell is formulated as a classical optimization problem with average throughput and cell throughput as alternative figures of merit. The latter analysis is extended to a multi-cell scenario in [21] by formulating ULPC as a non-cooperative game model. Then, a heuristic iterative optimization algorithm is proposed, where cells report UL power settings to the network management system and exchange power and interference information with their neighbor cells. In [22], a self-planning method is proposed for selecting the best parameter settings in FPC on a per-cell basis in an irregular LTE scenario. The proposal {{is based on an}} exhaustive search approach using Taguchi’s method over a system-level simulator. A more computationally efficient planning method is presented in [23]. The core of the method is an analytical model that predicts the influence of the nominal power (a.k.a. power offset) and path-loss compensation factor on call acceptance probability for a given spatial user distribution. A suboptimal value of these parameters is computed on a per-cell basis by a randomized local greedy search algorithm. Alternatively, other studies consider tuning algorithms for the network operational stage. For instance, a self-tuning algorithm is proposed in [24] to dynamically adjust nominal power parameter based on overload indicator [25] so as to control the overall interference in the network. Similarly, in [26], a self-tuning algorithm for FPC is proposed based on fuzzy-reinforcement learning techniques. These self-tuning algorithms, conceived to be executed during network operation, can also be applied to network planning, provided that a system performance model is available. However, most self-tuning algorithms rely on iterations that require evaluating system performance for many different parameter settings. This iterative process is straight-forward for live networks due to the availability of performance measurements. However, {{this is not the case}} of network planning, where computations required to measure the quality of a new parameter plan at every iteration may jeopardize method scalability when large scenarios are considered. For this reason, most ULPC planning methods in the literature rely on simple analytical models for system performance assessment. To the authors’ knowledge, few of them can handle irregular scenarios at a low computational cost and none of them considers closed-loop performance.|$|E
