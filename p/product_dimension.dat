5000|$|The {{concept of}} Taguchi's quality loss {{function}} was {{in contrast with}} the American concept of quality, popularly known as goal post philosophy, the concept given by American quality guru Phil Crosby. Goal post philosophy emphasizes that if a product feature doesn't meet the designed specifications it is termed as a product of poor quality (rejected), irrespective of amount of deviation from the target value (mean value of tolerance zone). This concept has similarity with the concept of scoring a 'goal' in the game of football or hockey, because a goal is counted 'one' irrespective of the location of strike of the ball in the 'goal post', whether it is in the center or towards the corner. This means that if the <b>product</b> <b>dimension</b> goes out of the tolerance limit the quality of the product drops suddenly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Hadwiger number η(G) of a graph G is {{the largest}} integer h such that the {{complete}} graph on h nodes Kh is a minor of G. Equivalently, η(G) {{is the largest}} integer such that any graph on at most η(G) nodes is a minor of G. The Hadwiger's conjecture states that for any graph G, η(G) ⩾χ(G), where χ(G) is the chromatic number of G. It is well-known that for any connected undirected graph G, there exists a unique prime factorization with respect to Cartesian graph products. If the unique prime factorization of G is given as G 1 □G 2 □⋯□Gk, where each Gi is prime, then we say that the <b>product</b> <b>dimension</b> of G is k. Such a factorization can be computed efficiently. In this paper, we study the Hadwiger's conjecture for graphs {{in terms of their}} prime factorization. We show that the Hadwiger's conjecture is true for a graph G if the <b>product</b> <b>dimension</b> of G is at least 2 log 2 (χ(G)) + 3. In fact, it is enough for G to have a connected graph M as a minor whose <b>product</b> <b>dimension</b> is at least 2 log 2 (χ(G)) + 3, for G to satisfy the Hadwiger's conjecture. We show also that if a graph G is isomorphic to Fd for some F, then η(G) ⩾χ(G) ⌊(d- 1) / 2 ⌋, and thus G satisfies the Hadwiger's conjecture when d⩾ 3. For sufficiently large d, our lower bound is exponentially higher than what is implied by the Hadwiger's conjecture. Our approach also yields (almost) sharp lower bounds for the Hadwiger number of well-known graph products like d-dimensional hypercubes, Hamming graphs and the d-dimensional grids. In particular, we show that for the d-dimensional hypercube Hd, 2 ⌊(d- 1) / 2 ⌋⩽η(Hd) ⩽ 2 d/ 2 d+ 1.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the polynomial coefficient}} matrix and identify maximum rank of this matrix under variable substitution as a complexity measure for multivariate polynomials. We use our techniques to prove super-polynomial lower bounds against several classes of non-multilinear arithmetic circuits. In particular, we obtain the following results : As our main result, we prove that any homogeneous depth- 3 circuit for computing the product of d matrices of dimension n × n requires Ω(n^d- 1 / 2 ^d) size. This improves the lower bounds by Nisan and Wigderson(1995) when d=ω(1). There is an explicit polynomial on n variables and degree at most n/ 2 for which any depth- 3 circuit C of <b>product</b> <b>dimension</b> at most n/ 10 (dimension of the space of affine forms feeding into each product gate) requires size 2 ^Ω(n). This generalizes the lower bounds against diagonal circuits proved by Saxena(2007). Diagonal circuits are of <b>product</b> <b>dimension</b> 1. We prove a n^Ω(n) lower bound {{on the size of}} product-sparse formulas. By definition, any multilinear formula is a product-sparse formula. Thus, our result extends the known super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of multilinear formulas by Raz(2006). We prove a 2 ^Ω(n) lower bound on the size of partitioned arithmetic branching programs. This result extends the known exponential lower bound on the size of ordered arithmetic branching programs given by Jansen(2008). Comment: 22 page...|$|E

Equivalently, $\eta(G) $ {{is the largest}} integer such that any graph on at most $\eta(G) $ nodes is a minor of G. The Hadwiger’s conjecture states that for any graph G, $\eta(G) \geq x(G) $, where x(G) is the chromatic number of G. It is well-known that for any connected undirected graph G, there exists a unique prime factorization with respect to Cartesian graph products.
