In this year, bioscope was also shown {{in the capital of}} United Bangla Calcutta. One of the arrangers to show the bioscope was the English Stephenson. We found that Stephenson came to Dhaka with a drama team and showed bioscope in around 1896 to 1897. But there is no prove about that. The weekly “Dhaka Prokash” proved the bioscope show of Dhaka. According to “Dhaka Prokash” 17 April 1898 (on 3rd Boishakh in 1305, Bengali Year) first bioscope was shown in Dhaka at the Crown Theatre (now lost) in Patuatuli, near Sadarghat then Dhaka Harbour. Bradford Bioscope Company of Calcutta arranged the show. The films that was shown there were very little of two, three, four or five minutes. The show included news items and other short features. The films were: The jubilee michil of Queen Victoria, Greek-Turkey battle, the jump of princes Diana from 300 feet up, the introduction of Russian prince jeer, the work of a mad hair-cutter, the game of lion and manik, the game of snow, the French underground railway etc. The <b>price</b> <b>rate</b> of ticket was eight anas to three taka. At that time the price of 40-kilogram rice was two taka four anas. After that bioscope was shown in SDO's Bungalow of Bhola, Bogjuri village of Manikganj, Joydebpur of Gazipur, Rajbari, and Palong village of Faridpur. This became the first film ever to be released in Bangladesh.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the way smaller builders price bills of quantities items for competitive tender. A series of interviews revealed some marked differences between normal practise and literature-based prescriptions. An experiment was conducted in which eight practising builders ' estimators were separately presented with a representative sample of 36 bill of quantities items taken from groundwork, in-situ concrete work and masonry sections. The estimators stated the method they would normally use to price each item, their 'normal ' <b>price</b> <b>rate</b> and their highest/lowest <b>price</b> <b>rate.</b> The results showed that only half the items would be priced by the prescribed 'detailed' method, the remainder being priced mainly by 'experience'. Analysis by work section, item rate, item quantity, item total, item labour content, contribution to the total of the bill, the standard deviation of the inter-estimator intra-item rates and totals, and their coefficients of variation, skewness and kurtosis indicated that the item total was the main factor determining the rating method used, although this varied in importance between work sections. An intra-estimator intra-item analysis of pricing variability generally confirmed the assumption of a constant coefficient of variation...|$|E

Results demonstrate that a one-cent hike in taxes increases retail prices of name-brand and generic cigarettes by exactly one cent. We find no tax-induced substitution toward name brands but a large substitution away from carton to pack sales, suggesting that tax hikes encourage within-product changes in purchase but little between-product substitution...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} built around a theorem proved {{analytically}} and exemplified empirically in Flaschel, Franke and Veneziani (2010) which states that profitable capital-using labor-saving technical change is under mild conditions always reducing the labor content of commodities. This type of technical change therefore increases Marx’s value rate of profit in a systematic way. Against this background the paper studies {{the relationship between the}} actual value and <b>price</b> <b>rate</b> of profit and derives expressions that show that the deviation between them may be of a secondary and unsystematic nature. This result is then exemplified empirically using flow as well as stock matrix data for the German economy.
