Natural factors, structural factors and human factors that lead to high <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> failure are summed up on the basis of statistics. Through qualitative analysis coupled with quantitative estimation, it is determined that high <b>arch</b> <b>dams</b> generally involve five major failure modes: abutment rock mass destabilization, excess cracking, <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> & dam foundation entire destabilization, extreme dam-overflow and destabilization of dam body along base plane. The state functions of individual major failure modes are established. An approach is made to the correlativity among the major failure modes and among the random variables within individual failure modes, and it is suggested that risk rate, economic loss risk value and life loss risk value should be used to assess the risk of high <b>arch</b> <b>dams.</b> A certain high <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> abutment instability risk evaluation has been provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Dam designs may {{be divided}} into three main types : gravity {{structures}} relying on their weight for stability, arch structures using the abutment reaction forces and buttress dams. The design of an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> relies on the abutment reaction forces to resist the water pressure force and it requires advanced engineering expertise. The present study demonstrates that {{the historical development of}} <b>arch</b> <b>dams</b> took place in five stages. The world 2 ̆ 7 s oldest <b>arch</b> <b>dams</b> were built by the Romans in France and Spain. They were followed by the Mongols who built dams in Iran during the 13 th and 14 th centuries. However it is not until the 19 th century that significant progress in <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> design was made. Four remarkable structures were the Meer Allum dam (India 1804), the Jones Falls dam (Canada 1831), the Zola dam (France 1854) and Parramatta dam (Australia 1856). Australian engineers pioneered the use of concrete as a construction material for <b>arch</b> <b>dams</b> (i. e. 75 -Miles and Lithgow No. 1 <b>dams).</b> Modern concrete <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> designs were introduced in North America {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century : e. g., constant-angle arch, double-curvature arch. Since no major design breakthrough has taken place and modern <b>arch</b> <b>dams</b> are based upon the single-radius, constant-angle or double-curvature arch design. It is the writers 2 ̆ 7 opinion that the introduction of concrete as construction material marked a major innovation in allowing a flexibility in arch shape design...|$|R
40|$|From {{the design}} {{experiences}} of <b>arch</b> <b>dams</b> in the past, it has significant practical value {{to carry out}} the shape optimization of <b>arch</b> <b>dams,</b> which can fully make use of material characteristics and reduce the cost of constructions. Suitable variables need to be chosen to formulate the objective function, e. g. to minimize the total volume of the <b>arch</b> <b>dam.</b> Additionally a series of constraints are derived and a reasonable and convenient penalty function has been formed, which can easily enforce the characteristics of constraints and optimal design. For the optimization method, a Genetic Algorithm is adopted to perform a global search. Simultaneously, ANSYS is used to do the mechanical analysis under the coupling of thermal and hydraulic loads. One of the constraints of the newly designed dam is to fulfill requirements on the structural safety. Therefore, a reliability analysis is applied to offer a good decision supporting for matters concerning predictions of both safety and service life of the <b>arch</b> <b>dam.</b> By this, the key factors which would influence the stability and safety of <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> significantly can be acquired, and supply a good way to take preventive measures to prolong ate the service life of an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> and enhances the safety of structure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{planning}} {{and construction of}} large dams are very intricate and complex tasks. Coordination of studies and planning of work phases require a highly competent task force. A team of experienced engineers with {{a broad spectrum of}} competences is a key success factor. They must be backed up by top specialists and experts for specific studies; contracts specialists prove very useful too. Due to their long life time span, these complex projects do not evolve linearly; they require constant adjustments and repositioning, depending on the events occurring during their development. Moreover, as important safety issues are at stake, the dilemma of the profitability of a project and the rapidity of its implementation vs. the work quality and the adequacy of the methods relied on becomes oftentimes of critical importance. The issue of the type of contract to adopt between the parties involved in a project also often proves crucial. All these reflections are illustrated by examples drawn from five high <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> projects STUCKY SA worked on these past ten years.
