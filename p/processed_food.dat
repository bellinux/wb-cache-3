40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the contribution of}} highly <b>processed</b> <b>foods</b> to total diet, nutrient intakes and patterns among 27 redefined centres in the 10 countries participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Methods: Single 24 -hour dietary recalls were collected from 36 034 individuals (aged 35 - 74 years) using a standardized computerized interview programme (EPIC-SOFT). Centre-specific mean food intakes (g/day) were computed according to their degree of food processing (that is, highly, moderately and non-processed foods) using a specifically designed classification system. The contribution (%) of highly <b>processed</b> <b>foods</b> to the centre mean intakes of diet and 26 nutrients (including energy) was estimated using a standardized nutrient database (ENDB). The effect of different possible confounders was also investigated. Results: Highly <b>processed</b> <b>foods</b> were {{an important source of}} the nutrients considered, contributing between 61 % (Spain) and 78 - 79 % (the Netherlands and Germany) of mean energy intakes. Only two nutrients, beta-carotene (34 - 46 %) and vitamin C (28 - 36 %), had a contribution from highly <b>processed</b> <b>foods</b> below 50 % in Nordic countries, in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, whereas for the other nutrients, the contribution varied from 50 to 91 % (excluding alcohol). In southern countries (Greece, Spain, Italy and France), the overall contribution of highly <b>processed</b> <b>foods</b> to nutrient intakes was lower and consisted largely of staple or basic foods (for example, bread, pasta/rice, milk, vegetable oils), whereas highly <b>processed</b> <b>foods</b> such as crisp bread, breakfast cereals, margarine and other commercial foods contributed more in Nordic and central European centres. Conclusions: Highly industrially <b>processed</b> <b>foods</b> dominate diets and nutrient patterns in Nordic and central European countries. The greater variations observed within southern countries may reflect both a larger contribution of non/moderately <b>processed</b> staple <b>foods</b> along with a move from traditional to more industrialized dietary patterns.
