5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E
5|$|A CSS Merrimac did {{actually}} exist. She was a <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> steamer {{named for}} the victor (as most Southerners saw it) at Hampton Roads. She was used for running the blockade until she was captured and taken into Federal service, still named Merrimac. Her name was a spelling variant of the river, namesake of USS Merrimack. Both spellings are still in use around the Hampton Roads area.|$|E
5|$|To {{protect and}} support the {{multitude}} of ships sailing for maritime interests into {{the waters of the}} East China Sea and Yellow Sea (to Korea and Japan), Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea, it was necessary to establish an official standing navy. The Song dynasty therefore established China's first permanent navy in 1132, with a headquarters at Dinghai. With a permanent navy, the Song were prepared to face the naval forces of the Jin on the Yangtze River in 1161, in the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi. During these battles the Song navy employed swift <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> driven naval vessels armed with traction trebuchet catapults aboard the decks that launched gunpowder bombs. Although the Jin forces commanded by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) boasted 70,000 men on 600 warships, and the Song forces only 3,000 men on 120 warships, the Song dynasty forces were victorious in both battles due to the destructive power of the bombs and the rapid assaults by <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> ships. The strength of the navy was heavily emphasized after that. A century after the navy was founded it had grown in size to 52,000 fighting marines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} on some older {{watercraft}} and their reconstructions. These ships {{were known as}} paddle steamers. Because <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> simply push against the water, their design and construction is very simple. The oldest such ship in scheduled service is the Skibladner. Many pedalo boats also use <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> for propulsion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> {{have been}} {{superseded}} by screws, {{which are a}} much more efficient form of propulsion. Nevertheless, <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> have two advantages over screws, making them suitable for vessels in shallow rivers and constrained waters: first, {{they are less likely}} to be clogged by obstacles and debris; and secondly, when contra-rotating, they allow the vessel to spin around its own vertical axis. Some vessels had a single screw in addition to two <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels,</b> to gain the advantages of both types of propulsion.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} use in milling and water-raising, ancient {{engineers}} applied the <b>paddled</b> water <b>wheel</b> for automatons and in navigation. Vitruvius (X 9.5-7) describes multi-geared <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> working as a ship odometer, the earliest of its kind. The first mention of <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> {{as a means of}} propulsion comes from the 4th-5th-century military treatise De Rebus Bellicis (chapter XVII), where the anonymous Roman author describes an ox-driven paddle-wheel warship.|$|R
5|$|Dolarhyde, Ella, {{and other}} townsfolk form a posse to track an injured alien that {{escaped from the}} downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an {{abandoned}} cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins up with the posse. During the evening, the group comes upon a capsized <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> steamboat that the aliens apparently dumped {{hundreds of miles from}} any rivers capable of holding it. They camp in it, and during the night the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel.</b> In good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> boats.|$|E

5|$|Mechanical cup-bearers and wine-pourers on automatic-traveling boats: The {{mechanical}} engineer Huang Gun served {{the court of}} Emperor Yang Di (r. 604–617) and wrote the book Shuishi Tujing on his inventions, which his colleague Du Bao enlarged and commented on. He constructed seven small boats, called 'wine boats', that were as large as 3m (10ft) long and 1.8m (6ft) wide which supported a number of mechanical figures of wooden statues called 'hydraulic elegances', each about 0.6m (2ft) tall, some of them animals but most in human form consisting of singing girls, musicians playing actual instruments, dancers and tumblers, oarsmen busy rowing, cup-bearers, and wine-pourers all moving simultaneously as if alive. These boats were set to travel at timed intervals along circuits made of winding stone channels and canals in palace courtyards and gardens (designed by Tang Haogui), where guests would gather for special occasions. The cup-bearer stood at the bow of each ship and beside him the wine-pourer; when the ship made automatically timed periodic stops where guests were seated, the cup-bearer automatically stretched out his arm with a full cup of wine. When the guest was done emptying his cup, he placed the cup back into the figure's hands; the latter then waited as the wine-pourer filled a second cup to be emptied. When this guest had been served, the wine boat automatically moved onwards to the next stop. The British sinologist, scientist, and historian Joseph Needham speculates that the 'wine boats' may have been paddle-wheel-driven. Another <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> ship was commanded by Wang Zhen'e and described in his biographies dated from the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). side from the partial remains of the Shuishi Tujing, an account of these 'wine boats' was also preserved by Huang Gun's contemporary Yan Shigu (581–645).|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of this craft was the <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel.</b> It was an old idea – supposedly dating to antiquities – and previously tried with a steam engine. Jonathan Hulls of England used a rear-mounted <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1737 but an inefficient method of turning the steam engine’s reciprocating motion into the circular motion hobbled it. In 1789, Nathan Reed of Massachusetts experimented with a <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel,</b> and considered patenting it, but eventually patented a different method instead. The American John Fitch experimented with side-mounted paddle wheels, but in 1791 used and patented oars instead. Morey's may have been the first successful use of a steam power <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was the best method of propulsion until the propeller, invented by Fitch, was perfected.|$|E
25|$|The {{return trip}} downriver from Albany to Portland took Nespelem only 48 hours, with the steamer {{arriving}} in Portland on September 14, 1819, having sustained only minor damage to its <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> {{and loss of}} part of its rudder.|$|E

25|$|The Napoleon III was {{originally}} {{built as a}} paddle steamer by Thames Ironworks, London (engines by Ravenshill & Salked, London) in late 1865 for the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (French Line). She was a 3,950 gross ton ship, length 365.9ft with 45.9ft beam, straight stem, two funnels, two masts, iron construction, <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> propulsion and a cruising speed of 11.5 knots.|$|E
25|$|Paddlewheels as {{the main}} motive source became {{standard}} on these early vessels (see Paddle steamer).

25|$|For instance, in Joule's experiment, {{the initial}} {{system is a}} tank of water with a <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> inside. If we isolate the tank thermally, and move the <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> with a pulley and a weight, we can relate the {{increase}} in temperature with the distance descended by the mass. Next, the system is returned to its initial state, isolated again, and {{the same amount of}} work is done on the tank using different devices (an electric motor, a chemical battery, a spring,...). In every case, the amount of work can be measured independently. The return to the initial state is not conducted by doing adiabatic work on the system. The evidence shows that the final state of the water (in particular, its temperature and volume) is the same in every case. It is irrelevant if the work is electrical, mechanical, chemical,... or if done suddenly or slowly, {{as long as it is}} performed in an adiabatic way, that is to say, without heat transfer into or out of the system.|$|E
25|$|In June 1845, Joule {{read his}} paper On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat to the British Association meeting in Cambridge.

He now estimated a mechanical equivalent of 819ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). He {{wrote a letter to the}} Philosophical Magazine, published in September 1845 describing his experiment.|$|E
25|$|There was a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Wood River, and the steamer used its <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> to wash out the sand to create a channel deep enough to allow the steamer to pass. This took 24hours, and the sand washed away {{accumulated}} under the hull of the boat, so that the vessel could not move forward off of the bar. In backing off the bar, the hull became permanently hogged, that is, flexed so that the middle part of the boat was raised and the bow and the stern drooped lower into the water.|$|E

50|$|There was {{considerable}} disagreement among Cunard's partners concerning {{the choice of}} <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> for the new liner as screw propulsion was proving itself superior.

25|$|Copper acetate hydrate adopts the <b>paddle</b> <b>wheel</b> {{structure}} seen {{also for}} related Rh(II) and Cr(II) tetraacetates. One oxygen atom on each acetate {{is bound to}} one copper at 1.97Å (197pm). Completing the coordination sphere are two water ligands, with Cu–O distances of 2.20Å (220pm). The two five-coordinate copper atoms are separated by only 2.62Å (262pm), which {{is close to the}} Cu–Cu separation in metallic copper. The two copper centers interact resulting in a diminishing of the magnetic moment such that near 90K, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is essentially diamagnetic due to cancellation of the two opposing spins.

40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} analysis of <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> {{as used in}} wastewater treatment high-rate algae ponds were conducted. It was found experimentally that the efficiency of <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> in transfer of mech-anical energy to water flow energy depends primarily on the paddle wheels' geometry such as the radius, the width, the number of paddles and the sub-mergence. An analytical approach based {{on the concept of}} the drag coefficient was developed. The drag coefficient was determined by calibrating the analytical model with the experimental data. The calibrated model can be used to estimate the speed of rotation and the power input required from the specified wheel dimensions and flow conditions in the pond. With this analytical design approach, it is possible to improve the efficiency of the <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> from the level of 20 - 25 percent currently attainable to 40 - 70 percent. Thus, the foreseeable improvement in efficiency is in the order of two to three fold. Since the <b>paddle</b> <b>wheels</b> constitute the major energy demand in the operation of the ponds, the improvement can {{have a significant effect on}} the overall economics of the high-rated algae pond systems...|$|R
