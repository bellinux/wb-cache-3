5|$|After this arrangement, Constantine {{ruled the}} dioceses of <b>Pannonia</b> and Macedonia and took {{residence}} at Sirmium, whence he could wage {{war on the}} Goths and Sarmatians in 322, and on the Goths in 323.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} Alboin's reign as king in <b>Pannonia</b> {{following}} the death of his father, Audoin, was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained the upper hand, but in 567, thanks to his alliance with the Avars, Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave <b>Pannonia</b> for Italy, hoping {{to take advantage of the}} Byzantine Empire's reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the Gothic War.|$|E
5|$|The season {{chosen for}} leaving <b>Pannonia</b> was unusually early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves {{time to do}} the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage <b>Pannonia,</b> which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E

5|$|As a precautionary move Alboin {{strengthened}} his {{alliance with}} the Avars, signing what Paul calls a foedus perpetuum ("perpetual treaty") and what is {{referred to in the}} 9th-century Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani as a pactum et foedus amicitiae ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of <b>Pannonia</b> and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied <b>Pannonia</b> would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} his reign, {{the armies}} of Augustus had conquered {{northern}} Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) and the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), Illyricum and <b>Pannonia</b> (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.), and had extended the borders of the Africa Province to the east and south.|$|E
5|$|Equites cataphractarii, {{or simply}} cataphractarii for short, were the heavily {{armoured}} cavalry of the Roman army. Based on Sarmatian and Parthian models, {{they were also}} known as contarii and clibanarii, although {{it is unclear whether}} these terms were interchangeable or whether they denoted variations in equipment or role. Together with new units of light mounted archers, the cataphractarii were designed to counter Parthian (and, in <b>Pannonia,</b> Sarmatian) battle tactics. Parthian armies consisted largely of cavalry. Their standard tactic was to use light mounted archers to weaken and break up the Roman infantry line, and then to rout it with a charge by the cataphractarii concentrated on the weakest point. The only special heavy cavalry units to appear in the 2nd-century record are: ala I Ulpia contariorum and ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum cataphractaria stationed in <b>Pannonia</b> and Moesia Inferior respectively in the 2nd century.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Sejanus and Drusus dated back {{to at least}} AD 15. That year a mutiny had broken out among legions posted in <b>Pannonia</b> and Germania. While his adopted son Germanicus {{restored}} order in Germania, Tiberius' biological son Drusus was sent to quell the uprising in <b>Pannonia,</b> accompanied by Sejanus and two Praetorian cohorts. In part due to what the soldiers believed to be bad omens, Drusus quickly managed to restore stability in the army, and publicly put the chief instigators to death. The camp was purged of mutineers by the Praetorians and the legions returned to the winter barracks. Despite this success, the following years witnessed a growing animosity between Drusus and Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in {{the region}} of Carpathia and <b>Pannonia</b> has been ongoing since 20 million years ago but has {{decreased}} during the Quaternary. No eruptions have occurred in the Holocene. The last volcanism occurred at Ciomadul in the last glacial age. Sparse basaltic volcanism has also occurred in the area, forming monogenetic volcanic fields.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the work}} De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7thcentury; however, that claim is disputed and {{competing}} hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Eventually two dukedoms were formed—Duchy of <b>Pannonia</b> and Duchy of Croatia, ruled by Liudewit and Borna, as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818.

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Western Roman Empire, which included the territory occupied by modern-day Slavonia, the area became a part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom {{by the end of the}} 5th century. However, control of the area proved a significant task, and Lombards were given increasing control of <b>Pannonia</b> in the 6th century, which ended in their withdrawal in 568 and the arrival of Pannonian Avars and Slavs, who established control of <b>Pannonia</b> by year 582. According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats had arrived in the early 7thcentury in the then region of Dalmatia, although this is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Eventually a dukedom was formed, Duchy of Dalmatia, ruled by Borna, as attested to by the chronicles of Einhard, starting in the year 818. This record represents the first document of the Croatian state, vassal of Francia at the time. The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, which ruled the area of modern-day Slavonia until the 5th century, Ostrogoths and Lombards {{controlled}} the area {{before the arrival of}} Avars and Slavs, when the Principality of Lower <b>Pannonia</b> was established in the 7th century. It was later incorporated into the Kingdom of Croatia and, after its decline, the kingdom was ruled through a personal union with Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Alboin (530sJune 28, 572) {{was king}} of the Lombards from about 560 until 572. During his reign the Lombards ended their migrations by {{settling}} in Italy, {{the northern part of}} which Alboin conquered between 569 and 572. He had a lasting effect on Italy and the Pannonian Basin; in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of Lombard rule, and in the latter his defeat of the Gepids and his departure from <b>Pannonia</b> ended the dominance there of the Germanic peoples.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} in which Notitia Dignitatum was written (late 4th century), the first {{detachment}} of Decima Gemina was {{under the command of}} the Magister Militum per Orientem, and was a comitatensis unit.

50|$|The {{document}} comprises {{a list of}} {{the names}} of all the provinces of the empire (c. 100 in total), organised according to the 12 newly created regional groupings called dioceses. Although the 12 dioceses are presented in a single list, they are not ordered in a single geographical sequence but rather in two separate eastern and western groups, the eastern group (Oriens, Pontica, Asiana, Thraciae, Moesiae, <b>Pannoniae)</b> preceding the western (Britanniae, Galliae, Viennensis, Italiae, Hispaniae, Africa). The split is apparent from the discontinuity midway in the list between the dioceses of <b>Pannoniae</b> and Britanniae. The eastern half of the list circles the Mediterranean neatly anticlockwise from south to north or, in continental terms, from Africa, through Asia, to Europe. The arrangement of the western half is less tidy, though it is approximately anticlockwise from north to south, or from Europe to Africa.|$|R
50|$|In 1508 Vietor {{moved to}} Vienna, {{where he worked}} for one year in the print shop of Johannes Winterburger.He printed Paulus of Krosno's Pangyrici ad divum Ladislaum <b>Pannoniae</b> while at Winterburger's. In 1510 he opened his own print shop, the first work being Joachim Vadian's edition of Parvulus philosophie naturalis of Petrus Dresdensis, {{completed}} on August 16, 1510.|$|R
5|$|Besides the Slavs, the {{presence}} of a German-speaking population can be demonstrated based on toponyms. For instance, the Hungarians adopted the Germanized form of the name of the river Vulka (whose name is of Slavic origin) and the document known as the Conversion of the Bavarians and the Carantanians from around 870 lists Germanic place names in <b>Pannonia,</b> including Salapiugin ("bend of the Zala") and Mosaburc ("fortress in the marshes"). Finally, the name of the Barca, Barót and other rivers could be either Turkic or Slavic.|$|E
5|$|Ljudevit Posavski, Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia, led a {{resistance}} to Frankish domination. Ljudevit {{also had to}} fight against Dalmatian Croatia, as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally. After unsuccessful resistance by Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats, the Franks again controlled Istria, Dalmatia, and <b>Pannonia.</b> Nevertheless, Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy between the two Empires, as they {{had a right to}} elect their own prince.|$|E
5|$|Problems arose {{quickly for}} the new Princeps. The Roman legions posted in <b>Pannonia</b> and in Germania had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after {{a short period of}} time mutinied when it was clear that a {{response}} from Tiberius was not forthcoming. Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.|$|E

5000|$|The primate was {{entitled}} to hold national synods, was [...] of the Holy Roman Church, and therefore had the right, inside of his legation (territory where he represented the Pope), to have the cross carried before him, dealt directly with Rome and had the right of visitation in the episcopal sees and the religious houses in Hungary, except the exempt Archabbey of Pannonhalma (S. Martinus in Monte <b>Pannoniæ).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Benedictine Pannonhalma Archabbey or Territorial Abbey of Pannonhalma (lat. Archiabbatia or Abbatia Territorialis Sancti Martini in Monte <b>Pannoniae)</b> is {{a medieval}} {{building}} in Pannonhalma, {{one of the}} oldest historical monuments in Hungary. Founded in 996, it is located near the town, on top of a hill (282 m). Saint Martin of Tours {{is believed to have been}} born at the foot of this hill, hence its former name, Mount of Saint Martin (Márton-hegy), from which the monastery occasionally took the alternative name of Márton-hegyi Apátság. This is the second largest territorial abbey in the world, after the one in Monte Cassino.|$|R
5|$|Reportedly, Tiberius once {{ran into}} Vipsania again, and {{proceeded}} to follow her home crying and begging forgiveness; soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps were taken to ensure that Tiberius and Vipsania would never meet again. Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa's death and his brother Drusus' death in 9BC, seemed the clear candidate for succession. As such, in 12BC he received military commissions in <b>Pannonia</b> and Germania; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.|$|E
5|$|Romulus' father Orestes was a Roman citizen, {{originally}} from <b>Pannonia,</b> {{who had served}} as a secretary and diplomat for Attila the Hun and later rose through the ranks of the Roman army. The future emperor was named Romulus after his maternal grandfather, a nobleman from Poetovio in Noricum. Many historians have noted the coincidence that the last western emperor bore the names of both Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, and Augustus, the first emperor.|$|E
5|$|Sources often {{considered}} more credible than the Augustan History include the contemporary historians Cassius Dio and Herodian. Cassius Dio lived {{from the second}} half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a patrician family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in Africa and <b>Pannonia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Laelianus {{had been}} {{governor}} of both <b>Pannonias</b> and governor of Syria in 153; hence he had first-hand {{knowledge of the}} eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers.

Bassus had been governor of Lower Moesia, and was also made comes. 1.4. Lucius selected his favorite freedmen, including Geminus, Agaclytus, Coedes, Eclectus, and Nicomedes, who gave up his duties as praefectus vehiculorum to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force.

5|$|Also to this end, and {{to provide}} more {{professional}} military leadership, Diocletian separated military from civil command at the lowest, provincial level. Governors of provinces on the frontiers were stripped of command of the troops stationed there in favour of purely military officers called duces limitis ("border commanders"). Some 20 duces may have been created under Diocletian. Most duces were given command of forces in a single province, but a few controlled more than one province e.g. the dux <b>Pannoniae</b> I et Norici. However, at higher echelons, military and administrative command remained united in the vicarii and praefecti praetorio. In addition, Diocletian completed {{the exclusion of the}} senatorial class, still dominated by the Italian aristocracy, from all senior military commands and from all top administrative posts except in Italy.|$|R
