25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive <b>power</b> <b>flow.</b> Reactive <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E

25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above.

25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes <b>power,</b> <b>flow</b> rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Geographical {{features}} such as mountain ranges or big lakes and inland seas often result in large closed loops in high voltage AC power grids. Sizable circulating <b>power</b> <b>flows</b> have been recorded around such loops, which take up transmission line capacity and dissipate but do not deliver electric <b>power.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>flows</b> in high voltage AC transmission grids are dominantly governed by voltage angle differences between connected buses, much {{in the same way}} as Josephson currents depend on phase differences between tunnel-coupled superconductors. From this previously overlooked similarity we argue here that circulating <b>power</b> <b>flows</b> in AC <b>power</b> grids are analogous to supercurrents flowing in superconducting rings and in rings of Josephson junctions. We investigate how circulating <b>power</b> <b>flows</b> can be created and how they behave in the presence of ohmic dissipation. We show how changing operating conditions may generate them, how significantly more power is ohmically dissipated in their presence and how they are topologically protected, even in the presence of dissipation, so that they persist when operating conditions are returned to their original values. We identify three mechanisms for creating circulating <b>power</b> <b>flows,</b> (i) by loss of stability of the equilibrium state carrying no circulating loop flow, (ii) by tripping of a line traversing a large loop in the network and (iii) by reclosing a loop that tripped or was open earlier.

25|$|There has, however, been {{interest}} among railroad operators in returning to DC use at higher voltages than previously used. At the same voltage, DC often has less loss than AC, {{and for this}} reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency three-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases {{on the assumption that the}} total loads of the three phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A few railroads have tried three-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> that occurs twice every cycle.
