25|$|In 1861 Wilson's {{father was}} {{one of the founders of}} the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) after it split from the {{northern}} Presbyterians. He served as the first <b>permanent</b> <b>clerk</b> of the Southern Church's General Assembly, was Stated Clerk for more than three decades from 1865 to 1898, and was Moderator of the PCUS General Assembly in 1879. He became minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Augusta, Georgia, and the family lived there until 1870, when young Wilson was 14. Wilson in 1873 became a communicant member of the Columbia First Presbyterian Church in South Carolina and remained a member throughout his life.|$|E

50|$|Born in East Belfast, {{he moved}} to Hillsborough, County Down, when the family home at 6 Tower Street was {{destroyed}} in the Blitz of 1941. He attended St. John's Primary School, Hillsborough, and returned to East Belfast in 1945, living with his parents at 144 Connsbrook Avenue. He attended Strand Primary School (1945-48), and Grosvenor High School (1948-54), and after completing his Senior Certificate, he accepted a post as <b>Permanent</b> <b>Clerk,</b> N.Ireland Civil Service, Family Allowances Branch (1954-1956). He returned to full-time education at Stranmillis Training College in 1956, graduating with a Cert. Ed (with Special Merit), 1960.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{all federal}} judges {{have at least}} one law clerk; many have two or more. Associate Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are allowed four clerks. Although the Chief Justice is allowed to hire five clerks, Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four. Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years; however, some federal judges hire a <b>permanent</b> law <b>clerk.</b> Such judges usually have one <b>permanent</b> law <b>clerk</b> and one or two law clerks who serve on a term basis.|$|R
50|$|In Merovingian France, ecclesiastical notaries, {{continuing}} Late Imperial practice, {{were attached}} to county courts as clerks of court who recorded proceedings and prepared and engrossed instruments and process which were later sealed before the count with the court's official seal to render them public and authentic. Otherwise, {{it was not until}} the 9th century, when Charlemagne, in an effort to reform the county court system, began to appoint notaries to accompany itinerant royal commissioners during their assize circuit, which notaries were called royal notaries. By the 10th century, they had become <b>permanent</b> <b>clerks</b> of court and came to greatly outnumber and then absorb the comital notaries into their corps. This system was preserved by the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R

50|$|After {{graduating from}} MCKK, {{he worked as}} a trainee clerk at the Johor Government Secretary office and was made a <b>permanent</b> <b>clerk</b> a year later. He served in this {{capacity}} in several departments before joining the Johor Military Forces in 1917 with the rank of lieutenant. Two years later, he rejoined the civil service. Soon later, he found himself in trouble with the Johor palace after expressing his unhappiness over the sale of his family’s ancestral home. The royal palace did not take the issue kindly and terminated his service in June 1920. He rejoined the service again in 1921 as an Assistant Collector of Land Revenue.|$|E
50|$|A police {{contingent}} of 4 men and an Inspector had been stationed in tents at Cloncurry from 1870, {{but it was}} not until 1880 that a <b>permanent</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Petty Sessions was appointed, and Cloncurry's first Police Magistrate was appointed in 1882. At that time there were still no permanent police quarters, and the lock-up was a slab hut with a bark roof. In 1883 the Department of Public Works called tenders for a timber building to serve as a Court house, police quarters and lockup. This was completed in 1885, and the first Court sat in March 1900. From 1907 this building was used for police purposes only and was demolished in 1965.|$|E
60|$|Endymion {{was really}} {{of the same}} opinion, though he was {{conscious}} of the social difficulty which he should have to encounter in order to effect his purpose. Occasionally a statesman in opposition is assisted by the same private secretary who was his confidant when in office; {{but this is not}} always the case--perhaps not even generally. In the present instance, the principal of Lord Roehampton's several secretaries had been selected from the <b>permanent</b> <b>clerks</b> in the Foreign Office itself, and therefore when his chief retired from his official duties, the private secretary resumed his previous post, an act which necessarily terminated all relations between himself and the late minister, save those of private, though often still intimate, acquaintance.|$|R
25|$|Octavian {{offered an}} early amnesty to his opponents and Horace quickly {{accepted}} it. On returning to Italy, he {{was confronted with}} yet another loss: his father's estate in Venusia {{was one of many}} throughout Italy to be confiscated for the settlement of veterans (Virgil lost his estate in the north about the same time). Horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry. In reality, there was no money to be had from versifying. At best, it offered future prospects through contacts with other poets and their patrons among the rich. Meanwhile, he obtained the sinecure of scriba quaestorius, a civil service position at the aerarium or Treasury, profitable enough to be purchased even by members of the ordo equester and not very demanding in its work-load, since tasks could be delegated to scribae or <b>permanent</b> <b>clerks.</b> It was about this time that he began writing his Satires and Epodes.|$|R
50|$|Everingham {{served as}} a {{judicial}} law clerk to the Honorable Howell Cobb, U.S. District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas from 1993-1994 and then entered private practice by joining the firm of Brown McCarroll & Oaks. He then {{served as a}} <b>permanent</b> law <b>clerk</b> to T. John Ward, U.S. District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas from Jan 3, 2000 to April 2007.|$|R
50|$|His son, Robert Davidson, clergyman, b. in Carlisle, Pa., 23 Feb., 1808; d. in Philadelphia, Pa., 6 April 1876, was {{graduated}} at Dickinson {{college in}} 1828, and at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1831. He was {{pastor of the}} second Presbyterian church in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1832-'40, and in the latter year became president of Transylvania University there. After his resignation in 1842 he held pastorates in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1843-1859, New York City in 1860-64, and Huntington, Long Island, in 1864-68, moving again to Philadelphia in the latter year. Davidson was {{for a quarter of}} a century a member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, was <b>permanent</b> <b>clerk</b> of the General Assembly in 1845-1850, and in 1869 was a delegate to the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland, in Edinburgh.|$|E
50|$|Brown also, while {{continuing}} his duties as a minister, {{took up the}} position of professor of divinity by the unanimous agreement of the Synod from 1768. From 1768 until the year of his death he also had the <b>permanent</b> post of <b>clerk</b> of the synod.|$|R
50|$|Mrs McClelland {{claimed that}} her {{dismissal}} {{from being a}} <b>permanent</b> senior <b>clerk</b> for 5 years from the NHS {{on the basis of}} a rule that ‘Female officer will on marriage be required to tender their resignations to the board’, created after her job started, was wrongful. Condition 12 of her contract mentioned gross misconduct and inefficiency as grounds for dismissal. She was given six months notice. The Health Services argued that her contract was not wrongful because it could be terminated on reasonable notice.|$|R
50|$|On 12 June 2012, it was {{announced}} by Sir Bob Kerslake, Head of Her Majesty's Civil Service, that Brennan {{would return to the}} Ministry of Justice as <b>Permanent</b> Secretary and <b>Clerk</b> of the Crown in Chancery. She replaced Sir Suma Chakrabarti, who left to become president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} {{on the federal}} bench in Marshall, Texas, which was growing to become the busiest patent docket in the nation, Everingham handled over 140 Markman {{hearings}} (according to Lex Machina) and tried more than 20 complex patent cases. He also served as the U.S. Magistrate Judge to the judge he had previously served as a <b>permanent</b> law <b>clerk</b> to for over seven years, U.S. District Judge T. John Ward, who also heard the most patent cases in the country during his time {{on the bench and}} who had also introduced the Local Patent Rules to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.|$|R
50|$|He entered Colonial Office in 1900 as a second-class clerk, {{eventually}} {{serving as}} acting first class clerk from 1907 to 1910, {{when he became}} a <b>permanent</b> 1st class <b>clerk.</b> In that same year, Stubbs was sent on a special mission to Malay Peninsula and Hong Kong. He was a member of West African Lands Committee in 1912, and became a colonial secretary of Ceylon in from 1913 to 1919.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} {{reference}} to Clerks of Assize {{was made in}} 1285, when a procedural rule was created stating that justices on Assize should {{be accompanied by a}} clerk tasked with enrolling pleas. The first few sets of Assize Clerks were the private clerks of the judges themselves, but by 1380 records show that the Western Circuit had a <b>permanent</b> employed <b>Clerk,</b> Simon of Lichfield, a barrister of the Old Temple. From then onwards the position was normally filled by barristers. Although a 1541 statute prohibited a Clerk from actively practising as a barrister while serving, the position offered a chance to make connections with the Westminster judges and of power in local politics, and records show that in 1657 the Oxford Circuit clerkship, for example, changed hands for the then-massive sum of £2,575.|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} monk of Monte Cassino, {{was taken to}} Rome by Pope Urban II, and made papal subdeacon (August 1088) and {{cardinal}} deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin (probably on 23 September 1088). As chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from 1089 to 1118, he drastically reformed the papal administration, establishing a <b>permanent</b> staff of <b>clerks</b> for the papacy, overcoming the previous custom of relying on Roman notaries to write papal documents, and introducing the minuscule curial script. His tenure also established the precedent of the papal chancellor always being a cardinal and holding the office for life or until elected pope.|$|R
5000|$|Legg {{was called}} to the Bar in 1960, one of the 12 lawyers {{allocated}} to the Lord Chancellor’s Department from 1962. He worked in the department for his entire career, which when he retired was responsible for administration of the UK legal system, and its co-ordination with European Union law, had resulted in the Department of Constitutional Affairs employing 20,00 staff and a budget of £2 billion. In 1989 he became <b>permanent</b> secretary and <b>Clerk</b> of the Crown in Chancery, until 1998. A Master of the Bench of the Inner Temple since 1984, he was made an honorary Queen's Counsel in 1990.|$|R
50|$|The Master of the Horse in the United Kingdom {{was once}} an {{important}} official of the sovereign's household, though the role is largely ceremonial today. The master of the horse is the third dignitary of the court, and was always {{a member of the}} ministry (before 1782 the office was of cabinet rank), a peer and a privy councillor. All matters connected with the horses and formerly also the hounds of the sovereign, as well as the stables and coachhouses, the stud, mews and previously the kennels, are within his jurisdiction. The practical management of the Royal Stables and stud devolves on the chief or Crown Equerry, formerly called the Gentleman of the Horse, whose appointment was always <b>permanent.</b> The <b>Clerk</b> Marshal had the supervision of the accounts of the department before they are submitted to the Board of Green Cloth, and was in waiting on the Sovereign on state occasions only. Exclusive of the Crown Equerry there were seven regular equerries, besides extra and honorary equerries, one of whom was always in attendance on the Sovereign and rode {{at the side of the}} royal carriage. They were always officers of the army, and each of them was on duty for about the same time as the lords and grooms in waiting. There are still several pages of honour who are nominally in the master of the horse's department, who must not be confounded with the pages of various kinds who are in the department of the Lord Chamberlain. They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen, selected by the sovereign in person, to attend on him at state ceremonies. At the Coronation they assisted the groom of the stole in carrying the royal train.|$|R
50|$|Allan was {{the first}} Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, having been the last Permanent Secretary of the Department for Constitutional Affairs from which it was created, {{together}} {{with the addition of}} HM Prison Service and the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, which were taken from the Home Office. Allan served in both of these roles from 1 August 2004 to 15 November 2007. An historical attribute of the role of Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice and its predecessor departments (which included the Lord Chancellor's Department) is that it carries with it the role of Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, an ancient Office, which entails responsibility for overseeing the creation of Letters Patent under the Great Seal, discharged by the Crown Office, itself based in the House of Lords. The Clerk of the Crown in Chancery also has various other responsibilities, including the State Opening of Parliament, and the Prorogation of Parliament. Until the role of the Lord Speaker was carved out of that of the Lord Chancellor, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery occupied one of Parliament's most prestigious rooms, adjacent to those of the Lord Chancellor. Allan was the last <b>Permanent</b> Secretary and <b>Clerk</b> of the Crown in Chancery to enjoy this splendid room, which he agreed to surrender to the House Authorities so that they could provide suitable accommodation for the newly created Lord Speaker. The only alternative would have been for his political master, the Lord Chancellor, to have given up his room.|$|R
