40|$|This work {{points out}} the role of process induced {{anisotropy}} on damage development in 3 D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer subject to severe compression. Blocks of dense ABS are printed using fusion deposition modelling. Severe compression conditions are attempted to highlight anisotropy induced by printing under different building orientations. X-ray micro-tomography and finite element computation are used to interpret damage occurring during loading. Results show significant inter-filament debonding that occurs during loading due to lateral expansion. Overall behaviour reveals contrasted damage in the plasticity stage, which depends on <b>printing</b> <b>orientation.</b> X-ray micro-tomography suggests also varied magnitudes of shearing, which are responsible for modulation of damage occurring during the irreversible straining.

40|$|Additive manufacturing, {{also known}} as 3 -D printing, has in recent years {{experienced}} a meteoric rise in relevance and application that has seen the technology be used in wide range of industries, from aerospace to construction to healthcare. However, many of {{the methods used for}} 3 -D printing, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), are layer-based processes, resulting in anisotropic material behavior of the printed object. Thus, the <b>print</b> <b>orientation</b> of the object is a crucial factor in its mechanical properties, such as strength and elastic modulus. While anisotropy in 3 -D printing has been extensively studied, a gap in current research exists because previous literature only considered different orthogonal configurations of specimen orientation. This thesis investigates the effect of <b>print</b> <b>orientation</b> on the tensile mechanical material properties of FDM printed test specimens in finer detail. By analyzing many <b>print</b> <b>orientations</b> in between the orthogonal configurations, this project seeks to develop a better, higher resolution understanding of anisotropic behavior that could inform engineers and designers about how to account for anisotropy in their prints. by Frank Yuxing Fang.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) is {{the most}} widely used {{thermoplastics}} in 3 D printing for making models, prototypes, patterns, tools and end-use parts. However, {{there is a lack of}} systematic understanding of the mechanical properties of 3 D printed ABS components, including orientation-dependent tensile strength, creep, and fatigue properties. These mechanical properties are critically needed for design and application of 3 D printed components. The main objective of this research is to systematically characterize key mechanical properties of 3 D printed ABS components, including tensile, creep, and fatigue properties. Additionally, the eff ects of <b>printing</b> <b>orientation</b> on the mechanical prop- erties are investigated. There are two research approaches employed in the thesis: rst, experimental investigation of the tensile, creep, and fatigue properties of the 3 D printed ABS components; second, laminate based finite-element modeling of tensile test to understand the stress distributions in different printing layers. The major conclusions of the thesis work are summarized as follows. The tensile test experiments show that the 0 <b>printing</b> <b>orientation</b> has the highest Young's modulus, 1. 81 GPa, and ultimate strength, 224 MPa. The tensile test simulation shows a similar Young's modulus as the experiment in elastic region, indicating the robustness of laminate based finite element model.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to define an optimum additive manufacturing process which incorporates not only low volume production and short delivery time but also missing, or defective documentation of the industrial components. This inevitably requires the integration of digitization through reverse engineering and state of the art direct and indirect additive manufacturing methods as these are built upon the fundamentals of lead time and cost efficiency which complement business potentials. The work was commissioned by Outotec (Finland) Oy and Aalto University. The data of exemplary components was provided by Outotec (Finland) Oy. The digitization measures and the ISO/ASTM standard additive manufacturing methods were explored and an integrated screening and design process was developed. Cost and lead time analyses were performed in correspondence to exemplary components and their relative business advantages against conventional manufacturing methods were discovered. In addition, performance of two exemplary components was evaluated via additive manufacturing enabled optimization studies. In order to validate and verify the suitability of the manufactured materials according to the predefined standards of Outotec (Finland) Oy, corrosion tests and tensile tests were performed. As a result of this thesis, an additive manufacturing integrated screening algorithm and design process is developed through which costs and lead times of 15 industrial components are evaluated and are utilized for good advantage. In addition, design for additive manufacturing is used to enhance the performance of two industrial components and prototypes are manufactured in order to provide proof of concept. Finally, it is discovered that additively manufactured Stainless Steel 316 L is not as corrosion resistant compared to wrought alloys of EN 1. 4404 and EN 1. 4432 in very aggressive corrosion environments and it has an ultimate tensile strength of approximately 595 MPa with 13 % anisotropy in favour of horizontal <b>print</b> <b>orientation.</b> Whereas, additively manufactured Titanium Ti 64 is corrosion resistant with respect to its bulk material with an ultimate tensile strength of approximately 1100 MPa containing 5 % anisotropy in favour of horizontal <b>print</b> <b>orientation.</b> Overall, this study provided a fundamental workflow for implementation of industrial additive manufacturing for higher production efficiency...|$|R

A number of commercial enterprises are currently offering SLM of tungsten (M&I Materials UK, Smit Röntgen, NL, Layerwise, Belgium) and a few conceptual collimator designs have been proposed. Applications for tungsten collimators have been proposed for high energy I- 131 imaging [5, 6] and in SPECT/MR systems to reduce Eddie currents [7 – 9].

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of an early intervention on distance learning outcomes, specifically learner behaviour associated with persistence and academic achievement, learner satisfaction, and intention to re-enroll. Social support theory was used as a conceptual framework to guide the development of an early intervention designed to enhance social integration by linking the distance learner into existing institutional support systems at a dual mode university. The social integration model proposes that students who are sufficiently integrated into the academic and social life of an institution through various kinds of interaction are more likely to experience goal satisfaction, develop institutional commitment, and, consequently, to persist in their studies. The project involved random assignment of paired study participants (all new to distance education) to either an experimental (n = 93) or a comparison (n = 93) group (the latter referred to herein as the control group). Both groups received a baseline service consisting of a <b>printed</b> <b>orientation</b> package called The Starter Kit that was designed specifically for this study. The experimental group, in addition to these materials, received an intervention consisting of two telephone calls and two follow-up letters from a member of the university staff. These interactions consisted of welcoming the learner, calling the learner's attention to the orientation materials, addressing issues common to distance learners, identifying any problems or needs, providing encouragement and positive emotional support, and strongly reinforcing the notion that help for distance learners is readily available from the institution. The first hypothesis was that the social support intervention provided to the experimental (intervention) group would be positively related to desired learning outcomes, both learner behaviour and learner satisfaction. The second hypothesis was that to the extent that a relationship was revealed between the treatment and the outcomes, it would be mediated by perceived social support. The results of t-tests and chi-square analyses revealed that there was no significant effect (at the p <. 05 level) of the intervention on learner behaviour or satisfaction. It therefore seems appropriate to regard the two orientation efforts (i. e. print materials plus intervention by telephone and mail, versus print materials alone), as about equally (rather than differentially) effective in enhancing distance learner behaviour and satisfaction. Lack of adherence to design, a ceiling effect, and the absence of a no-treatment control group were identified as factors which may have contributed to not finding a direct relationship between the intervention and outcomes. Although no main effects were found for the intervention, a series of post-hoc regression analyses revealed a strong positive relationship between social support and learner satisfaction, including intention to re-enroll. This outcome supports and extends findings from other studies of learner support in distance education by confirming the relationship between perceived institutional support and learner satisfaction, and by providing a theory-based explanation of how interaction enhances the distance learner's experience. The results are consistent with the social support literature in that it was the individual's subjective appraisal of support availability which was associated with satisfaction. Future research should address what kinds of university processes might contribute significantly to perceived social support in a distance learning setting, and if outcomes other than satisfaction can be improved by enhancing perceived social support. Follow-up research will be enhanced by the development in this study of reliable multi-faceted measures of learner satisfaction and perceived social support...|$|R

Firstly, worm-like micellar solutions are model non-Newtonian fluids having a single relaxation time [beta]. At shear rates larger than [...] . however, these systems exhibit shear banding and non-linear rheological behavior, whose importance {{is characterized by the}} Weissenberg number [...] . We develop a stability criterion for the onset of a purely viscoelastic instability for shear-banding fluids, to establish the limitations of conventional rheometric techniques for studying these fluids. A second challenge for conventional rheometers is inertially-driven secondary flows. The onset of these flows is governed by the Reynolds number [...] . where U is the velocity, D is the flow geometry length and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity. We develop microfluidic devices to impose shear and extensional deformation rates up to [...] . at low Re. These experiments combine pressure measurements, micro-particle image velocimetry ([mu]-PIV) and birefringence measurements. We develop a microfluidic chip that enables applied rheologists to quantitatively differentiate between fluid formulations intended for applications at high deformation rates. Finally, we study the interplay between fluid inertia and elasticity on particle migration. The inertially-dominated case is governed by the channel Reynolds number Re, and particle Reynolds number [...] . where a is the particle diameter. In a microfluidic device, the particle and channel size are on the same order, and hence migration occurs at [...] . in the so-called 'inertial focusing' regime which may have applications in clinical medicine.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of magma ascent and emplacement inferred from study of intrusive complexes {{have long been}} the subject of intense debate. Current models favor incremental construction, but much of this work has been focused on a single crustal level. However, the study of magmatism throughout the crust is critical for understanding how magma ascends through and intrudes surrounding crustal material. I present new field, geochronologic and geochemical data from three intrusive complexes emplaced at a range of crustal depths in the Cretaceous North Cascades magmatic arc. Integration of geological mapping and high-precision U-Pb TIMS geochronology allows me to demonstrate variable styles of intrusion in different complexes: Assembly of the Black Peak intrusive complex occurred via a series of small (< 1 km 3) magmatic increments from ca. 91. 7 Ma to 86. 8 Ma. My data indicate each of these increments were emplaced and solidified without major assimilation of country rock. The Seven- Fingered Jack intrusive complex, emplaced around ~ 20 - 25 km, preserves a similar record of intrusion between ca. 91. 8 Ma and 90. 5 Ma. Significant compositional variability and antecrystic zircons suggest that the Seven-Fingered Jack represents the remnants of mid-crustal magmatic conduit. Geochronology from the deep-crustal (~ 25 - 30 km) Tenpeak intrusive complex, intruded between ca. 92. 2 Ma and 89. 5 Ma, suggests that plutons comprising the complex were assembled rapidly (< 300 ka). These intrusive complexes represent different parts of an arc system, including deep- and shallow-crustal intrusions and a magmatic conduit. I propose a model where increments of magma migrated through the crust in magmatic conduits that were active multiple times. These conduits focused rising magma and served as a crustal filter. Geochronologic and isotopic variability between the Tenpeak and Black Peak intrusive complexes are likely a result of this filtering process and the vastly different conditions in the deep and shallow crust. by Erin Kathleen Shea.

40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modelling {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used rapid prototyping processes, considering the relative simplicity, availability, and ease of use. The proliferation of numerous systems at all possible price ranges led to a more widespread usage recently. A semisolid polymer such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is deposited line-by-line, to build three dimensional objects in layers. Being capable of desk-top manufacturing, the process finds wide application in a variety of situations, be it making a mould for the rapid production of an industrial tool or the production of models for preoperative planning of complex cranial reconstructive surgery. While these are predominantly prototyping applications, fused deposition modelling is capable of direct production of end-use parts and believed to be a possible replacement for injection moulding in specific applications. However, there are shortcomings such as inferior material attributes, flat layer deposition resulting in poor surface and part qualities, and undesirably higher number of layers in specific cases leading to high production times, which need to be resolved before realising the full potential of the process. Attempts are made in the past by means of varying raster orientations, adaptive flat layer and even curved layer slicing and deposition schemes to overcome some of the shortcomings with fused deposition modelling. While stair case effects can be minimised to varying degrees by adaptive flat layers, mechanical properties are plausibly enhanced by curved layers, due to continuity in fibres and the possible elimination of inter-layer weaknesses. Further, the mechanism of material deposition and the mechanics of subsequent consolidation involve time and temperature dependent inter-strand and inter-layer sintering. Overall, the internal meso-structure is characterised by the partly fused polymer strands and the intertwining air gaps. Research efforts in different directions, attempting improvements in materials as well as deposition techniques as evident in the literature, allowed some progress towards betterment. Although these improvements, especially in slicing algorithms led to significant progress in FDM processing, the part surface quality and geometric accuracy are still a major concern. Reducing build time and increasing part surface quality are two factors that contradict each other. Though proclaimed to be a solution to both, practical implementation of adaptive slicing has been limited and there is very little understanding of the typical influences of speed and time of printing on the mechanics of material consolidation and the ensuing meso-structures. Curved layer slicing on the other hand evolved as a means of improving surface quality and fibre continuity, but can only be effective in certain regions, close to curved outer surfaces of specific solid models. Considering all these aspects, process enhancements are envisioned in fused deposition modelling, through identification of proper combinations of different slicing and deposition schemes together with appropriate raster orientations. This forms the basis for the current research, envisioning better solutions, combining different slicing and deposition strategies, targeting the most favourable meso-structures in order to achieve the best mechanical and surface qualities for a given part. Theoretical and experimental evaluation of the mechanics of adaptive slicing and raster orientation effects need to be undertaken first, in order to understand the underlying principles governing the typical aspects of fused deposition modelling. Development of mathematical algorithms and practical implementation schemes will follow next, considering different slicing and deposition strategies, evaluating their abilities both individually and in combinations. Based on the results, different approaches will be integrated into an overall selection algorithm to develop the best combination of slicing and raster orientation schemes for processing different zones of specific components with given <b>print</b> <b>orientations.</b> The analytical and experimental evaluations on adaptive slicing and the ensued results established that the inter-road and inter-layer coalescence depends on the filament size as well as the sintering time allowed for a unit length of deposition. Evidently, a proper adjustment of filament size, print speed and total time of printing will be essential to realise the true benefits of adaptive slicing. Raster angle orientation is found to significantly influence the overall characteristics of materials built layer-by-layer. Practical implementation and experimental results showed curved layer printing to be effective in improving the surface quality as well as the part strength as a result of the fibre continuity. Slanting side surfaces and projecting finer details in specific solid models are sufficiently resolved using adaptive flat and curved layer slicing. The integrated alternative slicing approaches performed well developing appropriate slicing schemes in different regions of specific solid models. Overall, different approaches help overcome different shortcomings of fused deposition modelling, but a combination of several possible alternatives is usually the best solution for a given part. Due consideration must be given to the internal mechanics and the resulting meso-structures in order to establish the best combination of the alternative slicing and deposition schemes available for fused deposition modelling...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Physiotherapy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee. The objective of this prospective case series was to assess the efficiency of a guidance manual for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee in relation to pain, range of movement, muscle strength and function, active goniometry, manual strength test and function. METHODS: Thirty-eight adults with osteoarthritis of the knee (> 45 years old) who were referred to the physiotherapy service at the university hospital (Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo) were studied. Patients received guidance for the practice of specific physical exercises and a manual with instructions on how to perform the exercises at home. They were evaluated for pain, range of movement, muscle strength and function. These evaluations were performed before they received the manual and three months later. Patients were seen monthly regarding improvements in their exercising abilities. RESULTS: The program was effective for improving muscle strength, controlling pain, maintaining range of movement of the knee joint, and reducing functional incapacity. DISCUSSION: A review of the literature showed that there are numerous clinical benefits to the regular practice of physical therapy exercises by patients with osteoarthritis of the knee(s) in a program with appropriate guidance. This study shows that this guidance can be attained at home with the use of a proper manual. CONCLUSIONS: Even when performed at home without constant supervision, the use of the <b>printed</b> manual for <b>orientation</b> makes the exercises for osteoarthritis of the knee beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown that supply side sorting {{processes}} at the job application interface contribute to both vertical and horizontal gender job segregation. A prominent set of theories focused on the supply side stress the role of biased self-assessments in inducing gendered career choices (Correll 2001, 2004). In essence, females are posited to be less likely to pursue positions in male-dominated fields because they have downwardly biased views of their competence in those fields due to male-favoring cultural associations of competence. I examine the presence of biased self-assessments in the case of labor market job applicants. Female applicants in my sample generally self-assess their career level lower than males with the same level of education and experience. Consistent with Correll (2001, 2004), there are also differences in the extent of this bias with respect to the gender type of the job pursued. Female applicants report significantly lower self-assessments than comparable males when pursuing jobs in male typed departments but not when pursuing jobs in gender neutral departments. Across the organizational hierarchy, the extent of self-assessment bias favoring males increases as you move up levels of the hierarchy. However, I find no gender self-assessment bias among applicants to departments with female competence associations. This suggests the limits of Correll's "cultural beliefs" explanation of biased self-assessments beyond the case of stereotypically male fields. by Santiago Campero Molina. Thesis: S.

40|$|An {{emerging}} trend {{in real estate}} {{is the development of}} sustainable buildings, partially due to the huge environmental impact of the design, construction and operation of commercial buildings. This thesis provides a brief history of the green building movement and the two (2) programs that encourage the development of energy-efficient and sustainable buildings in the United States: the U. S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program and the Energy Star program, jointly sponsored by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. This thesis also summarizes a study by Piet Eichholtz, Nils Kok and John Quigley titled "Doing Well by Doing Good? Green Office Buildings" published December 2010 in the American Economic Review. This study found a commercial building with an Energy Star rating will rent for three percent (3 %) more per square foot. The addition to effective rent was approximately seven percent (7 %). The increase in value for a sale of a green building was as much as sixteen percent (16 %). Then, using the same data as Eichholtz, Kok and Quigley, this thesis reports on the location and ownership of these green buildings, and calculates Loan to Value (LTV) ratios using the most recent sales price and financing amounts from the CoStar Group. In addition, the property's current LEED certification status is provided as well as a review of Federal and State incentives for sustainable buildings. The results indicate that more green buildings are located in California, Texas and Colorado. Investment Management firms, National Developer/Owners and Real Estate Investment Trusts own the majority of green properties. The Loan to Value (LTV) ratio for green buildings is no higher than those for conventional office buildings. Not enough information is available to compare mortgage interest rates between green and conventional properties. The number of LEED buildings and level of certification has increased since 2008. The states with the largest number of LEED buildings are California, Texas, Colorado and Virginia, correlating with the top states for green buildings overall. Although a worthy goal, there is limited Federal and State assistance for financing of sustainable buildings. by Christopher John Pierce. Thesis (S.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{on the development of}} an additive manufacturing system and methodology for fabricating structures with functionally graded porous internal properties and complex three-dimensional external characteristics. For this purpose, a multi-scale three-dimensional printing system was developed, with capabilities and fabrication methodologies refined in the context of, but not limited to, manufacturing of porous bone substitutes. Porous bone implants are functionally graded structures, where internally, the design requires a gradient in porosity and mechanical properties matching the functional transition between cortical and cancellous bone regions. Geometrically, the three-dimensional shape of the design must adhere to the anatomical shape of the bone tissue being replaced. In this work, control over functionally graded porous properties was achieved by integrating specialized modules in a custom-made additive manufacturing system and studying their effect on fabricated constructs. Heterogeneous porous properties were controlled by: (i) using a micro-syringe deposition module capable of embedding sacrificial elements with a controlled feature size within the structure, (ii) controlling the amount of binder dispersed onto the powder substrate using a piezoelectric printhead, (iii) controlling the powder type or size in real-time, and/or (iv) selecting the <b>print</b> layer stacking <b>orientation</b> within the part. Characterization methods included differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) -thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) to establish the thermal decomposition of sacrificial elements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) to investigate the chemical composition and crystallinity, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy to investigate the physical and structural properties, uniaxial mechanical loading to establish compressive strength characteristics, and porosity measurements to determine the bulk properties of the material. These studies showed that the developed system was successful in manufacturing embedded interconnected features in the range of 100 - 500 μ m, with a significant impact on structural properties resulting in bulk porosities in the range of 30 - 55...|$|R

It can be found at: [URL] supplementary material at [URL] for movies on cell trajectories during division on the grooves, {{as well as for}} alignment and elongation of pre-mitotic protrusions on PLGA grooves. Retraction fibers (RFs) determine orientation of the cell division axis and guide the spreading of daughter cells. Long and unidirectional RFs, which are especially apparent during mitosis of cells in three-dimensional (3 D) environments, enable improved control over cell fate, following division. However, 3 D gel environments lack the cues necessary for predetermining the orientation of RFs to direct tissue architecture. While patterning of focal adhesion regions by microcontact <b>printing</b> can determine <b>orientation</b> of the RFs through enhancing focal adhesion numbers along particular directions, the RFs remain short due to the two-dimensional culture environment. Herein, the authors demonstrate that nanoimprinted grooves of polylactic acid glycolic acid (PLGA) with a high aspect ratio (A. R. of 2. 0) can provide the cues necessary to control the direction of RFs, as well as enable the maintenance of long and unidirectional RFs as observed within 3 D cultures, while the same is not possible with PLGA grooves of lower A. R. (1. 0 or lower). Based on enhanced levels of contact guidance of premitotic fibroblast protrusions at high A. R. grooves and deeper levels of focal adhesion due to filopodia extensions into these grooves, it is suggested that submicron (800 [*]nm width) PLGA grooves with A. R. of 2 are capable of supporting mechanical forces from cell protrusions to a greater depth, thereby enabling the maintenance of the protrusions as long and unidirectional RFs during cell division. Given the scalability and versatility of nanoimprint techniques, the authors envision a platform for designing nanostructures to direct tissue regeneration and developmental biology...|$|R

But as θ approaches 90°, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control {{the effects of}} anisotropy and break lines of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more.David Correa et al. is working with wood composite materials that change shape based on their printed grain direction and anisotropic swelling when water is absorbed. This work is 3D printed and studied on the macro scale rather than micro scale, with layer heights at fractions of millimeters rather than microns. The filament used in this research is a wood composite which is 60% co-polyester and 40% cellulose. The co-polyester binds the cellulose together while the cellulose provides the hygroscopic properties to the composite. Two methods {{have been developed for}} this kind of printing. The first method uses only the wood composite material. Designed deformation shape is printed by controlling the grain pattern, grain <b>orientation,</b> <b>print</b> layer thickness, and print layer interaction. In this method, hygroscopic bending occurs perpendicular to the grain direction. The second method uses both the wood composite as well as standard 3D printing plastics. This is an extension of the first method that introduces a separate layer of non-hygroscopic material that will not swell when exposed to water. This idea builds off of previous research of thermal bimetal  properties based on their relative expansion. Hygroscopic bending occurs only within the wood composite layers when prints of this method are exposed to water. Therefore, deformation shape is a product of both the patterning of material layers as well as the grain of the wood composite layers, offering quicker and more severe deformation than wood composite construction alone. Both methods allow their materials to deform when subject to moisture, as well as regain their shape. The quickest method observed for shape change is by fully submerging prints in warm water.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{parameters}} {{that must be}} set before manufacturing a product using 3 D printing. These parameters include the orientation deposition of that product, type of material, form fill, fill density, and other parameters. The finished product of 3 D printing has some responses that can be observed, measured, and tested. Some of those responses are the processing time, {{the dimensions of the}} end product, its surface roughness and the mechanical properties, i. e. its yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and impact resistance. This research was conducted to study the relationship between process parameters of 3 D printing machine using a technology of fused deposition modeling (FDM) and the generated responses. The material used was ABS plastic that was commonly used in the industry. Understanding the relationship between the parameters and the responses thus the resulting product can be manufactured to meet the user needs. Three different orientations in depositing the ABS polymer named XY(first orientation), YX (second orientation), and ZX (third orientation) were studied. Processing time, dimensional accuracy, and the product strength were the responses that were measured and tested. The study reports that the printing process with third orientation was the fastest printing process with the processing time 2432 seconds followed by orientation 1 and 2 with a processing time of 2688 and 2780 seconds respectively. Dimension accuracy was also measured from the width and the length of gauge area of tensile test specimens printed in comparison with the dimensions required by ASTM 638 - 02. It was found that the smallest difference was in thickness dimension, i. e. 0. 1 &# 8197;mm thicker in printed sample using second orientation than as required by the standard. The smallest thickness deviation from the standard was measured in width dimension of a sample <b>printed</b> using first <b>orientation</b> (0. 13 &# 8197;mm). As with the length dimension, the closest dimension to the standard was resulted from the third orientation product, i. e 0. 2 &# 8197;mm.

40|$|D-glucaric acid is a {{naturally}} occurring compound {{which has been}} explored for a plethora of potential uses, including biopolymer production, cancer and diabetes treatment, cholesterol reduction, and {{as a replacement for}} polyphosphates in detergents. This molecule was identified in 2004 as a "Top Value-Added Chemical from Biomass" by the U. S. Department of Energy (Werpy and Petersen, 2004), implying that production of D-glucaric acid could be economically feasible if biomass were used as a feedstock. A biosynthetic route to D-glucaric acid from D-glucose has been constructed in E. coli by our group (Moon et al., 2009 b), and the goal of this thesis has been to improve the economic viability of this biological production route through improvements to pathway productivity and yield. One part of this thesis involved the application of metabolic engineering strategies towards improving D-glucaric acid productivity. These strategies targeted MIOX, which had been identified previously as the least active pathway enzyme. Directed evolution of MIOX led to the isolation of a 941 bp DNA fragment which increased D-glucaric acid production 65 % from a myo-inositol feed. Fusion of MIOX to SUMO, a eukaryotic post-translational protein tag, significantly increased soluble expression and stability, resulting in a 75 % increase in D-glucaric acid production from a myo-inositol feed. A second part of this thesis attempted to apply synthetic biology strategies towards improving pathway productivity. Manual, delayed expression of MIOX via time-resolved addition of chemical inducers was shown to improve productivity approximately five-fold. However, inducers are generally too costly for use in industrial production processes, so we attempted to develop genetic circuits which could delay MIOX expression autonomously, eliminating the need for costly chemical inducers. Although the attempts to create robust, controllable genetic timers in this thesis were unsuccessful, these attempts provided significant insight into limitations currently preventing widespread application of synthetic biology devices to metabolic engineering problems. A third part of this thesis explored strain engineering as a strategy for improving the yield of D-glucaric acid on D-glucose. Deletion of pgi and zwf was demonstrated to prevent E. coli from consuming D-glucose as well as eliminate catabolite repression effects in the presence of D-glucose. Finally, both D-glucaric acid productivity and yield were shown to be increased significantly in this [Delta]pgi [Delta]zwf strain. Overall, this thesis reports significant strides towards commercially viable titers of D-glucaric acid as well as interesting avenues of research for further pathway improvements. by Eric Chun-Jen Shiue.
