40|$|AbstractTechnology {{transfer}} in public sector has been generally performed with large firms and high-tech ventures {{due to high}} level of expertise knowledge and capability demands with the objects of realizing successful commercialization. But recent public and private promotions of startups with ICT niche services, public institutions began to have interests on possibilities of technology transfer with these none technology based startups. Thereof, {{the purpose of this}} study is to to review the most suitable technology transfer assessment measurements particularly focusing on non-technology based <b>pre-startups</b> and micro-startups. Based on the reviewed and selected measurements, 323 technologies of the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) were evaluated. This study conducted expert interviews and face-to-face expert surveys to draw 60 promising public technologies that can be the most suitable to ICT start-ups. The evaluation results indicated that ‘Environment Control System for Smart Greenhouse’, ‘Fixed-PTZ Camera-linked Face Tracking Technology’ and ‘Multi-layer Copper-clad Fabric Circuit Board (FCB) Technology’ were the top three, respectively. The findings of this study would be a guideline for the promotion of ICT-based startup businesses. The approach and findings of this study contributes to the initial stage of the theoretical and empirical research idea of the non-technology based ICT startups...|$|R

50|$|After works {{had been}} {{completed}} on the raffinate splitter, consideration {{was given to the}} impending start-up of the plant. One of the primary safety critical steps in the prestart-up process was the use of the BP <b>Pre-Startup</b> Safety Review (PSSR) procedure. The purpose of the review was to ensure that complete and thorough technical checks were carried out and that all non-essential personnel were clear during the start-up operation. Once completed, the PSSR would be signed off by refinery operations and safety managers, authorising the start-up work but this essential safety procedure was not completed. In addition, {{there were a number of}} serious issues with items of safety critical equipment which had not been resolved prior to the start-up commencing including an inoperative pressure control valve (PV-5002), a defective high level alarm in the splitter tower (LSH-5102), a defective sight glass used to indicate fluid levels at the base of the splitter tower and the vital splitter tower level transmitter had not been calibrated.|$|E

40|$|New ventures’ {{formation}} {{is among the}} most significant sources of technological innovations and fast economic development. Nonetheless, most of the attempts will never be successful: It is a common saying in Silicon Valley that nine out of ten start-ups fail or suspend their activities without growing (they start “walking dead”) within 5 years. This paper links entrepreneurship and open innovation research in order to provide an integrated view of the probability of a startup to succeed. We suggest that the probability of startup success depends on five main factors, namely (i) the variety of OI practices performed by the founding team; (ii) the breadth of knowledge skills in the founding team; (iii) the amount (the depth) of the team’s prior joint experience; (iv) the moderating effect of the breadth of knowledge skills on prior joint experience (the team’s “learning potential”) and (v) the type of innovation ecosystem a start-up is embedded in. We draw on a unique database built from the business plans of 134 startups participating to the final round of INTEL Global Challenge (IGC) at UC Berkeley (California) from 2005 to 2012. We test five research hypotheses through logistic regression estimates. The model assesses the influence of “openness”, learning potential and innovation ecosystems on the odds of startup “Take-off” (with respect to failure). We find that the extent to which teams build on external innovation sources and integrate external knowledge in the <b>pre-startup</b> phase is a strong determinant of startup success. From an organisational perspective, a higher learning potential (the moderating effect of diversity of skills in the founding team on prior joint experience working at the technology), positively influences the odds of “Take-off”. Moreover, being incubated during the <b>pre-startup</b> phase significantly increases this probability. Our analysis extends previous entrepreneurship research on successful new venture creation and suggests new fields for research on OI in SMEs. Moreover, we take into consideration the role of “open environments” (innovation ecosystems), one of the most actual topics in OI research...|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigated}} how potential entrepreneurs evaluate {{opportunities in}} the <b>pre-startup</b> phase of a new venture creation process. Based on Busenitz and Lau’s (1997) cross-cultural cognitive model of new venture creation, I {{examined the relationship between}} risk perception and a potential entrepreneur’s intention to start a venture, as well as the moderating effect of a potential entrepreneur’s prior exposure to entrepreneurial experience on this relationship. In addition, I looked at the impact of uncertainty avoidance orientation on risk perception using samples collected from Canada and China. Results showed that risk perception was negatively related to entrepreneurial intention. However, it was found that one’s prior exposure to entrepreneurial experience did not offset the negative impact of high risk perception on entrepreneurial intention. Interestingly, Canadian students from a society with lower levels of uncertainty avoidance were found to be less risk-taking and have higher risk perception than Chinese students. iii Acknowledgements I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to my supervisor Dr. Bradle...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how the <b>pre-startup</b> {{circumstances}} surrounding an entrepreneur, {{during the time}} when he or she decides to start a business, affects the post-startup performance. Based on the original dataset, sample selection models are estimated connecting nascent entrepreneurs' selection of a startup with actual entrepreneurs' performance post-startup. The results of this paper confirm that the individual attributes of nascent entrepreneurs, which make it easier (difficult) to decide to start a business, have a tendency to worsen (improve) the performance post-startup. There also seems to be a trade-off between the easiness of a startup and the performance in general post-startup. This suggests that there exists a large number of 'push type entrepreneurs,' who were virtually forced to start up a business due to factors such as restructuring or bankruptcy of a former office, rather than the 'pull type entrepreneurs,' who independently decide on a startup for promising business opportunities. Moreover, from a policy perspective, this suggests consulting and advice services geared toward teaching nascent entrepreneurs how to succeed are more important than policies to augment the number of new startup firms. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{corporate}} size {{represents a}} strategic variable {{of the corporate}} behavior {{that has to be}} kept under control. Otherwise, it could give rise serious inefficiencies that can engrave heavily on the long-term economic equilibrium. In effect, the problem of the dimensional choice can never be considered definitively solved. Frequently, when the firm enter into the working phase, the scheduling that deals with the size reveals itself wrong, with all the consequences easily imaginable. Nevertheless, even when this decision has been correctly formulate during the <b>pre-startup</b> phase, new needs or various problems that require a dimensional adaptation could arise. In concrete terms, this adaptation could be realized through internal and external ways, both with advantages and disadvantages, that require meticulous analysis. For this reason we always have to act carefully, and with far-sightedness, {{in order to avoid the}} necessity to recourse to corrective interventions – that could reveals themselves difficult and expensive – in a limited span of time. Therefore, the dimensional parameters are key concepts to guide strategic decisions and should be constantly monitored. Although, even if necessary, these parameters are difficult to be determined. This paper aims at providing some analytical considerations on these critical concepts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{absorption}} heat transformer {{is a type}} of heat pump which recovers waste heat from an industrial source or a solar collector and increases its thermal level to be used in a specific application. In recent years, these transformers have been used as an alternative to conventional desalination processes. In the Applied Thermal Laboratory of UAEM, an {{absorption heat}} transformer for water purification (AHTWP) with compact components was designed and coupled. The purpose of this design is to reduce heat losses in the system and the final dimensions of the experimental device as well. The equipment has duplex components: Generator-Condenser (GECO) and Absorber-Evaporator (ABEV), these components are helicoidal heat exchangers with a drop distributor to produce a falling film. The AHTWP is instrumented with sensors, flowmeters and pumps that regulate the process variables. Equipment <b>pre-startup</b> proofs were carried out: sealing, hydraulic and insulation; and operational tests, the fluid used was water. With these tests an overall assessment of the components of AHTWP was obtained, and the uncertainty of the operating ranges was reduced. The results were satisfactory, so that the equipment is in optimal condition to start experimental test. The first experimental phase will be a proofs of an aqueous solution of lithium bromide in concentrations between 51 and 56 % by weight...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} plan to process {{a portion of the}} Liquid Effluent Retention Facility (LERF) Basin 44 wastewater through the 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF). The objective of this process test is to determine the most effective/efficient method to treat the wastewater currently stored in LERF Basin 44. The process test will determine the operational parameters necessary to comply with facility effluent discharge permit limits (Ecology 1995) and the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF) acceptance criteria (BHI- 00139), while achieving ALARA goals and maintaining the integrity of facility equipment. A major focus of the test plan centers on control of contamination due to leaks and/or facility maintenance. As a <b>pre-startup</b> item, all known leaks will be fixed {{before the start of the}} test. During the course of the test, a variety of contamination control measures will be evaluated for implementation during the treatment of the remaining Basin 44 inventory. Of special interest will be techniques and tools used to prevent contamination spread during sampling and when opening contaminated facility equipment/piping. At the conclusion of the test, a post ALARA review will be performed to identify lessons learned from the test run which can be applied to the treatment of the remaining Basin 44 inventory. The volume of wastewater to be treated during this test run is 500, 000 gallons. This volume limit is necessary to maintain the ETF radiological inventory limits per the approved authorization basis. The duration of the process test is approximately 30 days...|$|E
40|$|The Nigeria Research Reactor- 1 (NIRR- 1) is the nation’s first {{nuclear reactor}} {{and it is}} sited at the Centre for Energy Research and Training, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria. It is a Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) that {{attained}} criticality on February 03, 2004 and was licensed to operate at a maximum power of 31 kW {{three days a week}} in June 01, 2004. This presentation enumerates the measures put in place to ensure safe operation and adequate maintenance regime as well as the strategic plans for optimal utilization of the reactor. Some of these measures, which bothers on safe operation and sustainable maintenance culture that have been implemented include: strict adherence to the periodic preventive maintenance routines; standard procedures for <b>pre-startup,</b> startup and shut down procedures; provision of a quick access to reactor top to facilitate rapid response in case of emergency, {{especially in the case of}} rod-stuck incident. Similarly, on the basis of experience gained since the commissioning vis-à-vis the neutron flux spectrum characteristics of the MNSRs, experimental protocols are presented for the analysis of elements producing short-lived, medium-lived and long-lived activation products in geologic materials with negligible nuclear interferences especially for the analysis of Mg and Al in the presence of Al and Si respectively. Furthermore, research and development activities in core physics analysis and thermal hydraulics with regards to conversion from the current HEU core to a LEU core under the aegis of the IAEA Coordinated Research Project entitled “Conversion of MNSR to LEU” are outlined...|$|E
40|$|The key {{objective}} of Part I is to synthesize 23 years of innovation research findings from economic, strategy, and marketing literatures {{and extend the}} current theoretical knowledge base in these domains through meta-analysis. In general, empirical evidence {{of the nature of}} the relationship between innovation and its antecedents and consequences is provided, while at the same time providing answers to conflicting conclusions within this field. The conclusions reached provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers of innovation as well as the implications associated with the phenomena. In addition, this study seeks to aid in building a strong theoretical foundation relating to the nature of the relationship of innovation with key antecedents and outcomes. It is demonstrated that innovation serves as a partial mediator of the relationships between organizational and environmental antecedents and firm performance. Part II builds upon the innovation foundations set forth in Part I and extends the focus to consider how innovations are commercialized outside traditional organizational boundaries. Drawing upon the Resource-based view of the firm, the impact of two dynamic capabilities (network ties and absorptive capacity) on marketing strategy formulation effectiveness is explored. Utilizing a unique sample of university <b>pre-startup</b> teams, this research is able to track these teams over time (longitudinal research design) and provide an empirical examination of the role of dynamic capabilities in the effective formulation of marketing strategies. There has been very little empirical research on the formation of strategies at the team level and furthermore, even less research examining marketing strategy making for technologies that were developed outside traditional organizational boundaries and without a predefined market application. Overall, this research will not only contribute significantly to the current innovation and marketing strategy literature, but will also open up new avenues of research in marketing entrepreneurship.

40|$|This {{research}} contributes {{significantly to}} the current marketing strategy literature by examining the effective formation of marketing strategies for new technologies outside traditional organizational boundaries. This important question must be addressed considering that {{at any given time}} roughly 10. 1 million adults in the U. S. are attempting to create new ventures, yet the rate of new venture failures is approximately 70 percent. Therefore it is important to step away from examining innovation and marketing strategy formation within traditional domains (i. e. large organizations) and instead focus on innovations outside organizational boundaries that generate 60 to 80 percent of new jobs annually. In particular, considering the high rate of new venture failure, what characteristics increase the likelihood of success in the commercialization of new technologies? This research seeks to answer these compelling questions, and provide a more process-based approach to studying the effective development of marketing strategies for new technologies. Using a dynamic capabilities framework, the role of internal and external capabilities in driving marketing strategy effectiveness for inventions developed in university labs is explored. The key to building a conceptual framework based upon the dynamic capabilities perspective is to identify the building blocks upon which competitive advantages can be formed, sustained, and improved. One such foundation is knowledge transfer, or learning. The focus of this research is on two distinct components of knowledge transfer: network ties and absorptive capacity. Past research has shown that network ties provide access to information that can be beneficial to performance outcomes (Tsai and Ghoshal 1998; Tsai 2001). In addition to this external source of information, an internal learning capacity must also be present in order to absorb and utilize the information coming in. Both network ties and absorptive capacity have been found to {{play a key role in}} both innovation and superior performance outcomes (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Tsai 2001). Therefore it is expected that both network ties and absorptive capacity will have a complementary impact on marketing strategy effectiveness (marketing strategy performance, marketing strategy creativity, and marketing strategy improvisation). The sample for this research comes from a unique multidisciplinary program within the university setting. Technological Innovation: Generating Economic Results (TI:GER) is a two-year team based program that focuses on integrating science and engineering research with the other components (business and law) necessary for commercialization. The teams’ primary objective is that of developing a commercialization strategy for research developed within university laboratories. This study will collect data from <b>pre-startup</b> teams throughout their participation in the program. In addition, objective outcome measures for marketing strategy effectiveness will be collected from outside industry experts and team supervisors. The longitudinal panel data thus collected will be analyzed using random effects and generalized method of moments (GMM) modeling to account for the dependencies inherent to panel data. There has been very little empirical research on the formation of strategies at the team level and furthermore, even less research examining the formation of strategies for technologies that were developed outside traditional organizational boundaries and without a predefined market application. Overall, this research will not only contribute {{significantly to the}} current innovation and marketing strategy literature, but will also open up new avenues of research in marketing entrepreneurship...|$|E
