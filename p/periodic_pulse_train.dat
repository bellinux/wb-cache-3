40|$|Understanding {{contrast}} transduction {{is essential}} for understanding spatial vision. Previous research (Wichmann et al. 1998; Wichmann, 1999; Henning and Wichmann, 1999) has demonstrated the importance of high contrasts to distinguish between alternative models of contrast discrimination. However, the modulation transfer function of the eye imposes large contrast losses on stimuli, particularly for stimuli of high spatial frequency, making high retinal contrasts difficult to obtain using sinusoidal gratings. Standard 2 AFC contrast discrimination experiments were conducted using <b>periodic</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> as stimuli. Given our Mitsubishi display we achieve stimuli with up to 160 contrast at the fundamental frequency. The shape of the threshold versus (pedestal) contrast (TvC) curve using <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> shows the characteristic dipper shape, i. e. contrast discrimination is sometimes “easier” than detection. The rising part of the TvC function has the same slope as that measured for contrast discrimination using sinusoidal gratings of the same frequency as the fundamental. <b>Periodic</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> offer the possibility to explore the visual system’s properties using high retinal contrasts. Thus they might prove useful in tasks other than contrast discrimination. Second, at least for high spatial frequencies (8 c/deg) it appears that contrast discrimination using sinusoids and <b>periodic</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> results in virtually identical TvC functions, indicating a lack of probability summation. Further implications of these results are discussed...|$|R

To this end, we incorporate synaptic plasticity with symmetric spike-timing characteristics into a population of bursting neurons, which are interacting via chemical synapses. Under spontaneous conditions, qualitatively different stable dynamical states may coexist. We observe states characterized either by pathological synchrony or by uncorrelated activity. Suitably designed stimulation protocols enable to shift the neuronal population from one dynamical state to another. Due to low-frequency <b>periodic</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> stimulation, the population learns pathologically strong interactions, as known from the kindling phenomenon. In contrast, desynchronizing stimulation, e. g., multi-site coordinated reset stimulation, enables the network to unlearn pathologically strong synaptic interactions, so that a powerful long-term anti-kindling is achieved. We demonstrate that anti-kindling can be achieved even with weak and/or short desynchronizing stimuli, which {{are not able to}} cause a complete desynchronization {{in the course of the}} stimulation.

40|$|Abstract — Some signals, {{such as in}} radar systems, {{communication}} systems, and neural systems, {{are transmitted}} as <b>periodic</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>trains.</b> If more than one <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> is transmitted over the same communication channel, a challenge is to separate them for source identification at the receiver. This is known as <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> deinterleaving and is clearly a fundamental problem {{in the study of}} discrete-event systems. Frequently, the only relevant information at the receiver is the time of arrival (TOA) data, which is usually contaminated by jitter noise. Perhaps there are also missing or overlapping pulses. In this paper, we present an approach for deinterleaving <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> and estimating their periods using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). A naive application of EKF theory is not attractive because of discontinuities in the signal model. Here, a form of smoothing of the discontinuities is proposed so that the EKF approach becomes attractive. The advantage of this EKF approach is that it is less computationally expensive than most previously proposed methods, which are of order N 2, where N is the number of pulses being processed. The computation required here is of order N. The method proposed appears to give useful results for up to seven or so <b>pulse</b> <b>trains,</b> particularly when there is some a priori information on the pulse frequencies, which can be obtained using computations of order N log N.
