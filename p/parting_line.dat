5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the <b>parting</b> <b>line.</b> The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E
500|$|A <b>parting</b> <b>line,</b> sprue, gate marks, and {{ejector pin}} marks are usually {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. <b>Parting</b> <b>line</b> and ejector pin marks result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new slicing {{approach}} that uses multiple sets of cutting planes to automatic determine <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> and boundaries of undercuts of complex CAD parts for the multi-piece molds design. In this algorithm, {{the group of}} feasible parting directions is first collected and three sets of cutting planes are then formed based on the primary parting direction. One set of cutting planes is used to generate slicing profiles, and two others are used to extract intersection points passed through by parting loops and boundaries of undercuts. The result shows that the proposed <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> are suitable to obtain parting surfaces and construct the entire mold-pieces. The algorithm provides a highly effective solution for handling many complex industrial parts...|$|R
500|$|The {{amount of}} resin {{required}} {{to fill the}} sprue, runner and cavities of a mould comprises a [...] "shot". Trapped air in the mould can escape through air vents that are ground into the <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> of the mould, or around ejector pins and slides that are slightly smaller than the holes retaining them. If the trapped air {{is not allowed to}} escape, it is compressed by the pressure of the incoming material and squeezed into the corners of the cavity, where it prevents filling and can also cause other defects. The air can even become so compressed that it ignites and burns the surrounding plastic material.|$|E
500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the <b>parting</b> <b>line.</b> The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E

50|$|In 1957, Vagn Aage Jeppesen - {{professor}} at the Danish Technical University claimed a patent for a device producing flaskless molds of sand mixtures with vertical <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> for casting metal parts. In 1960, Danish company Dansk Industri Syndikat A/S (DISA) acquired the patent and started working on its implementation.|$|R
40|$|Casting and molding {{are popular}} {{manufacturing}} processes that transform molten materials into designed solid shapes. A gate and a mold cavity (impression) {{are the two}} necessary components of a molding process. Proper selection of a location for the gate is a challenging issue, which is commonly conducted by complex thermal and fluid simulations. In addition, mold pieces (cavities) generation from a given molded part usually consumes much time and labor as CAD software provides very limited functions for mold design. A simple and effective automation system of mold design is needed to dramatically reduce the cycle time of developing new products. The objective of this thesis is to propose a design framework for automated gate location selection and mold shape (cavity) generation. Reaction injection molding (RIM) is a molding process becoming more popular as it has wide applications and superior processing conditions. The critical requirement in RIM is that the filling time is short enough to allow the curable resins to fill up the mold before polymerization. Besides increasing injection pressure, proper selection of a gate location is an important element to achieve this requirement. From a geometric point of view, the geodesic center of a molded part is {{a good candidate for}} a gate location as it gives the shortest flow length. However, the geodesic center of a 3 -D object is difficult to obtain. The Surface Contraction Method (SCM) proposed in this thesis is to approximate the geodesic center. This method, which is implemented on a voxel-based model representing a 3 -D object, suffers easily from artificial breakages. To prevent artificial breakages, three breakpoint-checking rules were developed to guarantee the connectivity of the surface contracted object. This enables the object to contract smoothly into the approximate geodesic center without artificial breakages. The SCM was applied to several illustrative cases and the resultant gate locations are in line with physical expectations. Experiments were also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the SCM. Many researchers considered mold shape (cavity) generation as simply looking for <b>parting</b> <b>lines.</b> However, <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> alone cannot fully define the mold cavity in cases with inner <b>parting</b> <b>lines.</b> In the thesis, the concept of a contact line is introduced to fully define the mold cavity with inner <b>parting</b> <b>lines.</b> A draft angle can also be added to the mold halves to reduce the difficulty of assembly. In order to automate the process of mold shape generation, new algorithms implemented on the voxel model are proposed. The algorithms determine not only the <b>parting</b> <b>lines,</b> but also the surface points of the cavities of mold halves...|$|R

60|$|The Limits of the Palæarctic Region.--The {{boundaries}} of this region, as nearly {{as they can}} be ascertained, are shown on our general map {{at the beginning of this}} chapter, but it will be evident on consideration, that, except in a few places, its limits can only be approximately defined. On the north, east, and west it extends to the ocean, and includes a number of islands whose peculiarities will be pointed out in a subsequent chapter; so that the southern boundary alone remains, but as this runs across the entire continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, often traversing little-known regions, we may perhaps never be able to determine it accurately, even if it admits of such determination. In drawing the boundary line across Africa we meet with our first difficulty. The Euro-Asiatic animals undoubtedly extend to the northern borders of the Sahara, while those of tropical Africa come up to its southern margin, the desert itself forming a kind of sandy ocean between them. Some of the species on either side penetrate and even cross the desert, but it is impossible to balance these with any accuracy, and it has therefore been thought best, as a mere matter of convenience, to consider the geographical line of the tropic of Cancer to form the boundary. We are thus enabled to define the Palæarctic region as including all north temperate Africa; and, a similar intermingling of animal types occurring in Arabia, the same boundary line is continued to the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Persia and Afghanistan undoubtedly belong to the Palæarctic region, and Baluchistan should probably go with these. The boundary in the north-western part of India is again difficult to determine, but it {40} cannot be far one way or the other from the river Indus as far up as Attock, opposite the mouth of the Cabool river. Here it will bend to the south-east, passing a little south of Cashmeer, and along the southern slopes of the Himalayas into East Thibet and China, at heights varying from 9,000 to 11,000 feet according to soil, aspect, and shelter. It may, perhaps, be defined as extending to the upper belt of forests as far as coniferous trees prevail; but the temperate and tropical faunas are here so intermingled that to draw any exact <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> is impossible. The two faunas are, however, very distinct. In and above the pine woods there are abundance of warblers of northern genera, with wrens, numerous titmice, and a great variety of buntings, grosbeaks, bullfinches and rosefinches, all more or less nearly allied to the birds of Europe and Northern Asia; while a little lower down we meet with a host of peculiar birds allied to those of tropical Asia and the Malay Islands, but often of distinct genera. There can be no doubt, therefore, of the existence here of a pretty sharp line of demarkation between the temperate and tropical faunas, though this line will be so irregular, owing to the complex system of valleys and ridges, that in our present ignorance of much of the country it cannot be marked in detail on any map.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{possible}} to determine the number and disposition of <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> of the fuselage skin. However, if William Hawley Bowlus followed his own standard practice, entire sides from upper to lower center lines would have been molded as one piece. The average thickness of the skin would have been one quarter inch with additional laminations providing attaching points for the internal structure. Given the overall use of Duraloid throughout the airframe components it is reasonable to believe the bonding was accomplished using the Bakelite-based resin.|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} slip casting ceramic {{articles}} {{that does not}} employ parting agents and affords the casting of complete, detailed, precision articles that do not possess <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> is presented. This process is especially useful for high temperature superconductors and water-sensitive ceramics. A wax pattern for a shell mold is provided, and an aqueous mixture of a calcium sulfate-bonded investment material is applied as a coating to the wax pattern. The coated wax pattern is then dried, followed by curing to vaporize the wax pattern and leave a shell mold of the calcium sulfate-bonded investment material. The shell mold is cooled to room temperature, and a ceramic slip, created by dispersing a ceramic powder in an organic liquid, is poured therein. After a ceramic shell of desired thickness or a solid article has {{set up in the}} shell mold, excess ceramic slip is poured out. The shell mold is misted with water and peeled away from the ceramic article, after which the ceramic is fired to provide a complete, detailed, precision, high temperature superconductive ceramic article without <b>parting</b> <b>lines.</b> The casting technique may take place {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field to orient the ceramic powders during the casting process...|$|R

5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections.

This problem is minimized by including vents along the <b>parting</b> <b>lines,</b> however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|R
25|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings, that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, requires no draft, {{and has no}} <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> so no flash is formed. As compared to investment casting, it is cheaper {{because it is a}} simpler process and the foam is cheaper than the wax. Risers are not usually required {{due to the nature of}} the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification.|$|R

As many as several hundred patterns can be assembled into a tree. Wax patterns can also be chased, which means <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> or flashings are rubbed out using the heated metal tool.
