5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, the <b>Prince</b> hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the <b>Prince</b> wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save the <b>Prince,</b> Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the <b>Prince</b> mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. The <b>Prince</b> refuses and stabs the hourglass with the Dagger. Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the <b>Prince,</b> still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the <b>Prince</b> has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The <b>Prince</b> kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the <b>Prince</b> mentions a private word she told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E
