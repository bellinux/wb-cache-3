Sodium valporate is one of the drugs that has been proved effective in adults. To compare the effectiveness and safety of sodium valportate and propranolol in childhood migraine, this study was designed. Methods: A 15 months open labeled crossover clinical trial was carried out having a 4 week medication free baseline phase and a 8 week treatment phase for each drug and a 4 week wash out period before crossing over. Fifty two patients started the study and we missed 4 of them due to poor compliance. Forty eight patients (23 girl and 25 boys) were randomized to sodium valporate or propranolol(1 : 1 ratio) treatment group. Results: The response to treatment was evaluated on basis of frequency and severity of migraine attacks.
