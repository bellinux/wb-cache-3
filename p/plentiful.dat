5|$|An {{oceanic climate}} is {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, and in southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by <b>plentiful</b> precipitation year-round.|$|E
5|$|Poison ivy {{is common}} {{the length of}} the trail, and more <b>plentiful</b> in the South.|$|E
5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where {{food and water}} were <b>plentiful.</b> Settlement {{expanded}} inland to the Mauna Loa – Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations. The mountain's <b>plentiful</b> forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.|$|E
5|$|Another technique, used {{in areas}} where wood is <b>plentiful,</b> {{is to build a}} wood frame house and to infill it with mud, {{primarily}} to provide insulation. In parts of England a similar technique was used with cob.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites usually hunt singly or in pairs, though {{where food}} is <b>plentiful</b> they occur in small family groups {{and can be}} loosely gregarious at times of irruptions, with up to 70 birds {{reported}} feeding together during a mouse plague. They roost communally, like other Elanus species.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is mined as {{chromite}} (FeCr2O4) ore. About two-fifths of the chromite ores and concentrates in {{the world}} are produced in South Africa, while Kazakhstan, India, Russia, and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are <b>plentiful,</b> but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Roman {{administrative}} and military presence is <b>plentiful,</b> and {{the junction of}} the east–west Incense Road to Gaza and the north–south route to the Red Sea probably made it an economically valuable frontier outpost.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur {{at any time of}} year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or <b>plentiful</b> food.|$|E
5|$|Geography {{has a large}} {{influence}} on Israel cuisine, and foods common in the Mediterranean region, such as olives, wheat, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, and vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplants, and zucchini are prominent in Israeli cuisine. Fresh fruits and vegetables are <b>plentiful</b> in Israel and are cooked and served in many ways.|$|E
5|$|Many weekend visitors—particularly from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia—prefer Belgrade nightlife to that {{of their}} own capitals, due to a {{perceived}} friendly atmosphere, <b>plentiful</b> clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, {{and the lack of}} restrictive night life regulation.|$|E
5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, {{but only the}} latter is fissile. The chemically identical uranium-235 has to be physically separated from the more <b>plentiful</b> isotope. Various methods were considered for uranium enrichment, most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Squanto {{and another}} guide sent by Massasoit in 1621 named Hobomok helped the colonists set up trading posts for furs. Chief Massasoit later formed a Peace Treaty with the Pilgrims. Upon growing a <b>plentiful</b> harvest {{in the fall}} of 1621, the Pilgrims {{gathered}} with Squanto, Samoset, Massasoit, and ninety other Wampanoag men in a celebration of thanksgiving to God for their <b>plentiful</b> harvest. This celebration is known today as the First Thanksgiving, and is still commemorated annually in downtown Plymouth with a parade and a reenactment. Since 1941, Thanksgiving has been observed as a federal holiday in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The area {{receives}} <b>plentiful</b> sunshine {{throughout the}} year, averaging {{a total of}} 2920 hours, or 66.7% of the possible total. The daily sunshine amount is highest in May, when the sun's angle of incidence has increased the hours of daylight and the rainy season has not yet begun.|$|E
5|$|The middle–late Campanian {{formations}} show {{a greater}} diversity of dinosaurs {{than any other}} single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, and Torosaurus, which suggests food was <b>plentiful</b> immediately prior to the extinction.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, in the {{department}} of the Trans-Mississippi, problems with the distribution of the <b>plentiful</b> uniforms made in Houston and Shreveport meant that the South Western forces went without proper uniforms for some part of the war.|$|E
5|$|Water {{activities}} are <b>plentiful</b> during warmer months. Rafting {{can be done}} through the Yosemite Valley on the Merced River. There are also swimming pools available at Yosemite Lodge and Curry Village.|$|E
5|$|While wintering, {{bald eagles}} {{tend to be}} less habitat and {{disturbance}} sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with <b>plentiful</b> perches and waters with <b>plentiful</b> prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.|$|E
5|$|Belarusian cuisine {{consists}} {{mainly of}} vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest {{meal of the}} day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more <b>plentiful</b> because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.|$|E
5|$|Chaco endures {{remarkable}} climatic extremes: temperatures {{range between}} , and may swing 60°F (33°C) {{in a single}} day. The region averages fewer than 150frost-free days per year, and the local climate swings wildly from years of <b>plentiful</b> rainfall to prolonged drought. The heavy influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation contributes to the canyon's fickle climate.|$|E
5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is <b>plentiful,</b> as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was <b>plentiful,</b> Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are <b>plentiful.</b> Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much of their time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, and sheep, goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a <b>plentiful</b> source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|In winter, the {{resident}} bird population is increased by visitors from north-east Europe, {{in particular the}} widgeon and Greenland white-fronted goose. Riverside mammals are seen frequently and otters, mink and fox are common. Trout and salmon are less common in the Shannon than they once were, however pike is still <b>plentiful</b> and attracts many anglers.|$|E
5|$|It bred on rocky, {{isolated}} islands {{with easy}} access to the ocean and a <b>plentiful</b> food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. When not breeding, they spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Legitimate use of Preludin {{required}} a doctor's prescription, but Kirchherr's mother {{was able to}} obtain it from a local chemist who supplied the drug without asking questions. Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner, Weissleder, not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin. Starr explained that Dexedrine too was in <b>plentiful</b> supply in Hamburg, as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus, in association with decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.|$|E
5|$|Medaka and {{zebrafish}} {{are used}} as research models for studies in genetics and developmental biology. The zebrafish is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory vertebrate, offering the advantages of genetic similarity to mammals, small size, simple environmental needs, transparent larvae permitting non-invasive imaging, <b>plentiful</b> offspring, rapid growth, and the ability to absorb mutagens added to their water.|$|E
5|$|Nigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, {{is known}} for its {{richness}} and variety. Many different spices, herbs and flavourings are used in conjunction with palm oil or groundnut oil to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with chili peppers. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are <b>plentiful</b> and varied.|$|E
5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are heather and gorse, shaped by the prevailing wind; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are <b>plentiful</b> lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Otters {{may prefer}} {{to feed on}} crustaceans, {{especially}} crayfish (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) more than fish where they are locally and seasonally <b>plentiful.</b> In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the otter's diet. A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{deposits}} of iron ore {{are found in}} Cumbria and the North East, and fluorspar and baryte are also <b>plentiful</b> in northern parts of the Pennines. Salt mining in Cheshire has a long history, and both remaining rock salt mines in Great Britain are in the North: Winsford Mine in Cheshire and Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire, which also produces half of the UK's potash.|$|E
5|$|Support for the dam project {{came from}} a variety of sources, but {{supporters}} tended to use three primary arguments in favor of its construction: the electricity generated by the project would be cheap and <b>plentiful,</b> industries would be attracted to Alaska by the cheap electricity, and the dam's construction would have minimal impact on the environment and human populations.|$|E
5|$|Telescopic {{observations}} in the mid-20th century began to hint at Io's unusual nature. Spectroscopic observations suggested that Io's surface was devoid of water ice (a substance {{found to be}} <b>plentiful</b> on the other Galilean satellites). The same observations suggested a surface dominated by evaporates composed of sodium salts and sulfur. Radiotelescopic observations revealed Io's influence on the Jovian magnetosphere, as demonstrated by decametric wavelength bursts tied to the orbital period of Io.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is <b>plentiful,</b> it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
5|$|The party opposes {{government}} subsidy of wind turbines and instead proposes {{the increased use}} of clean coal technology and nuclear fusion to address the UK's energy shortage. This would be accompanied by a state-owned 'Public British Energy Company', a measure that the party hopes will keep consumer costs affordable. The party would also abandon catch quotas set by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy and establish 'no fishing zones' to ensure <b>plentiful</b> stocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth of}} Herrerasaurus {{indicate}} {{that it was a}} carnivore; its size indicates it would have preyed upon small and medium-sized plant eaters. These might have included other dinosaurs, such as Pisanosaurus, as well as the more <b>plentiful</b> rhynchosaurs and synapsids. Herrerasaurus itself may have been preyed upon by giant rauisuchids like Saurosuchus; puncture wounds were found in one skull.|$|E
