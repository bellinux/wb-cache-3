5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks about giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Wii Remote Plus was reissued, and branded for the Wii U, {{improved}} by adding another sync {{button on the}} battery cover, allowing users to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> without taking the battery cover off.|$|E
25|$|The Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth {{low energy}} {{wearable}} device, developed by Nintendo's Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain {{actions in the}} game without looking at their smart device. When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates. The player can then <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until {{the next time they}} sign into the app on their mobile device. The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin. The decision to create the device rather than create a smart watch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smart watch is prohibitively expensive. It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.|$|E

When you <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> to {{activate}} <b>the</b> scene you observed a room filled with cobwebs, and other creepy things, many of which became animated (accompanied with recorded sounds) when you <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>button.</b> <b>The</b> witch stood over a cauldron, stirring her brew round and round, Spiders rose and fell {{just in front of}} you. It was humorous but too frightening for some small children.|$|R
25|$|In November 2013, Jawbone {{announced}} the UP24 and a software update. With similar dimensions to the UP, UP24 features {{the ability to}} sync wirelessly via Bluetooth to the updated app. UP24 has as a 7-day battery life (depending on use) and the previous 3.5mm connector {{was replaced by a}} 2.5mm connector. The software provided more real-time information to help motivate users. The app also suggests goals based on user's habits. Live notifications are provided on the UP24 so users will get push notifications when they get close to their goals. A new activity log gives a snapshot of a user's day and when the UP24 last synced. The 3.0 app also will automatically analyze sleep data from the previous night if users forget to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> for sleep mode, and lets users edit sleep/wake times.|$|E
25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button.</b> In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E
500|$|Tennis for Two {{was first}} shown on October 18, 1958. The game was {{rendered}} as a horizontal line, representing the tennis court, {{and a short}} vertical line in the center, representing the tennis net. The first player would <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> on their controller to send the ball, a point of light, over the net, and it would either hit the net, reach {{the other side of}} the court, or fly out of bounds. The second player could then hit the ball back with their controller while it was on their side, either before or after it bounced on the ground. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut. Higinbotham claimed later that [...] "the high schoolers liked it best, you couldn't pull them away from it." [...] Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity. Players could set the game to simulate the gravity levels of the Moon or Jupiter. Higinbotham referred to the game as Tennis for Two, though a placard attached to the 1959 version titled it [...] "Computer Tennis". After the 1959 exhibition, the game was dismantled so its components could be put to other uses.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{component}} of the test is [...] "extinction". Again, participants learn to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> for picture A but not picture B. However this time, instead of the rules reversing, the rule changes altogether. Now the participant will be punished for pressing the button in response to either picture. The correct response is not to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> at all, but people with OFC dysfunction {{find it difficult to}} resist the temptation to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> despite being punished for it.|$|E
2500|$|This has two components. In {{the first}} component, [...] "reversal learning", {{participants}} {{are presented with}} one of two pictures, A and B. They learn {{that they will be}} rewarded if they press a button when picture A is displayed, but punished if they <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> when picture B is displayed. Once this rule has been established, the rule swaps. In other words, now it is correct to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> for picture B, not picture A. Most healthy participants pick up on this rule reversal almost immediately, but patients with OFC damage continue to respond to the original pattern of reinforcement, although they are now being punished for persevering with it. Rolls et al. noted that this pattern of behaviour is particularly unusual given that the patients reported that they understood the rule.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her Russian {{counterpart}} Sergey Lavrov symbolically {{pressed a}} [...] "reset" [...] button. The gag fell short as the Russian translation on the button was misspelt by the State Department and actually meant [...] "overload" [...] instead of [...] "reset". After {{making a few}} jokes, they decided to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> anyway.|$|E

60|$|The buccaneers did {{not notice}} the movement, but rushed upon him so quickly {{that he had to}} <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> at a lively rate.

His face resumed its normal hue. Automatically, his hands began to move toward his coat-tails, his feet to spread themselves. Jimmy noted with a smile these signs of restored complacency. He hoped ere long to upset that complacency somewhat.|$|E

60|$|Mr Bloom {{with careful}} hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant. Still {{you have to}} get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden {{discovered}} with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. <b>Press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.|$|E
