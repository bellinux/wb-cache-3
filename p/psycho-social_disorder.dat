40|$|Este artigo retrata a história recente da transformação do conceito da impotência, como desordem psicossexual, em disfunção erétil, considerada como uma doença de etiologia principalmente orgânica. Demonstra sucessivamente como a impotência masculina constituiu uma abrangência global de todo o ciclo da resposta sexual, e ainda, uma violação da identidade e da autoimagem; como o relacionamento entre casais se transformou progressivamente em dificuldade e como a falta de um órgão claramente circunscrito pode ser o objeto de um "simples" tratamento medicamentoso. Este processo foi analisado a partir de modelo sequencial da medicalização (Conrad), que permite compreender a intervenção dos diferentes atores envolvidos (cientistas, médicos, industriais, políticos, empresários). Compreende-se, assim, como as descobertas científicas são selecionadas e desenvolvidas de acordo com seu potencial {{industrial}} e são aplicadas às pesquisas clínicas; como entidades clínicas são reconceitualizadas e medidas através de investigações epidemiológicas na população em geral e como são criados os ensaios clínicos que levam à criação de um medicamento. Em seguida, observam-se como os atores da saúde pública e os políticos intervêm para dar legitimidade ao novo problema criado. Por fim, avalia-se a possibilidade da desmedicalização de problemas com o uso não-médico do medicamento, no contexto do desenvolvimento da autoprescrição na Internet. This paper delineates {{the history}} of the recent transformation of the concept of impotence - from a <b>psycho-social</b> <b>disorder</b> to a disease with an organic etiology. Then it shows how male impotency, which globally affected the entire sexual response cycle, even acted upon self-image and the representation of the couple - progressively became a disorder as the failure of a well controlled organ liable to undergo a single medicinal treatment. This process is analyzed from the sequential model of medicalization, making the interference of the several actors implied (scientists, practitioners, industrialists, politicians, businessmen) easier to understand. This sheds light on the way scientific discoveries are selected and developed according to their industrial potential, then applied to clinical research; how clinical entities are reconceptualized and measured through epidemiologic studies among the general population, how clinical trials are conducted and how they lead to the creation and validation of a drug in public health settings. Next, we observe how public health actors and politicians are involved with giving this new problem legitimacy. Eventually, we evaluate the germs of de-medicalization, caused by the non-medical uses of the drug within the context of self-prescription which is currently developed on the Internet...|$|E

30|$|Immigration from {{a patriarchal}} culture {{into a more}} egalitarian one {{produces}} many risk factors for IPH. One of these significant risk factors {{is derived from the}} acculturation process, which provides two relevant explanations for the occurrence of IPH among Ethiopian immigrants to Israel. First of all, acculturation stress may be responsible for some of the <b>psycho-social</b> <b>disorders</b> witnessed in new Ethiopian immigrants. Secondly, dislocation is caused between the Ethiopian {{men and women in the}} level they have achieved in the acculturation process; as long as the women more quickly attain higher levels than the men in this process, we can expect to see more cases of IPV and IPH. The acculturation process clashes, in many ways, with the norms, perceptions and behaviors which were taken for granted in the original culture. The resulting reversal of gender roles and status between men and women causes one of the main risk factors among these immigrants.|$|R
40|$|Cancer, {{which is}} one of the major health {{problems}} leading to despair, uncertainty, pain and suffering, is perceived as a serious and chronic disease. Cancer negatively affects individuals' quality of life due to the physical, psychological, and socio-economic problems. Today, despite inspiring advances in diagnosis and treatment of cancer and increase in survival rates of patients, appearance of physical and <b>psycho-social</b> <b>disorders</b> during cancer course disrupts the adaptation mechanisms of patients and undermines expectations for the future. Most of the time in clinical practice, clinicians focus on physical assessments and treatment planning of cancer patients primarily, ignoring social, psychological, economic and cultural factors related with the disease. This approach definitely influences patients' hope levels and their effective dealing with the disease. The aim of this article is to guide medical staff and increase awareness about the concept of hope in patients with cancer.

40|$|Brittle asthma is a {{clinical}} phenotype {{of the disease}} at the severe end of the spectrum. Type 1 brittle asthma is characterised by a maintained wide PEF variability (> 40 % diurnal variation for > 50 % of the time {{over a period of}} at least 150 days) despite considerable medical therapy including a dose of inhaled steroids of at least 1500 pg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Type 2 brittle asthma is characterised by sudden acute attacks occurring in less than three hours without an obvious trigger on a background of apparent normal airway function or well controlled asthma. Mechanisms behind the development of brittle asthma include smooth muscle contraction and edema of the airways, which are supported by chronic airway inflammation. Allergy reactions, impairment of local immunity, respiratory infections, <b>psycho-social</b> <b>disorders</b> and reduced perception of worsening airway function are the risk factors for brittle asthma. The diagnosis is based on the analysis of specific symptoms, role of triggers, personal or family history, measurement of lung function and PEF monitoring. Pharmacological treatment of type 1 brittle asthma in addition to the high doses of inhaled and/or oral steroids and bronchodilators includes subcutaneous injections of beta 2 agonist and inhalation of long acting beta 2 agonist. The treatment of patients with type 2 brittle asthma includes exclusion of allergen exposure, identification of triggers, self management and management of acute attacks...|$|R
40|$|For {{a number}} of years now, banks have been going through {{enormous}} changes in organization and structure. New technology and new ways of structuring the operation have left their mark on the working conditions and daily lives of employees. Deregulation of labor markets, emerging technologies and new types of jobs have significantly reshaping working lives by continuous changes on employment and working conditions. Such a scenario has a relevant impact not only on companies' organization but also on working population's health. The banking sector is particularly well-deserved of a specific and thorough analysis, in view of the recent increase in <b>psycho-social</b> <b>disorders</b> of employees. This {{may be related to the}} major organizational changes affecting this sector and, in particular, to the restructuring processes resulting from the global economic crisis. Our aim is to assess the scale of the phenomenon and how far it relates specifically to the processes of bank organization. With this in mind, through a review of the literature, we selected the main studies dealing with work-related stress in banking, so that we could reach a better understanding of the phenomenon as it relates specifically to this set of workers. The search took place on the MEDLINE® database; in total 20 articles were chosen. There was uniform agreement among the studies that stress in the banking workplace is now at critical levels, and that it can have deleterious psychological effects on workers, and on their physical health, and that organizations, too, are affected. Most studies showed that mental health problems had increased in the banking sector, and that they were stress-related. Examples began with anxiety and depression, carried on through maladaptive behaviors, and ended in job burnout.

The Health Survey for England (HSE), 2002 : Teaching Dataset has been prepared solely {{for the purpose of}} teaching and student use. The dataset will help class tutors to incorporate empirical data into their courses and thus to develop students' skills in quantitative methods of analysis. All the variables and value labels are those used in the original HSE files, with one exception (New-wt) which is a new weighting variable. Users may be interested in the Guide to using SPSS for Windows available from Online statistical guides and which explores this dataset. The original HSE 2002 dataset is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 4912. Main Topics : The HSE, 2002 : Teaching Dataset includes 60 variables, and only the 9, 281 cases from the general population sample; the boost sample cases of young people aged 0 - 24 and mothers of children aged under one year are excluded. Most of the variables contained within the dataset are individual ones, and require individual based analysis. However, {{there are a number of}} household-level variables included such as 'TenureB' and 'Hhsize'. The dataset contains a mix of discrete and continuous variables and all, apart from the weighting variable 'New_wt', are taken directly from the HSE 2002 dataset deposited at UKDA. The variable names on the Teaching Dataset correspond directly to those on the 2002 HSE dataset. Topics covered include demographic characteristics, illness and general health, recent periods of sickness, medication used, contraception, smoking, alcohol use, consumption of fruit and vegetables, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 12) score, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio and blood pressure measurement. Standard Measures The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 12), which has 12 items, is used widely to screen for <b>psycho-social</b> <b>disorders.</b> It asks questions about general level of happiness, depression, anxiety and self-confidence. A score of four or more has been used to identify potential psychological disorder. <br...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{emergency}} regarding recent immigration waves into Italy makes continued {{healthcare monitoring}} of these populations necessary. METHODS: Through {{a survey of}} hospital admissions carried out during {{the last five years}} at the S. Orsola-Malpighi General Hospital of Bologna (Italy), all causes of admission of these subjects were evaluated, together with their correlates. Subsequently, we focused on admissions due to infectious diseases. All available data regarding foreign citizens admitted as inpatients or in Day-Hospital settings of our teaching hospital from January 1, 1999, to March 31, 2004, were assessed. Diagnosis-related group (DRG) features, and single discharge diagnoses, were also evaluated, and a further assessment of infectious diseases was subsequently made. RESULTS: Within a comprehensive pool of 339, 051 hospitalized patients, foreign citizen discharges numbered 7, 312 (2. 15 %), including 2, 542 males (34. 8 %) and 4, 769 females (65. 2 %). Males had a mean age of 36. 8 ± 14. 7 years, while females were aged 30. 8 ± 12. 2 years. In the assessment of the areas of origin, 34. 6 % of hospitalizations were attributed to patients coming from Eastern Europe, 15. 3 % from Northern Africa, 7. 3 % (comprehensively) from Western Europe and United States, 6. 9 % from the Indian subcontinent, 5. 9 % from sub-Saharan Africa, 5. 7 % from Latin America, 4. 1 % from China, 2. 5 % from the Philippines, and 1. 1 % from the Middle East. Among women, most hospitalizations (58. 8 %) were due to obstetrical-gynecological procedures or diseases, including assistance with delivery (27. 1 %), and pregnancy complications (18. 7 %), followed by psycho-social disturbances (5. 9 %), malignancies (5. 1 %), gastrointestinal diseases (4. 7 %), and voluntary pregnancy interruption (4. 4 %). Among men, the most frequent causes of admissions were related to trauma (15. 9 %), followed by gastroenteric disorders (12 %), heart-vascular diseases (8. 9 %), <b>psycho-social</b> <b>disorders</b> (8. 4 %), respiratory (7. 1 %), kidney (6. 1 %), liver (5. 2 %), and metabolic (4. 9 %) diseases, and alcohol or substance abuse (4. 2 %). Infectious diseases (alone or with concurrent disorders) were reported in 881 discharged individuals, representing 12. 1 % of the 7, 312 DRGs attributed to foreign patients. The comprehensive patient population discharged from our hospital with at least one infectious disease diagnosis had lower rates of respiratory tract infections, followed by chronic viral hepatitis, HIV infection and related diseases, enterocolitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, pyelonephritis, severe skin and soft tissue infection, meningoencephalitis, and malaria, as the most frequently-reported disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey, through a combined analysis of both DRGs and discharge diagnoses, allowed us to conclude that 12. 1 % of foreign citizens hospitalized at our General teaching Hospital of Bologna (Italy) suffered from at least one infectious disease. Respiratory tract, liver, and gastrointestinal infections, and HIV infection, were found with an appreciable frequency among discharge diagnoses, while the frequency of malaria and meningoencephalitis was lower, compared with other series. Among disorders other than infectious diseases, obstetric-gynecological conditions and post-traumatic episodes (for male patients) were the most frequent causes of hospitalization...|$|R

A ausência congênita ou a perda do bulbo ocular na infância acarretam distúrbios estéticos e psico-sociais e comprometem o desenvolvimento normal da região orbitária. A literatura relacionada à etiologia congênita ou adquirida, devido a trauma ou doença, demonstra a necessidade da prevenção e da detecção precoce para minimizar as seqüelas e os distúrbios de crescimento orbital. A reabilitação implica a instalação de uma prótese ocular visando favorecer o desenvolvimento harmonioso da região. Com o objetivo de caracterizar o perfil do paciente infantil foi realizado um levantamento junto ao Setor de Prótese Ocular do Ambulatório da Disciplina de Prótese Bucomaxilofacial da FOUSP abrangendo o período de 1988 a 2003. As 124 (14, 02 %) crianças registradas encontravam-se distribuídas em 64 (51, 62 %) na faixa etária de 0 a 7 anos e 60 (48, 38 %) na de 8 a 13 anos de idade, sendo 59 meninas e 65 meninos. A análise estatística revelou que a variação das ocorrências dos gêneros masculino e feminino nas faixas etárias não é significante (p = 0. 069). Entretanto, a etiologia da perda variou segundo as faixas etárias consideradas, com um nível de significância de 0, 01, apresentando uma maior prevalência de distúrbios congênitos e patológicos na faixa etária mais jovem e trauma na mais velha. A etiologia alterou-se de acordo com os gêneros com uma significância de 0, 05, tendo as meninas apresentado três vezes menos trauma que os meninos na faixa etária mais velha. A necessidade de tratamento protético apresentou-se igualmente distribuída ao longo da infância e as perdas oculares que implicam reabilitação protética ocorreram igualmente nos gêneros masculino e feminino.
