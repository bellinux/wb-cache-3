30|$|Synthesis of {{mesoporous}} materials without stirring is {{a unique}} approach for interacting reagents under stagnant conditions. It was used to produce interesting morphologies of well-defined geometries within the bulk [24] or at oil–water interface [25] of the growth medium. It is worthy here to distinguish between ‘quiescent’ and ‘static’ conditions because literature may refer to them interchangeably although they are fundamentally different. The distinct feature lies in mixing while adding the silica source to the surfactant solution. In quiescent conditions, a silica precursor is added without mixing it to a <b>premixed</b> <b>water</b> phase containing the surfactant, while in static conditions, a silica precursor is mixed well with the water phase before holding the solution static. Therefore, upon aging, the silica species are available homogenously all over the solution in the static growth medium and thus grow in the bulk, while they have to diffuse across an interface in quiescent conditions and grow in the interface and/or the bulk regions. The growth time in both cases is remarkably longer (days) than mixed conditions (minutes to hours), but it is obviously longer under quiescent conditions due to diffusion limitations.|$|E

40|$|We use {{experimental}} mid-infrared optical constants {{and extended}} effective medium approximations {{to determine the}} porosity and the band strengths of multi-phase composite ices grown at 30 K. A set of porous H 2 O:CH 4 ices are taken as a prototypical example. As a benchmark and proof of concept, the stoichiometry of the ice constituents is retreived with good accuracy from the refractive indices and the extinction coefficients of the reference binary ice mixtures with known compositions. Accurate band strengths are then calculated from experimental mid-infrared spectra of complex ices. We notice {{that the presence of}} pores has only a small effect on the overall band strengths, whereas a water dilution can considerably alter them. Different levels of porosity are observed depending on the abundance of methane used as a gas contaminant <b>premixed</b> with <b>water</b> prior to background deposition. The absorption profiles are also found to vary with deposition rate. To explain this, we use Monte Carlo simulations and we observe that the deposition rate strongly affects the pore size distribution as well as the ice morphology through reorganization processes. Extrapolated to genuine interstellar ices, the methodology presented in this paper can be used to evaluate the porosity and to quantify the relative abundances from observational data...|$|R

40|$|The {{alternative}} fuel is attract good attention from worldwide especially for renewable and prevention energy such as biodiesel. Biodiesel {{is one of}} the hydrocarbon fuels and it has potential for external combustion. This research used biodiesel Crude Palm Oil (CPO) as fuels in which have been blend with diesel. Biodiesel Crude Palm Oil base (CPO) is free from sulfur and produced by esterification and trans-esterification reaction of vegetable oil with low molecular weight alcohol, such as ethanol or methanol. Rapid mixing injector uses for external combustion especially open burner system. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to investigate the effects of mixture formation between biodiesel and water on using rapid mixing injector and to analyze the influence of mixture formation on flame propagation and combustion characteristics together with the effect of water content on the gas emissions are analyzed. The disadvantages of CPO are high toxic emissions such as NOX and CO while it can cause the reduction on performance of burner system. However, high toxic emission can be solved by using a new concept injector with fuel-water-air <b>premixing.</b> The additional <b>water</b> in combustion process can be reduced the NOX emissions. The results of this research focuses on the mixture formation of spray, flame and exhaust gas emissions. CPO biodiesel has longer spray length and bigger spray area than diesel, but the spray angle is smaller than diesel. Based on flame image, it shows that the flame color between pure fuels and fuel-water mix fuel is totally difference compare to each other. Water mix with fuel has the brightness color and shorter flame than fuels. The exhausts gaseous tested are CO, CO 2, HC and NOX. In this research, <b>water</b> <b>premix</b> of percentage up to 15 vol% and blending biodiesel ratio was varied from 5 vol% - 15 vol%.

For MTT measurement, a pulsed laser is used to “tag” phosphorescent 1 -BrNp⋅Mβ-CD⋅ROH molecules <b>premixed</b> within a <b>water</b> droplet. Long-lived laser-induced phosphorescence is imaged at two successive times after the same laser excitation pulse. While the size and contact angle of the water droplet can be determined from the acquired phosphorescence images, the temperature measurement is achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the temperature dependence of phosphorescence lifetime, which is estimated from the intensity ratio of the acquired phosphorescence image pair. The feasibility and implementation of the lifetime-based MTT technique were demonstrated by conducting simultaneous measurements of droplet size and spatially-and-temporally resolved temperature distribution within a convectively-cooled water droplet over an aluminum test plate to quantify the unsteady mass and heat transfer processes within the small water droplet to elucidate underlying physics to improve our understanding about micro-physical phenomena associated with aircraft icing studies...|$|R

Biodiesel {{is one of}} the hydrocarbon fuels and it has potential for external combustion. As one of the different solutions to these problems, rapid mixing of biodiesel-water-air technique {{is one of the}} most significant approaches to improve the combustion and reduce the emissions. The gas emission can be reduced by two methods. First is by improving an injector with fractal and the other is by using a biodiesel-water mixture as an {{alternative fuel}}. Mixing of water with fuel in the combustion process is a low cost and effective way. This research used biodiesel Crude Palm Oil (CPO) as fuels in which blended with diesel. This study investigated the effects of water content and equivalence ratio on emissions with the rapid mixing injector.

40|$|A {{soft metal}} with low wear {{resistance}} (6000 series aluminum), {{was used to}} minimize run time while maximizing wear rate. Two paddle configurations were tested, with the first four paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles. The first configuration was all flat paddles, with the first paddle not aligned with the augers and is consistent with present SPF mixer. The second configuration had helical paddles {{for the first three}} stages after the augers and a flat paddle at the fourth stage. The first helical paddle was aligned with the auger flight for the second configuration. The all flat paddle configuration wear rate was approximately double the wear rate of the helical paddles for the first two sets of paddles after the augers. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on the third and fourth paddle sets based on mass change, indicating that the fully wetted premix materials are much less abrasive than the un-wetted or partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles at higher magnification showed the flat paddles were worn much more than the helical and is consistent with the wear rates. Aligning the auger discharge flight with the first set of helical paddles was effective in reducing the wear rate as compared to the flat paddle configuration. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in a slight increase in rheological properties. Although, both tests produced grout-like material that is within the processing rage of the SPF, {{it should be noted that}} cement is not included in the <b>premix</b> and <b>water</b> was used rather than salt solution, which does affect the rheology of the fresh grout. The higher rheological properties from the helical wear test are most likely due to the reduced number of shearing paddles in the mixer. In addition, there is variation in the rheological data for each wear test. This is most likely due to the way that the dry feeds enter the mixer from the dry feeder. The premix is discharged from the hopper in an unsteady fashion, where irregular sized clumps were observed leaving the discharge of the auger, though the auger speed is constant...|$|R

In study 1, the same level of molasses (45 %) and urea (15 %) were used in three treatments of blocks, except for the fourth treatment where molasses and urea were not included, this treatment was regarded as control. Elemental sulphur was added at 0. 5 % level. Dicalcium Phosphate was added at 2 %. Sodium chloride was included in levels of 3 % in all treatments. Cement, which is in the fine powdering form was used as a binder in this trial and it was included at 10 %. The cement was <b>premixed</b> with <b>water</b> in the ratio (w/w) 100 parts of cement to 50 part of water. One type of bran either sorghum, maize or wheat bran was included in each treatment at 17. 5 % for wheat bran,and maize bran while sorghum bran was included at 16. 5 %. Hay was included to improve consistency at 7 % for treatments with wheat and maize bran but for sorghum bran it was included at 8 %. This is because the block with sorghum bran was too soft at 7 % hay inclusion in the preliminary trial of block production. Chemical analyses showed that the blocks contained high dry matter (83. 92 to 95. 23 %) together with crude protein, Ash, NDF, ADF and IVTD. ADL was found to be low (2. 16 to 3. 64) in all the four treatments. Major and trace elements determined were found to be present in the blocks. The mineral tested include Phosphorus, Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, iron, Zinc, Copper and Manganese. An acceptability test was done by giving the blocks to grazing sheep and goats in their kraals. The Tswana sheep and goats consumed the urea-molasses blocks after nimbling at it for the first 24 hours because the blocks were new to the animals. After the first day the sheep and goats fed freely on the blocks until all the blocks finished showing that sheep and goats will consume urea-molasses block if provided to the animals.

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the Saltstone {{variability}} study is to identify (and, quantify the impact of) the operational and compositional variables that control or influence the important processing and performance properties of Saltstone mixes. A performance property for Saltstone mixes that is important but not routinely measured is the liquid permeability or saturated hydraulic conductivity of the cured Saltstone mix. The value for the saturated hydraulic conductivity is an input into the Performance Assessment for the SRS Z-Area vaults. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} a method available that allows for an accurate and reproducible measurement of permeability quickly and inexpensively. One such method that could potentially meet these requirements for the measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity is the technique of beam bending, developed by Professor George Scherer at Princeton University. In order to determine the feasibility of this technique for Saltstone mixes, a summer student, David Feliciano, was hired to work at Princeton under the direction of George Scherer. This report details the results of this study which demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the beam bending method to measurement of permeability of Saltstone samples. This research effort used samples made at Princeton from a Modular Caustic side solvent extraction Unit based simulant (MCU) and <b>premix</b> at a <b>water</b> to <b>premix</b> ratio of 0. 60. The saturated hydraulic conductivities for these mixes were measured by the beam bending technique and the values determined were of the order of 1. 4 to 3. 4 x 10 {sup - 9 } cm/sec. These values of hydraulic conductivity are consistent with independently measured values of this property on similar MCU based mixes by Dixon and Phifer. These values are also consistent with the hydraulic conductivity of a generic Saltstone mix measured by Langton in 1985. The high <b>water</b> to <b>premix</b> ratio used for Saltstone along with the relatively low degree of hydration for MCU based mixes leads to high total and capillary porosities. These two conditions generally lead to higher permeabilities as has been well documented in the literature for typical cementitious pastes in water. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the hydraulic conductivities of these Saltstone mixes are relatively high...|$|R
40|$|Measured {{distribution}} coefficients (K{sub d} values) {{for environmental}} contaminants provide input data for performance assessments (PA) that evaluate {{physical and chemical}} phenomena for release of radionuclides from wasteforms, degradation of engineered components and subsequent transport of radionuclides through environmental media. Research efforts at SRNL to {{study the effects of}} formulation and curing variability on the physiochemical properties of the saltstone wasteform produced at the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF) are ongoing and provide information for the PA and Saltstone Operations. Furthermore, the range and distribution of plutonium K{sub d} values in soils is not known. Knowledge of these parameters is needed to provide guidance for stochastic modeling in the PA. Under the current SRS liquid waste processing system, supernate from F & H Tank Farm tanks is processed to remove actinides and fission products, resulting in a low-curie Decontaminated Salt Solution (DSS). At the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF), DSS is mixed with premix, comprised of blast furnace slag (BFS), Class F fly ash (FA), and portland cement (OPC) to form a grout mixture. The fresh grout is subsequently placed in SDF vaults where it cures through hydration reactions to produce saltstone, a hardened monolithic waste form. Variation in saltstone composition and cure conditions of grout can affect the saltstone's physiochemical properties. Variations in properties may originate from variables in DSS, <b>premix,</b> and <b>water</b> to <b>premix</b> ratio, grout mixing, placing, and curing conditions including time and temperature (Harbour et al. 2007; Harbour et al. 2009). There are no previous studies reported in the literature regarding the range and distribution of K{sub d} values in cementitious materials. Presently, the Savannah River Site (SRS) estimate ranges and distributions of K{sub d} values based on measurements of K{sub d} values made in sandy SRS sediments (Kaplan 2010). The actual cementitious material K{sub d} values and solubility values differ from the sandy sediments. The K{sub d} value range and distribution currently used in the PA are estimated to range between 0. 25 *K{sub d} and 1. 75 *K{sub d}, where the minimum and maximum values of the ranges reflect the 95 % confidence level for the mean K{sub d} value (Kaplan 2010). The objective of the research with cementitious materials was to measure the range and distribution of a monovalent (Cs) and I{sup -} (anion), divalent (Sr), and trivalent (Eu) ions for a variety of laboratory-prepared saltstone surrogate samples to establish a K{sub d} range other than that which is presently used in the PA. It has been observed in laboratory samples that cure temperature profiles can affect properties such as heat of hydration, permeability, porosity, compressive strength, and set time (Harbour et al. 2009). The intent was to identify a range and distribution that could be used by stochastic modelers for the PA. Furthermore, the intent was to replace the arbitrarily selected distributions based on geological sandy sediments and to base it on actual cementitious materials. The scope of this study did not include understanding saltstone sorption mechanisms responsible for increasing or decreasing sorption. Similar to the work with cementitious materials, the purpose of the Pu sediment K{sub d} dataset was not to attempt to understand through statistics how to better understand Pu sorption to sediments or to lower Pu K{sub d} variance. The sediment Pu K{sub d} data is included in this study because it is a key risk driver for the PAs on the SRS, and there is presently no direct studies of Pu variability in SRS soils. Instead the distribution of Pu sediment K{sub d} values was assumed to be similar to other cations, as presented by Kaplan (2010) ...|$|R
40|$|The Saltstone Facility, {{located within}} the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina, {{consists}} of two facility segments: The Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) and the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF). The SPF receives decontaminated legacy low level sodium salt waste solution that is a byproduct of prior nuclear material processing. The salt solution is mixed with cementitious materials to form a grout slurry known as “Saltstone”. The grout is pumped to the SDF where it is placed in a Saltstone Disposal Unit (SDU) to solidify. SDU 6 {{is referred to as}} a “mega vault” and is currently in the design stage. The conceptual design for SDU 6 is a single cell, cylindrical geometry approximately 114. 3 meters in diameter by 13. 1 meter high and is larger than previous cylindrical SDU designs, 45. 7 meters in diameter by 7. 01 meters high (30 million gallons versus 2. 9 million gallons of capacity). Saltstone slurry will be pumped into the new waste disposal unit through roof openings at a projected flow rate of about 34. 1 cubic meters per hour. Nine roof openings are included in the design to discharge material into the SDU with an estimated grout pour radius of 22. 9 to 24. 4 meters and initial drop height of 13. 1 meters. The conceptual design for the new SDU does not include partitions to limit the pour radius of the grout slurry during placement other than introducing material from different pour points. This paper addresses two technical issues associated with the larger diameter of SDU 6; saltstone flow distance in a tank 114. 3 meters in diameter and quality of the grout. A long-radius flow test scaled to match the velocity of an advancing grout front was designed to address these technology gaps. The emphasis of the test was to quantify the flow distance and to collect samples to evaluate cured properties including compressive strength, porosity, density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Two clean cap surrogate mixes (saltstone <b>premix</b> plus <b>water)</b> were designed to simulate slurry with the reference saltstone rheology and a saltstone with extra water from the process flushing operation. Long-radius flow tests were run using approximately 4. 6 cubic meters of each of these mixes. In both tests the pump rate was 0. 063 liters/second (1 gpm). A higher pump rate, 0. 19 liters/second (3 gpm), was used in a third long-radius flow test. The angle of repose of the grout wedges increased as a function of time in all three tests. The final angles of repose were measured at 3. 0 º, 2. 4 º, and 0. 72 º. The pump rate had the largest effect on the radial flow distance and slope of the grout surface. The slope on the pour placed at 0. 19 liters/second (3 gpm) was most representative of the slope on the grout currently being pumped into SDU 2 which is estimated to be 0. 7 º to 0. 9 º. The final grout heights at 1 / 3 of a meter from the discharge point were 115, 105, and 38 cm. Entrapped air (≥ 0. 25 cm bubbles) was also observed in all of the mixes. The entrapped air appeared to be released from the flows within about 3. 1 meters (10 feet) of the discharge point. The bleed water was clear but had a thin layer of floating particulates. The bleed water should be retrievable by a drain water collection system in SDU 6 assuming the system does not get clogged. Layering was observed and was attributed to intervals when the hopper was being cleaned. Heat from the hydration reactions was noticeable to the touch...|$|R
