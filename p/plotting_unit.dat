We create a system called AESOP that exploits a variety of existing resources to identify affect states and applies “projection rules ” to map the affect states onto the characters in a story. We also use corpus-based techniques to generate a new type of affect knowledge base: verbs that impart positive or negative states onto their patients (e. g., being eaten is an undesirable state, but being fed is a desirable state). We harvest these “patient polarity verbs ” from a Web corpus using two techniques: co-occurrence with Evil/Kind Agent patterns, and bootstrapping over conjunctions of verbs.

Em vista do acréscimo de trabalho etc. que essa técnica ocasiona, nota-se tendência para simplificá-la, usando-se. por exemplo, uma só fileira, sem adubo, para separar as áreas úteis adjacentes. Estudando a viabilidade da citada simplificação em dois experimentos de adubação do milho, o autor verificou que as fileiras separadoras produziram tanto mais quanto maiores foram as doses de nitrogênio empregadas nas áreas úteis adjacentes, parecendo, assim, que estas foram desfalcadas de correspondentes quantidades dêsse nutriente. Num outro experimento, também com milho, em que se usou a técnica estabelecida, as produções das bordaduras foram maiores que as das áreas úteis, ao passo que, naquelas, o efeito do nitrogênio foi muito menor do que nestas. Dêsse estudo concluiu o autor que, pelo menos quando se estudar o efeito do nitrogênio, não se deve abandonar a técnica estabelecida.

In another experiment with corn, in which the established technique was used, the yields of the guard rows were larger than those of the effective <b>plot</b> <b>units,</b> whereas the response to nitrogen was much smaller in the former than in the latter.
