40|$|Many food {{ingredients}} are supplied in powdered form, as reducing water content increases shelf life and aids ease of storage, handling <b>and</b> transport. <b>Powder</b> technology is therefore {{of great importance}} to the food industry. The Handbook of food powders explores a variety of processes {{that are involved in}} the production of food powders, the further processing of these <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> their functional properties. Part one introduces processing and handling technologies for food <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> includes chapters on spray, freeze <b>and</b> drum drying, <b>powder</b> mixing in the production of food <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> safety issues around food powder production processes. Part two focusses on powder properties including surface composition, rehydration and techniques to analyse the particle size of food powders. Finally, part three highlights speciality food <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> includes chapters on dairy <b>powders,</b> fruit <b>and</b> vegetable <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> coating foods with powders. The Handbook of food powders is a standard reference for professionals in the food <b>powder</b> production <b>and</b> handling industries, development and quality control professionals in the food industry using <b>powders</b> in foods, <b>and</b> researchers, scientists and academics interested in the field. Explores the processing and handling technologies in the production of food powders. Examines powder properties, including surface composition, shelf life, and techniques used to examine particle size.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To characterise the {{distribution}} of particle size and mass of glove powder aerosol released from <b>powdered</b> <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> free non-sterile latex gloves under controlled conditions.  METHODS—Gravimetric sampling and aerodynamic particle size analysis were performed during simulated use of gloves on a prosthetic hand in a chamber designed to minimise background particle concentrations.  RESULTS—Aerosol was detectable for both <b>powdered</b> <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> free gloves under both aggressive and non-aggressive handling conditions. Most of the particles detected had aerodynamic diameter less than 10  µm.  CONCLUSION—Powder free gloves were not entirely free of powder aerosol. Particles from both <b>powdered</b> <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> free gloves are sufficiently fine to penetrate into the thoracic region of the respiratory tract.    Keywords: latex gloves; glove powder; aeroso...|$|R

5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> acid.

5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E

OTA was detected in low concentrations in Barbera, Moscato and Nebbiolo skins, but only in Barbera and Moscato extracts. Cadaverine, putrescine, ethanolamine and ethylamine were found in extracts at very low levels, while potential allergenic amines, tyramine and histamine, were never detected. Different pesticides were present in both skins and extracts. Pb and Cd were found in trace only in the <b>powders,</b> <b>and</b> K, Ca and Mg were the most abundant elements in both skin <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> extracts. Concentrations of the different contaminants were related to fibre content or total phenolics content of <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> extracts, respectively, in order to evaluate their use in the food sector...|$|R

On discovering the deserted village, the soldiers not only reclaimed the looted merchandise but also took animal pelts and twocanoes. The angry Karankawa attacked, killing twoFrenchmen and injuring others.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with <b>powder,</b> <b>and</b> the left gunner would fetch the powder from {{the magazine and}} be ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E

At the time, it was produced {{in the form of a}} <b>powder,</b> <b>and</b> was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E

The first step for making gunpowder is to <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E
