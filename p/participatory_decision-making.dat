For Stavenhagen (1985), the term “ethno-development” has two major approaches in literature, either being explained as “the economic development of a group ethnic” or being described as “the development of the ethnicity of a social group”. Little (2002) advocates that these two meanings are not self-exclusive; and they have dialectical bonds because “development of ethnicity” without “corresponding economic advances” can only produce a marginal ethnic group (p. 39 – 40).|$|R

AIMS This aim {{of this paper is to}} examine how aquaculture is performing in two regions in the Philippines with regards to a number of specific objectives in economic, social and ecological dimensions. The underlying philosophy is that an appropriate balance between these dimensions is required for the farming system to be sustainable, but that this negotiation has to take place at the local level – the concept of sustainability cannot be imposed from above. The work has three elements: a typology of farming systems constructed using data from a farm-level survey; collection of data for a series of six sustainability indicators; and a <b>participatory</b> multi-criteria <b>decision-making</b> model designed to assess the potential value conflicts underlying aquaculture development. The manner in which these multiple methods combine into an overall research methodology is outlined in the conceptual model in figure 1 below.

However, coral reef ecosystem in South Sulawesi has been pressured by reef-related fishing activities, which include destructive practices of bomb and poison fishing. This study assesses the condition of fishery sustainability in five selected small islands situated in Taka Bonerate Marine National Park and Spermonde Archipelago, South Sulawesi.

40|$|Abstract: Water is a finite, renewable, yet {{in certain}} {{circumstances}} depletable, natural resource with essential value for life. The uneven distribution of water resources, amplified by numerous conflicting water uses, constrains economic development and the wellbeing of humans. The excessive quantity of water {{as a result of}} land use and/or climate change (and thus at least partly accountable to human activities) poses additional threats. To ensure an efficient allocation and protection of water, a holistic (integrated/comprehensive) management based on the principles of the ecosystem approach was endorsed by a broad scientific and policy community. Such management was aimed at promoting pro-active, non-structural and demand-side interventions favouring a more cautious exploitation of resources, but the implementation of the concept may turn into a continuous frustration. Meanwhile, some authors consider IWRM an elusive (and fuzzy), amorphously-defined and evolving political process. In this paper we review the issues behind the lack of its successful implementation. We argue that the IWRM stands for policy-making which relies more than ever on interdisciplinary, pluralistic, inclusive approaches, with scientists participating alongside other stakeholders in deliberative <b>decision-making,</b> <b>participatory</b> assessment, or group model building. In the paper, we present a framework of water governance which facilitates the involvement of different actors in the formalisation of integrated environmental models and assists <b>participatory</b> planning and <b>decision-making</b> about water resources...|$|R

The ongoing review and assessment process {{is one of the}} largest locally based science policy and science consultation initiatives undertaken in the UK. Combining a questionnaire-based survey with in depth case studies has allowed an exploration of the process and the development of better practice guidance for such consultation initiatives. The research suggests that while there are no simple solutions to the dilemma of how best to engage the public in such consultations, there are steps that can be taken to improve consultation. Key factors that facilitate local community participation in such processes include a well-informed and adequately resourced local community and an explicit connection between <b>participatory</b> and <b>decision-making</b> processes. Although the research focused on local air quality management as a case study of consultation mechanisms, the outcomes will be relevant to other locally based environmental management issues...|$|R
40|$|Criteria and {{indicators}} (C&I) {{have become}} primary tools {{in implementing the}} principle of sustainable resource management. To carry out this principle, {{it is necessary to}} develop methodologies that can holistically and systematically generate relevant indicators for a particular forest or resource management unit. This paper describes some methodologies that can be used as tools to carry out structured analysis of C&I. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is used as a decision-making tool to analyze and evaluate multiple C&I under a <b>participatory</b> group <b>decision-making</b> environment. Use of the method enables the generation of C&I, estimation of their relative importance, estimation of the performance of each indicator relative to its desired condition, and assessment of the indicators' combined effect or impact. In addition to generating C&I and estimating their relative importance and performance, the paper also presents a soft methodology, called cognitive mapping, which can be used to assess the cross indicator interaction, linkages, and connectivities of the indicators. The method attempts to evaluate the overall cumulative impacts of all indicators, individually and collectively, as they impact sustainability directly and indirectly through their interactions with other indicators...|$|R
