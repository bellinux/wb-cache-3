Special {{attention has been}} paid to the possibility of twofold increase in timber yield due to the dramatic decrease of intraspecific competition between individual trees.

The phenomenon has been analyzed by means of computer models developed. A Temporal-spatial structure of the forest is formed under the influence of many factors.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTerry GriffinLarge acreage {{farms and}} even {{moderate}} sized farms employing custom applicators and harvesters have multiple {{machines in the}} same field {{at the same time}} conducting the same field operation. As a method to control input costs and minimize application overlap, these machines have been equipped with automatic section control (ASC). For nearly all these multiple-vehicle operations, over application is a concern especially for more irregularly shaped fields; however modern technology including automated guidance combined with automatic section control allow reduced doubling of input application including seeds, fertilizer, and spray. Automatic section control depends on coverage maps stored locally on each vehicle {{to determine whether or not}} to apply input products and up to now, there has not been a clear method to share these maps between vehicles in the same field. Without sharing coverage maps, an individual ASC <b>planting</b> <b>unit</b> only has location data where it has applied individually and no location data for where other planting units have applied seed in that same field. Automatic section control relies upon shared coverage maps to be continually updated between each <b>planting</b> <b>unit</b> and utilizes existing machine telematics infrastructure for map data sharing. Telematics utilizes a cloud computing platform and cellular connectivity which in rural areas is known to have limited service levels. Planting operations were simulated for two 16 -row planters, each using two John Deere GreenStar 3 2630 monitors, simulated GPS location data stream, electronic rate control units, and individual row unit clutches to have control at the finest granularity. Each simulated <b>planting</b> <b>unit</b> is equipped with automatic section control and telematics gateways to share coverage map data from the first <b>planting</b> <b>unit</b> to JDLink cloud infrastructure then out to the second. This study evaluates the impact that field size and shape have on using multiple ASC planters and coverage map sharing, and estimates seed cost savings from reducing over application because coverage maps are shared between planting units. The impact of sharing coverage maps with both planting units using field boundaries with automatic section control and without using field boundaries were evaluated. Guidance line headings were determined using AgLeader SMS’s mission planning feature to minimize the number of passes across each field based on the field boundary and implement width. Each field was run twice using parallel tracking, once each with and without coverage map sharing to observe the extent of over application. The field level data were then taken to examine a fictious 3, 000 acre farming operation where the field level data was used as a partial composition of the farm operation. An embedded Microsoft Excel macro was used to create 8, 008 different composition scenarios to determine farm level savings. The average farm savings was $ 58, 909 per year. Additionally, using the 8, 008 scenarios, time value of money was examined to determine the the minimum area required annually for five years for this technology to pay back. The average was 133 acres each year for five years. Equipment manufacturers and farmers have interest in these results. In general, equipment manufacturers desire to create a service-based product to be sold such that continual revenue path provides value added services after the precision agriculture hardware is sold. In this study, the existing telematics product offerings are tied to shared coverage maps to provide a value-add to an existing service. Farmers want to ensure this is a sound equipment investment with payback in a relatively short time period. As farm input costs continue to rise especially relative to crop prices, reducing over application will be critical to limit waste...|$|E

A study of the rhizome growth of T. testudinum was completed in December 2004 in southern Tampa Bay that determined growth after 26. 5 months. Two PVC planting frames each containing four rhizomes with 2 short shoots, two rhizomes with 4 short shoots, and two rhizomes with 8 short shoots were planted next to existing T. testudinum beds at 5 sites (n = 10 planting frames). The rhizome apical meristem was removed from half of each set of short shoot units on each planting frame. Plants initially lacking a rhizome meristem produced more new long shoot meristems than those planted with an intact meristem, and larger planting units produced more new rhizome meristems than smaller ones, P = 0. 001 and P 3 ̆c 0. 001, respectively. The total number of rhizome meristems per <b>planting</b> <b>unit</b> (new meristems + initial meristem) was greater in plantings initially lacking a long shoot meristem in the 2, 4 and 8 short shoot size classes. Only the two short shoot plants benefited from an intact rhizome meristem at planting time, elongating 66. 4 cm versus 60. 4 cm for plants initially lacking a rhizome meristem at 26. 5 months. In the 4 and 8 short shoot classes, plants that lacked a rhizome meristem at planting outpaced those with a meristem, producing 192. 1 and 277. 9 for 4 and 8 short shoot plants compared to 120. 9 cm and 177. 7 cm for plants with a meristem {{during the same time}} period. The greatest growth rate increases were due to lateral branching on planting units that lacked a rhizome meristem in the two largest size classes (4 and 8 short shoots); the differences between plants with an intact rhizome meristem and those without with the size classes pooled did not prove to be statistically different, P = 0. 112. Differences among the size classes were significant, however, P 3 ̆c 0. 001. Analysis of new short shoots was analogous to the results for rhizome elongation, with the presence of an initial rhizome factor proving insignificant, P = 0. 401, and the initial number of short shoots factor proving significant, P 3 ̆c 0. 001.

40|$|Big Sage (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) {{has proven}} {{difficult}} to re-establish in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming due to drought, plant competition, economics, and other factors. <b>Planting</b> <b>unit</b> design {{that takes into}} consideration the natural reproductive strategy of big sage could have a substantial impact on the economics and success of sage establishment. In general, the reproductive strategy of sage is to produce {{a large amount of}} short-lived seed with highly variable viability over a long life span. Actual establishment of seedlings results from infrequent stochastic events that create favorable conditions for germination and growth. Thus, the concept of direct-seeding sage as a one-time event is contradictory to the reproductive strategy of sage. In addition, studies have been conducted which demonstrate that large edge-to-area ratios result in increased invasion by species into otherwise stable habitats. A re-interpretation of this concept suggests that species with invasive qualities (i. e. – big sage) and high seed production may benefit from long-linear populations and adjacent disturbed habitats. Bitterroot Restoration Inc. proposes a design solution that emulates the natural strategy of sage reproduction. The proposed design solution would utilize the planting of containerized sage into linear “seed production plots ” and adjacent “facilitation beds ” which receive an annual seed rain. The proposed solution is supported by both field data from an existing replicated study in Wyoming and case studies of similar projects on high cost reclamation projects. We hypothesize that this long-term view of shrub establishment based upon species reproductive strategy will result in sage stands capable of achieving bond release...|$|E

40|$|As {{one of the}} {{important}} non-grain energy crops, sweet sorghum has attracted the attention of scientific community and decision makers of the world since decades. But insufficient study has been done about the spatial suitability distribution and ethanol potential of sweet sorghum in China. This paper attempts to probe into the spatial distribution and ethanol potential of sweet sorghum in China by ArcGIS methods. Data used for the analysis include the spatial data of climate, soil, topography and land use, and literatures relevant for sweet sorghum studies. The results show that although sweet sorghum can be planted in the majority of lands in China, the suitable unused lands for large-scale <b>planting</b> (<b>unit</b> area not less than 100 Â hm 2) are only as much as 78. 6 Â xÂ  104 Â hm 2; and the productive potentials of ethanol from these lands are 157. 1 Â xÂ  104 - 294. 6 Â xÂ  104 Â t/year, which can only meet 24. 8 - 46. 4 % of current demand for E 10 (gasoline mixed with 10 % ethanol) in China (assumption of the energy efficiency of E 10 is equivalent to that of pure petroleum). If all the common grain sorghum at present were replaced by sweet sorghum, the average ethanol yield of 244. 0 Â xÂ  104 Â t/year can be added, and thus the productive potentials of sweet sorghum ethanol can satisfy 63. 2 - 84. 9 % of current demand for E 10 of China. In general, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Liaoning rank the highest in productive potentials of sweet sorghum ethanol, followed by Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, and some other provinces. It is suggested that these regions should be regarded as the priority development zones for sweet sorghum ethanol in China. Sweet sorghum Bioethanol Productive potentials Spatial distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} <b>planting</b> <b>unit</b> size and stabilizing sediment was examined for two seagrass planting methods at Carnac Island, Western Australia in 1993. The staple method (sprigs) {{was used to}} transplant Amphibolis griffithii (J. M. Black) den Hartog and the plug method was used to transplant A. griffithii and Posidonia sinuosa Cambridge and Kuo. Transplant size was varied by {{increasing the number of}} rhizomes incorporated into a staple and increasing the diameter of plugs. Planting units were transplanted into bare sand, back into the original donor seagrass bed, or into a meadow of Heterozostera tasmanica, which is an important colonizing species. Sprigs of A. griffithii were extracted from a monospecific meadow; tied into bundles of 1, 2, 5, and 10 rhizomes; and planted into unvegetated areas. Half the units were surrounded by plastic mesh and the remainder were unmeshed. All treatments were lost within 99 days after transplanting, and although larger bundles survived better than smaller ones, no significant differences could be attributed to the effects of mesh or sprig size. Plugs of P. sinuosa and A. griffithii were extracted from monospecific meadows using polyvinyl chloride pipe of three diameters, 5, 10, and 15 cm, and planted into unvegetated areas nearby. Half the units were surrounded by plastic mesh and the remainder were unmeshed. Posidonia sinuosa plugs were also placed within a meadow of H. tasmanica (Martens ex Aschers.) den Hartog. Only 60 % of A. griffithii plug sizes survived 350 days after transplanting back into the donor bed; however, survival of transplants at unvegetated areas varied considerably, and analysis of variance indicated a significant two-way interaction between treatment and plug size. Transplants survived better when meshed (90 % survived) and survival improved with increasing plug size. Posidonia sinuosa transplants survived poorly (no plugs survived beyond 220 days in bare or meshed treatments) regardless of size. Survival of 10 - and 15 -cm plugs was markedly better than the 5 -cm plugs in vegetated areas, including the H. tasmanica meadow. The use of large seagrass plugs may be appropriate for transplantation in high-energy wave environments...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{has been}} carried out on behalf of the Swedish forest {{industries}} through the Forest Cluster. The main focus has been to improve the efficiency of mechanical planting. Theimprovements of the planting process has mainly been carried out by focusing on the reduction of time-consuming manual handling whilst refilling plants into a mechanical <b>planting</b> <b>unit,</b> and also by design of a reliable process. The realization of these improvements hasbeen carried out throughmechanical design of a magazine and associated feeder designed for aHIKO V 93 cassette. The mechanism manages the cassette and providesseedlings for amechanical planting assembly. For practical reasons, an existing planting device developed by Bracke Forest, has been serving as foundation for the development work. In order to achieve the desired result of a detailed design with high technical validity and accuracy for the mechanism, the development of the concept was initiated with aninvestigation of existing solutions and their pros and cons. Additionally, other students contributed with new perspectives by participating in focus groups performed during the creative part of the concept design phase. Solutions for the concept have been based upon resultsobtained duringresearch in the field of mechanized reforestation during the SIRIUS-projects 2010 for the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Empirical tests, which were carried out on the prototype built during the project, yielded important conclusions regarding the weaknesses and strengths of the method developed for the removal of the plant from the cassette. Furthermore, essential visual observations contributed tothe establishment of a sustainable process for the development of mechanized planting in northern conditions. The creative methods resulted in four fundamentally different concepts that matched the demands stipulated in the requirement specification. The winning concept was finally obtained while carrying out an evaluation based on surplus values. Using CAD, a virtual model of the mechanism was constituted and states a good base for the manufacturing of a physical prototype. It can also serve as one or more elements of a future concept for further development and even more cost reductions. The mechanical solutions given in this report are all based on real components and materials, and indicate that the design should also work in reality. Dynamic simulations confirm that the mechanics are correctly dimensioned and perform its intended tasks. Validerat; 20110217 (anonymous...|$|E
