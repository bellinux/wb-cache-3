5|$|Etty {{continued}} to produce paintings ranging from still lifes to formal portraits, and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity, {{until his death}} in 1849.

5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> all.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Émile Bernard {{organised}} a small {{solo show}} of Van Gogh's <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger.
