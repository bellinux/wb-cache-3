5000|$|None of {{the above}} {{streaming}} transports work across all modern browsers without negative side-effects. This forces Comet developers to implement several complex streaming transports, switching between them depending on the browser. Consequently, many Comet applications use long polling, which is easier to implement on the browser side, and works, at minimum, in every browser that supports XHR. As the name suggests, long polling requires the client to poll the server for an event (or set of events). The browser makes an Ajax-style request to the server, which is kept open until the server has new data to send to the browser, which {{is sent to the}} browser in a complete response. The browser initiates a new long <b>polling</b> <b>request</b> in order to obtain subsequent events.Specific technologies for accomplishing long-polling include the following: ...|$|E

The present invention comprises the steps of: initial polling configuration: an AP allocating a polling group ID and a subcarrier ID to a node which is newly added into a network OFDM frequency domain polling: the AP sending a <b>polling</b> <b>request</b> message, and after the node receives the <b>polling</b> <b>request</b> message, the AP responding in a frequency domain using an OFDM subcarrier and TDMA slot allocation and node data transmission: according to the response condition of each polled node, the AP allocating a TDMA slot to a node which needs data transmission and after the node receives the TDMA slot allocation result, conducting the data transmission in a corresponding slot. The present invention is proposed on the premise of fully {{taking into account the}} application characteristics of an industrial wireless network, and can reduce the network protocol overhead, and improve the bandwidth utilization rate and effective network throughput, thereby improving network timeliness and scale...|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{large-scale}} IP Multicast {{applications and}} the availability of broadband multicast enabled networks are two important factors driving the growth of IP Multicast beyond the current base of users on education networks. To accommodate that growth, solutions are required to monitor the number of participating receivers for some specific purposes. However in assuring the service model, we need to solicit information from receivers but could easily trigger a feedback implosion. The available solutions are mostly focused on delaying the feedbacks with some random or static timer, which has the undesired effect of creating significant counting convergence delay. We propose a method to estimate the number of receivers using a pollingbased approach, where the sender sends a <b>polling</b> <b>request</b> consisting of an estimation parameter and randomly selected receivers respond upon receiving it. While previous research focused on finding a good quality estimator, our research focuses on applying a method to adaptively change the estimation parameters in order to avoid possible feedback implosion and achieve estimatio...|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} Ethernet {{data link}} layer is extended by an additional bus scheduling mechanism, which secures that at a time only one node is accessing the network. The schedule is divided into an isochronous phase and an asynchronous phase. During the isochronous phase, time-critical data is transferred, while the asynchronous phase provides bandwidth for the transmission of non time-critical data. The Managing Node (MN) grants access to the physical medium via dedicated <b>poll</b> <b>request</b> messages. As a result, only one single node (CN) {{has access to the}} network at a time, which avoids collisions, present on older Ethernet hubs before switches. The CSMA/CD mechanism of non-switched Ethernet, which caused non-deterministic Ethernet behaviour, is avoided by the Ethernet Powerlink scheduling mechanism.|$|R

30|$|The uplink data {{transmission}} at CFP is {{initiated by the}} grant frame 5 broadcast by AP. The grant frame consists of the IDs of the clients determined by the concurrency algorithm that runs at APs. The clients in the uplink transmit the Data+Req frame. This frame contains the uplink data and, if there are more data in the clients to send, it also contains a request frame. The request frame is for transmission of the new frame in the uplink. However, APs do not entertain the new requests immediately. Instead, APs record the ids of the clients who have sent requests along with their uplink data and then polls them in the next cycle. Upon the reception of the <b>poll</b> <b>request,</b> clients with the new data can transmit to APs. APs decode Data+Req frame sent by clients by using the standard MIMO decoding method.|$|R

30|$|During the CP, a node with packets to {{transmit}} contends for channel access {{with a certain}} probability. QoS differentiation is enforced by allowing packets in HP queues to contend for channel access with higher probability than packets in LP queues. We assume that nodes are transmitting to an AP that can invoke a CFP by issuing a <b>poll</b> <b>request</b> {{to one or more}} nodes. These polled nodes can then transmit without any contention. Users can classify their applications as either HP or LP. Users are expected {{to take advantage of the}} MAC's QoS features by declaring their delay sensitive applications as HP, and delay tolerant applications as LP. The AP needs to decide what fraction of time the system will spend in the contention and CFPs. Our protocol is very similar to 802.11 e's HCF, with the CP corresponding to 802.11 e's random access or EDCA functionality and the CFP corresponding to 802.11 e's polled access or HCCA functionality [18].

50|$|With long <b>polling,</b> {{the client}} <b>requests</b> {{information}} from the server exactly as in normal polling, but with the expectation the server may not respond immediately. If the server has no new information for the client when the poll is received, instead of sending an empty response, the server holds the request open and waits for response information to become available. Once it does have new information, the server immediately sends an HTTP/S response to the client, completing the open HTTP/S Request. Upon receipt of the server response, the client often immediately issues another server request. In this way the usual response latency (the time between when the information first becomes available and the next client request) otherwise associated with polling clients is eliminated.|$|R

Our results demonstrate that random access outperforms <b>polling</b> when the <b>request</b> rate is low. However, its performance degrades significantly when the channel is congested.
