40|$|In industry, and {{particularly}} in the building construction and automotive industries, lap-joint technology for <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> assembly has undergone rapid development. However, the durability problems associated with joints of this type are well known, i. e., premature deterioration of protective coatings (metallic, organic) and accelerated metallic corrosion of the base steel by moisture retention in the joint, crevice corrosion, etc. The authors have been involved in researching lap-joint corrosion testing to know the behaviour of materials in these joints. The <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> materials studied were divided into two groups according to their use in two well-defined industrial sectors: building (55 % Al-Zn and hot-dip galvanised, painted and unpainted) and car manufacturing (electrogalvanised and galvanneal).

40|$|The {{adoption}} of designs involving {{the use of}} lap joints is becoming increasingly common in the building industry. However, <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> assembled by lap joints are prone to suffer durability problems associated {{with this type of}} joint, such as the premature deterioration of protective coatings (metallic, organic) and accelerated metallic corrosion of the base steel by moisture retention in the lap. The literature reveals a lack of knowledge about the corrosion mechanisms and primary factors involved in this issue. The main objective of this work is to study lap-joint corrosion in relation with two zinc-based coatings used in the building industry: 55 %Al-Zn and hot-dip galvanised (HDG), unpainted and painted, and before and after atmospheric exposure or accelerated ageing (salt fog and Prohesion tests). The proposed corrosion mechanisms are based on results obtained by visual observation and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) associated with X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Complementary X-ray diffraction (XRD) has also been used. With the unpainted <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> localised attack of the metallic coating is observed in the lapped area. In the case of the metallic+organic coatings, attack is initiated in the lapped area and advances towards the non-lapped area. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{high-temperature}} {{oxidation kinetics}} of Galvalume-coated <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> and Q 235 <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

40|$|Recently, the {{potential}} of the electromagnetic forming process has been introduced to form the shallow longitudinal reinforcement ribs in the lateral walls of roll formed parts, made of high strength <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> of 340 MPa tensile stress grade [1]. However, it seems that the application may not be easy for high strength <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> because of its high tensile strength and low electric conductivity.

40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on characterization of CO 2 {{laser beam welding}} (LBW) of dual phase (DP) and transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> based on experimental, numerical simulation and statistical modeling approaches. The experimental work aimed to investigate the welding induced-microstructures, hardness, tensile properties and formability limit of laser welding butt joints of DP/DP, TRIP/TRIP and DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> under different welding speeds. The effects of shielding gas types and flow rates on the weldability of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were also studied. The simulation of laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> through welding induced-temperature field, thermal cycles, residual stresses and distortions using Sysweld 2010 software v 12. 0 was the second goal of this research. Also stretch formability (Erichsen test) was simulated in this step using Abaqus/CAE software v 6. 9 - 1. The aim of statistical modeling was to predict and optimize laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> in industry through applying a three-factor-three-level Box-Behnken statistical design with full replication as a design of experiment (DoE) approach to design the experiments, develop mathematical models and optimize the welding operation. This was achieved by controlling selected welding parameters: laser power, welding speed and focus position. The experimental {{results showed that the}} CO 2 LBW is a successfully welding process for butt joining of DP and TRIP <b>steels</b> <b>sheets.</b> The LBW of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> is successfully numerically simulated using the finite element (FE) code SYSWELD when using a 3 D Gaussian distribution heat source model with a conical shape. There are good agreements between the experimental- and FE- results during simulation of stretch formability of DP/TRIP steel weldments when using von Mises yielding model as yielding criterion. Statistically, mathematical models were developed to predict the required responses (mechanical properties, weld bead geometry and unit welding operation cost) of laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> It was found that the welding speed is the most significant parameter during laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

50|$|Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> is carbon <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> {{coated with}} aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal coating composition is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to <b>steel</b> <b>sheet.</b> Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|R
