50|$|When {{the module}} {{includes}} non-volatile memory, on-board backup power is only {{required for a}} short time after the computer's <b>power</b> <b>fails.</b> Therefore, modern NVDIMMs use supercapacitors to store energy.|$|R
25|$|About {{one minute}} after the {{electrical}} <b>power</b> <b>failed,</b> Captain Turner {{gave the order}} to abandon ship. Water had flooded the ship's starboard longitudinal compartments, causing a 15-degree list to starboard.|$|R

50|$|A highly {{fault-tolerant}} {{system might}} continue {{at the same}} level of performance even though one or more components have failed. For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid <b>power</b> <b>fails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>power</b> <b>failed</b> on March 17 {{and full}} {{electric}} service was not restored for eight days. KDKA radio {{was able to}} broadcast without interruption throughout the flood but Pittsburghers were unable to listen {{because they did not}} have electricity to run their radios.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} about {{a modern}} detachable chair {{is that it}} can run on an auxiliary diesel motor instead of an electric motor in a <b>power</b> <b>fail.</b> Most detachables have this option, but it makes the drive louder and the movement speed slower.|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} {{required that the}} closed transition, or overlap time, be less than 100 milliseconds. If either source is not present or not acceptable (such as when normal <b>power</b> <b>fails)</b> the switch must operate in a break-before-make mode (standard open transition operation) to ensure no backfeeding occurs.|$|R

50|$|NVDIMM-N DIMM with {{flash storage}} and {{traditional}} DRAM {{on the same}} module. It presents a volatile memory to the computer like any other DIMM. A typical method of achieving non-volatility is to copy information to the non-volatile memory, invisibly to the computer, even in {{the case that the}} computer's <b>power</b> <b>fails.</b>|$|R
50|$|The motor {{controllers}} {{for large}} electric motors normally incorporate {{a type of}} circuit breaker known as a no-volt release. If the <b>power</b> <b>fails,</b> the circuit breaker opens and the motor will not restart when the power is restored. The circuit breaker must be reset before the motor can be started again.|$|R
5000|$|Maintained luminaires are {{permanently}} illuminated, {{and remain}} illuminated when <b>power</b> <b>fails.</b> They {{are used for}} tasks such as emergency exit lighting.
