40|$|During the 12 months ending May, 1937, 72 rats were {{observed}} that manifested typical symptoms of panmyelophthisis. The disease may start as agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia or <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> <b>anemia,</b> leading progressively, often rapidly, to aleukia hemorrhagica with its typical manifestations (epistaxis, melena, hematuria, purpura). Blood examinations revealed correspondingly low white cell, red cell and platelet counts with very pronounced granulocytopenia (0 to 4 per cent). Bone marrow smears and histological findings {{were consistent with}} the diagnosis of panmyelophthisis. Suprarenal hemorrhage was a frequent postmortem finding. The pathogenesis of this experimental panmyelophthisis and this hemorrhagic diathesis is confined to special nutritional conditions. These diseases have been observed by us in rats kept on a diet deficient in vitamin B 6, containing cane sugar and supplemented with vitamin B 1 and crystalline natural or synthetic lactoflavin. Lack of vitamin B 6, however, is not a necessary condition, since the disease was encountered in the majority of the animals after the specific deficiency disease which became apparent in rats kept on the B 6 free diet was successfully treated with purified B 6 preparations. Even in the untreated animals kept on the B 6 deficient diet acrodynia was, as a rule, in distinct remission before symptoms of panmyelophthisis and hemorrhagic diathesis became manifest. By means of the addition of Peters' eluate to the basal diet, panmyelophthisis could be prevented and, in animals where it was recognized in an early stage, cured. In view of these facts it is suggested that Peters' eluate contains a specific maturation factor for the primary blood-producing tissue, the reticulo-endothelium, a factor which, being different from lactoflavin, vitamin B 6 and probably also from the so called filtrate factor, constitutes another distinct component of the vitamin B 2 group. Bacteriological studies brought forward no conclusive positive evidence for the infectious etiology of the experimental panmyelophthisis in our rats. The possible relation of this new disease in rats to aleukia hemorrhagica and its partial manifestations in man, {{as well as to the}} so called Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, is discussed. Administration of amidopyrine, at least under the conditions chosen, failed to provoke panmyelophthisis in rats kept on the same diet as that given to rats in which the disease spontaneously developed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGood’s syndrome, {{also known}} as thymoma with {{combined}} immunodeficiency, is rare. The immunodeficiency may precede, arise concurrently with or follow the diagnosis of thymoma. In addition to myasthenia gravis and Good’s syndrome, paraneoplastic syndromes associated with thymoma can also be manifested with hematological disorders, such as <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia, aplastic <b>anemia,</b> agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

One proposed pathogenesis of myelodysplasia is autoantibodies that directly reject against hematopoietic cells, but this situation is rare in thymoma. Herein, we report a thymoma patient with unique paraneoplastic syndromes who developed myelodysplasia prior to Good’s syndrome. Early and accurate diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome is important for disease management, especially in patients whose myelodysplastic syndrome is possibly derived from autoimmunity. For thymoma patients with recurrent infections, comprehensive immunologic studies to exclude the possibility of Good’s syndrome and prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin infusion in suitable candidates are warranted...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Persistent anti-donor isoagglutinins after major ABO {{blood group}} {{incompatible}} {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation may cause delayed <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> engraftment and post-transplant <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of pretransplant anti-donor isoagglutinin reduction by in vivo absorption and/or plasmapheresis on the incidence of <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia and the time to <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> engraftment in 153 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with major ABO incompatibility. RESULTS: Twelve patients (8 %) developed <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia, 3 / 98 (3 %) with, and 9 / 55 (16 %) without prior isoagglutinin reduction (p= 0. 009). Red blood cell engraftment was faster in patients with isoagglutinin reduction; in addition, peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, acute graft-versus-host disease, and younger age were associated with faster <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> engraftment in Cox regression analysis. In patients with <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia the mean <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> engraftment occurred after 225 days (p< 0. 001) and {{was associated with a}} simultaneous decrease of anti-donor isoagglutinins.

CONCLUSIONS: Following major ABO incompatible hematopoietic stem <b>cell</b> transplantation, <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia and delayed <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> engraftment depend on the levels of anti-donor isoagglutinins and are efficiently prevented by the pretransplant removal of these isoagglutinins.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia due to anti-epoetin {{antibodies}} is a known {{complication of}} epoetin therapy for anemia due to chronic kidney disease. This disease has not previously been well {{described in the}} setting of therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. While treatment for <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia due to anti-epoetin antibodies is usually with immunosuppressive therapy such as calcineurin inhibition, the safety of this treatment in chronic hepatitis C virus infection is unknown. To date, little has been published on the efficacy of rituximab on <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia due to anti-epoetin antibodies. Case presentation This report describes a 65 -year-old Asian-American woman who developed <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia from high titer neutralizing anti-epoetin antibodies after epoetin-alfa therapy during ribavirin and peg-interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We describe the outcome of her treatment with rituximab. The reticulocyte count increased, and anti-epoetin antibody titer decreased with a loss of neutralizing activity in vitro, leading to a reduction in blood transfusions, and eventual resolution of anemia, without reactivation of hepatitis C virus. Conclusion The diagnosis of <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia from anti-epoetin antibodies should be considered in patients undergoing therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection who develop severe anemia after administration of erythropoietin or darbepoetin. Though it is currently an off-label indication, rituximab is a therapeutic option for patients with <b>pure</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> aplasia due to anti-epoetin antibodies. </p...|$|R

Thymectomy alone was ineffective, but cyclosporin A treatment subsequent to thymecto-my was safe and effective and resulted in the dis-appearance of a Vβ 12 bearing T cell clone in the bone marrow. Additional treatment with erythro-poietin enhanced the effects of cyclosporin A and recovered the patient’s hemoglobin to normal lev-els. The beneficial effect of cyclosporin A may be attributed not to a broad immunomodulatory effect, but to a local effect on a limited T cell sub-set.
