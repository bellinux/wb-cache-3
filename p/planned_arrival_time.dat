In this paper, an adaptive control strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust bus speed and traffic signal timings along the path of a running bus to improve its schedule adherence. The strategy relies on real-time location and speed information of buses provided by cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) and uses key-time nodes calculated by back-stepping of <b>planned</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> to dynamically update signal timing plans to keep the bus running on time.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study in detail the working {{principle}} of AMAN, its components involved, develop a trajectory prediction simulator using BADA 3. 6 and compare the initial flight plan predicted time with that of TP simulator. Due to the increasing traffic demands in major European airports, those airports are implementing it to assist the controllers and decrease their workload. AMAN is used to balance the flow of inbound aircraft and capacity of airport by proving sequence of aircrafts approaching the runway and it also helps controllers in the sequencing and merging process which reduces the workload of the controllers. In this thesis special attention is given to Baltic FAB and in particular study of AMAN and its implementation is done for Vilnius International Airport. The objective of thesis {{is to develop a}} trajectory prediction simulator because all AMAN's are based on prediction of aircrafts <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> and is also {{the most important part of}} the AMAN. In order to develop this simulator software like MATLAB and NEST are used. However all the aircraft performance data for descent phase of aircrafts are obtained using the BADA 3. 6. The <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> calculated by the trajectory prediction simulator is quite similar to that of initial flight <b>plan</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time.</b> Better result in the prediction of <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> is obtained using the trajectory prediction simulator. Nevertheless, we need to take into account that some assumptions were made in the development of the simulator and the results obtained are not hundred percent realistic. On the other hand, it is seen that the traffic growth is getting higher and higher every year in Vilnius International Airport. But, it is operating far below the potential physical capacity of the airport and provided with higher number of flights to and from this airport, it can handle the traffic without any major problems. In long run if the air traffic goes on increasing in the same rate then there will be the need of AMAN implementation in Vilnius Airport to assist controllers and maintain the security level marked by the SESARJU...|$|R

One goal of air traffic control automation is the capability to land an aircraft at a runway within five to ten seconds of the <b>planned</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time.</b> Such precision is difficult to attain because of the uncertainty of estimating winds aloft, which can significantly affect the amount of time an aircraft will take to reach its destination.

40|$|Collision {{avoidance}} is a {{main issue}} in applications employing free-ranging, com-puter-controlled vehicles. In this paper {{we look at}} the regulation of locally crossing traffic. Collisions are typically avoided by changing speed and/or changing route, but – to keep efficiency high – as minimal as possible. If we look at humans going by foot in crowded areas or driving by car in urban traffic, we observe a high degree of flexibility. The challenge is to reach the same flexibility with computer controlled driver systems. Preliminary research on dynamic ways of traffic control [1] has indicated that considerable improvements can be reached in comparison to the more static approach of traditional zone claiming methods, in particular in case of busy traffic. When searching for the best solutions there are many criteria to consider: time de-lay, throughput, total travel time, <b>planned</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time,</b> energy consumption, com-fort, et cetera.

40|$|In cargo logistics, a key {{performance}} measure is transport risk, {{defined as the}} deviation of the actual arrival time from the <b>planned</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time.</b> Neither earliness nor tardiness is desirable for customer and freight forwarders. In this paper, we investigate ways to assess and forecast transport risks using a half-year of air cargo data, provided by a leading forwarder on 1336 routes served by 20 airlines. Interestingly, our preliminary data analysis shows a strong multimodal feature in the transport risks, driven by unobserved events, such as cargo missing flights. To accommodate this feature, we introduce a Bayesian nonparametric model [...] the probit stick-breaking process (PSBP) mixture model [...] for flexible estimation of the conditional (i. e., state-dependent) density function of transport risk. We demonstrate that using simpler methods, such as OLS linear regression, can lead to misleading inferences. Our model provides a tool for the forwarder to offer customized price and service quotes. It can also generate baseline airline performance to enable fair supplier evaluation. Furthermore, the method allows us to separate recurrent risks from disruption risks. This is important, because hedging strategies for these two kinds of risks are often drastically different. Comment: 35 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

Households are routed in a coordinated fashion to allow for ride sharing. The algorithm includes time-dependent optimization of the network based on link delays that vary during the day. The router does not choose the transportation mode but finds the best route given the mode. The router starts by using well-known traffic assignment function BPR+ to estimate link delays {{based on the number of}} trips routed through each link.

40|$|We study {{temporary}} storage of fresh produce in a cross-dock center. In {{order to minimize}} cooling cost, compact storage systems are used. A major disadvantage of these systems is that additional retrieval time is needed, caused by necessary reshuffles due to the improper storage sequence of unit loads. In practice therefore, a dedicated storage policy is used in which every storage lane in the system accommodates only one product. However, this policy does not use the <b>planned</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> information of the outbound trucks. To exploit this information, this study proposes a mathematical model for a shared storage policy that minimizes total retrieval time. The policy allows different products to share the same lane. In order to solve real-sized problems, an effective and efficient heuristic is proposed, based on a greedy construction and an improvement part, which provides near optimal solutions. The gaps between {{the results of the}} heuristic and the lower bound are mostly less than 1 %. The resulting shared storage policy is generally robust against disturbances in arrival or departure times. We compare our shared storage heuristic with dedicated storage to determine which policy performs best under which circumstances. For most practical cases, shared storage appears to outperform dedicated storage, with a shorter response time and better storage lane utilization...|$|E
40|$|Unreliable {{travel time}} is defined {{to mean a}} {{distribution}} of possible commute durations. This dissertation identifies occupational groups and shows how an individual's occupation {{can be expected to}} indicate how that person is going to behave in risky commuting stations. Individual occupations attract a certain personality type. Also, individual occupations require different amounts of team work and pose idiosyncratic supervisory requirements for the employer. These effects create systematic variations among employer imposed work rules concerning employee's time use and employee expectations and reactions to the rules. The outcome is both personality driven and situation specific response to risky commuting situations. A psychological construct [...] locus of control [...] draws a boundary between what an individual believes is influenced by her own actions and what is caused by factors external to her. A person with an internal locus of control is optimistic about her possibilities to influence the outcomes of risky situations, while a person with an external locus of control tends to see the cause of events as random or influenced by some powerful others. Commuters with an external locus of control take fewer planned risks, reserving more slack time between planned arrival and official work start time. If something unanticipated throws them off the habitual path, {{they are less likely to}} go out of their way to maintain the <b>planned</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time.</b> The commuters with more internal locus of control are more willing to take planned risks and are more committed to see that the risk pays off. I use occupational classification developed by John Holland and resource exchange theory of Uriel Foa to establish a partial order from most external to most internal occupational groups. The dissertation also includes models where the commuter trades off different elements of unreliable travel time: expected mean travel time, expected schedule delay early, and expected schedule delay late.

40|$|International audienceTo {{sustain the}} rapidly {{increasing}} air traffic demand, the future {{air traffic management}} system will rely on a concept, called Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO), that will require aircraft to follow an assigned 4 D trajectory (time-constrained trajectory) with high precision. TBO involves separating aircraft via strategic (long-term) trajectory deconfliction rather than the currently-practicing tactical (short-term) conflict resolution. In this context, this chapter presents a strategic trajectory planning approach aiming at minimizing the number of conflicts between aircraft trajectories for a given day. The proposed methodology allocates an alternative departure time, a horizontal flight path, and a flight level to each aircraft at a nation-wide scale. In real-life situations, aircraft may arrive at a given position with some uncertainties on its curvilinear abscissa due to external events. To ensure robustness of the strategic trajectory <b>plan,</b> the aircraft <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> to any given position will be represented here by a probabilistic distribution over its nominal assigned <b>arrival</b> <b>time.</b> The proposed approach optimizes the 4 D trajectory of each aircraft so as to minimize the probability of potential conflicts between trajectories.

The algorithm is implemented and tested with real air traffic data taking into account uncertainty over the French airspace for which a conflict-free and robust 4 D trajectory plan is produced...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present results of the initial stage of a five-year research project between the Norwegian Meat Research Centre, Norwegian meat companies and Molde University College. The main goal of the project is to develop a decision support system for the transport of live animals to a slaughterhouse to reduce transportation costs while maintaining high level of livestock welfare and meat quality, as these are three main factors for the profitability of both farmers and industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a mixed integer programming model that combines vehicle routing and inventory control.

Based on these results, we find some bulk ships that paid no toll under the optimal single step toll scheme to maintain the same <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> at the anchorage {{as they did in}} the original nontoll equilibrium situation. New <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> at the anchorage for other bulk ships that paid the toll are postponed when compared with their original <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> in the nontoll equilibrium situation. ...|$|R
40|$|Currently, bus <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> {{prediction}} {{studies have}} not yielded {{the best results}} under complex road conditions. A bus <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> prediction mechanism based on the similarity of road conditions is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the past trip records of the bus, the historical traffic condition of each road section was estimated. The road condition for each trip records was extracted. In the operational phase, each road section's traffic condition was estimated by gathering bus locations continually. The mechanism predicted bus <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> for the rest bus station by the most similar historical which was searched by the time, distance, and real-time road conditions. The evaluation result using historical data of real bus trips shows that the <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> prediction of the mechanism is accurate-with an absolute percentage error around 5 %.
