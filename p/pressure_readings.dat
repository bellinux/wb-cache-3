5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} <b>pressure</b> <b>readings,</b> {{since there}} were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured {{when it was a}} Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, {{it should be noted that}} this list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|The 1942 Belize {{hurricane}} was {{the only}} known hurricane to strike Belize {{in the month of}} November. The thirteenth observed tropical cyclone, eleventh tropical storm, and fourth hurricane of the 1942 Atlantic hurricane season, this storm was detected in the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November5. Initially a tropical storm, it strengthened slowly while moving westward and then south-southwestward across the Bahamas. On November6, the storm became a Category1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later that day, it made landfall in Cayo Romano, Camagüey Province, Cuba. Impact in Cuba and the Bahamas was limited to lower barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>readings</b> and strong winds. While crossing Cuba, the system weakened to a tropical storm early on November7, shortly before emerging into the Caribbean Sea. The storm re-strengthened into a hurricane later that day and headed southwestward.|$|E
5|$|Unusual in many aspects, the 1846Havana {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense of its time. Though atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>readings</b> in Cuba reached as low as 916mbar (27.06inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938mbar (27.70inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until 1924, 78years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As {{a result of the}} tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. Sand Key, which completely submerged {{during the course of the}} hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.|$|E

5|$|Operation sorties {{from the}} summer, 1940 to March 1942 were high in number. No. 1405 flight flew 291 sorties from Tiree in Scotland {{covering}} the Atlantic Ocean {{west of the}} Faroe Islands gap. In 1943 long-range Handley Page Halifax and de Havilland Mosquitos became available in increasing numbers. No. 521 Squadron RAF's Mosquitoes joined the 8th Pathfinder Group as flight 1409 in March 1943. Halifax of No. 518 Squadron RAF started to conduct deep operations into the central Atlantic from Tiree on 15 September 1943. Readings on these operations were taken every 50nm. Sea level <b>pressure</b> <b>readings</b> were taken every 100nm. The usual flight patterns involved a climb to 18,000 feet on the return leg. It was flown 500nm, then a slow descent to sea level followed by a return to base at 1,500 feet. Other flights were made from covering the Atlantic, Bay of Biscay, North Sea and Western Mediterranean Sea. Coastal Command covered 91 percent of the Allied MET flights between November 1943 and June 1944. Sorties over the Atlantic on 4 June 1944 contributed to the decision to launch Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944. No. 518 Squadron alone flew on 363 {{days of the year}} in 1944 in support of MET operations.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} Swan Islands, Janet made {{landfall}} on the Yucatán Peninsula between Corozal Town, British Honduras, and Chetumal, Mexico, at 1700UTC on September28. At the time, it had winds of 175mph (280km/h). Hurricane force winds were reported {{for two hours}} preceding the hurricane's landfall, with numerous <b>pressure</b> <b>readings</b> below 948mbar (hPa; 28.00inHg). Roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to Janet. In Xcalak, Quintana Roo, the strong winds from Janet flattened the port's infrastructure, and only one house remained intact after the storm's passage. 97people were killed in Xcalak, constituting {{more than a third}} of the port's population. Chetumal, Mexico was devastated, with only four buildings left standing. Storm surge pushed water to a depth of 6.5feet (2m), 1600ft (490m) inland, despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean. The death toll in Chetumal remains uncertain; 120bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found. An additional 10,000people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane, and were forced to sleep in the open overnight. Federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the Gulf Coast of Mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. In Quintana Roo, Hurricane Janet was estimated to have caused $40million in damages and at least 500deaths, the most of any region affected by Janet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>readings</b> from John's peak are not {{consistently}} available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data {{obtained}} from modified cone penetrometer experiments {{were used to}} estimate the hysteretic soil hydraulic properties with a parameter estimation technique which combined a numerical solution of the Richards equation with Marquardt-Levenberg optimization. The modified cone penetrometer was designed to inject water into a soil through a cylindrical screen, measure the infiltration rate with time, and track {{the movement of the}} wetting front using two tensiometer rings positioned above the screen. After reaching relatively stable tensiometer readings during the experiments, the source of water was cut off and <b>pressure</b> head <b>readings</b> measured while water in the soil profile redistributed. Cumulative inflow and <b>pressure</b> head <b>readings</b> for two experiments with different supply pressures were analyzed to obtain estimates of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions. Analysis of flow responses obtained during the infiltration period, and of those obtained during the combined infiltration and redistribution phases, demonstrated the importance of hysteresis of the soil hydraulic functions. We found that the redistribution phase could not be described accurately when hysteresis was neglected. Hysteresis in the soil hydraulic functions was modeled using a relatively simple empirical model in which wetting scanning curves are scaled from the main wetting curve and drying scanning curves are scaled from the main drying curve. This model was deemed adequate for our examples. Optimization results for various combinations of unknown soil hydraulic parameters were compared to results of standard laboratory and in situ methods. Estimates of the saturated hydraulic conductivity were well within the range of in situ measurements. The estimated main hysteretic loops of the soil water retention curve were for the most part situated between the wetting and drying curves obtained with standard methods. 1...|$|R

Additionally, Andersen Air Force Base recorded a peak wind gust of 381km/h (236mph), {{which at the time}} was considered the highest wind speed on record, surpassing the 1934 world record of 372km/h (231mph) on Mount Washington in New Hampshire.
