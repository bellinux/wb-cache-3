50|$|When the Jesuits {{moved out}} in 1768, the Franciscans {{took over the}} parishes that the former had created save for Guiuan and Balangiga which were briefly {{administered}} by Augustinians. The major problems that they faced were largely the same: <b>population</b> <b>dispersion,</b> Muslim raids and cholera epidemics. They founded the parishes of Lanang (1851), Balangiga (1854), Sudao (1862), Oras (1863), Libas (1863), Nag-as (1864), Paric (1878), and Quinapondan (1894). These parishes, together with those founded by the Jesuits, all twelve of them, constituted the Vicariate of the Eastern Coast of Samar, under the Diocese of Cebu. In terms of orthodoxy, however, they found a big challenge in the influential but heretical teachings of Don Gaspar de Guerrero. It may be remarked that during this period, some Samareño priests already held parishes as pastors. However, the Spanish-American War in 1899 shook the Franciscan ministry and the local Church on Samar as a whole, what with the anticlericalism and Aglipayanism of Gen Vicente Lukban who had presented himself as Aguinaldo’s appointed Governor of Samar. In fact, the Spanish friars resigned from their posts. But at the same time, many people, including a number of Filipino priests, suffered from American ill-treatment. Bucolic life was disrupted; hundreds of Samareños were killed. Though Lukban was captured in 1902, peace never reigned; in the fierce war of the Philippine scouts with the local freedom-fighters, the Pulajanes, the latter practically controlled the island until 1905, leaving much suffering in its wake. As a consequence, there was dearth of priests, between 1899 to 1905, to {{serve the needs of}} Samareños.|$|E

Insect dispersion, however, is dynamic {{in space and}} time and largely dependent upon interactions among insect, plant and environmental factors. This study investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of corn rootworm dispersion at different spatial scales by using the global positioning system, the geographic information system, and geoStatistics and Probability; Egg dispersion pattern was random or uniform in 8 -ha cornfields, but could be aggregated at a smaller scale. Larval dispersion pattern was aggregated regardless of spatial scales used in this study. Soil moisture positively affected corn rootworm egg and larval dispersions. Adult dispersion tended to be aggregated during peak population period and random or uniform early and late in the season and corn plant phenology was a major factor to determine dispersion patterns. The dispersion pattern of root injury by corn rootworm larval feeding was aggregated and the degree of aggregation increased as the root injury increased within the range of root injury observed in microscale study. Between-year relationships in dispersion among eggs, larvae, adult, and environment provided a strategy that could predict potential root damage the subsequent year. The best prediction map for the subsequent year 2 ̆ 7 s potential root damage was the dispersion maps of adults during population peaked in the cornfield.

The principle and some statistical methods of pooling data have been discussed by Bancroft [1], Kitagawa [1], [2], Bennet [1], Asano [1] and various authors and developed mainly in case when the observations were obtained from the univariate populations. Recently Asano and the author of this paper [1] dealt the inference of a mean vector and a dispersion matrix on the basis of pooling data in the bivariate case. And in their Introduction it has been noted that the inference of a mean vector may be also expressed by the similar formulae and properties in the general $ k $-dimensional multivariate case.

Nevertheless, {{the degree of}} aggregation within a population is an “instantaneous” characteristic {{with the potential to}} identify populations presently at greatest risk of genetic impoverishment (via Allee effects and in-breeding depression) and local decline. We sought to determine the relative extinction risk for sympatric orchid species throughout Monte Barro natural park (Lecco, Italy), based on an index of dispersion (I) calculated from the size and location of ubpopulations (recorded with GPS and mapped with GIS). Three <b>population</b> <b>dispersion</b> types were identified: (1) highly aggregated and locally abundant (large subpopulations restricted to particular sites; e. g., Gymnadenia conopsea [L. ] R. Br.; I = 54. 5); (2) widespread and moderately aggregated (opportunistic throughout the elevational range of the mountain; e. g., Listera ovata [L. ] R.

Type 1 populations are more likely to respond to in situ intervention, whereas type 2 are relatively invasive species for which conservation intervention is not necessary, and type 3 are rare species that are least likely to respond to habitat management, for which ex situ conservation and population reinforcement would be most appropriate.

40|$|The {{multiplier}} e¤ect {{of total}} factor productivity on aggregate output in the one-sector neoclassical growth model is well known, {{but what about the}} e¤ects of regional productivity levels on the aggregate output as well as other national and regional variables? This paper studies the impact of productivity changes in the goods sector and the transportation sector in a general equilibrium trade model where agents in each location produce di¤erent varieties of a common set of goods. Wages are assumed to be equalized in nominal terms across locations, with di¤erences in purchasing power (due to trade costs) o¤set by agentspreferences for particular locations in the initial steady-state. Instead of assuming iceberg costs, a transportation sector is modeled to allow an e ¢ cient distribution of workers across the production and transportation sectors. The state level data from the U. S. support the model, and the comparative statics exercises have several implications on the national and state-level variables of the U. S. economy. It is shown that if the national production technology level (i. e., the production technology level in each region) is doubled, the national output increases by 5 times, the price dispersion across regions increases by 20 %, the <b>population</b> <b>dispersion</b> across regions decreases by 1 %, and the ratio of production labor force to transportation labor force increases by 10 times.

The results of our empirical analysis, which we conducted among a sample of very small municipalities, indicate that small towns that cooperate incur lower costs for their waste collection service. Cooperation also raises collection frequency and improves the quality of the service in small towns. By contrast, the form of production, whether it is public or private, does not result in systematic differences in costs. Interestingly, the degree of <b>population</b> <b>dispersion</b> has a significant positive relation with service costs. No evidence of scale economies is found because, it would seem, small municipalities exploit them by means of intermunicipal cooperation.
