50|$|The flight {{hardware}} unit, the FOEP, was a pressure-tight canister {{containing a}} water-filled centrifuge {{that housed the}} two frogs. The centrifuge was a cylindrical structure that rotated the frogs' heads at scheduled intervals. The FOEP also contained a life support system which could maintain a regulated environment for the frogs. This system consisted of two closed loops, one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The interface between the two loops was a selectively permeable silicone rubber that acted as an artificial lung. Oxygen passed through the membrane from the gas to the liquid side, and carbon dioxide from the liquid to the gas side. The frogs were immersed in the liquid loop. A pump circulated oxygen through the gas-containing loop. Carbon dioxide entering the gas loop was removed by an absorbent and the <b>purified</b> <b>oxygen</b> returned to the pump for recirculation. A water evaporator and an electric heater maintained the water temperature at about 60 °F (15 °C).

5000|$|Bioreactor {{design is}} a {{relatively}} complex engineering task, which is studied in the discipline of biochemical engineering. Under optimum conditions, the microorganisms or cells are able to perform their desired function with limited production of impurities. The environmental conditions inside the bioreactor, such as temperature, nutrient concentrations, pH, and dissolved gases (especially oxygen for aerobic fermentations) affect the growth and productivity of the organisms. The temperature of the fermentation medium is maintained by a cooling jacket, coils, or both. Particularly exothermic fermentations may {{require the use of}} external heat exchangers. Nutrients may be continuously added to the fermenter, as in a fed-batch system, or may be charged into the reactor at the beginning of fermentation. The pH of the medium is measured and adjusted with small amounts of acid or base, depending upon the fermentation. For aerobic (and some anaerobic) fermentations, reactant gases (especially oxygen) must be added to the fermentation. Since oxygen is relatively insoluble in water (the basis of nearly all fermentation media), air (or <b>purified</b> <b>oxygen)</b> must be added continuously. The action of the rising bubbles helps mix the fermentation medium and also [...] "strips" [...] out waste gases, such as carbon dioxide. In practice, bioreactors are often pressurized; this increases the solubility of oxygen in water. In an aerobic process, optimal oxygen transfer is sometimes the rate limiting step. Oxygen is poorly soluble in water—even less in warm fermentation broths—and is relatively scarce in air (20.95%). Oxygen transfer is usually helped by agitation, which is also needed to mix nutrients and to keep the fermentation homogeneous. Gas dispersing agitators are used to break up air bubbles and circulate them throughout the vessel.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1996 Diatoms are an ecologically {{important}} {{group of}} algae in both marine and freshwater systems, {{but in spite}} of their significance {{little is known about the}} structure of their photosynthetic apparatus. This is due in part to the lack of a highly <b>purified,</b> <b>oxygen</b> evolving thylakoid membrane preparation. Since thylakoid membranes purified from diatoms using methods developed for green plants did not evolve oxygen, a new procedure was developed for use with diatoms. An oxygen-evolving thylakoid membrane preparation is crucial for the study of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes from these algae because the stability of the Photosystem I (PS I) and Photosystem II reaction centers was shown to be greatly reduced in thylakoid preparations that did not retain electron transport activity. As a result of the instability of PS I in some thylakoid preparations, a novel chlorophyll-binding complex was isolated that contained only the PsaA polypeptide. The isolation of this complex should prove useful in elucidating the structure of the PS I reaction center in all plants. Immunological and N-terminal protein sequencing methods were used to identify several photosynthetic proteins in the purified thylakoid preparation. These results provided evidence for posttranslational modification of two light-harvesting polypeptides (LHCPs) as well as of the PsaB subunit of the PS I reaction center core. Posttranslational modification of LHCPs and/or of PsaB has not been observed in green plants. In contrast to green plants, PS I in diatoms has been shown to be located in the inner thylakoid membranes. It was hypothesized that proteolytic processing of the C-terminus of PsaB in diatoms may be necessary for the PS I holocomplex to be present in the inner membranes, and that this processing may be responsible for the instability of PS I in purified diatom thylakoids. The existence of a functional, highly purified, and extensively characterized thylakoid preparation from diatoms will promote our understanding of the photosynthetic apparatus in these algae...|$|E

The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} ABA and JA-Me {{application to the}} growth medium of pea seedlings on PSII light reactions was assessed by monitoring of Hill reaction activity, fluorescence induction, kinetic behaviour of oxygen evolving PSII centres and polypeptide analysis of thylakoids and <b>purified</b> PSII <b>oxygen</b> evolving complexes (PSII OEC). Results show the significant inhibitory effect of the two endogenous plant growth regulators on PSII activity and some specific alterations in the structural organization of chloroplast membranes. Restoration of Hill reaction activity with DPC led {{to the conclusion that}} the used phytohormones have a direct effect on the PSII donor side and oxygen evolving enzyme complex itself. In addition, ABA and JA-Me treatment led to an increase in the number of PSII β centres situated in stroma lamellae regions, which are functioning by the cooperative mechanism for O 2 production.

The inner electrode was made ofstainless steel covered with the dielectric glass and the outer electrode was also made of stainless steel. The electric spacing gap was 0. 0075 m and length of ozonizer was 0. 21 m. Oxygen gas passing through thedischarge gap between two electrodes supplied by an alternating current (AC) high voltage power supply, frequency 50 Hz, ranging of 6 - 10 kVAC was used for producing ozone. The amount of ozone was determinedby the KI standard method. The result showed that the concentration of ozone is proportional to the AC applied voltage. For determining effect of <b>purified</b> <b>oxygen</b> feed rate of 6 - 10 L/min on quantity of ozone, theresults indicated that at the volumetric flow rate of 8 L/min produced the largest amount of ozone. In addition, ozone concentration at a flow rate of 8 L/min and an electrical discharge time of 3 minutes wasapproximately determined as 41, 60, 80 and 135 mg/L at 8, 9, 10 and 11 kVAC, respectively. Moreover, study of dye wastewater of Krajud mat was proposed and treated by three different methods. Firstly, dye wastewater was solely treated by a plasma ozonation. Secondly, a combination ofozonation and alum coagulation was used for dye wastewater treatment. Finally, the combined ozonation and activated carbon adsorption were used for dye wastewater treatment. The experimental results showedthat the percentage of light absorbance reduction of pink dyed wastewater for these three different methods was about 56 %, 35 % and 10 %, respectively compared to the reference sample.

In conclusion, the most effective method for dye wastewater treatment was the combination of ozonation and adsorption by activated carbon. For chemical compound analysis, the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrograph illustrated that the treated dye solutions using ozonization were slightly different compared to the reference sample.

40|$|Abstract This thesis aims to {{increase}} our knowledge about the characteristics of chemical pulp process and wastewaters and how problematic substances, e. g. wood extractives, could be removed effectively and selectively by coagulation–flocculation with either internal or external water treatment. Characterization was performed by investigating kraft pulp bleaching filtrates, as well as wastewater, before (influent) and after (effluent) the activated sludge treatment {{by means of a}} range of chemical analyses and by carrying out size fractionation studies. Cationic polyelectrolytes were used to <b>purify</b> <b>oxygen</b> stage bleaching filtrate, and charge analyses (zeta potential, charge quantity) were carried out {{in order to understand the}} coagulation phenomenon. In activated sludge treatment, the enhancement of particle removal, either by filtration or using a chemical in the primary clarifier, would lead to savings in aeration costs and result in a more stable process. Microfiltration already with a large pore size (8 µm) removed 30 – 50 % of the wood extractives from the influent. Separate treatment stages for certain wastewater fractions, e. g. debarking plant effluent, would ensure cost-efficiency. After the activated sludge process, the wood extractives were present as particles (18 %) and <  3  kDa fraction (82 %). β-sitosterol occurred only in particles in the effluent. The release of harmful components into the environment could be decreased by microfiltration (e. g. 0. 45 µm) of the final effluent or using a chemical in the secondary clarifier. Interestingly a huge increase in BOD was realized in the 3 kDa fraction of both influent and effluent, which indicated the presence of toxic substances in the larger fractions. After passing the effluent into the water system, there might be a similar jump in the BOD because the effluent is diluted many-fold. This would contribute to the formation of areas with an oxygen deficit. In the coagulation–flocculation studies, effective and selective removal of wood extractives (92 %) from the oxygen stage filtrate was obtained with a cationic polyelectrolyte of medium molecular weight and medium charge density at 72  °C and pH 5 – 6. The multimodal zeta potential distribution gave more information than the average zeta potential. Aggregation of colloidal particles occurred when only one zeta potential was observed.

Accordingly, Octopus vulgaris Hemocyanin catalyses the o-diphenol oxidation to o-quinone at a very low rate. The crystallographic structure of one of the functional units (called Odg) of O. dofleini Hemocyanin shows two domains, a mainly alpha-helical domain that directly binds the copper ions of the reaction center and a beta-strand domain that precludes access to the active site to ligands bigger than molecular oxygen.

40|$|The {{oxygenation}} {{of human}} Hb (HbA) demands a three state model: two deoxy states To and Tx, free and complexed with anions respectively, and an oxy R state.

The aim of this work is the study of arginines 92 a (a 1 ß 2 interface) and 141 a (C-terminal) as chloride binding sites. To investigate that, we have studied 92 and 141 site directed mutant species: natural mutants Hb J-Cape-Town (R 92 Q), desArg (R 141 Δ), Chesapeake (R 92 L), and the constructed Chesapeake desArg (R 92 L, 141 Δ). We expressed Hbs in Escherichia coli and <b>purified.</b> Through <b>oxygen</b> binding curves we measured affinity and cooperativity, in function of water effect and Bohr effect in presence and absence of chloride. Structural features were obtained through 1 H NMR spectroscopy Oxygen binding properties and Bohr effect measured indicated a higher affinity and lower cooperativity in absence and presence of chloride for all mutants. Structural changes represent functional aspects of mutant Hbs, such as a significant rise in affinity or a change in cooperativity. Water activity studies conducted as a function of chloride concentration showed that the only Hb desArg follows the thre state model. The other mutant Hbs do not exhibit the Tx state, a fact confirmed by the number of water molecules bound to each Hb during the deoxy-oxy transition. This behavior suggests that the Arginine 92 site could be responsible for chloride binding to Hb, since oxygenation of 92 mutant Hbs cannot be adjusted by the three state model. However, Bohr effect showed that all mutant Hbs released~ 1 proton in chloride presence, different from HbA that releases ~ 2, suggesting a role for 141 arginine in the tertiary and quaternary Bohr effect...|$|R

Crack tip damage is ascribed to hydrogen embrittlement because of the following: (1) accelerated da/dN due to part-per-million levels of H 2 O without condensation; (2) impeded molecular flow model predictions of the measured water vapor pressure dependence of da/dN as affected by mean crack opening; (3) {{the lack of an}} effect of film-forming O 2; (4) the likelihood for crack tip hydrogen production in NaCl, and (5) the environmental and delta K-process zone volume dependencies of the microscopic cracking modes. For NaCl, growth rates decrease with decreasing loading frequency, with the addition of passivating Li 2 CO 3, and upon cathodic polarization. These variables increase crack surface film stability to reduce hydrogen entry efficiency. The hydrogen environmental FCP resistance of 2090 is similar to other 2000 series alloys and is better than 7075...|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} energy is increasing. At the same time, energy rich wastewaters are currently <b>purified</b> by <b>oxygen</b> supply, which {{costs a lot}} of energy. The Microbial Fuel Cell is a new technology that offers advantages in both directions: it produces electricity while purifying wastewaters. This research aimed at increasing the electricity production from wastewaters in the Microbial Fuel Cell. In a Microbial Fuel Cell, microorganisms grow on an electrode, the anode. These microorganisms convert biodegradable organic components in wastewater directly into electrons (electricity). The most important limiting factor is currently the cathode, where the electrons are accepted, normally by oxygen. Oxygen is the most desired electron acceptor because of its unlimited availability and its high potential. To drive the oxygen reduction reaction at the desired rate however, a catalyst is needed. The mostly used catalyst for oxygen reduction is Pt, however, its high cost requires development of other cost-effective and renewable catalysts. We followed three strategies to improve cathode performance: the use of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + as a mediator at the cathode, a biocathode, in which microorganisms were used to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction, and the reduction of Cu 2 + in the presence and absence of oxygen. This last process resulted not only in higher current production, but also in recovery of pure copper. Finally, we have tested a Microbial Fuel Cell on larger scale, with a surface area of 0. 5 m 2 and a volume of 5 L. Contrary to other studies, we have shown that a larger-scale Microbial Fuel Cell can produce similar power and current densities compared to small lab scale systems, when the distances between the electrodes are small, the electrodes are well flowed-through, and the reaction rate at the cathode is fast. Finally, we {{show that there is}} still a factor 10 improvement in power possible, as the estimated maximum power density that can be achieved in Microbial Fuel Cells is 17. 3 W/m 2 or 3, 460 W/m 3. Compared with anaerobic digestion, this is almost 3 times as much power at a similar loading rate of 25 kg COD/m 3 /d. At this estimated maximum performance, the energy efficiency in a Microbial Fuel Cell will be 63 %, whereas the energy efficiency in anaerobic digestion is 30 %. For reaching this estimated power density, further studies should focus on the cathode as it is still the main limiting factor, leading to largest part of the energy losses in the MFC...|$|R
40|$|In Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking, {{scrap metal}} is melted by using {{electric}} arc and oxy-fuel burner inside the furnace. After that the molten metal is <b>purified</b> by blowing <b>oxygen</b> supersonically into the molten metal {{which in turn}} results in splashing of liquids melt {{on the wall of}} the furnace. The splashed metal droplets cause wear of furnace wall and loss of production. Optimization of the operating condition (lance angle, lance height and flow rate) may allow less splashing and increase productivity. In the present study, air was injected on water surface in a small-scale model at different lance angles, lance heights and flow rates. Splashed liquid in the forward direction was collected and measured in each case. The forward splashing rate was found to increase with the increase of lance angle from the vertical and flow rate. But the splashing rate is not a monotonous function of lance height. Splashing rate increases with lance height up to a critical distance and after that splashing rate decreases with the increase of lance height. The shape of the cavity was carefully observed by using a video camera and it was found that the splashing was minimum when the cavity was operating in penetrating regime. The critical depth of penetration of water at different lance angle was measured at constant lance height. The critical depth of penetration was found to decrease with the lance angle. A correlation was obtained to determine the critical depth of penetration at different lance angles. Using the values of critical depth of penetration at different lance angle, the Blowing number equation can be corrected to calculate the blowing number at different lance angles. The present study shows that the Blowing number on liquid surface increases with jet angle...|$|R
40|$|The Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{research}} at NASA. CELSS is a plant-based bioregenerative life support system for long term manned space flights where resupply is costly or impractical. The plants in a CELSS will function to convert the carbon dioxide (exhaled by the crew) into <b>oxygen,</b> <b>purify</b> non-potable water into potable quality water, and provide food for the crew. Prior to implementing a CELSS life support system, one must have knowledge on growing plants in a closed chamber under low gravity. This information will come from research to be conducted on the CELSS Test Facility that will operate on the Space Station Freedom. Currently a ground-based CELSS Test Facility is being built at NASA Ames Research Center. It is called the EDU (Engineering Development Unit). This system will allow researchers to identify issues that may cause difficulties {{in the development of the}} CELSS Test Facility and aid in the development of new needed technologies. The EDU consists of a 1 m 2 crop growth chamber that is surrounded by a containment enclosure. The containment enclosure isolates the system so there is very little mass and thermal exchange with the ambient. The leakage rate is on the order of 1 % of the enclosure's volume per day (with 0. 2 S psi pressure difference). The thermal leakage is less than 0. 5 % of the electrical power supplied to the system per degree Celsius difference from the surrounding. The pressure in the containment enclosure is regulated at 62. 5 Pa below the ambient by an active controller. The goal is to maintain this set point for a variety of conditions, such as a range of operating temperatures, heat load variations that occur when the lights are turned on and off, and fluctuations in ambient pressure. In addition certain transition tracking performance is required. This paper illustrates the application of some advanced systems control methods to the task of synthesizing the EDU's pressure control system...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen reductase {{members of}} the heme-copper {{oxidoreductase}} superfamily are redox-driven proton pumps which couple the free energy liberated from the reduction of O 2 to the translocation of protons across the membrane. The A-family requires two proton input channels (D- and K-channels) to transfer protons used for oxygen reduction chemistry and proton pumping, with the D-channel transporting all pumped protons. We use comparative genomics, site-directed mutagenesis, and redox kinetics {{to demonstrate that the}} B-family of oxygen reductases utilize only one proton input channel, structurally analogous to the K-channel, for the delivery of protons for both chemistry and pumping. Since all of the oxygen reductase families are evolutionary related and perform the same chemistry for oxygen reduction, we propose that they must also share an evolutionary conserved mechanism for proton pumping. Comparative analysis between all oxygen reductase families identifies the A-propionate of the active-site heme as the most likely proton loading and the kinetic gating site. According to the crystal structure of ba 3 oxidase in T. thermophilus, two highly conserved residues, D 372 and H 376 which are located at the interface of subunit I and II of complex, form ion pairs with the A-propionate of active-site heme a 3. A set of mutations of D 372 and H 376 are made and examined in this work. Interestingly, mutations of D 372 I and D 372 A still remain ~ 50 % and 15 % electron transfer activity respectively, but abolished proton translocation. Furthermore, the reduced minus oxidized FTIR difference spectra of the D 372 I also show significant changes in the protonated heme propionate signals. These results suggest that the H-bonding network A-propionate heme a 3 -D 372 might {{play an important role in}} proton translocation. Heme c binding proteins have been well identified in Vibrio cholerae. Of these, two predicted c-type cytochromes, diheme c 4 (encoded from gene cycA) and monoheme c 5 (encodes from gene cycB), have high conservative amino acid residues in all of the Vibrio strains and are significant homologues in other known bacteria. Both of them are predicted to transfer electrons on the respiratory chain in V. cholerae. In the current work, cytochromes c 4 and c 5 have been cloned and expressed heterologously in E. coli. It is shown that reduced cytochrome c 4 is a substrate for the <b>purified</b> cbb 3 <b>oxygen</b> reductase and can support steady state oxygen reductase activity of at least 300 e- 1 /s. In contrast, reduced cytochrome c 5 is not a substrate for the cbb 3 oxygen reductase. Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine that the midpoint potentials of the two hemes in cytochrome c 4 are 240 mV and 340 mV (vs SHE), similar to the electrochemical properties of other c 4 -type cytochromes. The majority of cytochrome c 4 ???s are found in ??- and ??- proteobacteria. Genomic analysis shows a strong correlation between the presence of a c 4 -type cytochrome and a cbb 3 oxygen reductase within the ??- and ??- proteobacterial clades, supporting our proposal that cytochrome c 4 is the likely natural electron donor to the cbb 3 oxygen reductases within these organisms. These would include the ??- proteobacteria Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonnorhoeae, in which the cbb 3 oxygen reductases are the only terminal oxidases in their respiratory chains, and the ??- proteobacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri...|$|R
