Forced air cooling using a low <b>power</b> <b>fan</b> and use of a thermo siphon heat pipe are the modifications proposed {{for the purpose of}} efficiency enhancement.

40|$|A single-aisle {{commercial}} transport concept with a turboelectric {{propulsion system}} architecture was developed assuming {{entry into service}} in 2035 and compared to a similar technology conventional configuration. The turboelectric architecture consisted of two underwing turbofans with generators extracting power from the fan shaft and sending it to a rear fuselage, axisymmetric, boundary layer ingesting fan. Results indicate that the turbo- electric concept has an economic mission fuel burn reduction of 7 %, and a design mission fuel burn reduction of 12 % compared to the conventional configuration. An exploration of the design space was performed to better understand how the turboelectric architecture changes the design space, and system sensitivities were run to determine the sensitivity of thrust specific fuel consumption at top of climb and propulsion system weight to the motor <b>power,</b> <b>fan</b> pressure ratio, and electrical transmission efficiency of the aft boundary layer ingesting fan...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} 8 -GeV proton driver (PD) linac at FNAL {{includes a}} front end up to {approx} 420 MeV operating at 325 MHz {{and a high}} energy section at 1300 MHz. A normal conducting RFQ and short CH type resonators are being developed for the initial acceleration of the H-minus or proton beam up to 10 MeV. From 10 MeV to {approx} 420 MeV, the voltage gain is provided by superconducting (SC) spoke-loaded cavities. In the high-energy section, the acceleration will be provided by the International Linear Collider (ILC) -style SC elliptical cell cavities.

40|$|Background: Simple, {{reproducible}} assays {{are needed}} for the quantification of sphingolipids, ceramide (Cer), and sphingoid bases. We developed an HPLC method for simultaneous quantification of total plasma concentrations of Cer, glucosylceramide (GlcCer), and ceramide trihexoside (CTH). Methods: After addition of sphinganine as internal calibrator, we extracted lipids from 50 �L plasma. We deacylated Cer and glycosphingolipids by use of microwave-assisted hydrolysis in methanolic NaOH, followed by derivatization of the liberated amino-group with o-phthaldialdehyde. We separated the derivatized sphingoid bases and lysoglycosphingolipids by HPLC on a C 18 reversed-phase column with a methanol/water mobile phase (88 : 12, vol/vol) and quantified them by use of a fluorescence detector at � ex 340 nm and � em 435 nm.

Intra- and interassay CVs were < 4 % and < 14 %, respectively, and recovery rates were 87 %– 113 %.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{creating}} soft computing tools for machine diagnosing systems. There are some problems with interpretating measured data in the-se systems. To overcome the problems with a big number of information in a diagnosing system, a neural pre-processor was proposed. A neural network {{can be used for}} reducing the size of analysed features. The fault detection and isolation is dicult due to context and broaden relations between me-asured data and a machine state. Soft computing methods are helpful in solving such problems. Articial neural networks and fuzzy logic systems were used in these studies. An approximation of the unknown diagnostic re-lations symptom-state was done by both created tools. The only information about these relations were hidden in measured data that illustrate an expert knowledge formulated in a natural language. Such a form of information is the basis of constructing neural networks and fuzzy systems adequatly. The case study was fault detection of a high <b>power</b> <b>fan.</b> The working correctness of soft computing tools, presented in this work, was examined in the context of results obtained by utilisation of pattern recognition methods.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} server model {{that can be}} applied to {{simulating}} the annual cooling energy consumption of data centers and an analysis of its impact. Recently, aisle containment architecture and the variable air volume system have been widely adopted in the data center industry because of their superior indoor thermal management and cooling energy savings. However, the current simulation method, which fixes the server heat generation and the supply and return air temperature difference of the computer room air handler (CRAH), does not correctly reflect current cooling systems. In this study, a server model was developed that accounts for server thermal characteristics - including server <b>power,</b> <b>fan</b> airflow, and exhaust temperature - according to the given CPU utilization and temperature. After the proposed server model was validated, the annual cooling energy consumption was simulated for modular data centers with an air-side economizer and high ambient temperature. Unlike the conventional method, the proposed model showed that the cooling energy consumption increased when the CRAH supply air temperature was higher than 19 C because of the increase in fan energy consumption.

40|$|The World Health Organisation {{estimates}} that over 20 % {{of the global}} population (~ 1. 4 billion people) lack access to electricity. Furthermore, 40 % of the global population (~ 2. 7 billion people) rely on the traditional use of biomass for cooking (WHO 2011, OEDC/IEA, 2010). This study details the development of aprototype electrical generator for portable stoves commonly in use in the developing world. This generator is capable of delivering small amounts of off-grid electricity. Power is generated using the thermoelectric effect. A single thermoelectric module is utilised to convert asmall portion of heat from the stove to electricity. The electricity produced is used to charge a single 3. 3 V lithium?iron phosphate battery and drive a low <b>power</b> <b>fan,</b> {{as well as some}} other auxiliary features. The airflow produced by the fan is used in conjunction with a commercially available heat pipe heat sink to maintain an adequate temperature difference across the thermoelectric module. From experiments in the laboratory, a maximum TEG power output of 5. 9 W has been obtained. On average, 3 W h of energy was stored in a battery during a typical 1 h long burn. Three 1 h long burns produced sufficient energy to fully charge the battery. The performance of the electricity generating cooking stove has subsequently been tested in Malawi using locally sourced fuel and fire stoking methods...|$|E
