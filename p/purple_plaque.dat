In contrast to RICH, NICH does not involute and rarely ulcerates. It persists into late childhood {{and can even}} mimic a vascular malformation by growing commensurately with the child. Although NICH can resemble RICH in its external appearance, it can be differentiated from RICH by a greater elevation and coarse telangiectases. It mainly affects {{the head and neck}} region (43%), but also the limbs (38%) and the trunk (19%).|$|E
40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric {{vascular}} neoplasm {{associated with}} the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). KS can occur in immunocompromised patients as well as certain populations in Africa or in the Mediterranean. Less than 5 % of KS cases can present with lymphangioma-like kaposi sarcoma (LLKS), which can occur in all KS variants. KS presents with characteristic skin lesions that appear as brown, red, blue, or <b>purple</b> <b>plaques</b> and nodules. The lesions are initially flat and if untreated will become raised. LLKS presents similarly to KS but is associated with severe lymphedema and soft tissue swelling as well as bulla-like vascular lesions.

40|$|An {{elderly man}} {{with a history of}} {{hypertension}} andatrial flutter was referred to an internal medicine out-patient clinic because of purple-tinged and painful toes for over a year. His medications were candesartan, ler-canidipine and warfarin. One and a half years earlier he had been given warfarin for paroxysmal atrial flutter. After six months on warfarin, the patient had been examined for the same symptoms in his toes by a vascular surgeon. At that time, computed tomography (CT) of the aorta, Doppler ultrasonog-raphy of the arteries of the legs and ankle pressure measure-ments had been performed, but no substantial abnormalities had been found. Only slightly elevated serum creatinine levels of 130 – 140 (normal 60 – 100) µmol/L had been observed. At his visit to the outpatient clinic, the patient reported that the pain in his toes occurred with walking or putting socks on. On examination, his toes were <b>purple</b> with <b>plaques</b> (Figure 1) and tender on palpation. Distal pulses were present. No dis...|$|R

It {{is characterized by the}} presence of microcysts and macrocysts and is lined by amorphous eosinophilic material with a crenelated arabesque appearance. These findings have been associated with lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, erythema nodosum, trauma, etc. We report a case of a 43 -yearold woman who had a red to <b>purple</b> asymptomatic indurated <b>plaque,</b> approximately seven cm in diameter and on the left arm. She was a chronic hepatitis B antigen carrier and had hypertension for four years. Histopathology of the biopsied lesion showed transepidermal elimination of altered collagen and elastic fibers, as well as membranous lipodystrophy changes. There were hypertensive vascular changes including lymphohistiocytic infiltration around the vascular wall, swelling of endothelial cells, increased thickness of the vascular walls, and narrowing of the lumen. We report a case showing transepidermal elimination with membranous lipodystrophy. We carefully suggest that the secondary phenomenon of transepidermal elimination was associated with membranous lipodystrophy and degenerate connective tissues...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Eosinophilic panniculitis is {{an unusual}} type of panniculitis {{characterized}} by a prominent infiltration of subcutaneous fat with eosinophils without an exact etiopathogenesis. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, up to now eosinophilic panniculitis has been described in only one previous case with human immunodeficiency virus disease in the literature. Case presentation Here we report the case of a 44 -year-old Caucasian man, who is human immunodeficiency virus positive, diagnosed with eosinophilic panniculitis. A dermatological examination revealed multiple, confluent Kaposi’s sarcoma-like <b>purple</b> colored, deep <b>plaques</b> and nodules on his right gluteal area and right thigh. The presence of the mixed inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and numerous eosinophils involving both septa and lobules of the subcutis were noted on the histopathological examination. On the basis of all these clinical and histopathological findings the patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic panniculitis. He was given intravenous 60 mg/day methylprednisolone for 3 consecutive days a week for 6 months. The lesions resolved almost completely after 6 months. Conclusion The predominance of T helper- 2 subset of T helper cells and the consequential increase in interleukin- 5 cytokines accompanying peripheral eosinophilia and high serum immunoglobulin E levels may all be blamed for the development of eosinophilic panniculitis in our case study. As a result, we aim to emphasize that eosinophilic panniculitis should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous nodular lesions in patients who are human immunodeficiency virus positive. We also focus on the requirement of histopathological examination for the definitive diagnosis because the clinical features of eosinophilic panniculitis may easily be confused with Kaposi’s sarcoma. </p...|$|R
