40|$|The {{oxidation}} of <b>pyrazolidinedione</b> 1 with manganese(III) acetate in {{the presence}} of 1, 1 -diaryl- 1, 3 -butadienes 2 a-d did not give cyclization product but 4, 4 -bis(2 -acetoxy- 3 -butenyl) pyrazolidines 3 a-d as a diastereomixture. Using other cyclic 1, 3 -dicarbonyl compounds, dimedone (4), quinolinone 6, and triketone 8, resulted in the production of the cyclization products 5 a-d, 7 a-d, and 9 a in good yields. A similar reaction of 1, 3 -cyclopentanedione afforded dialkylated cyclopentanedione 11 a together {{with a small amount of}} bicyclic compound 12 a...|$|E
40|$|The X-ray crystal {{structures}} of 4 -butyl- 1, 2 -diphenylpyrazolidine- 3, 5 -dione (phenylbutazone) (I). and its 2 : 1 complex (II) with piperazine have been determined by direct methods and the structures refined to R 0. 096 (2 300 observed reflections measured by diffractometer) and 0. 074 (2 494 observed reflections visuallyestimated). Crystals are monoclinic, space group P 21 /c; for (I) a= 21. 695 (4), b= 5. 823 (2), c= 27. 881 (4) Å, = 108. 06 (10) °, Z= 8, and for (II) a= 8. 048 (4), b= 15. 081 (4), c= 15. 583 (7) Å, = 95. 9 (3) °, Z= 2. The two crystallographically independant molecules {{in the structure}} of (I) are similar except for the conformation of the butyl group, which is disordered in one of the molecules. In the <b>pyrazolidinedione</b> group, the two C–C bonds are single and the two C–O bonds double. The two nitrogen atoms in the five-membered ring are pyramidal with the attached phenyl groups lying on the opposite sides of the mean plane of the ring. The phenylbutazone molecule in (II) exists as a negative ion owing to deprotonation of C- 4. C- 4 is therefore trigonal and the orientation of the Bu group with respect to the <b>pyrazolidinedione</b> group is considerably different from that in (I); there is also considerable electron delocalization along the C–O and C–C bonds. These changes in geometry and electronic structure may relate to biological activity. The doubly charged cationic piperazine molecule exists in the chair form with the nitrogen atoms at the apices. The crystal structure of (II) is stabilized by ionic interactions and N–H O hydrogen bonds...|$|E
40|$|FT-IR and FT-Raman {{spectra of}} 1, 2 -diphenyl- 4 -n-Butyl- 3, 5 -pyrazolidinedione (Phenylbutazone) were {{recorded}} and analyzed. The vibrational wavenumbers were computed using HF/ 6 - 31 G(d) and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) basis sets and compared with experimental data. The first hyperpolarizability, infrared intensities and Raman activities are also reported. The geometrical {{parameters of the}} title compound obtained from theoretical calculations are in agreement with that of reported similar derivatives. The first hyperpolarizability is comparable with reported values of similar derivatives and is an attractive molecule for future applications in non-linear optics. The variation in C-N bond lengths suggests an extended π-electron delocalization over the <b>pyrazolidinedione</b> moiety {{which is responsible for}} the nonlinearity of the molecule...|$|E
40|$|Oxyphenbutazone, C 19 H 20 N 203, a {{metabolite}} {{and perhaps}} the active form of phenylbutazone, is a widely used non-narcotic analgesic and anti-inflammatory <b>pyrazolidinedione</b> derivative. The monohydrate of the compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group Pi with two molecules in a unit cell of dimensions a [...] 9. 491 (4), b = 10. 261 (5), c = 11. 036 (3) A and ¢ = 72. 2 (1), fl = 64. 3 (1), 7 = 73. 0 (1) °. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined to an R value of 0. 107 for 1498 observed reflections. The butyl group in the molecule is disordered. The hydroxyl group occupies two sites with unequal occupancies. On account of the asymmetry at the two N atoms {{and one of the}} C atoms in the central five-membered ring, the molecule can exist in eight isomeric states, of which four are sterically unfavourable. The disorder in the position of the hydroxyl group can be readily explained {{on the basis of the}} existence, with unequal abundances, of all four sterically favourable isomers. The bond lengths and angles in the molecule are similar to those in phenylbutazone. The crystal structure is stabilized by van der Waals interactions, and O-H [...] . O hydrogen bonds involving the carbonyl and the hydroxyl groups as well as a water molecule...|$|E
