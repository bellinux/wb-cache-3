40|$|A new sol-gel {{synthesis}} {{route for}} {{the preparation of}} a transparent photochromic coating based on silver halide crystals is described. Therefore a sodium alumo borosilicate sol synthesized for dip coatings glass surfaces is used. Porous layers of about 2 µm in thickness have been obtained after drying. Silver ions were introduced into the layer by an infiltration process with an aqueous silver nitrate solution, forming small silver colloids that can be converted into silver chloride particles by HCl vapour. The so prepared coatings show a reversible photochromic behaviour. After 15 minutes of UV illumination transmittance decreases from about 86 % to 36 %. The darkend coatings recover completely after thermal bleaching at about 400 °C. The reversible formation of silver colloids after UV irradiation could be followed directly by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy.

40|$|A sol-gel derived <b>photochromic</b> <b>glass</b> {{coating of}} about 1. 5 µm in {{thickness}} is synthesized by infiltration of Ag+ into a predried Na-Al-B-Si gel layer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop an optical method of leak detection. Various modifications of schlieren optics were explored with initial emphasis on leak detection of the plumbing within the orbital maneuvering system of the space shuttle (OMS pod). The schlieren scheme envisioned for OMS pod leak detection was that of a high contrast pattern on flexible reflecting material imaged onto a negative of the same pattern. We find that the OMS pod geometry constrains the characteristic length scale of the pattern to the order of 0. 001 inch. Our experiments suggest that optical modulation transfer efficiency will be very low for such patterns, which will limit the sensitivity of the technique. Optical elements which allow a negative of the scene to be reversibly recorded using light from the scene itself were explored for their potential in adaptive single-ended schlieren systems.

Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black.

30|$|Besides gold, platinum, palladium, etc, others {{metallic}} nanoparticles {{have been}} studied {{during the last decade}} such as copper, bismuth, and nickel. Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) have fascinating properties such as the good thermal and electrical conductivity, nonlinear optical properties, and cost much less than the other metals. CuNPs are very well known for their potential application in cooling fluids for electronic systems, conductive inks, switches, or <b>photochromic</b> <b>glasses</b> in optical devices and nonlinear optical materials [146]. In addition, the CuNPs are widely used in electrochemistry as electrode materials. The effect of copper concentration and surfactants on the conductivity and stability of composite polymer-supported copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) were studied by Pham et al., and the nanoparticles with average diameter of 56  nm were synthesized by chemical reduction in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as stabilizer. They have shown that these compounds prevent and protect the copper nanoparticles from the agglomeration and oxidation. The CuNPs were incorporated in PEDOT:PSS in aqueous solution to form conducting composite [147], who could be used for different applications. In situ chemical oxidation polymerization method was used to synthesis copper nanoparticles intercalated polyaniline nanocomposite. This nanocomposite was used to elaborate a sensor, which was applied for gas sensing towards different gases namely NH 3, CO, CO 2, NO, and CH 4 at room temperature. The sensor films exhibited a highly selective response for NH 3 with negligible response towards the other gases. Although the sensor have a drawback related to its sensitivity at high concentration, the saturation of the sensor was observed at concentration exceeding 50  ppm. The large surface area and charge transfer resulting of CuNPs intercalation in PANI matrix were the characteristics allowing the enhancement of the gas response [148]. The same method was used to synthesize nanocomposites of polypyrrole (PPy) containing copper sulfide (CuS). The nanocomposite was characterized by the means of FTIR, scanning electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, confirming the formation of CuS/PPy nanocomposites with porous, granular, and globular surface morphology and crystallinity. Besides, the thermal stability and the conductivity were also studies, indicating a better thermal stability. The dielectric behavior increases the order ness and the packing. Despite dielectric loss arises due to the localized motion of the charge carriers. The conductivity of CuS/PPy nanocomposite increases with the increase in the concentration of CuS. The nanocomposites have a large scientific and technological interest and possible application like sensors [149]. Ternary NiO/CuO/PANI nanocomposites were synthesized by in situ growth of NiO/CuO nanoparticles via electrodeposition and electrochemical oxidation, in a PANI matrix prepared through electrodeposition. Due to the large surface area and good conductivity of NiO/CuO/PANI nanocomposite, a non-enzymatic sensor exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose. The modified electrode displayed higher sensitivity and a lower detection limit of 2.0  μM [150]. MnOx nanoparticles have attracted large attention due to its abundance and relatively environmentally friendly nature [151]. To improve the capacitance property of PEDOT, Yang et al. used manganese dioxide nanoparticles MnO 2 –NPs, to produce a high-performance electrochemical energy storage electrode. The PEDOT/MnO 2 –NPs were prepared by simple thermal treatment and chemical vapor phase polymerization (VPP) methods. Despite the low conductivity and aggregation of MnO 2 –NPs, the control of the loading and distribution of MnO 2 –NPs in PEDOT matrix offer uniform dispersion of nanoparticles into porous PEDOT matrix, which enhance the performance of the composite electrode [39]. The conductive PEDOT:PSS matrix was also used by Ju et al., with tin selenide SnSe nanosheets to achieve high-performance polymer-based thermoelectric devices. The subsequent solvent treatment appears a promising strategy to create the nanocomposites [152]. Other nanocomposites based on Gallium nitride nanoparticles (GaN) and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene)-co-polypyrrole (GaN/PEDOT–PPY) were synthesized using supercritical ammonia method and by chemical oxidative polymerization method. The nanocomposite was used as an electrochemical catalyst for the oxidation of an antihelminthic drug mebendazole using differential pulse voltammetry [153]. Bismuth recognized with a low toxicity and widely used in electroanalytical as environmentally friendly electrode since the first publication of Wang et al., [154]. Bismuth nanoparticles were employed in synthesis of different nanocomposite materials for application in different area example power generation as thermoelectric material [155, 156] and electroanalysis as sensor. Polyaniline–bismuth oxide (PANI–Bi 2 O 3) nanocomposite was used to fabricate a sensor for the detection of pramipexole in pharmaceutical formulation. The prepared electrode has lower charge transfer resistance leading to higher electrocatalytic activity. A highest concentration of PANI–Bi 2 O 3 suspension causing thickness of the hybrid film and increasing concentration of surfactant leads to the increase of hydrophobicity of surfactant micelles that were decreased the performance of the sensor. The LOD and LOQ for the pramipexole detection are 1.10 and 3.35  µg/mL, respectively [157]. Salih et al. have modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) with poly(1, 8 -diaminonaphthalene) and bismuth film for detection of lead. The bi-poly 1, 8 -DAN/CPE was prepared and characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that higher concentration could cause the reduction of active sites on the surface of electrode. The modified electrode was applied for the analysis of lead in water samples using square wave voltammetry in acidic medium [158]. Similarly, Elbasri et al. have fabricated the modified poly(1, 8 -Diaminonaphthalene) by nickel ions particles (NiPs) on carbon paste electrode (CPE) for electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol in alkaline medium for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The obtained composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [159]. Different metallic particles were used to develop a sensor for the electroanalysis of ascorbic acid (AA). Platinum electrode modified with polyterthiophene (P 3 T) and doped with metallic particles (Cu, Co, Ag, Au, and Pd) was fabricated by first the electropolymerization of the monomer and then the incubation of the modified electrode in metallic ions solution to form the composite materials. The good sensitivity was obtained with the P 3 T–Ag film towards the target molecule AA, due to the high electron conductivity and good stability of the silver nanoparticles. The limit of detection was found to be 5.1710 − 10  mol L− 1 using square wave voltammetry (SWV) [160].|$|R

Silver colloid was identified by its well-known absorption band around 580 nm. It was found that at 300 K colloid formation followed a single exponential growth characteristic having a growth time of approximately 7 µs. This growth characteristic was found to be independent of temperature between 300 K and 150 K, but colloid formation ceased rather abruptly between 150 K and 130 K, below which temperature no colloid was detected. These results are consistent with a mechanism of colloid growth suggested by previous molecular orbital calculations [1]. Furthermore they indicate that the Ag+ ions which contribute to colloid formation are mobile surface ions (internal or external surfaces) rather than bulk interstitials...|$|E
