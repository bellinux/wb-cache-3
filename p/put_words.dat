25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{to say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protested {{that he could not}} speak, for he was a child, but God told him not to fear, for he would go wherever God would send him, say whatever God would command him to say, and God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had <b>put</b> <b>words</b> in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
25|$|After {{giving up}} his farm, he removed to Dumfries. It was at this time that, being {{requested}} to write lyrics for The Melodies of Scotland, he responded by contributing over 100 songs. He made major contributions to George Thomson's A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice {{as well as to}} James Johnson's Scots Musical Museum. Arguably his claim to immortality chiefly rests on these volumes, which placed him in the front rank of lyric poets. As a songwriter he provided his own lyrics, sometimes adapted from traditional words. He <b>put</b> <b>words</b> to Scottish folk melodies and airs which he collected, and composed his own arrangements of the music including modifying tunes or recreating melodies on the basis of fragments. In letters he explained that he preferred simplicity, relating songs to spoken language which should be sung in traditional ways. The original instruments would be fiddle and the guitar of the period which was akin to a cittern, but the transcription of songs for piano has resulted in them usually being performed in classical concert or music hall styles.|$|E

500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the published script of Viet Rock, Richard Schechner says, [...] "performance, action, and event are the key terms of our theatre – and these terms are not literary." [...] In the 1950s, Off-off Broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director, and actor. [...] The playwright's job was not just to <b>put</b> <b>words</b> on a page, but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea. [...] By 1967, theaters such as The Living Theatre, La MaMa E.T.C. and The Open Theatre were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space, rather than following a traditional script.|$|E

S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, No Policy, and released it in 1981 on MacKaye's Dischord Records. S.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP. Rollins had enjoyed being the band's frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said, [...] "I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and loved {{to get in the}} dust-ups."

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, [...] "Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and <b>put</b> <b>words</b> in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, so I thought he {{did a very good}} script." [...] Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like [...] "a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing.|$|E
500|$|Sheppard's tale was revived in {{the first}} half of the 19th century. [...] A melodrama, Jack Sheppard, The Housebreaker, or London in 1724, by W. T. Moncrieff was {{published}} in 1825. [...] More successful was William Harrison Ainsworth's third novel, entitled Jack Sheppard, which was originally published in Bentley's Miscellany from January 1839 with illustrations by George Cruikshank, overlapping with the final episodes of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. [...] An archetypal Newgate novel, it generally remains close to the facts of Sheppard's life, but portrays him as a swashbuckling hero. [...] Like Hogarth's prints, the novel pairs the descent of the [...] "idle" [...] apprentice into crime with the rise of a typical melodramatic character, Thames Darrell, a foundling of aristocratic birth who defeats his evil uncle to recover his fortune. [...] Cruikshank's images perfectly complemented Ainsworth's tale—Thackeray wrote that [...] "...Mr Cruickshank really created the tale, and that Mr Ainsworth, as it were, only <b>put</b> <b>words</b> to it." [...] The novel quickly became very popular: it was published in book form later that year, before the serialised version was completed, and even outsold early editions of Oliver Twist. [...] Ainsworth's novel was adapted into a successful play by John Buckstone in October 1839 at the Adelphi Theatre starring (strangely enough) Mary Anne Keeley; indeed, it seems likely that Cruikshank's illustrations were deliberately created in a form that were informed by, and would be easy to repeat as, tableaux on stage. [...] It has been described as the [...] "exemplary climax" [...] of [...] "the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially".|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Ainsworth and Cruikshank continued until Saint James's, the final novel {{that the two}} worked together on. It is possible that it resulted from Ainsworth selling his magazine or that Ainsworth drifted from Cruikshank after not needing an illustrator for some time. Of the {{relationship between}} author and illustrator, the Athenaeum printed a review which claimed that it was [...] "doubtful whether the plates were etched for the book, or the book written to illustrate the plates" [...] but stated such with a negative purpose. This was followed by those like William Makepeace Thackeray that complimented the power of Cruikshank's illustrations on the story: [...] "With regard to the modern romance of 'Jack Sheppard' [...] {{it seems to us}} that Mr. Cruikshank really created the tale, and that Mr. Ainsworth, as it were, only <b>put</b> <b>words</b> to it." ...|$|E

In Freiheit, Most attacked both Goldman and Berkman, implying Berkman's act was designed to arouse sympathy for Frick. Goldman's biographer Alice Wexler suggests that Most's criticisms may {{have been inspired by}} jealousy of Berkman. Goldman was enraged, and demanded that Most prove his insinuations. When he refused to respond, she confronted him at next lecture.

2500|$|As {{with all}} the speeches {{reported}} by Thucydides, the resemblance between Cleon's and Diodotus' speeches as the historian recorded them and the speeches actually given {{has been the subject}} of much debate.

[...] Various historians have either stressed the first clause of this sentence and reached the conclusion that Thucydides <b>put</b> <b>words</b> into his speakers' mouths or emphasized the second clause and concluded that Thucydides' speeches maintain the basic sense of the speeches actually given on the various occasions he describes. [...] Still other scholars take the second approach but conclude that Thucydides strayed from this approach over his writing career; a number of schemes for dating the authorship of the various speeches has also been proposed, without any gaining a preponderance of support.|$|E

Although not remaining in close contact, Paterson and Christina Macpherson both maintained this version of events until their deaths.

[...] Similarly, in the early 1930s on ABC radio Paterson said [...] "The shearers staged a strike and Macpherson's woolshed at Dagworth was burnt down and a man was picked up dead...Miss Macpherson used to play a little Scottish tune on a zither and I <b>put</b> <b>words</b> to it and called it Waltzing Matilda." ...|$|E

According to Bakshi, Crumb was dissatisfied with the film. Among his criticisms, he said that he felt that Skip Hinnant was wrong for the voice of Fritz, and said that Bakshi should have voiced the character instead.

It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively." [...] Crumb also criticized the film's condemnation of the radical left, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song [...] "The End", as [...] "red-neck and fascistic" [...] and stated, [...] "They <b>put</b> <b>words</b> into his mouth that I never would have had him say." ...|$|E
