25|$|Information {{security}} threats come {{in many different}} forms. Some {{of the most common}} threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today {{due to the fact that}} most devices today are mobile. Cell phones are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization′s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company′s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. There are many ways to help <b>protect</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>from</b> some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is user carefulness.|$|E

40|$|Part of series 1 of the CDC Museum set of Infectious disease trading cards, {{featuring}} {{photos and}} information {{about some of the}} infectious diseases that CDC studies. West Nile virus was first found in the United States in New York City in 1999. Since then it has spread throughout the United States. This virus can cause illness and sometimes fatal brain infection in peo 2 ple, horses, birds, and other animals. You get West Nile virus by being bitten by an infected mosquito, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that it can be spread from person to person or from animal to person. If you get infected with West Nile virus, you may have a bad headache, be sick to your stomach, and be very tired. You can reduce your chances of getting infected with West Nile virus by <b>protecting</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>from</b> mosquito bites. To avoid mosquito bites, eliminate sources of standing water like old cans or unused swimming pools from around your home, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, and apply bug repellent on your skin and clothing when you are outdoors and mosquitoes are biting, especially in the evening, at night, and in the early morning...|$|R

40|$|Most crime {{prevention}} practices assume offenders will desist from crime if {{the opportunity to}} offend is made more difficult. In practice, this means more alarms and guards, and higher awareness about <b>protecting</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>from</b> crime. The legal costs of offending have become greater as punishments have become more punitive. A rational choice theory of crime predicts that individuals weigh {{costs and benefits of}} crime to maximize their own self-interest. When the costs outweigh the benefits of crime, the individual will not offend. In spite of this prevention approach, crime continues. Where rational choice explains why offenders desist from crime, self-control explains the individual's ability to engage in that decisionmaking process. Low self-control is characterized by being impulsive, risk-seeking, self-interested, physical, temperamental, and lazy. Singly and combined, these tendencies are more likely to create behavior that neglects future consequences in favor of current satisfaction. Where rational choice and self-control theories are similar is in using opportunity as a gateway for criminal conduct. Both see opportunity as an objective feature of the environment. The current work questions this assumption. Instead, it is hypothesized that perceptions of opportunity are subjective, tending to vary according to a person's level of self-control. An experiment was done with 132 students on computers, where opportunities to earn money in 1. 00 increments were encountered over a five-step process. The maximum payoff was 5. 00. Tasks became more frustrating at each step, though no task would be considered "difficult". Those with low self-control were expected to lack persistence toward the 5. 00 goal, taking the easier, smaller, payoff earlier in the process. At the experimental prompt, subjects were told they could proceed to the 5. 00 payoff, but would have to give back 1. 00 to classmates unable to attend. Those in the control group were told they could continue fo...|$|R
5000|$|The Punany Poets {{works have}} been {{included}} in college curriculum and are the subject of several dissertations, including 'Representin' the forbidden': The Punany Poets, black female sexuality, and HIV and performance by Monroe, Raquel LaMara, PhD, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES 2006; 3244035. [...] "Academics tend to be the only ones who read academic journal articles, thus such venues cannot be relied on to transmit important health information to the masses. Mass marketed public health messages reach large populations, encourage HIV testing, communicate the routes of infection, and explain how to protect oneself from infection; but they do not explore the intimate contexts that aggravate the spread of HIV. It is difficult for a thirty-second PSA to convey the intense contradictory emotions a woman or man, may feel when faced with the decision to use a condom {{in the heat of the}} moment. Likewise, it is unfair to assume that a thirty-minute sitcom with an HIV theme can provide comprehensive education on HIV. Again, the focus tends to be on testing and the routes of infection, which makes it easy for the viewer to tune out if it’s information they have previously heard or read. The Punany Poets, however, perform the intimate contexts. Their work speaks to women who maintain romantic relationships for financial security, in spite of continually contracting sexually transmitted diseases from their partners. Their work explores how childhood sexual abuse can potentially lead to self-destructive behavior like substance abuse. They show how to make condoms a seductive, fun part of the sex act. They address HIV by depicting the various socio-cultural, emotional, physical, and spiritual issues around it. The Punany Poets perform HIV interventions by specifically encouraging women to be proud of and take control of their sexuality, which is different <b>from</b> merely <b>protecting</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>from</b> a man. In the Punany paradigm, women are active agents, while public health messages tend to position them as passive ones," [...] Author Raquel Monroe writes.|$|R
