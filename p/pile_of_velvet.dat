6000|$|In autumn, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} to see flies motionless upon a window-pane, with a sort of magic circle, in white, drawn round them. On microscopic examination, the magic circle is found to consist of innumerable spores, which have been thrown off in all directions by a minute fungus called Empusa muscoe, the spore-forming filaments of which stand out like a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> <b>velvet</b> from the body of the fly. These spore-forming filaments are connected with others which fill the interior of the fly's body like so much fine wool, having eaten away and destroyed the creature's viscera. This is the full-grown condition of the Empusa. If traced back to its earliest stages, in flies which are still active, and to all appearance healthy, it is found to exist in the form of minute corpuscles which float in the blood of the fly. These multiply and lengthen into filaments, at the expense of the fly's substance; and when they have at last killed the patient, they grow out of its body and give off spores. Healthy flies shut up with diseased ones catch this mortal disease, and perish like the others. A most competent observer, M. Cohn, who studied the development of the Empusa very carefully, was utterly unable to discover in what manner the smallest germs of the Empusa got into the fly. The spores could not be made to give rise to such germs by cultivation; nor were such germs discoverable in the air, or in the food of the fly. It looked exceedingly like a case of Abiogenesis, or, at any rate, of Xenogenesis; and it is only quite recently that the real course of events has been made out. It has been ascertained, that when one of the spores falls upon the body of a fly, it begins to germinate, and sends out a process which bores its way through the fly's skin; this, having reached the interior cavities of its body, gives off the minute floating corpuscles which are the earliest stage of the Empusa. The disease is [...] "contagious," [...] because a healthy fly coming in contact with a diseased one, from which the spore-bearing filaments protrude, is pretty sure to carry off a spore or two. It is [...] "infectious" [...] because the spores become scattered about all sorts of matter in the neighbourhood of the slain flies.|$|E

Silkworms are liable to many diseases; and, even before 1853, a peculiar epizootic, frequently accompanied by the appearance of dark spots upon the skin (whence the name of [...] "Pébrine" [...] which it has received), had been noted for its mortality. But in the years following 1853 this malady broke out with such extreme violence, that, in 1858, the silk-crop was reduced to a third of the amount which it had reached in 1853; and, up till within the last year or two, it has never attained half the yield of 1853. This means not only that the great number of people engaged in silk growing are some thirty millions sterling poorer than they might have been; it means not only that high prices have had to be paid for imported silkworm eggs, and that, after investing his money in them, in paying for mulberry-leaves and for attendance, the cultivator has constantly seen his silkworms perish and himself plunged in ruin; but it means that the looms of Lyons have lacked employment, and that, for years, enforced idleness and misery have been the portion of a vast population which, in former days, was industrious and well-to-do.|$|E

The chromatogram of the extract from the dark blue <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> the Persian <b>velvet</b> (acc.no. 09.50. 1107) showed the presence of both carthamin and indigotin suggesting that safflower and indigo dye were used on the dark blue sample.

60|$|I {{found myself}} in a large, lofty room, with a {{magnificent}} carved ceiling, and with a carpet over the floor, so thick and soft that it felt like <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>velvet</b> under my feet. One {{side of the room}} was occupied by a long book-case of some rare inlaid wood that was quite new to me. It was not more than six feet high, and the top was adorned with statuettes in marble, ranged at regular distances one from the other. On the opposite side stood two antique cabinets; and between them, and above them, hung a picture of the Virgin and Child, protected by glass, and bearing Raphael's name on the gilt tablet {{at the bottom of the}} frame. On my right hand and on my left, as I stood inside the door, were chiffoniers and little stands in buhl and marquetterie, loaded with figures in Dresden china, with rare vases, ivory ornaments, and toys and curiosities that sparkled at all points with gold, silver, and precious stones. At the lower end of the room, opposite to me, the windows were concealed and the sunlight was tempered by large blinds of the same pale sea-green colour as the curtains over the door. The light thus produced was deliciously soft, mysterious, and subdued; it fell equally upon all the objects in the room; it helped to intensify the deep silence, and the air of profound seclusion that possessed the place; and it surrounded, with an appropriate halo of repose, the solitary figure of the master of the house, leaning back, listlessly composed, in a large easy-chair, with a reading-easel fastened on one of its arms, and a little table on the other.|$|R

30|$|Carminic acid was {{detected}} {{from the red}} <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> those Persian <b>velvets</b> as the main colorant. Natural dyes whose major colorant is carminic acid {{are known to be}} American cochineal (Dactylopius coccus Costa), Polish cochineal (Porphyrophora polonica Linnaeus), and Armenian cochineal (Porphyrophora hamelii Brandt) and possibly cochineals of other species of Dactylopius and Porphyrophora genus. The composition of colorants in those cochineals is similar [25 - 27]. Therefore, those red piles appeared to be dyed with one of those cochineals. Wouters and Verhecken [25, 26] also found that a minor component, dcII, is generally found more in American cochineal than in Armenian or Polish cochineals, and so a system using the dcII to differentiate yarn samples dyed with those insects was developed. The structure of the dcII was identified as 7 -C-glycoside of flavokermesic acid [28]. Further, Serrano et al. [27] developed the system using multivariate data analysis to differentiate those different species of cochineals. In this paper, the system had not yet been applied to differentiate them, and the species of cochineals used on those red thread samples was not determined. Because the system evaluates minor components, it was considered essential to carefully repeat the test with the experimental conditions used in our lab in order to evaluate the ratio of color composition.|$|R
30|$|Armenian {{cochineal}} {{is currently}} found near Mount Ararat, although {{it appeared to}} have been harvested in other regions of the Caucasus, Turkey and Iran [32] page 648, where the Safavid Empire existed. Armenian cochineal is reported to have been used in textiles found in Syria, Khotan, and Egypt from the 1 st to 5 th centuries [29] pages 73 – 75 : in a caftan of 7 th-century Sassanid Persia and in a hat given by Henry VIII {{in the first half of}} the 16 th century [32] pages 650 – 652. The production center of Polish cochineal appears to have been in Central and Eastern Europe: Germany, Poland, Romania or Ukraine [32] pages 638 – 640. It is reported that textiles dyed with polish cochineal were also found near these regions: France, Belgium, Romania, and Hungary [32] pages 645 – 646, also in Italy [29] pages 67 – 69. It may be possible that Polish cochineal was exported to Persia via Venice in 16 th – 18 th centuries because American cochineal is reported to have been exported via Venice to Persia by the end of the 16 th century [32] pages 630 – 631, 645, indicating presence of a trade route. In terms of the historical record of use of American cochineal in the Middle East, the investigation by Phipps reported that in the 16 th - 18 th centuries, cochineal from America was exported to Spain and from there to the Middle East to supply the Ottoman emperor. It was also exported from America to the Philippines, and then using sea routes, to China, and finally to the Middle East via the Silk Road [33] page 27. Cardon and Böhmer reported that by the end of the 16 th century, cochineal from America was re-exported via Venice to Persia and Central Asia [32] pages 630 – 631, [34]. Thus the dyes used on the red <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> those <b>velvets</b> could be cochineal from either America or from the Old World.|$|R
