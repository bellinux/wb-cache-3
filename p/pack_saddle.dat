25|$|While at Tel el Marakeb, Captain Herrick, New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, who was {{in charge}} of Hotchkiss gun training, {{redesigned}} the <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> for these guns so that one could be carried on the centre of the saddle instead of to one side. The brigade farriers reworked the pack saddles in the field, to Captain Herrick's design. The brigade was still in reserve at Tel el Marakeb, when on 13 September the brigade held a rifle competition.|$|E

In {{addition}} to Pedersen, Latham, and Coleman, Lieutenant Bill Riley and Sergeant Elmer Lively were also involved with the training and care of Reckless. Pedersen had his wife ship a <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> {{from their home in}} California so Reckless could better fulfill her primary role as a pack animal. The recoilless rifle platoon had its own medical corpsman, Navy Hospitalman First Class George [...] "Doc" [...] Mitchell, who provided the majority of medical care for Reckless.|$|E

2500|$|Corbinian's symbol is the saddled bear. [...] According to his hagiography, a bear killed Corbinian's {{pack horse}} {{on the way}} to Rome and so the saint {{commanded}} it to carry his load. Once he arrived in Rome, however, he let the bear go, and it lumbered back to its native forest. [...] Both the heraldic element and the legend itself carry significant symbolism. One interpretation is that the bear tamed by God's grace is the Bishop of Freising himself and the <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> is the burden of his episcopate. The bear's submission and retreat can also be interpreted as Christianity's [...] "taming" [...] and [...] "domestication" [...] of the ferocity of paganism and, consequentially, the laying of a [...] " [...] for a great civilization in the Duchy of Bavaria." ...|$|E

50|$|A crupper {{is used to}} {{keep the}} {{equipment}} placed on a horse's back from slipping forward. Cruppers are seen most often on horse harnesses. They are also used on the surcingles of bitting rigs, riding <b>saddles,</b> and, occasionally, <b>pack</b> <b>saddles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although a girth {{is often}} enough to keep a well-fitting saddle in place, other pieces of {{equipment}} are also used in jumping or speed sports such as polo, eventing, show jumping, and fox hunting; or on rough terrain such as trail riding.

50|$|The {{expedition}} {{is considered}} to have been privately funded; however, the Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane furnished six <b>pack</b> <b>saddles</b> and gear, one tent of Parramatta cloth, two tarpaulins, a suit of slops {{for each of the}} men, a few bush utensils, a small quantity of arms and ammunition, and two skeleton charts for the tracing of the journey, worth about 50 pounds.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the guide came {{around the corner of the}} house, from the inn yard, leading the horse. He stopped to water the horse at a {{fountain}} in the street, and then led him to the door. In the mean time the porter of the inn had brought down the trunk, and then the guide proceeded to fasten it upon the saddle of the horse, by means of two strong straps. The saddle was what is called a <b>pack</b> <b>saddle,</b> and was made expressly to receive such burdens.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the horse}} grew restless and pricked its ears, stood still snorting, and backed {{away to the}} length of its tether as a face looked out from the undergrowth. The sinking light of the fire was on it, and it was an evil face with the stamp of hunger on it, and malevolence in the staring eyes. Again the horse snorted and trembled as an arm was thrust out of the bushes and {{something}} glinted in the hand, but Alton still lay motionless with the <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> under his shoulders.|$|E

6000|$|We were {{to leave}} town quietly, after midnight, {{in two or three}} small parties, so as not to attract attention, and meet at dawn on the [...] "divide" [...] {{overlooking}} Mono Lake, eight or nine miles distant. We were to make no noise after starting, and not speak above a whisper under any circumstances. It was believed that for once Whiteman's presence was unknown in the town and his expedition unsuspected. Our conclave broke up at nine o'clock, and we set about our preparation diligently and with profound secrecy. At eleven o'clock we saddled our horses, hitched them with their long riatas (or lassos), and then brought out a side of bacon, a sack of beans, a small sack of coffee, some sugar, a hundred pounds of flour in sacks, some tin cups and a coffee pot, frying pan and some few other necessary articles. All these things were [...] "packed" [...] {{on the back of a}} led horse--and whoever has not been taught, by a Spanish adept, to pack an animal, let him never hope to do the thing by natural smartness. That is impossible. Higbie had had some experience, but was not perfect. He put on the <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> (a thing like a saw-buck), piled the property on it and then wound a rope all over and about it and under it, [...] "every which way," [...] taking a hitch in it every now and then, and occasionally surging back on it till the horse's sides sunk in and he gasped for breath--but every time the lashings grew tight in one place they loosened in another. We never did get the load tight all over, but we got it so that it would do, after a fashion, and then we started, in single file, close order, and without a word. It was a dark night. We kept the middle of the road, and proceeded in a slow walk past the rows of cabins, and whenever a miner came to his door I trembled for fear the light would shine on us an excite curiosity. But nothing happened. We began the long winding ascent of the canyon, toward the [...] "divide," [...] and presently the cabins began to grow infrequent, and the intervals between them wider and wider, and then I began to breathe tolerably freely and feel less like a thief and a murderer. I was in the rear, leading the pack horse. As the ascent grew steeper he grew proportionately less satisfied with his cargo, and began to pull back on his riata occasionally and delay progress. My comrades were passing out of sight in the gloom. I was getting anxious. I coaxed and bullied the pack horse till I presently got him into a trot, and then the tin cups and pans strung about his person frightened him and he ran. His riata was wound around the pummel of my saddle, and so, as he went by he dragged me from my horse and the two animals traveled briskly on without me. But I was not alone--the loosened cargo tumbled overboard from the pack horse and fell close to me. It was abreast of almost the last cabin.|$|E

50|$|Goat packing was popularized in the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s by John Mionczynski of Atlantic City, Wyoming.

He designed and built customized <b>pack</b> <b>saddles</b> and saddlebags and, with illustrator Hannah Hinchman, published a book, The Pack Goat, in 1992.|$|R

50|$|A girth, {{sometimes}} called a cinch (Western riding), {{is a piece}} of equipment used to keep the saddle in place on a horse or other animal. It passes under the barrel of the equine, usually attached to the saddle on both sides by two or three leather straps called billets. Girths are used on Australian and English saddles, while western <b>saddles</b> and many <b>pack</b> <b>saddles</b> have a cinch, which is fastened to the saddle by a single wide leather strap on each side, called a latigo.|$|R
