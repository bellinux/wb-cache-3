25|$|The {{degaussing}} circuit {{is often}} built of a thermo-electric (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element {{and a positive}} thermal coefficient (<b>PTC)</b> <b>resistor,</b> connected directly to the switched AC power line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the <b>PTC</b> <b>resistor,</b> increasing its resistance {{to a point where}} degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the <b>PTC</b> <b>resistor</b> to cool to the ambient temperature; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.|$|E
50|$|One {{method is}} to add {{electronic}} components such as: capacitors, snubbers, diodes, Zener diodes, transient voltage suppressors (TVS), resistors, varistors, in-rush current limiters <b>PTC</b> <b>resistors,</b> NTC resistors, voltage-dependent resistors. However, this is the least effective method as these do neither significantly influence the creation nor suppress the arc between the contacts of the electromechanical power switches, relays and contactors.|$|R
40|$|This work reports, for {{the first}} time, a low-frequency (LF) noise study in barium {{titanate}} ceramic <b>resistors.</b> Several <b>PTC</b> <b>resistors</b> with different additives, including Y, Mn, and Nb, were prepared. The temperature dependence of the resistivity and the grain morphology of these samples {{were found to be}} strongly governed by the type of additives. Low-frequency noise measurements at room temperature and above the Curie point were conducted. Experiments show that the LF noise behaviors are governed by grain boundary tunneling at room temperature and by trapping and detrapping of the grain boundary states at temperatures above the Curie point. These observations provide additional information on the current conduction and distribution of grain boundary states in these materials...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} multifunctional LTCC module {{has been}} designed for miniature atomic clock packaging. Efficient packaging and interconnection of the atomic clock packaging is a critical issue and a precise temperature control is required for some components, such as mini-cell and light source. The great advantage of using LTCC technology for this application {{is that it allows}} the integration of different functions, such as heaters and <b>PTCs</b> <b>resistors</b> for temperature measurement and control, and optionally other active elements. In this research, a platform for measuring the thermal conductivity of materials has been developed in order to perform precise thermal studies on the packaging. The relationship between achieved temperature and power dissipated for the heating of the LTCC module has been calculated in different experimental configurations, {{in order to determine the}} effects of conduction and convection on the heating and estimate the thermal losses that they introduce into the system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a DC-link discharge device that is smaller and cheaper than conventional resistor or PTC-based solutions. The basic {{idea is to}} use the switching element (IGBT, Mosfet), that is usually controlling the <b>PTC</b> or <b>resistor,</b> in a linear mode and decrease the maximum power by shifting the discharge curve from an uncontrolled square voltage dependent curve to a roughly constant power characteristic. The advantages in volume and costs are described and the technical setup is explained and compared to the conventional solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of the fault current level is especially critical when additional generation capacity, e. g. distributed generation, is added close to a substation. Hence, in order to mitigate {{the severity of the}} fault currents, the installation of fault current limiter (FCL) devices appears as an attractive alternative. However, the use of FCL devices causes an unavoidable impact on the dynamics of the power system; consequently, the study of the interaction of FCLs with other equipment gains significance. This study examines the interaction between a FCL and the differential protection (DP), in detail, when integrating distributed generation into an already existing MV network. This interaction between FCL devices and DP has not yet been thoroughly studied. In order to carry out this study, initial results are obtained by computer simulation and validated by a real-time simulator connected to two units of differential relays (real-time hardware-in-the-loop experiments). The applied FCL is a hybrid type with <b>PTC</b> <b>resistors</b> as limiting elements. Eight different short circuit cases {{in the presence of a}} FCL are systematically compared to the same eight cases without the presence of the FCL. The results indicate that when a FCL is inserted into the system, there is no need to change the settings of the main protection mode of differential relays, that the trip signal sent to the circuit breakers does not suffer any delay, and that the relative position of the FCL does not influence the performance o...|$|R
40|$|Thick film {{resistors}} {{are prepared}} as pastes, which are screen-printed and fired on dielectric substrates such as alumina and {{widely used in}} hybrid circuits. The final resistor properties are mostly influenced by the firing conditions and the interactions between the elements in the substrate and the resistor. In this study, conductor â€“ <b>resistor</b> (<b>PTC</b> thermistor) pairs of selected compositions of different chemical origin are post fired on low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) and alumina substrates, the latter being considered as the reference. The effects of firing temperatures on main thermistor characteristics such as {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR), standard deviation of TCR and non-linearity are presented and discussed...|$|R
