For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the interpersonal <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> approaches <b>and</b> locus of control levels on a basis of different variables, to determine whether or not there was a significant relationship between interpersonal <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> approaches <b>and</b> locus of control, and to reveal whether or not locus of control and gender significantly predicted the interpersonal <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> approaches. A total of 262 candidate teachers studying at university level constituted the study group of the research. Interpersonal <b>Problem</b> <b>Solving</b> Inventory <b>and</b> Locus of Control Scale were used while collecting research data. In the analysis, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients technique, independent samples t-test technique and Simultaneous Multiple Regression Analysis test technique were applied. As a result of the research, it was found that there was a significant relationship between foreign language teacher candidates’ interpersonal <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> approaches <b>and</b> locus of control, and that the variable of gender differentiated at the lack of self-confidence sub-dimension of interpersonal <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> approaches. Furthermore, it was revealed that locus of control predicted the approaching problems in a negative way. Constructive <b>problem</b> <b>solving,</b> lack of self-confidence, and insistent-persevering approach dimensions of the interpersonal <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> approaches, <b>and</b> the variable of gender, in addition to locus of control, only had an explanatory effect on the lack of self-confidence dimension...|$|R

In the research, for which screening model was used, 190 females and 124 males 314 students in total, still studying in different class levels in Bolu Atatürk High School and Bolu Fine Arts and Sports High School, were included in the workgroup. As data collection tools, ‘Personal Information Form’ <b>and</b> ‘Problem <b>Solving</b> Inventory’ <b>and</b> ‘Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale’ prepared by the researcher was used. The data obtained from the participants were collected and processed into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS- 15) and t-test analysis, one way analysis of anova, pearson correlation analysis were carried out. According to the findings obtained from the research, while a significant difference in students’ <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> abilities <b>and</b> self esteem levels was not found in terms of gender, a significant difference was found in terms of class level. A significant relation in a negative direction was found between <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> abilities <b>and</b> self-esteem levels of those who do not receive art education <b>and</b> between <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> abilities <b>and</b> self-esteem levels of those who receive art education.
