5|$|The show is semi-autobiographical; it was {{inspired}} by the then-recent separation of Moffat and his first wife. Some of the episodes in the first series followed a non-linear <b>parallel</b> <b>structure,</b> contrasting the rise of the relationship with the fall. Other episodes were ensemble farces, predominantly including the couple's friends Robert (Paul Raffield) and Tracy (Tracie Bennett). Paul Mark Elliott also appeared as Trevor, Becky's lover.|$|E
5|$|Now {{functioning}} as a freeway, the QEW was already overburdened by the ever-increasing number of vehicles. The Burlington Bay Skyway, the lone four-lane link on the route between Hamilton and Toronto, was initially designed to handle 50,000 vehicles daily, but by 1973 there were 60,000 vehicles crossing it. Preliminary work on a second <b>parallel</b> <b>structure</b> began a decade later in 1983. In July of that year, Transportation Minister James Snow broke ground for the new bridge. Construction was carried out over two years, and the twinned structure was opened on October11, 1985. It was named the James N. Allan Skyway, in honour of James Allan, Minister of Highways during construction of the original skyway. The new name was not well received by locals, and debate erupted once again whilst the original bridge was closed and repaired for several years. It reopened on August22, 1988, with Toronto-bound traffic crossing the original bridge. The twin structure was renamed the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, though it is {{commonly referred to as}} simply the Burlington Skyway.|$|E

The {{military}} and civilian sectors only meet at the regional level, as the military sector is represented in the Regional Command and sends delegates to regional congresses. The military sector is divided into branches, operating at the battalion level. The head of a military party branch is called a tawjihi (guide).|$|E
50|$|The large conjunct {{approach}} {{in terms of}} movement assumes that the <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> of RNR are full clauses or phrases below the surface. A movement mechanism is responsible for raising the shared material out of both conjuncts to {{a position in the}} hierarchy that is above the level of the <b>parallel</b> <b>structures.</b> Given this movement, the <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> actually qualify as constituents before movement. The movement analysis is illustrated here using t (trace) and indices to mark the positions of the shared material before movement occurs.|$|R

25|$|Age for {{decrease}} of L2 grammaticality performance varies from early childhood to late adolescence, {{depending on the}} combinations of the speaker’s first and second language. The age of acquisition at which L2 learners are worse than native speakers depends on how dissimilar the L1 and L2 are on phonological and grammatical level. For example, Chinese/English bilinguals at 7 years old perform {{just as well as}} Spanish/English bilinguals at 16 years old. This {{is due to the fact}} that a grammatical construction on an L2 that has a <b>parallel</b> <b>structure</b> in an L1 would impose less processing demand than one that does not have a parallel, causing a poorer performance on language structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} Christian {{music industry}} has {{roots in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s Jesus Movement and its Jesus Music artists. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a <b>parallel</b> <b>structure</b> to the general music industry. First, the Jesus movement produced {{a large number of}} bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb. This was in part {{due to a lack of}} appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists. Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations. According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure. Petra, for instance, struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.|$|E
500|$|Love's Last Shift {{can be seen}} as {{an early}} sign of Cibber's {{sensitivity}} to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see Colley Cibber). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and gender roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. Love's Last Shift {{is one of the first}} illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of [...] "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to The Relapse as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley's The Country Wife of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, The Relapse contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of <b>parallel</b> <b>structure</b> to Love's Last Shift: in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of The Relapse, it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.|$|E

5000|$|In linguistics, {{the term}} right node raising (RNR) denotes a sharing {{mechanism}} that sees {{the material to}} the immediate right of <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> being in some sense [...] "shared" [...] by those <b>parallel</b> <b>structures,</b> e.g. likes but dislikes the debates. The <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> of RNR are typically the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, although the phenomenon {{is not limited to}} coordination, since it can also appear with <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> that do not involve coordination. The term right node raising itself is due to Postal (1974). Postal assumed that the <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> are complete clauses below the surface. The shared constituent was then raised rightward out of each conjunct of the coordinate structure and attached as a single constituent to the structure above the level of the conjuncts, hence [...] "right node raising" [...] was occurring in a literal sense. While the term right node raising survives, the actual analysis that Postal proposed is not (or no longer) widely accepted. RNR occurs in many languages, including English and related languages.|$|R

50|$|The small conjunct {{approach}} dispenses {{with the}} desire to see the <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> as complete constituents at some level of structure below the surface. Instead, it assumes that {{what you see is what}} you get; the <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> are non-constituent strings that share the material to the immediate right of the final bracket. Neither movement nor ellipsis occurs. This approach has tacitly been taken for granted in this article. It avoids all the problems facing the previous two approaches. However, this success comes at a cost, since the small conjuncts do not qualify as constituents. The challenge facing the small conjunct approach is therefore to provide a principled account of how the RNR mechanism allows the <b>parallel</b> <b>structures</b> to be non-constituents.|$|R
