40|$|Lead is a {{persistent}} pollutant {{and the subject}} of many environmental studies, yet, in Australia, the extent of atmospheric lead emissions from the use of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> is unquantified. This paper details the first comprehensive account of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> sales and its lead concentrations over the 70 years of use in Australia. The resulting atmospheric lead emissions are calculated to provide the most complete understanding of the volume of lead released to the Australian continent from the consumption of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol.</b> Atmospheric emissions of lead to the entire Australian continent from <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> are calculated to total 240, 510 tonnes over seven decades of use, peaking at 7869 tonnes in 1974. Total emissions for individual states and territories range from 1745 to 67, 893 tonnes, with New South Wales responsible for the largest emissions. The effect of regulations on allowable concentrations of tetraethyl-lead additives are observed in the reduction of lead emissions in New South Wales and Victoria. The consequences to {{human health and the environment}} of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> consumption in Australia's populous cities are examined against historical air quality data and blood lead levels. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Lead {{concentrations}} {{and lead}} isotopic compositions were determined in historic {{central and southern}} Victoria, Australia lichen (Cladonia and Usnea) and fungi (Trametes) samples collected between 1852 and 2008 to evaluate long-term atmospheric lead contamination sources. The data are grouped into four time intervals of 1850 - 1931, 1932 - 1984, 1985 - 2001 and 2002 - 2008 corresponding {{to the history of}} <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> use in Australia. Elevated lichen and fungi lead concentrations and relatively high isotopic compositions from the period 1850 - 1931 are attributed to lithogenic sources, gold mining activities and early industrialisation. Significant increases in lichen and fungi lead concentrations and concomitant lower lead isotopic compositions correspond to the marked increase in lead emissions from <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> use after 1932. Following the end of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> use in 2002 lead isotopic composition values 'recover' toward more lithogenic values. However, the lead isotopic composition data indicate that the environmental impact from <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> emissions persists in contemporary samples dated to 2002 - 2008. Overall, the data reveal that herbarium lichens and fungi from central and southern Victoria can be used as proxies for environmental lead emissions over the past 150 years. 10 page(s...|$|R

Significant proportions of up to 30 - 50 % of natural Pb, derived from mineral dust, are observed in Atlantic surface waters, reflecting {{the success of the}} global effort to reduce anthropogenic Pb emissions. The observation of mineral dust derived Pb in surface waters is governed by the elevated atmospheric mineral dust concentration of the North African dust plume and the dominance of dry deposition for the atmospheric aerosol flux to surface waters.

40|$|Lead {{concentrations}} {{and their}} isotopic compositions were measured in lichen genera Cladonia and Usnea and fungi genus Trametes from the Greater Sydney region (New South Wales, Australia) {{that had been}} collected and archived over the past 120 years. The median lead concentrations were elevated in lichens and fungi prior {{to the introduction of}} <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> (Cladonia 12. 5 mg/kg; Usnea 15. 6 mg/kg; Trametes 1. 85 mg/kg) corresponding to early industrial development. During the period of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> use in Australian automobiles from 1932 to 2002, total median lead concentrations rose: Cladonia 18. 8 mg/kg; Usnea 21. 5 mg/kg; Trametes 4. 3 mg/kg. Following the cessation of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> use, median total lead concentrations decreased sharply in the 2000 s: Cladonia 4. 8 mg/kg; Usnea 1. 7 mg/kg. The lichen and fungi isotopic compositions reveal a significant decrease in ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb ratios from the end of 19 th century to the 1970 s. The following decades were characterised by lower allowable levels of lead additive in fuel and the introduction of unleaded petrol in 1985. The environmental response to these regulatory changes was that lichen and fungi ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb ratios increased, particularly from 1995 onwards. Although the lead isotope ratios of lichens continued to increase in the 2000 s they do not return to pre-leaded petrol values. This demonstrates that historic <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> emissions, inter alia other sources, remain a persistent source of anthropogenic contamination in the Greater Sydney region. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Data {{on blood}} lead levels, {{sources of lead}} and health effects were {{reviewed}} among children in Pakistan. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of published studies found through PubMed, an index of Pakistani medical journals PakMediNet and unpublished reports from governmental and non-govern mental agencies in Pakistan. Results: With {{the exception of a}} few studies that had adequate sample sizes and population-based samples, most studies were small and used convenience sampling methods to select study subjects. Overall, blood lead levels declined from 38 mu g/dl in 1989 to 15 mu g/dl in 2002. The major sources of lead that directly or indirectly resulted in lead exposure of children included: <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol,</b> father 2 ̆ 7 s occupation in lead-based industry, leaded paint, traditional cosmetics, and remedies. Apart from <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol,</b> there was no information regarding the [eve[of lead in other sources such as paints and the household environment.

The current lead levels in circumpulpal dentine of Cape Town residents are reported to be 74 μg/g and 16 μg/g for primary and secondary teeth respectively. It was found that lead pollution of the human body during the period 1812 - 1922 in the Cape Town area was substantially higher than at present.

In {{order to address}} this data gap, wine was investigated as a potential proxy for atmospheric lead conditions. Wine spanning sixty years was collected from two wine regions proximal to the South Australian capital city, Adelaide, and analysed for lead concentration and lead and strontium isotopic composition for source apportionment. Maximum wine lead concentrations (328 μg/L) occur prior to the lead-in-air monitoring in South Australia in the later 1970 s. Wine lead concentrations mirror available lead-in-air measurements and show a declining trend reflecting parallel reductions in <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> emissions. Lead from petrol dominated the lead in wine (²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb: 1. 086; ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb: 2. 360) until the introduction of unleaded petrol, {{which resulted in a}} shift in the wine lead isotopic composition closer to vineyard soil (²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb: 1. 137; ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb: 2. 421).

40|$|Vehicular {{consumption}} of fossil fuel contributes over 90 % {{of air pollution}} in Hong Kong. A key strategy to improve Hong Kong's air quality is to discourage dirty fuels (e. g., <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> and high-sulphur diesel) and to promote the use of clean fuels (e. g., low-sulphur diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)). This paper presents the empirical evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} the Government's clean fuel programs that offer tax subsidy to lower the consumption cost of such fuels. For the cases of unleaded petrol and ultra-low-sulphur diesel, lower fuel duties were offered so that the prices of these fuels were below those of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> and conventional diesel. Conventional petrol and diesel were phased out. In order to decide on the level of fuel duty concessions required to introduce LPG for taxis and bio-diesel for other vehicles, various Government-run trial programs were introduced to obtain cost estimates of using these alternative cleaner fuels. LPG using vehicles were subsequently exempted from the fuel duty in order to attract taxi and light bus operators to switch to LPG. It is apparent that the higher the subsidy, the faster is the rate at which switching to cleaner fuels takes place. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
