40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to <b>plasma–surface</b> <b>interaction</b> issues at high heat-loads which are typical for fusion reactors. For the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which is now under construction, the {{knowledge}} of erosion processes and the behaviour of various constructional materials under extreme conditions is a very critical issue, which will determine a successful realization of the project. The most important <b>plasma–surface</b> <b>interaction</b> (PSI) effects in 3 D geometry have been studied using a QSPA Kh- 50 powerful quasi-stationary plasma accelerator. Mechanisms of the droplet and dust generation have been investigated in detail. It {{was found that the}} droplets emission from castellated surfaces has a threshold character and a cyclic nature. It begins only after a certain number of the irradiating plasma pulses when molten and shifted material is accumulated {{at the edges of the}} castellated structure. This new erosion mechanism, connected with the edge effects, results in an increase in the size of the emitted droplets (as compared with those emitted from a flat surface). This mechanism can even induce the ejection of sub-mm particles. A concept of a new-generation QSPA facility, the current status of this device maintenance, and prospects for further experiments are also presente...|$|E
40|$|The <b>plasma-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> {{expected}} in the divertor of a future fusion reactor are characterized by extreme heat and particle fluxes interacting with the plasma-facing surfaces. Powerful linear plasma generators are used to reproduce the expected plasma conditions and allow <b>plasma-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> studies under those very harsh conditions. While the ion energies on the divertor surfaces of a fusion device are comparable to those used in various plasma-assited deposition and etching techniques, the ion (and energy) fluxes are up to four orders of magnitude higher.

40|$|It {{became clear}} {{in the early days}} of fusion {{research}} that the effects of the containment vessel (erosion of "impurities") degrade the overall fusion plasma performance. Progress in controlled nuclear fusion research over the last decade has led to magnetically confined plasmas that, in turn, are sufficiently powerful to damage the vessel structures over its lifetime.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{interaction}} of atmospheric-pressure plasma jets of Ar or air with liquid films of an aliphatic hydrocarbon on moving solid substrates. The hydrodynamic jet-liquid interaction induces a track of lower film thickness. The chemical <b>plasma-surface</b> <b>interaction</b> oxidizes the liquid, leading to a local increase of the surface tension and a self-organized redistribution of the liquid film. We developed a numerical model that qualitatively reproduces the formation, instability and coarsening of the flow patterns observed in the experiments.

40|$|The {{decreasing}} {{availability of}} energy and concern about climate change necessitate the development of novel sustainable energy sources. Fusion energy is such a source. Although it will take several decades to develop it into routinely operated power sources, the ultimate potential of fusion energy is very high and badly needed. A major step forward {{in the development of}} fusion energy is the decision to construct the experimental test reactor ITER. ITER will stimulate research in many areas of science. This article serves as an introduction to some of those areas. In particular, we discuss research opportunities in the context of plasma-surface interactions. The fusion plasma, with a typical temperature of 10 keV, has to be brought into contact with a physical wall in order to remove the helium produced and drain the excess energy in the fusion plasma. The fusion plasma is far too hot to be brought into direct contact with a physical wall. It would degrade the wall and the debris from the wall would extinguish the plasma. Therefore, schemes are developed to cool down the plasma locally before it impacts on a physical surface. The resulting <b>plasma-surface</b> <b>interaction</b> in ITER is facing several challenges including surface erosion, material redeposition and tritium retention. In this article we introduce how the <b>plasma-surface</b> <b>interaction</b> relevant for ITER can be studied in small scale experiments. The various requirements for such experiments are introduced and examples of present and future experiments will be given. The emphasis in this article will be on the experimental studies of plasma-surface interactions...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling techniques allow <b>plasma-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> such as sheath formation and sputtering to be modeled concurrently with {{the physics of}} antenna near- and far-field behavior and ICRF power flow. Although typical sheath length scales (micrometers) are {{much smaller than the}} wavelengths of fast (tens of cm) and slow (millimeter) waves excited by the antenna, sheath behavior near plasma-facing antenna components can be represented by a sub-grid kinetic sheath boundary condition, from which RF-rectified sheath potential variation over the surface is computed as a function of current flow and local plasma parameters near the wall. These local time-varying sheath potentials can then be used, in tandem with particle-in-cell (PIC) models of the edge plasma, to study sputtering effects. Particle strike energies at the wall can be computed more accurately, consistent with their passage through the known potential of the sheath, such that correspondingly increased accuracy of sputtering yields and heat/particle fluxes to antenna surfaces is obtained. The new simulation capabilities enable time-domain modeling of <b>plasma-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> and ICRF physics in realistic experimental configurations at unprecedented spatial resolution.
