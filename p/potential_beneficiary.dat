The leading test for mere powers is the [...] "any given postulant" [...] test, laid down in Re Gulbenkian.

This doctrine is that, for an express trust to be valid, the trust document must say with certainty who the beneficiaries there are. This is a problem with discretionary trusts, which can contain a class of beneficiaries rather than a list of named ones. The leading test of certainty of objects here is the [...] "any given postulant test", laid down in Re Gulbenkian. This states that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, when a <b>potential</b> <b>beneficiary</b> comes before them, that he either is or is not a beneficiary. The test was applied to discretionary trusts in McPhail v Doulton. The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden (No. 2); however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate new tests and reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid. Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a [...] "core number" [...] of beneficiaries who were certain.|$|E

50|$|In 1910, the Shrady Family {{successfully}} claimed {{two thirds}} of the Appley estate (worth nearly $1 million {{at the time of the}} settlement) finally resolving a legal battle that was initiated in the 1860s. The founder of the estate was Jacob Appley, the son of a German immigrant who started out as a butcher. In the early 1800s he made a big score by cornering the mutton market and he began investing in properties around the lower east side on Eldridge, Delancey, Forsyth, Bayard, and First Streets. When he died in 1840 he left the estate, which included about 40 houses, in trust for his only son, Jacob Alexander Appley (Jacob A.). The trust document, one of the earliest of its kind, provided Jacob A. with the income from the estate for life and saved the properties to be distributed to Jacob A's issue (children) after his death. In case no issue existed the trust named old Jacob's sister Barbara (Shrady) and her heirs as the beneficiaries. As Barbara's grandson, Dr. George Frederick Shrady was one <b>potential</b> <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|E
50|$|Those {{eligible}} for unemployment benefits receive them in two ways. A basic daily allowance of about 25 € goes to any person looking for employment. This allowance was meanstested, and {{the income of}} a spouse could disqualify a <b>potential</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> The allowance lasts {{as long as the}} recipient was unemployed. Those unemployed who are members of an unemployment fund (about 80 percent of Finns are) and who have worked for at least 26 weeks in the preceding 2 years are {{eligible for}} more substantial benefits amounting to the daily basic allowance plus 45 percent of the difference between their daily wage and the basic allowance. After 100 days the payment is reduced by 20 percent. Beneficiaries of the income-related allowance could receive it for 500 days in a 4-year period. Workers in their late fifties and older who had been unable to find work can be granted an unemployment pension equal to a disability pension until they reached the age when they would be eligible for an old-age pension. Unemployment benefits are administered by the Social Security Institute. The basic allowance is completely financed by the state. Employers and the state fund equal shares of 95 percent of the income-related payments and the beneficiary is responsible for the remaining 5 percent.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more complex}} test is found with mere powers. These are {{where a person}} is granted the power (the ability) to {{exercise}} a trust-like power, but without any obligation to do so, such as [...] "the trustee may give £1,000 to X", or [...] "the trustee can, at his discretion, give £1,000 to X" [...] as opposed to [...] "the trustee shall give £1,000 to X". In Re Hay's ST, Megarry VC said that: [...] A mere power is very different an ordinary trust obligation. Normally the trustee is not bound to exercise it, and the court will not compel him to do so. That, however, {{does not mean that}} he can simply fold his hands and ignore it, for normally he must from time to time consider whether or not to exercise the power, and the court may direct him to do this. The holder of a mere power is therefore free to do what he wants with the property he holds; if he fails to consider his exercise of the power, the courts may force him to do so. The leading test for mere powers is the [...] "any given postulant" [...] test, laid down in Re Gulbenkian.

5000|$|National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a {{petition}} for an employment-based immigrant visa under the second preference ("EB-2"), unlike the first preference category {{for individuals with}} extraordinary ability ("EB-1A"), generally requires a specific, permanent job offer and a corresponding approved labor certification. As a result, {{not only does the}} <b>potential</b> <b>beneficiary</b> have to have a firm job offer, but they must rely on that particular employer to petition on their behalf. In addition, the labor certification process can be a very time consuming and costly undertaking for potential employers. This is one reason why many employers are hesitant to petition on behalf of beneficiaries for this particular preference category. However, under the “National Interest Waiver” (NIW) provision for EB-2, an individual may seek a waiver of the otherwise required offer of employment -and thus corresponding labor certification- by establishing that his/her admission to permanent residency would be in the so-called [...] "national interest". As a result, this means that potential beneficiaries can petition on their own behalf. However, because of the heightened evidentiary standard {{a petition}}er must meet, the NIW requires more than a regular EB-2 petition. The procedure is to file the Form I-140 together with corresponding evidence to establish that the foreign person's admission to the United States for permanent residency would be in the national interest.|$|E

[...] Indeed, he is credited with informing former President Ben Ali not only that he needed to relinquish power, but that he could not count United States for exile. In WikiLeaks cables, Gray has also commented on the political aptitude of Tunisian Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi, who temporarily assumed control of the country following former President Ben Ali's departure, stating that [...] "it appears Ben Ali has come to view him as indispensable." [...] During protests which contributed to President Ben Ali's departure, Gray was summoned to explain American encouragement of political demonstration and the American response stating that Tunisia had used excessive violence against protesters. [...] U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley stated that the purpose of Gray's meeting was to express the Obama administration's wariness toward said violence, with 27 protesters having died before the meeting took place. [...] The U.S. response to Tunisian riots was poorly received, and as such it was Gray who was called to explain the reasons for the Obama administration's condemnation of the Ben Ali regime's handling of the unrest.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} a generous demogrant for individuals age 70 and older that started in 2001 in Mexico City on the labor supply and time use of beneficiaries and of non-elderly family members who live with them. Using a triple differences approach, I find that the program has no significant effect on the time use of eligible individuals, except for the sharp decrease in the housework participation of elderly women who live with another <b>potential</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> Individuals 60 to 69 years old change their time use only if they live with a <b>potential</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> but not because they expect to receive the demogrant themselves in a few years. In particular, men in their 60 s seem to retire early if they live with someone who qualifies for the transfer. Both men and women 18 to 59 years old increase their labor supply if they live with an eligible man, but decrease it if they live with an eligible woman. These results are consistent with income in the hands of elderly women being shared more with younger family members than income in the hands of elderly men. ...|$|E
