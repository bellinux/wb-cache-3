The simulated katabatic flow moves from 'shooting' to 'tranquil' towards the foot of the slope. This transition acts to trigger a train of internal gravity waves which propagate energy upwards away from the katabatic flow JUMP.

The specific objective was to derive nocturnal <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage velocity over the slope. To address these objectives, a number of infrared measurement campaigns were conducted during calm and clear sky conditions over an agricultural zone (blackcurrant farm) in Canada. Using thermal infrared images, the nocturnal surface temperature gradient were computed in hourly basis. The largest gradient magnitudes were found between 17 h - 20 h.

Aircraft data from the New England Winter Storms Experiment (NEWSEX) are used to examine the vertical structure of four New England coastal fronts. The aircraft made multiple passes at varying elevations through the coastal fronts. The observations were projected onto cross sections normal to the coastal fronts using frontal orientations determined from surface analyses and frontal velocities determined from a least-squares fit to multiple frontal penetrations. The frontal zones were found to be roughly 200 m wide, rising sharply from the ground to a height of 150 m to 400 m over distances of 0. 5 to 2. 5 km before leveling off and rising gradually toward the mountains. The underlying <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> were similar in form and flow patterns to cold-air damming structures observed elsewhere along the East Coast. The coastal fronts formed the leading edges <b>of</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>pools.</b> <b>Air</b> on the warm side of the fronts was neutrally stratified, having been recently heated by the warm Gulf of Maine. This warm air attained vertical velocities of up to 2. 5 m s? 1 as it rose over the coastal fronts and accelerated toward the mountains, and evidence is found for direct precipitation enhancements by this updraft. The coastal fronts possessed characteristics of atmospheric density currents, with a low-level inflow within the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> toward the head and turbulent mixing behind the head. Because the fronts were quasi-stationary and were located in neutrally stratified environments, a direct comparison is made with theoretical predictions of inviscid density current behavior. The observed frontal velocities relative to the warm air were found to be within about 1 m s? 1 of the velocities predicted by inviscid density current theory. Richardson numbers are estimated at {{the leading edge of the}} coastal front and along the frontal inversion beyond the region of rapid mixing behind the head.

40|$|A non-hydrostatic {{numerical}} model, the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), {{has been}} used to investigate the development of katabatic jumps in Coats Land, Antarctica. In the control run with a 5 m s- 1 downslope directed initial wind, a katabatic jump develops near the foot of the idealized slope. The jump is manifested as a rapid deceleration of the downslope flow and a change from supercritical to subcritical flow, in a hydraulic sense, i. e., the Froude number (Fr) of the flow changes from Fr > 1 to Fr> 1. Results from sensitivity experiments show that an increase in the upstream flow rate strengthens the jump, while an increase in the downstream inversion-layer depth results in a retreat of the jump. Hydraulic theory and Bernoulli's theorem have been used to explain the surface pressure change across the jump. It is found that hydraulic theory always underestimates the surface pressure change, while Bernoulli's theorem provides a satisfactory estimation. An analysis of the downs balance for the katabatic jump indicates that the important forces are those related to the pressure gradient, advection and, to a lesser extent, the turbulent momentum divergence. The development of katabatic jumps can be divided into two phases. In phase I, the t gradient force is nearly balanced by advection, while in phase II, the pressure gradient force is counterbalanced by turbulent momentum divergence. The upslope pressure gradient force associated with a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> over the ice shelf facilitates the formation of the katabatic jump...|$|E

40|$|Building on {{studies by}} Brayshaw et al. (2009, 2011) {{of the basic}} {{ingredients}} of the North Atlantic storm track (land-sea contrast, orography and SST), this article investigates the impact of Eurasian topography and Pacific SST anomalies on the North Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks through a hierarchy of atmospheric GCM simulations using idealised boundary conditions in the HadGAM 1 model. The Himalaya-Tibet mountain complex is found to {{play a crucial role}} in shaping the North Pacific storm track. The northward deflection of the westerly flow around northern Tibet generates an extensive <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> very <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> in the north-eastern tip of the Asian continent, which strengthens the meridional temperature gradient and favours baroclinic growth in the western Pacific. The Kuroshio SST front is also instrumental in strengthening the Pacific storm track through its impact on near-surface baroclinicity, while the warm waters around Indonesia tend to weaken it through the impact on baroclinicity of stationary Rossby waves propagating poleward from the convective heating regions. Three mechanisms by which the Atlantic storm track may be affected by changes in the boundary conditions upstream of the Rockies are discussed. In the model configuration used here, stationary Rossby waves emanating from Tibet appear to weaken the North Atlantic storm track substantially, whereas those generated over the cold waters off Peru appear to strengthen it. Changes in eddy-driven surface winds over the Pacific generally appear to modify the flow over the Rocky Mountains, leading to consistent modifications in the Atlantic storm track. The evidence for each of these mechanisms is, however, ultimately equivocal in these simulations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{katabatic}} wind events {{observed in the}} coastal zone of Adelie Land, Antarctica, on 27 November and 3 December 1985 are simulated with a hydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model coupled to a snow moder. The diurnal cycle of insolation is strong. The main difference in the forcing between the two events is the large-scale wind, which is weak on 27 November and moderate on 3 December. In both cases temperature and wind are characterized by well-marked diurnal cycles. In particular, {{katabatic wind}}s blow during nighttime and upslope winds during daytime. In both cases the katabatic airstream slows down progressively over the ocean. Consequently, continental air piles up and this generates a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> responsible for a pressure gradient force opposing the katabatic wind. An amplification of the slowing down results. When, in the morning, insolation increases, the surface inversion weakens but {{the influence of the}} cold air pool increases. The katabatic how starts to decay over the coastal zone and then retreats progressively toward the ice sheet interior. When the large-scale wind is weak, the surface warming is sufficient for generating an additional upslope bouyancy force, and anabatic flow develops over the ice sheet in the afternoon. When the large-scare wind is moderate and downslope, the pilling up of cold air is important and this has a dramatic impact on the flow. A sharp spatial transition is generated between downslope and upslope winds over the ocean. This discontinuity moves toward the ice sheet interior in the morning and is responsible for the sudden cessation of the katabatic flow seen by static observers. The results of the simulations are used in order to refine a simple parameterization of Antarctic katabatic winds...|$|E
