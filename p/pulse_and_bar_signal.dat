40|$|Abstract The dynamic {{compressive}} {{behavior of}} ice is investigated using a large-sized (37 mm in diameter) modified aluminum split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) with pulse shaper at the strain rate from 500 s- 1 to 1200 s- 1. A series of relatively stable experimental results of dynamic compressive strength versus strain rate and a linear fitting curve {{have been obtained}} by controlling data scatter within 25 %. The composition of incident wave has been discussed. The effects of <b>pulse</b> shaper diameter <b>and</b> velocity of striker bar have been tested. The properties and principles of incident wave in different stage has been elaborated when using pulse shaper. A theoretical analysis of <b>pulse</b> shaper <b>and</b> <b>bar</b> size effects on the rising time of incident wave has been conducted. Results show the thickness of pulse shaper {{is proportional to the}} rising time. Enlarging the diameter and reducing the velocity of the striker bar could increase the rising time and suppress the dispersion.

5|$|The Last of Us Remastered changes {{little from}} the basic {{gameplay}} {{of the original}} version. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. For most of the game, players control Joel; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Remastered uses the DualShock 4's touchpad to navigate inventory items, <b>and</b> the light <b>bar</b> <b>signals</b> health, scaling from blue to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely. In the menu, players {{have the ability to}} watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring creative director Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively.|$|R

Quasi-static compression tests were done with a Shimadzu AG-X conventional test machine while two different modified Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) systems were used for dynamic compression tests. Since dynamic testing of soft materials with classical SHPB is problematic due to low signal levels and relatively higher signal to noise ratio, impact end of transmitter bar was modified with insertion of piezoelectric force transducers through the SHPB tests of Teflon, thus enabling the direct measurement of force on specimen. High strain tests of Polyurethane involved oscillations in both incident <b>and</b> transmitter <b>bar</b> <b>signals.</b> To overcome this, EPDM rubber pulse shaper was used through the SHPB tests of Polyurethane. Experimental results were used in numerical study as material model parameters and SHPB tests of both materials were simulated in LS-DYNA. Experimental study concluded strong strain rate dependency in both Teflon and Polyurethane, depicting an increase in maximum stress {{with the increase in}} strain rate. Numerical study showed a good correlation with experiments in terms of <b>bar</b> stresses <b>and</b> damage behavior of specimens, offering a solution to more complex problems that can be encountered in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Obesity is a {{significant}} health care problem, affecting more than {{one third of the}} United States population and is an important risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 D). Adipose tissue expansion results in the recruitment and accumulation of macrophages, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines that impair insulin signaling. Adenosine regulates inflammation by signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the A 2 b adenosine receptor (A 2 bAR). Recently a role for adenosine receptors has been described in the differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes. This thesis tests the hypothesis that the A 2 bAR regulates adipose tissue dynamics at the level of preadipocyte differentiation and macrophage inflammation. This thesis showed that activation of the A 2 bAR inhibited preadipocyte differentiation. A 2 bAR-induced adipocyte inhibition was dependent on the expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF 4), which is important for stem cell maintenance and renewal. A 2 bAR knockdown enhanced adipogenesis in vitro <b>and</b> A 2 <b>bAR</b> knockout (KO) mice had more adipocytes as compared to wild type (WT) mice, suggesting enhanced adipogenesis {{in the absence of the}} A 2 bAR. The translational potential of this work is strengthened by the previous finding of elevated A 2 bAR expression in adipose tissue of obese individuals as well as our new finding of a close correlation between the expression of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>and</b> KLF 4 in adipose tissue of obese individuals. A 2 bAR KO mice have impaired insulin resistance, in part due to reduced levels of insulin receptor substrate- 2 (IRS- 2). Proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to reduce IRS- 2 levels. Given the role of the A 2 bAR in regulating inflammation, the contribution of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in macrophages to insulin resistance was elucidated. Transgenic mice that express A 2 bAR only in macrophages were generated. Intriguingly, restoration of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in macrophages ameliorated insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, and fat and liver tissue insulin signaling. As expected, tissue and plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels were reduced to that of WT mice. This suggested that the protective effect of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> on insulin resistance was due in large part to A 2 bAR control of macrophage cytokine expression. This thesis highlights the importance of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in adipogenesis <b>and</b> in regulating inflammation in the setting of obesity and T 2 D...|$|R

40|$|Although acute lung injury {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} critical illness, resolution often occurs spontaneously via activation of incompletely understood pathways. We recently found that mechanical ventilation of mice increases {{the level of}} pulmonary adenosine, and that mice deficient for extracellular adenosine generation show increased pulmonary edema and inflammation after ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Here, we profiled the response to VILI in mice with genetic deletions {{of each of the}} 4 adenosine receptors (ARs) and found that deletion of the A 2 BAR gene was specifically associated with reduced survival time and increased pulmonary albumin leakage after injury. In WT mice, treatment with an A 2 BAR-selective antagonist resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation, edema, and attenuated gas exchange, while an A 2 BAR agonist attenuated VILI. In bone marrow–chimeric A 2 BAR mice, although the pulmonary inflammatory response involved A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> from bone marrow–derived cells, A 2 BARs located on the lung tissue attenuated VILI-induced albumin leakage and pulmonary edema. Furthermore, measurement of alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) demonstrated that A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> enhanced amiloride-sensitive fluid transport and elevation of pulmonary cAMP levels following VILI, suggesting that A 2 BAR agonist treatment protects by drying out the lungs. Similar enhancement of pulmonary cAMP and AFC were also observed after β-adrenergic stimulation, a pathway known to promote AFC. Taken together, these studies reveal a role for A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in attenuating VILI and implicate this receptor as a potential therapeutic target during acute lung injury...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Color <b>bar</b> <b>signal</b> {{generator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important measurements for PAL TV applications. However, its use in resource constrained applications such as color TV video adjustment is limited because of the high architecture complexity involved. Due to the broad range of applications presently offered by FPGA (filed programmable gate array), their use has become increasingly widespread in different areas and sectors. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a color <b>bar</b> <b>signal</b> generator based on FPGA and MC 1377 with a high performance and low system complexity. The FPGA technology proved to be a proper platform to meet these two contrasting requirements. The signal structure, generation principle, and FPGA implementation of composite PAL synchronize signal and RGB color signal are described. The interface circuits, hardware and software of the system are introduced. The software is simulated using MAXplus platform. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness and stability of the signal generator...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince its {{discovery}} as a low-affinity adenosine receptor (AR), the A 2 B receptor (A 2 BAR), {{has proven}} enigmatic in its function. The previous {{discovery of the}} A 2 AAR, which shares many similarities with the A 2 BAR but demonstrates significantly greater affinity for its endogenous ligand, led to the original perception that the A 2 BAR was not of substantial physiologic relevance. In addition, lack of specific pharmacological agents targeting the A 2 BAR made its initial characterization challenging. However, {{the importance of this}} receptor was reconsidered when it was observed that the A 2 BAR is highly transcriptionally regulated by factors implicated in inflammatory hypoxia. Moreover, the notion that during ischemia or inflammation extracellular adenosine is dramatically elevated to levels sufficient for A 2 BAR activation, indicated that A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> may be important to dampen inflammation particularly during tissue hypoxia. In addition, the recent advent of techniques for murine genetic manipulation along with development of pharmacological agents with enhanced A 2 BAR specificity has provided invaluable tools for focused studies on the explicit role of A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in different disease models. Currently, studies performed with combined genetic and pharmacological approaches have demonstrated that A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> plays a tissue protective role in many models of acute diseases e. g. myocardial ischemia, or acute lung injury. These studies indicate that the A 2 BAR is expressed {{on a wide variety of}} cell types and exerts tissue/cell specific effects. This is an important consideration for future studies where tissue or cell type specific targeting of the A 2 BAR may be used as therapeutic approach.
