40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing decentralized robust <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stabilisers</b> for interconnected <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> by considering effects of parameter variations and interconnections from other generators. To make the controller robust against parameter variations around an operating point, variations in system parameters due to the load change are translated to the uncertainty framework and are represented using Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs). The operating range of the generator is divided into several zones with respect to its power output and separate controllers are designed for each zone to achieve robust stabilization {{in the vicinity of}} the operating point. As the operating point shifts from one zone to another a suitable controller is selected and switched. The stability of the switched system is achieved by allowing a “dwell time ” between consecutive switchings. Jumps in system states during switching are taken into account in the derivation of the dwell time. Interconnection effects due to other machines in the grid are included as the uncertainty in the controller design.

These scaling parameters are the outputs of another fuzzy-logic system, which gets its inputs from the operating conditions of the power system.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an investigation of}} the dynamics and control of turbogenerators from a multivariable control viewpoint. The multivariate control framework chosen -Individual Channel Analysis and Design- is particularly appropriate since it encapsulates the dynamical characteristics of the uncontrolled system with a view to exposing the potential and limitations for subsequent closed-loop control. The main contribution of the thesis is a complete new insight into why excitation/governor control with <b>Power</b> <b>System</b> <b>Stabilisers</b> (PSS) has been so successful for the control of turbogenerators connected to an infinite bus provided by the small-signal multivariable analysis framework, Individual Channel Analysis and Design. The multivariable analysis justifies treating the turbogenerator system as a pseudo- Single-Input Single-Output, (SISO) system where the governor loop is first closed and the exciter loop is treated as a SISO system for the prime purpose of rejecting voltage disturbances. The function of the PSS is identified as that of overcoming an awkward switch-back frequency-domain characteristic of the excitation channel so as to permit high-performance excitation channel bandwidths up to 10 rad/sec that otherwise could not be obtained. Thus, in addition to the control requirements of set point regulation of the terminal voltage and shaft speed, the PSS provides for a second control requirement of strong voltage disturbance rejection over the important frequency range of 0 to 10 rad/sec. The PSS control option is also assessed against other control options. Several other results concerning stability robustness to system uncertainties in different system configurations follow from the analysis in a transparent and immediate way...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{impedance}} devices using {{power electronic}} technology, such as Static VAR Compensators (SVCs) Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitors (TCSC) and Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) {{have the potential}} to increase <b>power</b> control and <b>system</b> damping [1, 2]. The allocation of these devices to get the most effective stabilisation of system modes is a complex problem that requires consideration of many factors. Major design considerations include the identification of busbars and branches in which to locate the system controllers and the choice of suitable feedback signals to be used as input to a stabilising control function [3 - 6]. Several analytical criteria for placement of damping controllers have been proposed in the literature. Specifically, modal analysis techniques based on the calculation of participation factors, transfer function residues and controllability and observability indices have been used to identify optimal locations for SVCs, TCSC, UPFC and <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stabilisers</b> [2, 7 - 11]. The computation of controllability and observability measures is of particular interest as it provides valuable information about system dynamic characteristics and the ability of system controllers to enhance damping. This work presents an efficient analysis and design method to place variable impedance devices for enhancement of small signal stability in complex <b>power</b> <b>systems.</b> Controllability is first explored to allocate damping controllers in those busbars and system branches in which they are more effective to enhance damping of a given subset of critical oscillation modes. Observability indices are, in turn, taken to assess supplementary signals that are to be used in a given controller and which are required to “show” the oscillation mode. In this approach, the computation of controllability and observability is based on a measure of the distance of a state representation from the nearest uncontrollable system [12, 13]. This method is numerically stable and can be used to assess the numerical rank and other properties of state models. The study of inter-area oscillations and placement of controllers is done using modal analysis of a linearised model of the <b>power</b> <b>system</b> that includes a detailed representation of variable impedance controllers.

40|$|Contemporary power {{networks}} are gradually expanding incorporating {{new sources of}} electrical energy and power electronic based devices. The major stability issue in large interconnected <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> is the lightly damped interarea oscillations. In the light of growth of their incidents there are increased concerns {{about the effectiveness of}} current control devices and control <b>systems</b> in maintaining <b>power</b> <b>system</b> stability. This thesis presents a Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) based control scheme to enhance <b>power</b> <b>system</b> stability. The control scheme has a hierarchical (two-level) structure comprising a Supplementary Wide-Area Controller (SWAC) built on top of existing <b>Power</b> <b>System</b> <b>Stabilisers</b> (PSSs). The SWAC's focus is on stabilising the critical interarea oscillations in the system while leaving local modes to be controlled entirely by local PSSs. Both control systems in the two levels work together to maintain system stability. The scheme relies on synchronised measurements supplied by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) through the WAMS and the only cost requirement is for the communication infrastructure which is already available, or it will be in the near future. A novel linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control design approach which targets the interarea modes directly is introduced in this thesis. Its features are demonstrated through a comparison with the conventional method commonly used in <b>power</b> <b>system</b> damping applications. The modal LQG approach offers simplicity and flexibility when targeting multiple interarea modes without affecting local modes and local controllers, thus making it highly suitable to hierarchical WAMS based control schemes. Applicability of the approach to large <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> is demonstrated using different scenarios of model order reduction. The design approach incorporates time delays experienced in the transmission of the SWAC's input/output signals. Issues regarding values of time delays and required level of detail in modelling time delays are thoroughly discussed. Three methods for selection of input/output signals for WAMS based damping controllers are presented and reviewed. The first method uses modal observability/controllability factors. The second method is based on the Sequential Orthogonalisation (SO) algorithm, a tool for the optimal placement of measurement devices. Its application is extended and generalised in this thesis to handle the problem of input/output signal selection. The third method combines clustering techniques and modal factor analysis. The clustering method uses advanced Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where its draw backs and limitations, in the context of <b>power</b> <b>system</b> dynamics' applications, are overcome. The methods for signal selection are compared using both small signal and transient stability analysis to determine the best optimal set of signals. Enhancement of <b>power</b> <b>system</b> stability is demonstrated by applying the proposed WAMS based control scheme on the New England test system. The multi-input multi-output (MIMO) WAMS based damping controller uses a reduced set of input/output signals and is designed using the modal LQG approach. Effectiveness of the control scheme is comprehensively assessed using both small signal and transient stability analysis for different case studies including small and large disturbances, changes in network topology and operating condition, variations in time delays, and failure of communication links.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of {{harmonics}} as a power quality issue on the dynamic behaviour of the <b>power</b> <b>systems.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>power</b> <b>system</b> stabilizers in distorted conditions is also investigated. This thesis consists of three parts as follows:The first part focuses on {{the operation of the}} <b>power</b> <b>system</b> under distorted conditions. The conventional model of a synchronous generator in the dq-frame of reference is modified to include {{the impact of}} time and space harmonics. To do this, the synchronous generator is first modelled in the harmonic domain. This model helps in calculating the additional parts of the generator fundamental components due to the harmonics. Then the Park transformation is used for calculating the modified fundamental components of the synchronous generator in dq axes. The modified generator rotor angle due to the presence of harmonics is calculated and the impact of damper windings under the influence of harmonics is investigated. This model is used to study the small-signal stability of a distorted Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system. The eigenvalue analysis method is employed and the system state space equations are calculated by linearizing the differential equations around the operating point using an analytical method. The simulation results are presented for a distorted SMIB system under the influence of different harmonic levels. The impact of damper windings and also harmonics phase angles are also investigated. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, the effectiveness of the <b>power</b> <b>system</b> damping controllers under distorted conditions is studied. This investigation is done based on a distorted SMIB system installed with a Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC). In the first step, the system state space equations are derived. A Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller with a conventional structure is installed on the SSSC to improve the system dynamic behaviour. A genetic-fuzzy algorithm is proposed for tuning the POD parameters. This method along with the observability matrix is employed to design a POD controller under sinusoidal and distorted conditions. The impact of harmonics on the effectiveness of the POD controller under distorted conditions is investigated. In the last part, the steady state and dynamic operation of an actual distributed generation system under sinusoidal and distorted conditions are studied. A decoupled harmonic power flow program is employed for steady state analysis. The nonlinear loads are modelled as decoupled harmonic current sources and the nonlinear model of synchronous generator in harmonic domain is used to calculate the injected current harmonics. For the system dynamic stability study, the <b>power</b> <b>system</b> toolbox with the modified model of the synchronous generator is used. The system eigenvalues are calculated and the effectiveness of the installed <b>Power</b> <b>System</b> <b>Stabilisers</b> (PSS) is investigated under sinusoidal and distorted conditions.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the small-signal dynamic performance of high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission links based on voltage source converter (VSC) technology operating in parallel with the existing longitudinal Australian <b>power</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis presents the principle design methodology to achieve robust controllers for VSCs including inner current controller, outer power and voltage controllers {{as well as the}} supplementary damping controllers for enhancing the small-disturbance rotor-angle stability of a weak multi-machine <b>power</b> <b>system</b> with embedded VSC-HVDC links. Three types of linear current controller schemes (proportional-integral, proportional-resonant and Dead-Beat schemes) are investigated and discussed in detail to identify the most suitable control method. Due to its wider bandwidth and superior performance under unbalanced operating conditions, the Dead Beat current controller is set as the inner current controller that has not been analysed in detail in the literature. A new methodology for the selection and optimization of the parameters of the proportional-integral compensators in the various control loops of a VSC-HVDC transmission system using a decoupled control strategy is also proposed in this thesis. It was found that the new methodology is effective in a relatively strong system. However, since the method did not take various operating conditions and system disturbances into account, it will not be effective in a relatively weak system. The analysis shows that the design of robust outer loop controllers is challenging due to the limited bandwidth of the inner current controller in a weak AC system. Therefore, the second primary objective of the project was to develop a simple fixed parameter controller, which can perform well over a wide range of operating points within the active/reactive power (PQ) capability chart of the VSCs. To achieve this second objective, various grid conditions including various Short Circuit Ratios (SCRs), different X/R ratios and PQ capabilities of the VSC system were studied. To support the primary objectives, a detailed higher order small-signal model of the DB controlled VSC is developed and systematically verified. As an original contribution, the study developed a new methodology to linearize the modulator/demodulator blocks which are used to develop the small signal models for several key components such as the sampling block, the delay block and the DB inner current controller. The initial values of the PI/PID compensator parameters are obtained by applying the classical frequency response design methods to a set of detailed linear models of the open-loop transfer functions of the VSC-HVDC control system. It was concluded that an iterative process may be required after examining the co-operation performance of these controllers designed. In the final chapter of this thesis, the small-signal rotor-angle stability of a model of the Australian <b>power</b> <b>system</b> with embedded VSC based HVDC links was examined. For the analytical purposes of this thesis a simplified model of the Australian <b>power</b> <b>system</b> is used to connect the high capacity, but as yet undeveloped, geothermal resource in the region of Innamincka in northern South Australia via a 1, 100 km HVDC link to Armidale in northern New South Wales. It is observed that the introduction of the new source of geothermal power generation has an adverse impact on the damping performance of the system. Therefore, two forms of stabilization are examined: (i) generator <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stabilisers</b> (PSS) fitted to the synchronous machines which are used to convert geothermal energy to electrical power; and (ii) power oscillation damping controllers (PODs) fitted to the VSC-HVDC link. In the case of the PODs two types of stabilizing input signals are considered: (i) local signals such as power flow in adjacent AC lines and (ii) wide-area signals such as bus voltage angles at key nodes in the various regions of the system. It was concluded that the small-signal rotor-angle stability of the interconnected AC/DC system has been greatly enhanced by employing the designed damping controllers. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{fuzzy logic}} {{controller}} (FLC) is {{designed as a}} <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stabiliser</b> due to its simplicity and robustness. The input and output membership functions were adjusted according to an evaluation index {{in order to achieve}} the optimal performance. The initial FLC design with a complete filled rule table (49 rules) can be reduced using neural network techniques to improve the dynamic performance. However, the simplified FLC does not work well when the power system is subject to a large disturbance such as a three-phase fault. The FLC with hierarchical structure consinsts of a multi-layer controller which incoprporates rule based FLCs for direct control at the lower level. The proposed FLC with hierarchical structure has improved the system performance under both small and large pertubations at various operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|A <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stabiliser</b> (PSS) design method, {{which aims}} at {{enhancing}} the damping of multiple electromechanical modes in a multi-machine system {{over a large}} and pre-specified set of operating conditions, is introduced. With the assumption of normal distribution, the statistical nature of the eigenvalues corresponding to different operating conditions is described by their expectations and variances. A probabilistic eigenvalue-based optimisation problem used for determining PSS parameters is then formulated. Differential evolution (DE) is applied for solving this highly nonlinear optimisation problem. Different strategies for control parameter settings of DE have been studied to verify the robustness of DE in PSS optimisation problems. The performance of the proposed PSS, with a conventional lead/lag structure, has been demonstrated based on two test systems by probabilistic eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear simulation.
