During this time the P. schultzi quivers very quickly with its whole body at regular intervals. In almost all cases the prey stays motionless. P. schultzi never plucks the web as Portia fimbriata does.|$|E
5|$|When Brian {{approaches}} Stewie {{about helping}} him find {{a tennis ball}} he'd buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that he buried it on January 31, 1999 (the day of the series' premiere on Fox). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, but notice that their past looks more strange than they remembered it: The family continually <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> cutaways, and Meg's voice sounds different. Telling Brian that he mustn't alter the past by getting the tennis ball {{and that he should}} instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging outside the window, Brian fell onto Past Peter's car as he drives to the bachelor party at past Glenn Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved only a bit forward in time towards their destination. Later, the two manage to take advantage of Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. It was only after the two return to the present that Stewie learns that Brian intentionally told his past self about the September 11 attacks ahead of time, allowing the Past Brian to beat American Airlines Flight 11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari with a baseball bat, and then preventing the other three planes from leaving the airports.|$|E

25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E

500|$|Professional {{performances}} of Shakespeare in {{the mid-19th century}} had two particular features: firstly, they were generally star vehicles, with supporting roles cut or marginalised to give greater prominence to the central characters. Secondly, they were [...] "pictorial", placing the action on spectacular and elaborate sets (requiring lengthy <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> scene changes) and with the frequent use of tableaux. Henry Irving's 1882 production at the Lyceum Theatre (with himself as Romeo and Ellen Terry as Juliet) is considered an archetype of the pictorial style. In 1895, Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson took over from Irving and {{laid the groundwork for}} a more natural portrayal of Shakespeare that remains popular today. Forbes-Robertson avoided the showiness of Irving and instead portrayed a down-to-earth Romeo, expressing the poetic dialogue as realistic prose and avoiding melodramatic flourish.|$|E
500|$|Smith began {{publishing}} {{for children}} in 1887, with her first volume of children's music entitled Songs for Little Children, Part 1. She was a proponent and follower of the teaching philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel. Smith incorporated Fröbel's ideas that childhood is a universal experience in which children learn by imitation, using their natural abilities. Her compositions also recognized that children learn by movement and play, but have limited attention spans. Thus, the compositions she created were usually short melodies, with limited vocal ranges, and were easy to sing. The songs were in major keys, typically C, F, and G and extended only from C1 to F2. Most melodies were made in stepped triads and provided <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> activity. For example, in her song [...] "The Wind Mill" [...] there is an eight measure rest {{for the children to}} make the motions of the turning blades.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{found the}} book well-researched and thought-provoking. Reviewers enjoyed Atwood's humour and {{conversational}} writing. The style {{was described as}} [...] "eclectic", a [...] "literary walkabout", and [...] "anecdotally rich". Novelist David Liss wrote that the book was [...] "delightfully engaging, smart, funny, [...] clever". Canadian writer Charles Foran called the book [...] "serious adult fun" [...] that [...] "displays some of the energy of a lively dinner party, one replete with anecdotes and opinions, witticisms and barbs". The book's most entertaining parts are discussions on non-monetary debts and debts portrayed in literature. Regarding the speeches, the reviewer for The Montreal Gazette wrote: [...] "Her delivery, as usual, was smooth, relentlessly paced, but with precise <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> the frequent, much-appreciated laugh lines." [...] John N. Gray, in The New York Review of Books, wrote that [...] "Atwood has combined rigorous analysis, wide-ranging erudition, and a beguilingly playful imagination". The Library Journal recommended the book for all libraries.|$|E
500|$|Half-Life is a first-person shooter that {{requires}} the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike most of its peers at the time, Half-Life used scripted sequences, such as a Vortigaunt ramming down a door, to advance major plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, Half-Lifes story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences, keeping the player {{in control of the}} first-person viewpoint. In line with this, the game has no cut-scenes, and the player rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees [...] "through his eyes" [...] for {{the entire length of the}} game. Half-Life has no [...] "levels"; it instead divides the game into chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous, except for short <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> loading.|$|E
500|$|The Second Army {{planned to}} attack with a {{succession}} of separate bodies of infantry, on narrower fronts, for about [...] to the first objective, [...] to the second objective and [...] to the final objective. Pauses on successive objective lines would become longer and attacks would be protected by a bigger, deeper multi-layered creeping barrage. Standing barrages beyond the objective lines were to be fired during <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> consolidation, to obstruct German counter-attacks into the captured area, which would be confronted {{by a series of}} defensive areas based on the British objective lines. The British infantry would be in communication with its artillery and have much more local support from the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Beyond the [...] "creeper", four heavy artillery counter-battery double groups, with [...] and howitzers, covered a [...] front, ready to engage German guns with gas and high-explosive shell. Strictly limited advances using these methods, at the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge (20 September), Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September) and Battle of Broodseinde (4 October), had produced a [...] advance in two weeks, inflicted many German casualties. The German high command had made several changes against the refined British attacking methods, all of which had failed.|$|E

500|$|Upon encountering a Chi site, the {{activity}} of the RecBCD enzyme changes drastically. DNA unwinding <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> a few seconds and then resumes at roughly half the initial speed. [...] This is likely because the slower RecB helicase unwinds the DNA after Chi, rather than the faster RecD helicase, which unwinds the DNA before Chi. [...] Recognition of the Chi site also changes the RecBCD enzyme so that it cuts the DNA strand with Chi and begins loading multiple RecA proteins onto the single-stranded DNA with the newly generated 3' end. [...] The resulting RecA-coated nucleoprotein filament then searches out similar sequences of DNA on a homologous chromosome. The search process induces stretching of the DNA duplex, which enhances homology recognition (a mechanism termed conformational proofreading [...] ). [...] Upon finding such a sequence, the single-stranded nucleoprotein filament moves into the homologous recipient DNA duplex in a process called strand invasion. [...] The invading 3' overhang causes one of the strands of the recipient DNA duplex to be displaced, to form a D-loop. [...] If the D-loop is cut, another swapping of strands forms a cross-shaped structure called a Holliday junction. [...] Resolution of the Holliday junction by some combination of RuvABC or RecG can produce two recombinant DNA molecules with reciprocal genetic types, if the two interacting DNA molecules differ genetically. [...] Alternatively, the invading 3’ end near Chi can prime DNA synthesis and form a replication fork. [...] This type of resolution produces only one type of recombinant (non-reciprocal).|$|E
500|$|Both sides played defensively {{which led}} many {{commentators}} to bemoan the poor {{quality of the}} match. There were frequent <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> injuries and accusations of diving. However, some analysts commented on the genuine desire to win both teams displayed. Numerous goal opportunities were missed, most notably by Tyrone, although only a block from Conor Gormley prevented Steven McDonnell from equalising for Armagh in the 68th minute. Tyrone led 008 [...] 004 at half-time; five of their points were scored by Peter Canavan from frees. He was replaced during the interval due to a relapse of his ankle injury during training, although he did return to the pitch for the final few minutes. Diarmuid Marsden was controversially sent off {{in the second half}} following an off-the-ball incident, leaving Armagh with only fourteen players. Marsden had been arguing with Conor Gormley when he was approached by Philip Jordan. Marsden raised his arm and made contact with Jordan, who fell to the ground. Some commentators claimed Jordan was feigning injury to get his opponent sent off. [...] Armagh managed to stay within two points of Tyrone at times but were ultimately unable to catch Tyrone. At the final whistle, Tyrone fans invaded the pitch and remained there for an hour. In his speech after lifting the trophy, Peter Canavan dedicated the victory to every Tyrone team he had played on, the 1986 team (beaten in the final by Kerry) and every player who had played on teams without success. He also spoke of his father, who had died over the summer, and of Paul McGirr, who had played alongside many of the Tyrone team before he died in a freak accident aged 18.|$|E
