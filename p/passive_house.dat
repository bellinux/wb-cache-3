25|$|The {{zero-energy}} building {{concept has}} been a progressive evolution from other low-energy building designs. Among these, the Canadian R-2000 and the German <b>passive</b> <b>house</b> standards have been internationally influential.

40|$|According to the definition, <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> in Europe meet {{a target}} energy demand for heating {{of less than}} 15 kWh per square meter and per year. This low level for the heating demand is based on heating by a small post-heater in the {{hygienic}} ventilation system at 52 0 C maximum, while the ventilation system can be dimensioned purely for ventilation purposes. In theory thus the installed heating power is less than approximately 10 Watts/m 2. But what happens in practice? The practical realization can {{be different from the}} definition and user experiences with indoor climate systems for <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> may require further adaptations. Belgian example projects and the indoor climate systems in winter and in summer were studied. The study includes inspection of technical details and interviews with occupants of some <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> in Belgium. The results illustrate the concerns of occupants considering winter and summer comfort in especially bedrooms, low air humidity creating respiratory problems and complex control of installations including temperature control. The research shows that occupants tend to prefer new adapted types of post-heating. Also, a good realization of (passive) cooling techniques is a very important issue in <b>passive</b> <b>houses.</b> The paper gives recommendations on how to improve the user friendliness of indoor climate systems for <b>passive</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Synopsis The paper {{analyzes}} {{the introduction of}} <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> in the Norwegian <b>house</b> market. <b>Passive</b> <b>houses</b> are houses with extremely low levels of energy consumption for heating, and {{have not yet been}} built in Norway, but have started to enter the market in Germany and some other countries. The construction sector is analyzed as a sectoral innovation system. The different elements of the innovation system are studied. This includes government agencies, producers, consumers, finance and education. The analysis shows that <b>passive</b> and low-energy <b>houses</b> {{are on the verge of}} market breakthrough. This can partly be explained by economic calculations, and partly by processes of learning and change in the institutional set-up of the sector. The construction sector is a sector characterized by low innovative intensity and little interaction between different agents. Those working to promote <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> have to some extent managed to cope with these challenges. This has happened by breaking away from the traditional focus of Norwegian energy efficiency policies on technology and the economically rational agents, by instead focusing on knowledge and institutional change at the level of the producers...|$|R

2500|$|In 2007 the City of Ulm {{was awarded}} the European Energy Award for its {{remarkable}} local energy management and its efforts to combat climate change. Examples of these efforts are a biomass power plant operated by the Fernwärme Ulm GmbH (10 MW electrical output), and the world's biggest <b>passive</b> <b>house</b> office building, the so-called Energon, located in the [...] "Science City" [...] near the university campus. Moreover, the city of Ulm boasts the second largest solar power production in Germany. For all new buildings, a strict energy standard (German KFW40 standard) has been mandatory since April 2008. Ulm Minster has been fully powered by renewables since January 2008. Until the end of 2011 as a European pilot project a self-sustaining data-centre will be constructed in the west-city of Ulm. There is a solar-powered ferry that crosses the Danube 7 days a week in summer. The [...] "Bündnis 100% Erneuerbare Energien" [...] was founded in February 2010 {{with the aim of}} bringing together the people and organisations seeking to promote the transition to 100% renewable energy in Ulm and Neu-Ulm by 2030.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and <b>passive</b> <b>house</b> have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation. Passive cooling, and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.|$|E

40|$|Subject of {{this thesis}} - Economic {{advantages}} and disadvantages of <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> in the Czech Republic and the EU - is very topical with regards to building boom and the environment and related issues of energy-saving housing. Comparison of economic {{advantages and disadvantages}} between <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> and low-energy buildings is also interesting considering connection modern, comfortable and environmentallyeffective housing. Reducing the energy performance of buildings is currently a fundamental trend and an opportunity for the future, either for individuals as well as for society. It is the result of international legislation dealing with the energy performance of buildings, which is addressed by Directive 2002 / 91 / EC of the European Parliament and Council of the energy performance buildings. The main target of the practical part of the bachelor thesis was to evaluate the return on investment in passive and low energy houses. The starting point of the calculation is the specific energy consumption for each type of house that is defined by the standard. The main benefit of this work is a finding based on the annual operating costs, which combined with the amount of the initial investment was calculated by the return on investment. This is 19 years for <b>passive</b> <b>houses,</b> which is lower than for low energy houses (28 years). This difference is influenced by the two main factors, namely the "Green Savings" subsidy for <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> and the energy efficiency of <b>passive</b> <b>houses.</b> The calculation has taken into account the current and constant energy prices. It can be assumed that energy prices will rise in the future, making the investment return differential between <b>passive</b> and low-energy <b>houses</b> even more pronounced. The results of the return on investment are also consistent with those reported by different suppliers and developers...|$|R

40|$|Experience and {{evaluation}} of ten-year-old passive houses– indoor environment, durability and user convenienceAlthough many <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> and low-energy houses were evaluated {{while they were still}} newly built, there has not been much evaluation of them after several years’ of occupation.

The objective of this project has been to provide the building sector with feedback of experience from the first <b>passive</b> <b>houses</b> in Sweden, which were first occupied in 2001. User experiences have been collected through interviews, and indoor environmental conditions and the performance of technical systems have been monitored and measured.
