Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls.

50|$|The fifth {{dimension}} {{is difficult to}} directly observe, though the Large Hadron Collider provides an opportunity to record indirect evidence of its existence. Physicists theorize that collisions of subatomic particles in turn produce new particles {{as a result of}} the collision, including a graviton that escapes from the fourth dimension, or brane, leaking off into a five-dimensional bulk. M-theory would explain the weakness of gravity relative to the other fundamental forces of nature, as can be seen, for example, when using a magnet to lift a <b>pin</b> <b>off</b> a table — the magnet is able to overcome the gravitational pull of the entire earth with ease.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, [...]22 Long Rifle {{competitions}} {{shoot the}} tops of the pins, known as [...] "pin-tops," [...] which are lighter and more easily knocked down by the light, comparatively low energy bullets. Occasionally, a [...]22 match may be shot by placing pins at the very back of the table so that the comparatively light [...]22 hit will still knock the <b>pin</b> <b>off</b> the table. Some matches are also shot with a semiautomatic or pump shotgun, firing buckshot. As shotgun rounds quickly disintegrate the pins, such matches are customarily reserved for the end of a match, when a supply of pins unfit for handgun matches may be put to final utility. [...] Some types of matches allow carbines or submachine guns.|$|E
5000|$|Flypaper (also {{known as}} fly paper, fly sticker, fly strip, fly ribbon, or fly tape) attracts flies to {{adhesive}} {{so that they}} can be trapped. The exposed adhesive strip makes it more stick-prone than an enclosed glue board. To avoid accidental entanglement with humans, the strips are often hung in relatively inaccessible spaces, such as near ceilings. One type of fly strip is packaged in a small cardboard tube with a pin on the top. It is used by pulling the <b>pin</b> <b>off</b> the top (usually covered with wax), removing the adhesive [...] "fly strip" [...] and using the pin to attach it to a ceiling, with the tube dangling below as a small weight. Flypaper is not reused, but is replaced when it loses effectiveness.|$|E

50|$|The mini-DIN pins, being weak, {{sometimes}} bend. This {{can result}} {{in the loss of}} colour or other corruption (or loss) in the signal. A bent pin can be forced back into shape, but this carries the risk of the <b>pin</b> breaking <b>off.</b>|$|R
25|$|On January 21, 1968, Mason's team {{is sent to}} Vietnam. After {{defending}} Khe Sanh, they recover a dossier on Dragovich from a Russian defector in Hue City {{during the}} Tet Offensive. The defector {{turns out to be}} none other than Reznov, who joins them as they penetrate Laos to recover a Nova-6 shipment from a downed Soviet plane. They are captured by Viet Cong and Spetznaz infiltrators at the crash site. Bowman is executed, but Woods and Mason hijack an Mi-24 Hind in the confusion and escape, moving on to rescue Reznov from Kravchenko's base. They confront Kravchenko and Woods stabs him, but Kravchenko pulls the <b>pins</b> <b>off</b> of four grenades strapped to himself, forcing Woods to sacrifice himself by pushing both himself and Kravchenko out of a window. In a huge explosion, Mason presumes the two dead.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} the case that {{electric}} hum at a venue is picked up via a ground loop. In this situation, an amplifier and a mixing desk are typically at some distance from one another. The chassis of each item is grounded via the mains earth pin, and is also connected along a different pathway via the conductor of a shielded cable. As these two pathways do not run alongside each other, an electrical circuit {{in the shape of a}} loop is formed. The same situation occurs between musical instrument amplifiers on stage and the mixing desk. To fix this, stage equipment often has a [...] "ground lift" [...] switch which breaks the loop. Another solution is to connect the source and destination through a 1:1 isolation transformer, called variously audio humbucker or iso coil. Another extremely dangerous option is to break contact with the ground wire by using an AC ground lift adapter or by breaking the earth <b>pin</b> <b>off</b> the power plug used at the mixing deck. Depending on the design and layout of the audio equipment, lethal voltages between the (now isolated) ground at the mixing desk and earth ground can then develop. Any contact between the AC line live terminals and the equipment chassis will energize all the cable shields and interconnected equipment.|$|E

Despite this success, things became difficult that summer when love-letters to Kathy that she had accidentally left at the sorority house were found by the cleaning staff and {{turned over to the}} alumnae council of the sorority. When she returned from summer vacation the council (while speaking in coded language and carefully avoiding the word [...] "lesbian") confronted Kuehl with the letters demanding an explanation. Kuehl later recalled that at first she tried to deny it and failing that [...] "I then just clammed up and took my sorority <b>pin</b> <b>off</b> {{and put it on the}} table and left. I cried all the way home." [...] She was officially expelled from the sorority and despite assurance that no one would be told why she was aware that rumours were spreading. Some of the members of the sorority refused to speak to her afterwards and avoided her. Kuehl moved back in with her parents under the cover story that she was homesick but was still a member of the sorority which they knew she loved being a part of. Whenever her parents knew of a sorority meeting taking place, to prevent discovery, Kuehl would go to a coffee shop during that time and return with a story about the events of the meeting that she had not attended.|$|E
40|$|Inspired by the Japanese game Pachinko, {{we study}} simple (perfectly "inelastic" collisions) {{dynamics}} {{of a unit}} ball falling amidst point obstacles (pins) in the plane. A classic example is that a checkerboard grid of pins produces the binomial distribution, but what probability distributions result from different pin placements? In the 50 - 50 model, where the pins form a subset of this grid, not all probability distributions are possible, but surprisingly the uniform distribution is possible for { 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 } possible drop locations. Furthermore, every probability distribution can be approximated arbitrarily closely, and every dyadic probability distribution can be divided by a suitable power of 2 and then constructed exactly (along with extra "junk" outputs). In a more general model, if a ball hits a <b>pin</b> <b>off</b> center, it falls left or right accordingly. Then we prove a universality result: any distribution of n dyadic probabilities, each specified by k bits, can be constructed using O(n k^ 2) pins, which {{is close to the}} information-theoretic lower bound of Ω(n k) ...|$|E

However, if a ball hits the cush, or wall or passes through the diamond and bounces back out of the pit before felling pins the frame must be reset.|$|R

5000|$|This {{process was}} made more {{difficult}} {{by the fact}} that the MOS Technology 6507 used in the 2600 was a pin-reduced version of the 6502 which had no support for hardware interrupts. Generally the analog side of the display system would generate an interrupt when it finished drawing a line and was getting ready for the next one (as in the Atari home computers, for instance). The interrupt would trigger the code needed to update the screen, and then return to the [...] "main" [...] program. The 6507 left these <b>pins</b> <b>off</b> of the CPU to save money. This meant that the programmer had to carefully time their programs to run in the exact number of cycles needed for the various screen-related events to take place. Getting it wrong meant the screen would not draw properly, so in addition to the complexity of drawing the display, the programmer also had to carefully count the number of cycles that their program took to run, moving code around as necessary to ensure it fit cleanly within the limited CPU budget. The program needed to do this was known as the [...] "kernel", and was fantastically complex compared to other systems.|$|R
